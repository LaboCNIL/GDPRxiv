Justification

 

The basis of administrative proceedings for suspicion of committing offenses under § 45 para. E),
g) and h) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., on the protection of personal data and on the amendment of certain acts against
accused, companies

  based

("the accused"), the material collected as part of the inspection was carried out
at the accused by the inspector of the Office for Personal Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the “Office”) PhDr. Peter
The tailor, who was terminated by the protocol on the control of Ref. UOOU-04102 / 17-16 of 12 October
2017, including materials relating to the settlement of objections terminated by the memorandum
President of the Office Ref. UOOU-04102 / 17-20 of 23 November 2017.
 
On the basis of the evidence presented, the Office came to the conclusion that the accused had committed the first of all
offense according to § 45 par. 1 let. e) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., as it processed personal
data without the consent of the data subjects. As a personal data controller, it has done so by:
at least from April 2017 until the commencement of the proceedings in question (the notice of commencement of the proceedings was
accused delivered on March 26, 2018) processed for the purpose of offering personal services
data of its potential customers, an unspecified number in the range of name, surname
and phone number. The personal data provided were obtained from actual customers who
in a document called
put contacts on potential
customers accused. The accused thereby violated the obligation stipulated in § 5 paragraph 2 of the Act
No. 101/2000 Coll., ie the obligation to process personal data with the consent of data subjects and without
of this consent only on the basis of § 5 para. a) to g) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

At the same time, the accused, as he also found the administrative body of the first instance, committed a misdemeanor
§ 45 par. 1 let. h) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., as it did not adopt or implement measures for
ensuring the security of the processing of personal data, which as the controller of personal data
committed that, at least from 28 June 2017, ie from the date of the oral hearing and the local inquiry
held against the accused in the above-mentioned inspection, until the commencement of the proceedings in question
kept documents containing personal data of its customers in lockable cabinets
in the office, thereby violating the obligation stipulated in § 13 paragraph 1 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., ie
the obligation to take such measures as to prevent any unauthorized or accidental occurrence
access to, change, destruction or loss of personal data, unauthorized transfers,
to their other unauthorized processing, as well as to other misuse of personal data. The same
the accused, as found by the administrative body of the first instance, committed a misdemeanor under § 45
paragraph 1 (a) h) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. also by at least from June 7, 2017 to launch
the procedure in question did not ensure that the information system
  where it occurs
for automated processing of customers' personal data, were acquired electronically
records of the reason for the accession of a particular user, thereby violating the obligation laid down
in § 13 par. 4 let. c) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., ie the obligation of the administrator in the area
automated processing of personal data to make electronic records that will allow
determine and verify when, by whom and for what reason personal data were recorded or otherwise
processed.
 
She was accused of committing these offenses by a decision of the Office no. UOOU-01895 / 18-16 ze
On 30 May 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the “Decision”), a fine of CZK 30,000 was imposed.
 
On the other hand, the administrative body of the first instance concluded that within the scope of the present
proceedings, the accused could not prove a breach of obligations under § 12 para. 1 of the Act
No. 101/2000 Coll. and thus committing an offense under § 45 para. g) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.
Therefore, the decision to this extent was terminated.
 
The defendant objected to the decision with a timely appeal. In it, he proposes a decision
in the parts by which the guilt for offenses according to § 45 par. 1 let. e) and h) of the Act
No. 101/2000 Coll. and impose a fine in that regard, since, in the opinion of the accused,
to the violation in question No. 101/2000 Coll. did not happen.
 
Regarding the violation of § 5 paragraph 2 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. the accused stated that the clients were at
Filling in the relevant forms instructed to provide only the contact details of the persons who
they agreed. The accused was therefore in a legitimate expectation that there was a condition of consent
fulfilled. The data thus obtained was used only
once, and therefore the degree of social
The dangers of acting are negligible. The accused then did not create any databases or distribute them
mass communications, etc. Thus, even if, in the opinion of the accused, the law was formally violated,
the material feature of the offense, which means the social harmfulness of the conduct, would not be fulfilled.
The administrative body of the first degree, however, finding and evaluating the character and degree of social
harmfulness for the offense.
 
Regarding the violation of § 13 paragraph 1 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. The accused stated that during the settlement

contain personal data. The law does not stipulate any specific method of security, it depends
on the administrator. As no security incident has occurred, it is not possible
declare the security method in question insufficient.
 
Regarding the violation of § 13 par. c) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. The accused stated that the functionality
internal system was demonstrated during the inspection and subsequently requested
even the printscreens which the accused considered sufficient and is willing to present the printscreen,
which demonstrate other functionalities of the system at the date of inspection. In this sense, subsequently
further communication took place between the accused and the administrative authority of the first instance, however
to the invitation to send the relevant electronic records sent under ref. UOOU-01895 / 18-20
of 26 June 2018, the accused did not respond.
 
The appellate body reviewed the decision in its entirety, including the previous process
its issue and in this context dealt mainly with the arguments of the accused.
 
As regards the defendant 's arguments concerning the failure to assess the social harmfulness of the conduct, then
refers to the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court ref. 1 Afs 14/2011 - 62 of 30 March
2011, according to which: “Despite the fact that administrative bodies are obliged to a specific social

that there are such exceptional facts, failure to take them into account would obviously lead to a result
contrary to the purpose and function of administrative punishment (that is, at a time when
hazard does not even reach the minimum type hazard limit), it must be intensified

found the appellate body, the material aspect of the offense was social harm

The titles, which moreover is required to prove the accused then cannot be healed through
legitimate expectations. Nor is it a reason to conclude that there is no material
the fact that the personal data in question were subsequently used only
once. However, that fact was duly taken into account in the imposition of the fine
at the very lower limit, which, as should be noted in particular, could have reached a higher level
up to 5,000,000 CZK.
 
Regarding the violation of § 13 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. and committing an offense pursuant to Section 45 (1)
letter h) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., it must be submitted that the conduct in question was correct
qualified as less serious, ie as absorbed by committing an offense according to § 45
paragraph 1 (a) e) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.
 
In connection with its own indicated violation of Section 13, Paragraph 1 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. then it is
primarily obvious that no set of specific measures last mentioned
provision is not really prescribed. However, free storage of file materials without
special security in the office room should be seen as an obvious shortcoming.
Access to the premises in question by third parties is clearly not a priori in practice

in this way reduces the risk of unauthorized access, resp. represents another significant
barrier to prevent unauthorized access, moreover, clearly more effective than the accused
recalled absence of content label. The purpose of the measures in question is to prevent them
incidents in question and it is therefore irrelevant that such an event has not yet taken place.
 
The defendant's arguments concerning the violation of § 13 par. c) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.,
resp. printscreens
  documented during the inspection
in the case of the accused, it is necessary to state above all that already in the protocol on control ref. UOOU-04102 / 17-16 ze
on 12 october 2017, the accused was warned that the electronic records obtained did not allow
determine and verify the reason why personal data were recorded or otherwise processed and were

At the request of the administrative authority of the first instance, these shall be:

electronic records were sent, then the accused, as mentioned above, did not respond.
 
Furthermore, the Appellate Body also assessed the whole case in the light of the new legislation contained in the Regulation
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and o

The appellate body therefore rejected the defendant's arguments. At the same time after a general review
