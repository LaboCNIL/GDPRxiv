Appeal against this decision by the President of the Office by his decision ref. VER-2821 / 09-21
of 22 September 2009. The party filed an action against the decision of the President of the Office
to the Municipal Court in Prague, which in her judgment no.
of 30 May 2013
rejected. However, following a subsequent appeal by a party, that judgment was set aside
by the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court ref.
of 20 February 2014, namely
including both decisions of the Office, the case being returned to the Office for further proceedings.
 
In the grounds of the judgment the Supreme Administrative Court stated that the administrative body, ie
The Office did not state reasons in the statement of reasons for the contested decisions in the part relating to publication
data on
  or
subject to appropriate proof in the proceedings whether the party acted as
personal data controller. The administrative proceedings did not rebut the party 's assertion that
due to his position as the employer of the said persons, he only had the data
on their permanent residence (with regard to the data on permanent residence, the party to the proceedings was their administrator,
which he did not question), not the above data.
 
In the opinion of the Supreme Administrative Court, the administrative body violated the law by giving reasons
both decisions did not address the nature of the data on

  possibly did not do so
proof. He stated that, without any further examination, it was an administrative body
presumed that these data are the subject of registration of the party to the proceedings as the employer
and as such are subject to the legislation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. He sees another mistake
The Supreme Administrative Court stated that the administrative body did not deal with the arguments of the participant
the source of this data, ie whether the party obtained the data from the employee register, or
whether it was, for example, only information arising from the general awareness of the team at
workplace. If, as the Supreme Administrative Court stated, the party to the proceedings in question is personal
he obtained the data not from the title of personal data management, but, for example, from the title of shared knowledge
within the team at the workplace, it was possible to apply the institute of protection to such a case
personalities in civil court proceedings and not punishment for an administrative offense under the law
No. 101/2000 Coll.
 
The Supreme Administrative Court identified as superfluous parts of the reasoning of the decision of the administrative body,
which concerned the assessment of the fulfillment of the conditions for the application of § 5 para. e) of the Act
No. 101/2000 Coll., ie a provision enabling the processing of personal data without consent
the persons concerned, as it was not clear from the administrative authority whether
in this case it was a processing according to Act No. 101/2000 Coll.
 
The Supreme Administrative Court regarding the sanction of a party to the proceedings for an administrative offense in the part concerning
disclosure of data on
stated that the decision
administrative body, in both stages, suffers from a lack of reasons, respectively. management suffers from absence
appropriate evidence. He stated that the administrative body should have been more thorough
in justification whether the indication of

personal data, or subject to appropriate proof as to whether the party to the proceedings
due to the management of personnel and payroll of employees, he actually had the data
O
(from October 14
2008) and follow - up
(as of April 15, 2009). He further stated that the administrative body
did not sufficiently assess the facts of the case, in particular whether they constituted a case

mitigating or aggravating circumstance. He identified as a matter of fact the fact that
data on
was included in the press release in response to
allegations presented in Nova television 's broadcast regarding the inappropriate conduct of her
employee (for this he referred to the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court No. 2 As 21 / 2011-166
of 25 March 2011) to shed light on that

  He then stated that at least
the grounds on which the party considered necessary were to be settled
state why
  He also noted
that the administration should pay more attention to the fact that

 
. In the opinion of the Supreme Administrative Court, the administrative body did not define the seriousness of the administrative
tort in the light of the fact that the party to the proceedings violated the law (primarily or only) in relation to
publication of additional information that

He stated that he also lacked an assessment of the facts of the case regarding the participant's sanction

However, the following decision of the Office ref. VER-2821 / 09-34 of 21 May 2014 thereafter
confirmed by the decision of the President of the Office ref. VER-2821 / 09-44 of 12 August 2014 again
the proceedings of the party to the proceedings qualified as an administrative offense pursuant to § 45 para. e) of the Act
No. 101/2000 Coll. and for these reasons a fine of CZK 10,000 was imposed on him.
 
Based on the administrative action of the party to the proceedings, the Municipal Court in Prague in the judgment no.

 of 28 February 2018 Decision of the President of the Office Ref. VER-2821 / 09-44 of
On 12 August 2014, it annulled and remitted the case to the Office for further proceedings. In the reasoning the Municipal Court in Prague
in particular, he stated that the Office had not followed the instructions of the Supreme Administrative Court
in the judgment no.
  of 20 February 2014, in particular, did not make the necessary
evidence and, in addition, re-substantiated its decision with arguments made by the Supreme Administrative Court
refused as unjustified.
 
To that end, the appellate body, having thoroughly acquainted itself with the file, considers that
It is necessary to recall, above all, that the administrative body of the first instance in the decision no. VER-
2821 / 09-34 of 21 May 2014 as part of the justification, except for the recapitulation of the previous one
procedure, dealt with the interpretation of the concepts of personal data and processing, concluding
that the processing of personal data on the Internet should also be considered as the processing of personal data
provided that, in the present case, the party to the proceedings is an administrator within the meaning of
§ 4 letter j) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. It is further stated here that no evidence has been taken
requested by the Supreme Administrative Court, as the party's statement was unequivocally
according to which personal data on

they were not part of the personnel files kept by the party to the proceedings and were therefore
gained from general awareness in the workplace. Subsequently, with reference to the judgment of the Court
Court of Justice in Case C-101/01 (Lindqvist v. Sweden) and to note that the judgment of the Supreme Court
Administrative Court ref. As 21 / 2011-166 of 25 March 2011 is relevant only in the determination
sanctions, inferred that the controller lacks a legal title for the relevant disclosure of personal data.
In the end, the amount of the sanction is justified quite extensively. With this argument made
subsequently, in principle, identified the decision no. VER-2821 / 09-44 of 12 August 2012.

The Appellate Body therefore found that the Office had deepened its reasoning regarding the interpretation of the law
regulations, justifying why the party to the proceedings is in the position of personal data controller and further
more thoroughly justified the amount of the sanction. These conclusions can generally be accepted, however
at the same time, it is necessary to state the resignation from the basic requirement expressed by the Supreme Administrative
court, ie to determine the source of the relevant personal data. In this context, it was only
presumed that they were obtained on the basis of general awareness in the workplace, resp. it was not
the party 's assertion that the information on

. Here, however, it is necessary to recall the opinion expressed by the Supreme Administrative
court, according to which in this case the sanction for an administrative offense under the law would be excluded
No. 101/2000 Coll., however, the matter could be resolved within the institute of personality protection according to
of the Civil Code. With this view of the Supreme Administrative Court, it would be possible
to argue in fact, but the Office is, on the basis of § 78 para. 5 of the Code of Administrative Procedure,
bound. Moreover, in the absence of such evidence, the application of the law is not excluded
title according to § 5 par. 2 let. e) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. If it is the source of information itself
data subject, the provision after the semicolon § 5 para. e) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.
requiring the protection of the personal and private life of the data subject to be interpreted more in favor of protection
the legitimate interests of the administrator. This also distinguishes the case from the judgment of the Court of Justice
EU in Case C-101/01 (Lindqvist v. Sweden), where proactive disclosure took place
data from a relatively closed community environment, which was found to be unsafe. Similarly,
Although a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. had to be pronounced if it were proved that
personal data comes from records with limited access (employee records of the participant
proceedings, medical documentation, etc.), however, this situation did not occur. It is not the same
it is excluded that the processing of personal data published by the data subject in accordance with
with § 9 letter g) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., resp. on the processing of personal data legitimately
published according to § 5 par. 2 let. d) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. Absence of proof in this
direction thus represents an insufficiently ascertained factual state of affairs on the basis of which it is impossible to do so
no conclusions, in particular, the act in question cannot be classified as an administrative offense.
       
For those reasons, the appellate body ruled, as stated in the operative part of this decision.
At the same time, the appellate body found that the original appeal had been upheld in this way and could not
no damage may be caused to any of the parties to the proceedings. Alternatively, the matter could be returned
the administrative authority of the first instance in order to try to remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings,
however, with a gap of about nine years, the effectiveness of taking the required evidence
a priori it seems very negligible.
               
 
Lessons learned:

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 91 (1) of the Act, this decision shall be challenged
No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code, cannot be revoked.
