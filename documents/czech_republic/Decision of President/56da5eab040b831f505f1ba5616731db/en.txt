1/3

The defendants first lodged an objection against the decision by letter of 5 October 2018 within the prescribed period
blanket decomposition, which was subsequently supplemented by a submission dated 22 October 2018.
 
In it, the accused first stated how he sent the commercial message and then how
cooperates with the company
and other companies. Says that
has a contract with each partner.
 
In the second part of her statement, the accused already commented on the failure to cooperate
and further objected to seeking repeated prolongation of administrative requirements
management. Specifically, she stated that the mere fact that the accused no longer registered everything
communication with the contractor, she can not be burdened and that she considers the controller
cooperation provided. In conclusion, the accused described the amount of the fine imposed as disproportionate
and inadequate.
 
The appellate body reviewed the decision in its entirety, including the previous process
its release.
 
Regarding the arguments of the accused, he states above all that the first part has none
connection with this proceeding, as this is due to non-cooperation. However
may have some relevance to the company's own control
 
under sp. No. UOOU-04263/17.
 
Furthermore, the appellate body, after getting acquainted with the file in question (file no.
07350/18), found that the accused did not provide the required cooperation when the first call
responded by considering all relationships and cooperation with the company

 for trade secrets and asked for information on what legislation it should
accused of proceeding to provide such sensitive data, she claims.
By the following memorandum, the defendant was reiterated all provisions, on the basis of
which it is obliged to provide cooperation, as well as was reiterated that it was
cooperation is necessary in the ongoing control procedure. Given that the accused
did not respond to the above, a request was sent to it, which was the provision in question
cooperation is urged. However, the accused also did not react to this. Administrative body of the first
therefore issued the above-mentioned order ref. UOOU-07350 / 18-6 of 19 July 2018, in
which sanctioned the accused for failing to cooperate. The accused filed against him
opposition, in which she also stated that she would comment in writing in the Office for Personal Data Protection
within a specified period. Subsequently, however, the accused only stated that she was cooperating
with the agency

The director of the accused also stated that he liked it
document all required documents that can serve as cooperation within the given
checks and requested the sending of requests by the Office for Personal Data Protection so that
the accused could cooperate. The administrative body of the first instance is therefore within the framework of the call
to familiarize himself with the grounds of the decision again stated what in the cooperation of the accused
he demanded. However, the accused responded to this note in such a way that the administrative requirements
authority of the first instance as illegal and again asked for clarification on the basis of which
statutory provisions are floated.
 

 

2/3

On this basis, the Appellate Body found that the requirements of the administrative body of first instance
against the accused were completely legal, the reasons why the co-operation was after the liable person
required, the accused were duly communicated several times. Accused of cooperation, however, as it was
required, did not provide. Nor does her claim that she no longer records everything
communication with the contractor, as the requirement of the administrative body of the first instance is
it also applies to the documents it is required to keep.
 
The appellate body therefore rejected the defendant's arguments. At the same time after a general review
found no reason to be unlawful. In particular, it considers
a reasonable fine, which was imposed in the lower half of the possible rate and did not find any
error of procedure of the administrative body of the first instance.
 
Likewise, the Appellate Body considers it necessary to note that the provision requested
cooperation does not run counter to the prohibition of self-blame, which must be seen as part of it
the right to a fair trial under Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In that
In this context, it should be pointed out, first, that the cooperation in question was requested
in the context of a check that was not conducted against the accused and that this prohibition cannot be confused
with the obligation to submit existing documents and to provide factual statements, as
the addressee of this obligation is not prevented from defending the proceedings and the documents in question or their significance
question (see judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court No. 6 As 159/2014 of 11 August
2015, ref. 2 As 254/2016 of 15 December 2016 and ref. 4 As 92/2018 of 25 May 2018).
 
On the basis of all the above, the Appellate Body therefore ruled as indicated
in the operative part of this decision.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 91 (1) of the Act, this decision shall be challenged
No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code, cannot be revoked.
