Justification

 

By order no. UOOU-06702 / 17-4 of 4 July 2017 sent to the company

  based

  (hereinafter referred to as the “accused”), infringement proceedings were initiated pursuant to Section 15 (1)
letter a) of Act No. 255/2012 Coll., on control (control rules), in connection with non-provision
cooperation within the control conducted by the Office for Personal Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the "Office")
at the accused. The accused filed a timely opposition against the order and the first-instance administrative body
continued the proceedings. By communication of 18 August 2017, the accused was informed that
that all the documents for issuing the decision have been collected and has been informed of their rights
according to Act No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code.
 
By decision of the Office ref. UOOU-06702 / 17-17 of October 11, 2017 was found to be accused
guilty of committing an offense under § 15 para. (a) of the Rules of Procedure, since
the ongoing inspections did not provide the inspector with the necessary cooperation by failing to send
required answers to the questions set out in the letter of 12 June 2017, thereby infringing
the obligation to create conditions for the performance of control, to enable the controller to perform his
authorizations stipulated by law and to provide the necessary co-operation in accordance with
provisions of § 10 paragraph 2 of Act No. 255/2012 Coll. The accused was charged for the conduct

Accused against the decision no. UOOU-06702 / 17-17 lodged an ordinary appeal, which the President
Rejected by the Office by decision no. UOOU-06702 / 17-37 of 2 February 2018.
 
Given that the written copy of the first instance decision ref. UOOU-06702 / 17-17
contained in the statement the incorrect number of the account on which the imposed fine is due, the administrative body
first instance issued a corrective decision on 14 March 2018 pursuant to Section 70 of the Administrative Procedure Code
Ref. UOOU-06702 / 17-39. The decision in question was delivered to the accused on 26 March 2018.
 
Against the corrective decision ref. UOOU-06702 / 17-39 accused filed on April 10, 2018
decomposition. She did not substantiate it in any way and only stated that she would justify it by 23 April 2018.
Subsequently, on 11 April 2018, the administrative body summoned the accused in accordance with Section 37 (3)
of the Administrative Procedure Code to eliminate defects in filing and set a deadline of 23 April 2018. Accused
it did not react in any way and did not complete the decomposition. The appellate body is thus obliged to review the decision
only in terms of legality. It assesses the correctness of the decision only if it requires it
public interest.
 
The appellate body examined the contested decision in its entirety, including the process which
preceded its publication, and reached the following conclusions.
 
First, the appellate body dealt with the legality of the procedural procedure. In view of the fact that
the ground of appeal is an obligatory requirement of an appeal pursuant to Section 87 (2) and Section 152 (5) of the Administrative Procedure Code
of the Rules of Procedure, the administrative body of the first instance was obliged to call on the accused to supplement the appeal, which
duly done. At the same time, the administrative body of the first instance set a time limit of
23 April 2018. In the light of the present case and in the light of the fact that it was established
the same period, which the accused himself stated in the dissolution as the period within which he
can be considered as a completely sufficient and reasonable time to rectify the defects of the submission.
 
Next, the appellate body dealt with the contested decision itself. Wrong account number in
the statement of reasons for the written decision constitutes a manifest error which is necessary
rectified in accordance with Section 70 of the Administrative Procedure Code, with the issuance of this decision being the first
repair action. The administrative body of the first instance thus proceeded in full compliance with
Administrative Code.
 
The appellate body summarizes that neither the contested decision nor the procedure prior to its issuance
did not find it illegal or incorrect and, in view of the above, ruled as it is
stated in the operative part of this decision.
 
Lessons learned:

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 91 (1) of the Act, this decision shall be challenged
No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code, cannot be revoked.
