Company


The inspection was initiated on the basis of an initiative forwarded by the Police of the Czech Republic, based on a submission. On its basis, the Police of the Czech Republic carried out an inspection of the premises of a company that dealt with waste disposal and left the premises due to insolvency, where office waste was located in approximately 9 rooms on the ground. The filing contained a record of the search, including information from the filer who claimed that a photocopy of his ID card was on the premises. The police of the Czech Republic took photo documentation of all the rooms, but without proof that the documents contain personal data.

The inspection found that the company was in liquidation. As part of it, its headquarters was sold to a new owner. It was found that the sale took place before the start of the inspection, that the new owner of the building did not have any documents at his disposal, nor did he find any on site. From the documents of the Police of the Czech Republic, there was no evidence that there were any documents at the site, especially personnel documents, which would contain the personal data of the company's former employees. At the same time, it was discovered that the company ended its activities through liquidation.

The inspection did not prove any suspicion of unauthorized disclosure of personal data of former employees.
