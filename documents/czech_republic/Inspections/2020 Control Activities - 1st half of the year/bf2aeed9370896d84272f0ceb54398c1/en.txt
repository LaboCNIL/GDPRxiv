The subject of the control, carried out on the basis of the control plan for 2019 and information from the notification of a breach of personal data security, was compliance with the obligations set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in connection with the processing of personal data in the framework of DNA testing, with a particular focus on the retention period of the collected genetic samples and their disposal, processing of personal data when dealing with blood samples found at the Municipal Swimming Pool in Pilsen and for the fulfillment of other obligations set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

All procedures for the processing of personal data and data of a special category, processed by the controlled company in connection with the provision of health services in the sense of Act No. 372/2011 Coll., on health services and the conditions of their provision, and others (Act on Medicines, Acts in the field of provision of laboratory care), not only in the sense of checking internal regulations in the field of technical-organizational security, but directly in practice on the spot during the collection and processing of biological samples within the healthcare sector.

Thus, no breach of obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was detected.

The inspection also found that the discovery of ampoules with biological material at the waste dump was the result of a crime that the Police of the Czech Republic is investigating and did not occur as a result of the activities of the inspected company, but in connection with the disposal of biological material by a specialized company that accepts the samples for disposal.
