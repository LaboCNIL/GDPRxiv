The inspection was carried out on the basis of the inspection plan for 2019 and the initiative of the General Directorate of Customs. In the initiative, it was stated, among other things, that during the supervision of gambling, customs officials encountered a situation where, as part of registration, players were required to provide and register fingerprints, and when the fingerprint then serves as access data to the user account. Without providing fingerprints, the player is allegedly not registered.

The subject of the inspection was compliance with the obligations in the processing of personal data set by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Act No. 110/2019 Coll., on the processing of personal data, in connection with the processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data â€“ fingerprints of gambling participants when using TIP&CASH terminals.

The audit findings showed that the audited company does not have a license to operate gambling games and does not carry out this activity. It is a so-called "empty" company without any economic or other activities. At the time of the inspection, the audited company did not process any personal data in relation to the subject of the inspection carried out by the Office.
