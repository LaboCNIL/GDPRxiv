Based on 11 initiatives, the Office carried out an inspection regarding compliance with Act No. 480/2004 Coll.



He found that the controlled person violated the obligations set out in ยง 7 paragraph 2 of Act No. 480/2004 Coll., i.e. to use electronic contact details for the purpose of disseminating commercial messages by electronic means only in relation to users who have given prior consent. The inspected person further violated ยง 7 paragraph 4 letter b) of Act No. 480/2004 Coll., because the disseminated commercial messages did not contain the identification of the sender.



The President of the Office partially complied with the objections that the inspected person filed against the inspection findings. Specifically, this was one of the objections, as the controlled person additionally documented previous consents granted by some users.



The office imposed a fine of CZK 8,000 on the inspected person.


The inspection was conducted by inspector Ing. Josef Vacula.
