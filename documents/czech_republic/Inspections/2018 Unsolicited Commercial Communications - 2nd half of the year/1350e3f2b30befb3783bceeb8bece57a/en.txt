On the basis of 29 initiatives, the Office carried out an inspection of a natural person doing business regarding compliance with Act No. 480/2004 Coll. Unsolicited commercial messages were sent for the benefit of the website www.ms-finance.cz.



The audited person stated that he has nothing to do with commercial communications or the operated website www.ms-finance.cz, and that he does not do business in the field of finance. In this case, she filed a criminal report on suspicion of committing a crime.



On the basis of the Office's request, the Police of the Czech Republic provided information on the fact that it has initiated criminal prosecution for the offense of damage to the rights of others pursuant to Section 181(1)(a) a) of Act No. 40/2009 Coll., Criminal Code. The police of the Czech Republic found that the controlled person is not really the owner of the domain ms-finance.cz, nor does he operate the website www.ms-finance.cz, as this page was created by another natural person.



On the basis of the above, the Office considers it proven that the audited person did not actively send the commercial communications in question, and therefore there could not have been a violation of Act No. 480/2004 Coll.


The inspection was conducted by inspector Ing. Josef Vacula.
