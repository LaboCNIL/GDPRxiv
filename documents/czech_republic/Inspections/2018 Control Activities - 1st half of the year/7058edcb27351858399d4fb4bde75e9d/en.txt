On the basis of the Office's control plan, the Office carried out an inspection of compliance with the obligations of the administrator of personal data stipulated by Act No. 101/2000 Coll. when processing personal data in the register of debtors located on the website. The Office focused on the existence of a legal title for the processing of personal data, including their access and publication.

The Authority found that the controlled person publishes on its website information about debtors provided by their creditors without the consent of the data subjects. The controlled person publishes the information about the debtors as it is provided to him, without carrying out a control of the transmitted information.

The Office came to the conclusion that the controlled person is processing personal data in violation of § 5, paragraph 2 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. (legal title for processing). Considering that the inspected person immediately corrected the defective condition, the Office did not impose corrective measures. Following the aforementioned findings, the Office initiated a misdemeanor proceeding in the matter.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector MVDr. František Bartoš.
