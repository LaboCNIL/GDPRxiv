Based on the initiative of the President of the Office, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was the existence of a title for the processing of personal data. The controlled person was supposed to contact the data subjects by phone and offer them to buy the bonds.

The Office focused in particular on the verification of obligations arising from ยง 5 paragraph 1 letter a) (determination of the purpose of processing) and ยง 5 paragraph 2 (legal title for processing) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. The inspection did not reveal that the inspected person collects personal data, with the exception of the registration of personal data as part of the fulfillment of legal obligations (accounting, labor law agenda, registration of owners of own bonds and list of shareholders).

Similarly, it was not proven that the inspected person had the complainant's personal data, both at the time of the inspection and in the past, i.e. processed them. However, according to the statement of the inspected person, it cannot be ruled out that she contacted the complainant by telephone, for example due to an error when entering the telephone number.

In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector Mgr. Daniel Rowan.
