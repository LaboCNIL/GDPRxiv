The office carried out an inspection on the basis of an initiative, the subject of which was the claim that the company requires an identity card and social security number when returning goods.

The office did not find that the inspected person was processing customer birth numbers or collecting ID numbers in violation of the law. The controlled person verifies the customer's identity, and therefore requires the customer to present an ID card, only if the customer returns the goods that he ordered and paid for via the Internet to the store, and at the same time if he requests a refund of the purchase price in cash. Such identity verification is necessary to prevent the purchase price from being returned to a person other than the person who ordered and paid for the goods, and is therefore listed on the invoice and in the corrected tax document.

In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector PhDr. Petr Krejci.
