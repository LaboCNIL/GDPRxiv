Based on the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of the disclosure of personal data of the company's clients to the insurance company's sales representative.

The Office found that the sales representative was a subordinate insurance broker of the company with which the audited person has a sales agency contract, and cooperated with the audited person as a bonded insurance broker based on the sales agency contract. At the time of inspection, this contractual relationship had already been terminated.

The Office also checked the obligations of the controlled person arising from § 5 paragraph 2 (legal title for processing), § 13 paragraph 1 (adoption of security measures) and § 14 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. (processing under the conditions and to the extent set by the controller or processor). In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by Inspector Mgr. Daniel Rowan.
