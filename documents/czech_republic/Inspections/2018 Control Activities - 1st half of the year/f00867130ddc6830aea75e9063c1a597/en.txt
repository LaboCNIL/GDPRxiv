Based on the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of the processing of personal data through the camera system located at the municipal office.

The Office came to the conclusion that in connection with the subject processing there is no violation of the obligations stipulated by Act No. 101/2000 Coll. A complaint was filed against this finding, on the basis of which the matter was investigated. It was established that the decisive legal issue (ownership of the monitored area) is the subject of court proceedings. The office suspended the inspection until the end of the court proceedings.

At the time the inspection was interrupted, the inspected person terminated the operation of the camera system in question because he terminated the lease of the property in which it was installed. The Office concluded the inspection with the fact that no reasons were given for changing the original conclusion, i.e. that in connection with the subject processing of personal data, the inspected person did not violate Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector Mgr. et Mgr. Bozena Čajková.
