On the basis of an initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of a public benefit company focused on the fulfillment of the obligations of the personal data administrator according to § 5 et seq. of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. and in particular the legitimacy of obtaining contact data, which the company processes in its own database and to which it subsequently sends requests for donations.

The office found that the complainant ordered and paid for an advertising item in the controlled person's e-shop in the previous period. In this context, the complainant was informed, through the general terms and conditions of the e-shop, that her data will subsequently be used to contact her with a request for a financial contribution, until the withdrawal of her consent to the processing of personal data.

Furthermore, the Office checked that the controlled person collects and subsequently processes personal data for the purpose of contacting with a request for a financial contribution only in connection with its activity.

In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector MVDr. František Bartoš.
