The office carried out an inspection on the basis of a complaint that the payroll slip had been made available to unauthorized persons.

The manager of the controlled entity made the pay slips of the employees for one month available to all employees of the company via e-mail. The office found that it was a non-standard situation that was the result of previous events at the inspected person (damage apparently caused by one of the executives, leading de facto to the termination of the activity).

The Office checked the procedures for handing over payslips and for further processing of personal data of employees of the inspected person, and found that the procedures are set as standard in such a way that they correspond to the requirements of § 13 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. (security of personal data). The Office thus evaluated the conduct in question as a violation of the obligation of confidentiality stipulated in § 15 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., for which the manager of the controlled entity is responsible. However, taking into account all the circumstances of his actions, the Office did not impose a sanction on him.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector Mgr. et Mgr. Bozena Čajková.
