On the basis of 6 initiatives, the Office carried out an inspection of the processing of personal and sensitive data of employees of the company CHRIST CAR WASH s.r.o. The inspection revealed that an unidentified third party has copies of personnel files (which contain, for example, copies of identity cards, birth certificates, certificates, health insurance cards and a number of other documents), which it sends anonymously to individual employees via e-mail. The Office found that the inspected person collected and kept the mentioned documents without them being necessary to conclude an employment contract and to secure an employment relationship.

Furthermore, it was established that personnel documents were stolen from the IT system of the controlled person, at an unspecified time and in an unspecified way, and this is because the controlled person did not take sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of personal data. The office also found that the inspected person does not have a contract for the processing of personal data with the company that provides payroll accounting for him. Furthermore, it was found that the audited person in connection with managing the personnel agenda of the employees in the electronic database does not make records (logs) about who, when and for what reason accessed the personal data of the employees.

Thus, in connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office found a violation of § 5 paragraph 1 letter d) (collection to the appropriate and necessary extent), § 6 (processing contract), § 13 paragraph 1 (adoption of security measures) and § 13 paragraph 4 letter c) (logging of operations and access records) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The audited person submitted objections against the audit findings, which were rejected by the chairperson of the Office as late. Following the aforementioned findings, the Office will impose remedial measures and initiate proceedings for an offense in the matter.

The inspection was conducted by inspector PaeDr. Jana Rybínová.
