On the basis of three initiatives, the Office carried out a security check of the personal data of customers of a company operating an online store.

The Authority concluded that the inspected person violated the obligation under § 13, paragraph 1 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll., as the administrator did not take such security measures to prevent the theft of the database of its customers' records. The company therefore did not secure the personal data of more than 700,000 customers from unauthorized access, as a result of which, among other things, this personal data was made available on the www.ulozto.cz server.

As part of the inspection, it was found that the inspected person, while securing the personal data of his customers, changed the IT system in the part of editing and storing his customers' passwords, or access to their personal data. Therefore, the Office did not impose remedial measures. Following the aforementioned findings, the Office initiated a misdemeanor proceeding in the matter.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector MVDr. František Bartoš.
