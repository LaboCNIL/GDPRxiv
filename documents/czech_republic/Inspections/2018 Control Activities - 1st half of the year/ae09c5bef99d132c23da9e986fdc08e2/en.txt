On the basis of the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of compliance with the obligations of the personal data administrator in the collection and processing of personal data of the bank's clients processed for the purpose of transferring banking information between the client and the controlled person.

The Authority found that the client of the bank incorrectly entered his e-mail address when concluding the contract, while this e-mail address belonged to another person who was not a client of the inspected person. This person, after receiving several e-mails, alerted the person under review, but the latter incorrectly evaluated the alert as a service complaint. The correction took place only after the revision of this evaluation.

The inspected person alerted his client to the error and immediately deleted the e-mail address of the person who was not his client. The unauthorized sending of e-mail messages to the address of a third party occurred due to the error of the client of the controlled person and not the error of the controlled person. The Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. in connection with the subject processing of personal data.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector MVDr. František Bartoš.
