On the basis of the initiative, which resulted in the suspicion of unauthorized disclosure of the complainant's personal data, the Office carried out an inspection of the technical and organizational measures taken by the hospital to secure personal data.

As part of the inspection, the Office found that the inspected person did not take sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure the protection of personal data, especially in connection with the access of persons to the data box of the inspected person and when storing documents delivered to the data box. The controlled person, as the administrator of personal data, therefore did not take measures that would prevent the unauthorized disclosure of personal data contained in documents delivered to the hospital's data box.

By the conduct in question, the controlled person violated the obligation according to § 13 paragraph 1 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. (taking security measures). Given that the inspected person immediately corrected the defective condition, the Office did not impose corrective measures. The office imposed a fine of CZK 10,000 on the inspected person.

The inspection was conducted by inspector PaeDr. Jana Rybínová.
