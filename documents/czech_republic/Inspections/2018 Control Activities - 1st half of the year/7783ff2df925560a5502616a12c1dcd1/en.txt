Based on the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of a company offering driving school services, the subject of which was the processing of personal data of clients of the driving school through the registration form.

The Authority found that the inspected person's website, which included a web form with the option of "pre-registration", also contained information that the website was under construction and that the driving school was not currently offering any courses, expecting to start operations in the summer of 2016. Therefore, the Authority did not find that the interactive form would be functional, i.e. that the controlled person would collect personal data through it or that it would operate any system used to process personal data collected through the registration form located on its website.

In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by Inspector Mgr. Daniel Rowan.
