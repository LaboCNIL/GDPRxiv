Based on the initiative, the Office carried out a control of the transfer of personal data by the insurance company to another person. The Office checked, in particular, the fulfillment of the obligations arising from § 5 paragraph 1 letter a) (determination of the purpose of processing) and d) (collection to the appropriate and necessary extent) and § 5 paragraph 2 (legal title for processing) of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The subject of the initiative was a possible violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. in connection with the activation of the e-invoice service by the complainant's bank, Česká spořitelna a.s. The office found that the e-invoice service was activated for the complainant in such a way that the inspected person in the role of issuer of the invoice submitted to him through Česká spořitelna a.s. offer to establish this service. Česká spořitelna a.s. forwarded this offer to the complainant, stating that if he does not reject the e-invoice service within two months, it will be automatically activated for him.

In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.
