On the basis of several initiatives, the Office carried out an inspection of the processing of personal data by the capital Prague in connection with the unauthorized disclosure of personal data to other data subjects, specifically in connection with the delivery of a call to pay a fine for committing a traffic offense to the wrong persons.

The Office found that the inspected person correctly forwarded the fine payment notices together with the assigned addresses in electronic form to the delivery service, České poště, s.p., which, however, sent these notices to the wrong addressees in 2,500 cases.

According to the findings of the Office, Česká pošta, s.p. is responsible for making personal data available, which is in the position of processor, and which cannot absolve itself of responsibility by the fact that an error occurred on the envelope line from a foreign supplier.

Following the above-mentioned findings, the Office in the matter initiated proceedings for an offense with Česká pošta, s.p.

The inspection was conducted by the inspector PhDr. Petr Krejci.
