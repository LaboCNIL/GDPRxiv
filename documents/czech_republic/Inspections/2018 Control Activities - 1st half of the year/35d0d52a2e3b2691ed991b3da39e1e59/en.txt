On the basis of an initiative, the Office carried out an inspection of the publication of personal data on websites focused on project monitoring.

The Authority found that the operator of the website is the company Maesta, a.s., based in Bratislava in the Slovak Republic. The websites in question are focused on monitoring projects in the Czech and Slovak Republics and contain descriptions of planned, ongoing and completed buildings and contacts for investors, architects, designers and general contractors. The site collects data from public sources, for example from registers, from statistics, from requests according to Act No. 106/1999 Coll., on free access to information, from information published on the Internet and from other sources.

In view of the inspection findings, the Office decided to forward the submission to the Slovak Office for the Protection of Personal Data.

The inspection was conducted by inspector PaeDr. Jana Rybínová.
