On the basis of an initiative, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was the management of file documentation within the scope of the activities of the Police Presidium of the Czech Republic, with a focus on the processing of personal data of a specific complainant and on the fulfillment of the duties of the administrator pursuant to § 13 of Act No. 101/2000 Coll. (security of personal data).

The initiative contained a suspicion of leakage of personal data from the criminal file, or from the records of criminal proceedings. The office found that the document in question, which was stored in the criminal file, was also presented during court proceedings in the context of another civil dispute.

The claim of the complainant that this document could have come exclusively from the criminal file in question was therefore not proven during the inspection, as other state authorities and persons also had access to the document. In connection with the subject processing of personal data, the Office did not detect a violation of Act No. 101/2000 Coll.

The inspection was conducted by inspector PaeDr. Jana Rybínová.
