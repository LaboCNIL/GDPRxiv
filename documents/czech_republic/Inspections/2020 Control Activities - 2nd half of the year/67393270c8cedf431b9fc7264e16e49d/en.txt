Elementary School


The inspection, which was carried out on the basis of a complaint about the illegal transfer of personal data to the ZUÅ  Association, provided by the parents of primary school pupils, in connection with their interest in studying a given field, did not reveal that the inspected person was processing the pupils' personal data beyond the scope established by law, without legal reason, and the complainant's statement that turning over the records of pupils would result in their personal data being handed over to the Association of Secondary Schools was not confirmed. At the same time as this check, an investigation by the Czech School Inspectorate took place based on a complaint, the result of which did not bring any new facts regarding the alleged disclosure of pupils' personal data. During this inspection, on the basis of further investigations by the relevant authorities and according to a published petition, the director was dismissed, or statutory representative of the controlled person. If the inspected person filed objections against the inspection protocol, they were dealt with in autoremedy, as it was the fault of the inspected person himself, or about a new statement in the objections about the non-existence of a contract with the trustee, contrary to the documents in the file, from which the inspection findings were based.
