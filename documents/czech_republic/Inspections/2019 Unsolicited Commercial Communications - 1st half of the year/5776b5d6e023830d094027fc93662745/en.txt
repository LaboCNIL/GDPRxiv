On the basis of 18 initiatives, the Office carried out an inspection regarding compliance with Act No. 480/2004 Coll. in connection with the sending of business communications. The auditors found that the audited person violated the obligations set out in ยง 7 paragraph 2 of Act No. 480/2004 Coll., i.e. to use electronic contact details for the purpose of disseminating business communications by electronic means only in relation to users who they gave their prior consent to do so. In relation to part of the commercial communications, the inspectors came to the conclusion that there was also a violation of ยง 7 paragraph 4 letter b) of Act No. 480/2004 Coll., because these commercial communications did not contain a clear indication of the person on whose behalf the communication is being carried out. For this action, the Office imposed a fine of CZK 40,000 on the inspected person. The inspection was carried out by the unsolicited communications department.
