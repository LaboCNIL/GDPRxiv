Based on the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the subject of which was the fulfillment of the information obligation in the processing of personal data. The controlled person rents vehicles that are equipped with GPS.



The inspection found that the inspected person, as the administrator of personal data, does not properly inform data subjects about the processing of data generated by GPS operation and about the involvement of processors. With the above-mentioned actions, it thus violated the obligations set out in Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (obligation to provide information).



The Office imposed corrective measures on the controlled person consisting of the obligation to inform data subjects about the processing of personal data, within the scope of Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and will initiate infringement proceedings in the matter.


The inspection was conducted by inspector Ing. Josef Vacula.
