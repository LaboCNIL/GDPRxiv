On the basis of an initiative, the subject of which was the finding of a flash drive with the personal data of clients of the inspected person, the Office carried out a personal data security check in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679.



The flash drive, which the complainant should have found at the department store, contained 760 contracts for the provision of publicly available electronic communications services with customers' personal data. It was not possible to prove who the flash drive in question belonged to. Given that it was not possible to rule out suspicions of unfair business practices by one of the competitors, or intending to damage the reputation of some of the former employees, the audited person turned to the law enforcement authorities, mainly because the complainant has more files than he claimed and presented, as the contracts that he presented in his petition were not found in the file of 760 contracts like the ones he found.



In connection with the aforementioned findings, the Office terminated the inspection with the understanding that another inspection may be initiated after the investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic is completed.


The inspection was conducted by inspector PhDr. Petr Krejci.
