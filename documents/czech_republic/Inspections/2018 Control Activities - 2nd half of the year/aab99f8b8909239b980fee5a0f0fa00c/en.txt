On the basis of an initiative, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was compliance with the obligations of the personal data administrator when processing the personal data of clients and applicants for the conclusion of a contract with the audited company, with a focus on the right of the data subject to access personal data according to Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/ 679.



The inspection found that the inspected person did not provide the complainant with information about the processing of his personal data and conditioned their provision on the unauthorized condition of submitting an application with a verified signature of the applicant.

The audited person violated the obligations set out in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by the above-mentioned conduct.



Considering that the inspected person immediately corrected the defective condition, the Office did not impose corrective measures and waived the imposition of a fine.


The inspection was conducted by the inspector MVDr. František Bartoš.
