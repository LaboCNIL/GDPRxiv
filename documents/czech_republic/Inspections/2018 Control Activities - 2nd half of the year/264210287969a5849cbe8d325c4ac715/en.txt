Based on the initiative, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was compliance with the obligations set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in connection with the processing of personal data through a camera system located in the toilets and near the toilets in the shopping gallery.



The inspection showed that cameras are placed in the washrooms, i.e. in front of the toilets (women's and men's), for the purpose of protecting the health and property of the center, vendors and customers. The cameras were stable, with fixed shielding so that the privacy of toilet visitors was not violated and at the same time the stated purpose was ensured. The inspection also included the fulfillment of other duties of the personal data administrator in connection with the operation of the camera system, in particular the obligation to provide information, the security of personal data, the right of access to personal data.



The Office did not detect a violation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in connection with the processing of personal data in question.


The inspection was conducted by MVDR inspector František Bartoš.
