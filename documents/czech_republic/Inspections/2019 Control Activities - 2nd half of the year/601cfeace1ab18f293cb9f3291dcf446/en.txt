The inspection was carried out on the basis of the results of the investigation by the representative of the public defender of rights, regarding the initiative of the complainant, regarding the processing of personal data of passengers. Personal data should have been collected by the transport controller (auditor) from the identity cards of passengers without a valid travel document even if the passenger wanted to pay the fare and fare surcharge on the spot. The claim of the complainant was not proven by the inspection. As part of the inspection, it was not found that the inspected person processed personal data other than within the legal scope and for the time necessary for the purpose of processing, or that it would not fulfill the administrator's other legal obligations. Additional information: In the event that the passenger does not present a valid travel document at the request of the authorized person during the transport inspection, he is obliged to pay the fare and surcharge to the fare, or to present himself with a personal document and provide the personal data required for enforcement payment of fares and fare surcharges; personal data required for the enforcement of fare payment and fare surcharges means first name, surname, date and place of birth, address for delivery and personal document number [ยง 18a para. 2 lit. c) of Act No. 111/1994 Coll., on road transport].
