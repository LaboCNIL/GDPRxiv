Company


The inspection was carried out on the basis of an initiative. The internal procedures of the controlled company during so-called telemarketing were assessed. At the same time, the technical-organizational measures taken by the audited company were examined, including the implemented control mechanisms. As part of the audit, not a single concrete evidence was found for the claim of the complainant about the unauthorized processing of personal data, while the audit documented that there was a conflict between the complainant and the audited person unsuccessful negotiations on mutual cooperation that preceded the complaint.
