The inspection was carried out on the basis of a notification by the inspected person of a breach of personal data security in the sense of Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In the notification, the inspected person stated that a briefcase had been stolen from a parked motor vehicle in the parking lot in front of the supermarket, while this briefcase contained, among other things, several documents with the personal data of 12 persons in the scope of first name, surname, date of birth, social security number, address of permanent residence, telephone , e-mail, identity card number, date of validity of identity card, authority issuing identity card, overview of income and expenses and also personal data of 13 employees of one legal entity, including name, surname, social security number, limit of insurance benefits, amount of co-payment .

The inspection revealed that after the briefcase was stolen, the inspected person conducted individual training for the intermediary in the area of personal data processing and protection, who is responsible for the loss of documents, which the inspected person documented with an extract from the attendance list of meeting participants.

Based on the audit findings, the auditors stated that the intermediary in question as a personal data processor, although he was properly trained and instructed by the audited person on the security and protection of personal data, did not pay attention to the instructions he received from the administrator in the sense of Article 28, paragraph 3 letter a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and did not fulfill the obligations arising for the processor from the mentioned article, while not securing the documents with personal data in such a way that they were not stolen from the car that he was driving on the day of the theft. After assessing the entire matter and taking into account the collected evidence, the auditors concluded that the auditee did not violate the controller's obligations regarding the security of the personal data processed by them in connection with the loss of documents with personal data.
