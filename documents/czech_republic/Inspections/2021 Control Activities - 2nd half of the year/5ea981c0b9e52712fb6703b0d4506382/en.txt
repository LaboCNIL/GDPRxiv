Association


The inspectors started the inspection based on three complaints. The complainants unanimously stated that they sent a controlled person (an association whose purpose, as stated in the federal register: protection of the legitimate interests of capital market entities and small investors in the position of consumers under EU law) for access to their personal data, without the start of the inspection, they received a response. For non-cooperation, the association was legally fined. However, during the inspection, the Office did not find that she was in fact the holder of the domain. One of the former representatives of the controlled person applied for its establishment and holding, stating that: he registered the domain with the intention of creating a free discussion space for those who feel damaged by fraudulent actions on the capital market. Considering that the company was not the administrator of the personal data of the complainants according to Article 4, Paragraph 7 of the General Regulation, it was not found to have violated the General Regulation in this regard.
