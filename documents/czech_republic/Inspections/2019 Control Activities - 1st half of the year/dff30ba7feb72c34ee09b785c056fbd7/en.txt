On the basis of the inspection plan for 2018, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was the processing of personal data of insurance premium payers of the General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic who owe insurance premiums. The General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic published on its website the personal data of payers whose total debt for health insurance premiums and penalties exceeded a certain amount. With the applicability of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the controlled entity terminated this activity and continues to post personal data of debtors on its website page does not publish. In view of this fact, the Office did not detect a violation of the relevant personal data processing after the applicability of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The inspection was conducted by inspector PhDr. Petr Krejčí. Recommendation: The Office considers the publication of debtors' personal data to be a coercive act, which usually violates the basic rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any disclosure of personal data in connection with the creation of claims would only be possible with the prior consent of the data subject, subject to compliance with all basic principles of personal data processing, which would, however, have to meet all the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. it would have to be possible, for example, to revoke at any time.
