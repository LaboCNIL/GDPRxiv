Based on three complaints, the Office carried out an inspection, the subject of which was the processing of personal data through the camera system located at the entrance to the establishment. The inspectors checked the camera system on site and found that it is located at the entrance to the establishment and that it serves to identify people when the door is opened remotely. After ringing the bell, the operator checks the person's identity and then lets them into the building. The inspectors also found that the camera system is not recording, i.e. only in online mode, and that the image is without sound. Taking into account these facts, the inspectors came to the conclusion that the inspected person does not process personal data and is therefore not their administrator within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The Authority did not detect a violation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in connection with the processing of personal data in question. led by inspector PhDr. Petr Krejčí. Recommendation: In this context, we refer to the guidelines of the European Personal Data Protection Board 3/2019 regarding the processing of personal data through camera systems, which was adopted on July 10, 2019.
