Brussels, January 19 - AZOP participated in the plenary session of the EDPB, where the Guidelines on the rights of data subjects were adopted, focusing on the right of access to personal data. The guidelines aim to analyze the various aspects of an individual's right to access their personal data and to provide more precise instructions on how the right of access must be exercised in different situations. Among other things, the guidelines provide clarifications on the scope of the right of access, the information that the controller must provide to the data subject, the format of the access request, the main modality of providing access, and the concept of manifestly unfounded and excessive requests.
EDPB President Andrea Jelinek said: “The right of access enables individuals to find out how and why their personal data is being processed. The guidelines provide  examples  for controllers to use when responding to data subjects' requests for access to their personal data in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR".
The guidelines will be in the process of public discussion for 6 weeks.
In addition, the EDPB adopted a response to the letters addressed to it, in which the EDPB calls for a consistent interpretation of the consent to the use of cookies. In the letter, the EDPB reiterates that it is committed to its goal of ensuring the harmonized application of data protection rules throughout the European Union. In this regard, the EDPB has recently established a Working Group on Cookie Notices (Banners). The working group will coordinate responses to complaints regarding cookie banners. Furthermore, the EDPB has updated the Consent Guidelines to ensure a harmonized approach by supervisory authorities regarding the conditionality of consent and the unequivocal expression of data subjects' wishes.
