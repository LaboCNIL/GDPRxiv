Project partners (Personal Data Protection Agency, Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Italian data protection authority Garante Privacy, Vrije University in Brussels and University of Florence) on the project "Campaign to raise awareness of data protection for small and medium-sized enterprises II - ARC II ", on Wednesday October 12, held an introductory meeting in Brussels. It was an opportunity for representatives of the project coordinator (AZOP) and users to discuss in detail the activities to be undertaken under the project, focusing on the development of specifications and modules for the Olivia web tool, project documentation, reporting requirements under the Citizenship Programme, equality , rights and values, gender-aware policy, adherence to EU values, information dissemination campaign and Communication and Visibility Plan, as well as the establishment of an External Advisory Board.
By the way, ARC II is a continuation of the successfully implemented ARC project, which aimed to provide support to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in their efforts to align their operations with GDPR. The expected direct result of the ARC II project is a higher level of knowledge and understanding of small and medium-sized enterprises about their obligations arising from the GDPR and the Italian and Croatian legal framework for data protection.
The project will result in a digital GDPR compliance tool that will be developed in open source code, so that all data protection authorities can adapt it to their national legislation and language. Thus, SMEs across the EU will benefit from the results of the ARC II project.
The progress of the ARC II project will be monitored by members of the Board of Directors: Zdravko Vukić (AZOP), Luigi Montuori (Garante Privacy), Paul Quinn (VUB), Andrea Simoncini (UNIFI) and project manager Anamarija Mladinić (AZOP).
