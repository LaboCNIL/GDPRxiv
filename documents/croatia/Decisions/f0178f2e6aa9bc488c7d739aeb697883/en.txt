The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data, as part of the EU project Awareness Raising Campaign for SME II, implemented in cooperation with the Italian supervisory body for data protection Garante Privacy, the Faculty of Organization and Informatics from Vara≈ædin, the Vrije University in Brussels and the University of Florence, is conducting a survey of women's attitudes and men in terms of GDPR compliance, in the context of respecting gender equality and equality between women and men.
Please complete the survey available at the link: https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/ARC2-ravnopravnost-istrazivanje. Your answers are key to gaining a deeper insight into the awareness of data protection and gender equality among managers and processors in Croatia.
The goal of this research is to determine the needs for the adoption of a plan of activities aimed at improving the equality of women and men and at combating discrimination against vulnerable groups in society within organizations that carry out activities within the framework of the ARC II project and within small and medium-sized enterprises included in this project.
Given that the main activities of the project are carried out in the field of personal data protection, part of this research will be devoted to examining the awareness of personal data protection within organizations and companies. The results of the research will be used exclusively for the purpose of analyzing needs and proposing measures to improve the equality of women and men and to combat discrimination against vulnerable groups in society.
The survey is intended primarily for micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and craftsmen, but we invite all other organizations to participate in the implementation of this survey.
Thank you in advance for your valuable contribution.
With respect,
Agency for the Protection of Personal Data
