Director of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data Zdravko Vukić, also a friendly member of the Osijek Faculty of Law Alumni Club, on Tuesday, December 7, 2021, held an online guest lecture on the legislative framework for the protection of personal data in the Republic of Croatia.
In order to bring the area of personal data protection closer to the students of the Osijek Faculty of Law, director Vukić explained the basic terms from the General Regulation on Data Protection, the area of its application, as well as the impact it had on natural and legal persons, as well as independent supervisory bodies. "The general regulation on data protection strengthened the existing rights to the protection of personal data of individuals and introduced some new ones, also introduced new obligations for managers and executors of processing, as well as new powers and tasks for supervisory bodies for data protection," the director pointed out.
The topic of the lecture was also the Law on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection, which ensures the implementation of the Regulation, but also regulates certain issues that are not defined by the Regulation. Namely, the General Data Protection Regulation allows member states to define certain areas in more detail: such as defining the term public authority, age limit for offering information society services directly to children, processing of biometric and genetic data, processing of personal data through video surveillance, etc.
The director wished all the students success in their further studies and that, as future lawyers, they successfully protect their own and other people's personal data.
