In a tender conducted by the European Commission on March 10, 2021, the Personal Data Protection Agency was selected to implement a Twinning project entitled "Supporting the Implementation of the Modernized Legislative Framework for Personal Data Protection" in Northern Macedonia.
The aim of the project is to improve the area of personal data protection and the national system of personal data protection in Northern Macedonia in accordance with the European acquis. This significant international success is due to AZOP's team of experts led by the Director of the Personal Data Protection Agency. The Personal Data Protection Agency is extremely honored and pleased to be able to contribute to the reputation of the Republic of Croatia in the European Union in this way. The Twinning Instrument for the Republic of Croatia is a key strategic instrument for improving and further strengthening friendly relations between the Republic of Croatia and beneficiary countries, positioning Croatia as a proactive and competent EU member state and contributing to strengthening Croatian influence in third countries.
The knowledge and experience of Croatian experts from the process of Croatia's accession to the EU are extremely sought after and appreciated among the beneficiary countries, but also among the member states-partners in consortia. In its official statistics, the European Commission highlights Croatia as an EU member state that is the most successful in Twinning projects in the countries of Southeast Europe.
The project, lasting 15 months and worth EUR 700,000, will be implemented by the Agency in cooperation with partners from the German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (IRZ) and the Central Finance and Contracting Agency (CFCA).
