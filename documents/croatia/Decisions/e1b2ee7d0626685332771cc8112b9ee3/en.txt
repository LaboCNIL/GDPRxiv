The Agency for Personal Data Protection, in cooperation with the Croatian Chamber of Commerce, has launched a campaign to systematically educate data protection officers in the private sector. The second online workshop in a row was held today, December 14, thanks to which data protection officers had the opportunity to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their tasks well.
"Taking into account the important role and numerous tasks imposed on officials by the General Data Protection Regulation, the Agency recognized the need to conduct targeted training, which includes specialized knowledge and skills in personal data protection law and practice and information security. It should be noted that this campaign is a continuous process of acquiring knowledge about personal data protection and will be largely based on practical examples from the practice of this Agency, but also best practices at EU level, "said Director of the Personal Data Protection Agency Zdravko Vukic.
The workshop, which was attended by more than a hundred participants, presented the General Data Protection Regulation and its main provisions (definitions, principles, rights of respondents, roles and responsibilities of the controller and executor of processing (). Nevertheless, the emphasis of the workshop is the role and tasks of the personal data protection officer. Thus, the main tasks and responsibilities of data protection officers are explained, and only some of them are to advise processing managers on all issues related to data protection, conduct analysis of processing procedures, propose technical and organizational measures, keep records of processing, resolve complaints, conduct proportionality tests, participate in impact assessments, communicate with the personal data protection authority, etc.
The implementation of these workshops, in addition to the acquired knowledge, is expected to develop awareness of the importance of personal data protection, as well as a kind of ethics of dealing with them. This would ensure that a positive climate related to the protection of personal data and more efficient application of the General Regulation is created within organizations.
