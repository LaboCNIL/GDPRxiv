The director of the Agency for Personal Data Protection, Anto Rajkovaƒça, confirms that we really justifiably perceive 2018 as a turning point in data protection in Croatia, Europe and internationally.
Namely, after almost 4 years of extensive negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union reached an agreement on new EU rules on data protection, completed in the General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force on 24 May 2016, and its full implementation in to all Member States, became binding on 25 May 2018.
The purpose of full implementation of the Regulation is related to the development of the digital age, which involves the incredibly simple exchange of information and data, and the emergence of social networks, increasing availability and use of the Internet, mobile applications, smartphones, etc., significantly accelerated the flow of for privacy - sensitive data.
These changes have resulted in the adoption of a new regulation that ensures uniform and uniform treatment in all Member States in the part concerning the overall protection of personal data, which results in simpler and equal protection of the rights of all individuals, citizens and respondents in Europe. union.
The protection of personal data is not a novelty that has occurred in the application of the General Regulation. On the contrary, it existed before the full application of the General Regulation, and was implemented in accordance with the then existing legal framework. However, due to the strength of this regulation, we justifiably perceive 2018 as a turning point in data protection in Croatia, Europe and internationally.
As technology has transformed economic and social life, the development of technology is moving forward at a rapid pace, and bearing in mind that personal data protection is an institution of trust, extremely important for people / individuals, we can truly expect the scope of AZOP's work in the years to come. are ahead of us, always be higher than the previous year.
