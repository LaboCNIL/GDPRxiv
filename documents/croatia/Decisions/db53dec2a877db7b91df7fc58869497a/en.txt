As part of raising awareness of the importance of personal data protection, the Agency for Personal Data Protection, launched in cooperation with the Croatian Chamber of Commerce, is launching a long-announced campaign to systematically educate data protection officers in the real sector.
Taking into account the important role and numerous tasks imposed on officials by the General Data Protection Regulation, the need for targeted training in the field of personal data protection and information security, which includes specialized knowledge and skills in personal data protection and information security law and practice, was recognized.
The capacity building campaign for data protection officers will start with a free ONLINE training to be held on December 2, 2020.
Participation in the training is free, the number of participants is limited to 200, and you can apply via the online form available at https://www.hgk.hr/edukacija-sluzbenika-za-zastitu-osobnih-podataka-2-prosinca-najava , no later than Tuesday, Dec. 1, at 2 p.m.
This campaign is a continuous process of acquiring knowledge about personal data protection and will be largely based on practical examples from the practice of the Personal Data Protection Agency.
