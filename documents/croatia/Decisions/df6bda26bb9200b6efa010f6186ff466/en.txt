Dear data protection officers,
The Agency, in cooperation with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) with data protection supervisory authorities throughout the European Economic Area and with the cooperation of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), is implementing a coordinated implementation activity for 2023 (Coordinated Implementation Framework - CEF 2023) on the topic appointment and role of the data protection officer. For further competent action, it is necessary to submit data to the Agency, i.e. answer the questions from the Questionnaire that you received via e-mail https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/koordinirana-provedbena-akcija-azop related to the appointment and role of the data protection within your organization.

The questionnaire is mandatory for everyone - the private sector and all public authorities. The deadline for completing the questionnaire has been extended until June 1.

If you have technical problems when loading the questionnaire (questions and answers do not appear correctly) - please open the questionnaire in another internet browser.
If you receive an error (Error) - try submitting the questionnaire later.
If none of that works, that is, you cannot access the questionnaire via the link you received in the e-mail, send us the completed questionnaire to azop@azop.hr. Download the questionnaire here: DPO-questionnaire
If you have already submitted the questionnaire and want to change the answers afterwards, this is not possible. However, you can fill out the questionnaire again and note what you have changed.
