Brussels, 2 February – The EDPB adopted its opinion on the GDPR-CARPA certification scheme submitted to the Board by the Luxembourg supervisory authority. This is the first time that the EDPB has adopted a consistency opinion on criteria for a national certification scheme.
The GDPR-CARPA certification scheme is a general scheme that does not focus on a specific sector or type of processing. It includes requirements for data protection management and personal data processing activities in the organization.
The President of the EDPB, Andrea Jelinek, said: “This opinion is an important step towards greater compliance with the GDPR. The main objective of certification mechanisms is to help controllers and processors prove compliance with the GDPR. Controllers and processors who adhere to the certification mechanism also gain greater visibility and credibility, as it also enables individuals to quickly assess the level of protection of their personal data."
The EDPB's opinion aims to ensure consistency and correct application of certification criteria among supervisory authorities in the European Economic Area. For this purpose, the EDPB considers it necessary to make a number of changes to the draft certification criteria. After approval by the supervisory authority, the certification mechanism will also be added to the register of certification mechanisms and data protection seals in accordance with Art. 42 (8) of the GDPR.
Note: The above certification is not related to the certification in accordance with Article 46(2)(f) of the GDPR, intended for international transfers of personal data and therefore does not provide adequate safeguards in the context of the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organizations.
