The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data carries out supervisory proceedings over the data controller EOS Matrix d.o.o. due to a possible violation of personal data and will inform the public about the findings after the procedure is over.
We instruct citizens to request access to their personal data from the subject data controller (EOS Matrix d.o.o.), in accordance with the rights guaranteed by the General Data Protection Regulation, and to provide information on whether and to what extent their personal data is covered by a personal data breach. Contact of the data protection officer: dpo@eos-matrix.hr.
Related to citizens' requests for compensation in case of violation of their personal data; any person who has suffered material or non-material damage due to the processing of personal data contrary to the provisions of the General Regulation on Data Protection, has the right to compensation for material and non-material damage from the manager or executor of the processing for the damage suffered. However, we emphasize that the Personal Data Protection Agency is NOT the competent authority for compensation. Anyone who has suffered non-material or material damage has the right to initiate a procedure for exercising the right to compensation for damage before the competent court (in the Republic of Croatia, this is the municipal court).
