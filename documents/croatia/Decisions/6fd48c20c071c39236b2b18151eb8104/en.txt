Dear data protection officers,
we invite you to participate in the research on the scope, type of work and education of data protection officers in Croatia.

The research is conducted within the European project PRO-RES through an anonymous online questionnaire.
The survey is available at:
https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DPOsurvey2020.
Please answer all questions spontaneously and honestly. This research is conducted by the Agency for Personal Data Protection (AZOP) in cooperation with the Croatian Catholic University as the holder of the European project H2020-SwafS for Croatia. The purpose of this research is to gain insight into the challenges faced by data protection officers in complying with the General Data Protection Regulation and a clearer understanding of their needs.
Participation in the survey is anonymous. The collected data will be used exclusively for the purpose of improving the quality of lectures, writing scientific articles, creating educational materials and modules for data protection officers.
Also, in order to support you in performing your complex tasks, the Agency will hold trainings for data protection officers in the public sector and in the private sector throughout 2021. Our partners in these activities are the Croatian Chamber of Commerce and the Croatian Association of Counties.
