Brussels, 15 March 2023 - The European Data Protection Board has launched its coordinated enforcement activity for 2023. During 2023, 26 data protection authorities across the European Economic Area and the European Data Protection Supervisor will participate in the Coordinated Enforcement Framework - CEF 2023 on the appointment and role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO).
Data protection officers, as intermediaries between personal data protection authorities, individuals and business entities, play a key role in contributing to compliance with the legislative framework on personal data protection and promoting effective protection of data subjects' rights.
In order to assess whether officials have an adequate role in their organizations, as prescribed in Articles 37-39 of the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as sufficient resources needed to carry out their tasks, participating data protection authorities (DPAs), apply will CEF at the national level in several ways:
- data protection officers will be sent questionnaires to help establish the facts or questionnaires to determine the justification of the official investigation;
- conducting an official investigation;
- monitoring of ongoing official investigations.
The results of the joint initiative will be analyzed in a coordinated manner, and data protection authorities will decide on possible further supervision at the national level and further enforcement measures. In addition, the results will be analyzed, creating a deeper insight into the subject matter and enabling targeted monitoring at the EU level. The EDPB will publish a report on the results of this analysis once the actions taken have been completed.
This series of actions represents the second initiative under the Coordinated Implementation Framework (CEF). CEF (Coordinated Enforcement Framework) initiatives aim to simplify enforcement and cooperation between data protection authorities.
The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data will also participate in this coordinated implementation activity, and on Monday, March 20, 2023, it will begin conducting research among data protection officers in Croatia.
