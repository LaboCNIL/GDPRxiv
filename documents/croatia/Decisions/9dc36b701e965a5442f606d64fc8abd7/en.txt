In the period from October 18 to 22, 2021, Marko Å ijan, a senior specialist advisor in the Supervision Service and Central Registry, participated in the capacity of a member country's appointed expert in the implementation of the Schengen evaluation of Greece in the area of personal data protection and the application of Schengen Acquia.
The evaluation team was composed of 7 members; 2 Commission representatives, 1 EDPS observer and 4 experts from member countries (Austria, Finland, Lichtenstein, Croatia), and the evaluation included a visit to the Greek Data Protection Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, S.I.R.E.N.E. Office, the border crossing at the Athens airport, the local police station in Athens, and the data centers for hosting the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the Visa Information System (VIS).
After discussions with the representatives of the aforementioned institutions and an insight into the processing processes of personal data contained in the databases to which they have the authority to access, the evaluation team compiled a draft of the Report on findings in 7 chapters, which will be submitted to the Schengen Committee of the European Commission for adoption after the completion of the entire evaluation procedure.
Also, the aforementioned evaluation of Greece, after the evaluations of Lichtenstein in March and the Netherlands in April, was the third in which the Agency participated in 2021.
