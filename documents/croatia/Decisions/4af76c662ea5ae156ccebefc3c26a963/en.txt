Dear Sir or Madam,
The Personal Data Protection Agency invites you to participate in a survey on the scope, type of work and education of data protection officers in Croatia. The survey is conducted through a simple online questionnaire available at the link:Â https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/anketa-sluzbenici-za-zastitu-podataka, and the expected time to complete it is about 10 minutes.
Participation in this research is anonymous, which means that the questionnaire does not collect personal data that could be used to identify the respondent.
The purpose of the research is to gain insight into the challenges faced by data protection officers, and your answers are key to our better understanding of your needs and problems and to improving cooperation between the supervisory authority and data protection officers.
The results of the research will serve AZOP for the purpose of designing activities that will make it easier for data protection officers to perform their tasks.
Please, when filling out the questionnaire, be as honest and objective as possible, so that the results of the research are credible.
We thank you in advance for taking the time to participate in this research and thereby contribute to strengthening the capacity of data protection officers and improving the area of personal data protection in Croatia.
With respect,
Agency for the Protection of Personal Data
