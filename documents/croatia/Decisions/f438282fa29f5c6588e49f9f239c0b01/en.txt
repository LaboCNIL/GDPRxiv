On this occasion, experts from the Personal Data Protection Agency pointed out that the GDPR is not a burden or an obstacle, but an opportunity for entrepreneurs to improve their business and make better use of the personal data they collect.

It is crucial that everyone who processes personal data be well informed about their obligations, coordinate their operations and thus avoid situations in which they may find themselves in the role of violators of the General Data Protection Regulation, and therefore risk high fines.
In the first part of the workshop, participants were introduced to the key terms of the General Data Protection Regulation, such as who is the manager and processor, what are the legal bases for processing personal data, what is the privacy policy, and the like. Understanding the basic terms of the Regulation is essential in order for entrepreneurs, as data controllers, to properly process personal data.
Technical and organizational measures for the protection of personal data, why a data protection officer is important, but also what to do in the event of a personal data breach, are just some of the topics covered during the second part of the workshop.
