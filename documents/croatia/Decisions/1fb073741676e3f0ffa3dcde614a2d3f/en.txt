In cases where the Agency has knowledge of a violation of personal data, it will conduct a supervisory procedure and determine all the circumstances of the specific case (for example, it will determine how the incident occurred, whether the data controller took appropriate technical and organizational measures to reduce the risk of violation to a minimum, etc. ). Depending on the circumstances of each individual case, and if the responsibility of the controller is determined, the Agency will impose an appropriate corrective measure (such as an official warning, restriction or ban on processing), the most severe of which is an administrative fine.

However, in certain situations in the event of a personal data breach, the controller will not be obliged to inform the subject (notifying the subject is not mandatory if any of the conditions stipulated in Article 34, paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation are met).
Regardless of the above, in case of suspected violation of your personal data (for example, unauthorized disclosure of a large number of personal data of citizens), you have the right to request information from the data controller, if he processed your data, as to whether your personal data is included in the incident.

The data controller must provide the answer as soon as possible, and within 30 days at most. Namely, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is obliged to provide you with the requested information and provide you with access to your personal data, if you request the same. If the controller does not comply with your request, you can contact the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data with a request to determine a violation of rights https://azop.hr/zahtjev-za-utvrdivanje-povrede-prava/.
