Following the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Schrems II case, Alessandra Pierucci, Chair of the Committee 108 and Jean-Philippe Walter, Data Protection Commissioner of the Council of Europe, issued a joint statement recalling the importance and impact of the Convention on the Protection of Individuals processing of personal data (Convention 108 +) in the context of international data transfers.
An increasing number of stakeholders are calling for democratic and effective oversight of security and intelligence services around the world, in order to ensure better protection of the rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals.
The principles of Convention 108+ and the strict exemption regime it allows, especially in the context of security and intelligence, are strong elements in responding to concerns expressed after Edward Snowden's discovery of illegal collection and processing of European citizens' personal data by US security intelligence.
The Chair of the Convention Committee 108 and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Data Protection also consider the Council of Europe's unique mandate, experience in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and opening up beyond European borders (with some of its important instruments such as Convention 108 and the Budapest Convention), make this organization an ideal forum for engaging in international cooperation and working together on the sensitive issue of the collection and processing of personal data by national security services.
