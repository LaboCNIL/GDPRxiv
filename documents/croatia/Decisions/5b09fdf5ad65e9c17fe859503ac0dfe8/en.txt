On the occasion of the European Personal Data Protection Day, Zdravko VukiÄ‡, director of the Personal Data Protection Agency, spoke to Jutarnji list journalists about information and citizens' rights arising from the General Data Protection Regulation, mistakes by legal entities, penalties for violators of obligations from the General Data Protection Regulation information about the Agency's plans this year.
"Citizens are aware that they have the rights guaranteed by the General Data Protection Regulation, but they are not sufficiently familiar with them and often misinterpret them. At the Agency, we work intensively to raise awareness of the protection of personal data among citizens, but we still encounter frequent similar inquiries due to misinterpretation of certain provisions of the Regulation. The most common misconception is that citizens think that since the GDPR came into force, they have to give their consent for everything and, if they do not want to give their consent, that their data must not be processed, which is absolutely not true. Consent is only one of the legal bases for processing personal data". You can read the entire interview here.
