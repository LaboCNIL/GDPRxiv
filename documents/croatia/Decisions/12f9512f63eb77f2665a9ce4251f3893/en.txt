"During the pandemic, we want to continue to help entrepreneurs understand that investing in personal data protection and information security is an investment that will pay off. I am glad that entrepreneurs recognize this, which is evidenced by the great interest in our education and counseling, "said Zdravko Vukic.
The webinar is intended exclusively for security managers and executors, and accordingly the program is adapted to the specific needs and concerns they encounter in their daily work, related to compliance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the General Implementation Act.
The participants of the conference had the opportunity to get acquainted with the legislative framework in the field of personal data protection, and the focus of the conference was on certain specifics in the field of personal data protection, which directly concern the application of the Private Protection Act. At the same time, through specific examples, certain ambiguities related to the protection of personal data that appear in practice, ie. the conduct of small and medium-sized enterprises performing private security activities.
