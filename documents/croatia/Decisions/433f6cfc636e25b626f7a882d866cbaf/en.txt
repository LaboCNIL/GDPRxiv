The way personal data is used and stored has changed significantly in the last few years. The General Data Protection Regulation gives individuals greater control over their personal data and regulates the way every business and organization must handle consumer and employee data.
Good data management is not only important for your business reputation, but there are also penalties for non-compliance.
As part of the ARC project, co-financed by the European Union's "Rights, Equality and Citizenship" program, we designed a website and various activities to help small businesses comply with the GDPR.
