NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Šibenik (Solaris)
"Principals and changes in education"
The Agency for Personal Data Protection responded to the invitation of the organizers - the Agency for Education, and this year, as the only national independent body in charge of supervision over personal data protection, participates in the National Conference for Primary School Principals. The subject meeting will be held from 11 to 13 March 2019 in Šibenik (Solaris), and this year's theme of the conference is "Principals and changes in education".
Through their lectures, as well as through interaction with the interested public, the Agency's experts will clarify the implementation of the provisions of the General Regulation on Data Protection and clarify the most common dilemmas that arise among employees in the educational system.
Given the fact that the General Data Protection Regulation itself recognizes children as a particularly vulnerable group in society, experts from the Personal Data Protection Agency will significantly contribute to the protection of children and their rights and continue the cooperation with the education sector.
