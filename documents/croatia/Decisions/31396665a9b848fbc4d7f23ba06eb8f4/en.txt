Today, November 5, representatives of the Agency for Personal Data Protection held an online training on personal data protection for teachers of secondary schools in the City of Zagreb and Zagreb County, within the County Council for Civic Education.
Thus, about sixty teachers had the opportunity to gain new knowledge about the General Data Protection Regulation, including the Data Protection Officer, the rights of respondents, as well as examples from practice in the education sector, but also to ask questions and resolve any doubts encountered in compliance with a legal framework for the protection of personal data.
Teachers who participated in the education will pass on the acquired knowledge to their students, so that the younger generations are aware of the importance of personal data protection.
