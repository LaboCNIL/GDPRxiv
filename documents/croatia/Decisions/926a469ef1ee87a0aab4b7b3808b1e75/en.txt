During the month of August, this Agency received a number of inquiries / petitions from citizens regarding the collection and further processing of their personal data, more precisely the collection of personal data and photo ID cards, for the purpose of conducting a fake prize game through a fake Facebook page Arena Center Zagreb.
We are of the opinion that there is a suspicion of possible commission of criminal offenses under Article 146 of the Criminal Code "Illegal Use of Personal Data", as well as other criminal offenses, for which the Police and the State Attorney's Office are responsible, and therefore the same is primarily reported to the competent Police Station.
The Agency for Personal Data Protection, as the competent body in the field of personal data protection supervision, preventively advises citizens that increased caution is needed in any disposition of personal data, especially via the Internet. Citizens are asked to act with special care, responsibly and critically, and not to pass them on to unknown as well as insufficiently known persons whose identity cannot be determined in advance.
