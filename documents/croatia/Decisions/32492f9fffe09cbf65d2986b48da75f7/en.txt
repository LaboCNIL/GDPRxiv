Representatives of the Personal Data Protection Agency, headed by Deputy Director Igor Vulja, participated in the annual "European Case Handling Workshop - ECHW", which was organized as this year's host by the Personal Data Protection Service of Georgia in Tbilisi from 17 until November 19, 2022.
The "European Case Handling Workshop" is an annual international forum for the exchange of best practices in the field of privacy and personal data protection through the participation of data protection supervisory authorities from different countries. This year's workshop was attended by more than 50 representatives of personal data protection authorities from 26 countries, including representatives of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Within the framework of this Workshop, various topics related to the implementation of data protection legislation were discussed, as well as international standards of handling cases by supervisory authorities for data protection. The focus was on topics such as the implementation of supervision by supervisory authorities for data protection; data protection on social networks; international transfer of data to third countries; personal data and artificial intelligence, imposition and implementation of corrective measures, etc.
At the panel related to administrative fines, representatives of the Agency presented Croatian experiences in conducting investigations (supervisory procedures) in which the strongest (and most complex) form of corrective measure prescribed by the General Data Protection Regulation - administrative fines was pronounced.
By the way, the Workshop has been held since 1999 and originates from the Helsinki Spring Conference, all with the aim of enabling European supervisory authorities to compare complaint handling procedures and facilitate handling of cross-border complaints, and is a kind of continuation of the "European Conference of Supervisory Authorities for Data Protection" (so-called "Spring Conference"). The next workshop will be held in 2023, and the host country will be Switzerland.
