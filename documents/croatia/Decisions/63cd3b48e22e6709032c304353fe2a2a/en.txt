Representatives of the Agency for Personal Data Protection, on November 16, held an online lecture on personal data protection at an expert meeting for secretaries and accountants of Catholic schools organized by the National Office for Catholic Schools, Croatian Bishops' Conference.
Fifty representatives of Catholic primary and secondary schools had the opportunity to learn more about the application of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Law on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as specific examples from practice in the education sector. Thus, the participants were introduced to, among other things, the basic concepts of the General Regulation, the role of data protection officers, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, but also the most common mistakes that schools make when processing personal data. However, in order to resolve all the doubts that school secretaries and accountants face, the Agency's representatives also answered their questions.
