On the basis of warnings and recommendations as part of the international cooperation of European supervisory bodies, the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data issues recommendations for all Croatian fans who will be in Katra for the World Cup in football.
Upon arrival in Qatar, fans must download two mobile apps — the official World Cup app – Hayya and the COVID monitoring app – Ehteraz. From the initial settings of the applications, it can be concluded that the mentioned applications can access the data of the mobile phone user, track their location, read, delete or change the content from the mobile phone and prevent the mobile device from going into sleep mode.
Therefore, it is recommended that, if possible, passengers travel with the so-called "burner phone" that they will be able to destroy, with an empty mobile device or a mobile device that has been reset to factory settings, and the mentioned applications are installed only immediately before departure and deleted immediately upon return. It is also recommended that travelers limit internet connections to services that require authentication to a minimum, keep their smartphone with them at all times and have a strong password to unlock their mobile device.
It is also necessary to draw attention to the fact that passengers do not keep photos, videos or digital works that do not comply with the legislation of the country they are traveling to on their mobile devices.
