On Wednesday, July 6, representatives of the Personal Data Protection Agency participated in the meeting of HUP's GDPR Privacy Group, which was moderated by HUP's legal advisor and group leader Iva Nappholz.
Namely, HUP brings together experts who deal with personal data protection and regularly organizes meetings where experts have the opportunity to share their experiences, challenges, obstacles they encounter when harmonizing business processes with GDPR, as well as the solutions they come up with.
Thus, during the meeting, the representatives of the Agency answered numerous questions and concerns of the participants of the Privacy group, mostly on the topic of personal data processing through video surveillance. This meeting was an opportunity to contribute to the more successful implementation of the General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data in the Republic of Croatia, given that the Privacy Group also disseminates and exchanges information with a wide range of stakeholders.
