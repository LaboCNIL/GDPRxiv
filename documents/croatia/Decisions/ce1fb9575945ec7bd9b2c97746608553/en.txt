Regarding the importance (and urgency) of protecting children, as the most vulnerable part of the population in the online sphere, it is necessary to point out to children, on the one hand, the benefits and benefits of the Internet and digital platforms in learning, development and obtaining useful information, while on the other hand, it is necessary to warn and to all the negative sides of indiscriminate use of information and sharing of personal data. Namely, we must be aware that children should be taught and warned from an early age about the importance of content selection in the online environment, i.e. recognizing useful from useless/harmful, appropriate from inappropriate, and how to recognize and protect oneself from dangers that may violate the child's right to the protection of personal information. data and privacy. An excellent and attractive tool for children to strengthen knowledge and skills so that they are ready for learning, work and life in the modern world is Dabric Dark's game.
A representative of AZOP will hold a lecture entitled "Protection of children's personal data in the digital age" with the aim of raising the level of awareness of the importance of protecting children's personal data and pointing out potential threats and misuse of children's personal data in the virtual world.
