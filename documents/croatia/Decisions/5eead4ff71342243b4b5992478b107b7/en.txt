In order to raise public awareness of the fundamental human right - the right to the protection of personal data and privacy, the Council of Europe, with the support of the European Commission, declared January 28 as the European Day of Personal Data Protection, also known as Privacy Day in the world.
The Agency dedicated this year's European Day of Personal Data Protection to data protection officers - key persons in the personal data protection system. Aware of the importance of the role of the data protection officer, but also of the various doubts that officers regularly face, the Agency is organizing a GDPR conference on January 27 called "Data Protection Officer - the job of the future" where it gathers experts and data protection officers from public, financial and the IT sector, who will speak from their own experience about their role, problems and solutions in the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation.
In the opening part of the conference, speeches will be given by senior government officials, Mr. Wojciech Wiewiórowski, the European Data Protection Supervisor and Ms. Anna Hänninen from the Finnish Data Protection Supervisory Authority, which is the coordinator of the European Data Protection Board's initiative focused on the appointment and role of data protection officers .
Also, the conference will be an excellent opportunity to familiarize participants with the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the European space for health data and the new digital regulation - the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Data Management Act (DGA) ) and the Act on Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, one of the topics of the panel discussion will be the new directive of the Council of the European Union on the security of network and information systems (NIS 2), which entered into force on January 16, 2023. Together with the NIS 2 Directive, the CER Directive - Directive on Critical Entities Resilience was adopted. In addition to these two directives, DORA - the Digital Operational Resiliency Act - was also adopted for the financial sector. The new NIS 2 will also apply to financial institutions (key sector – banking), with the fact that DORA is lex specialis. The NIS 2 Directive has the task of ensuring the resilience of critical entities in terms of cyber security, and the DORA to strengthen the security of financial entities.
The aforementioned regulations imply significant investments in cyber security and human resources and a systematic approach to compliance, which will certainly pose a challenge for organizations. To what extent are the aforementioned directives related to the General Data Protection Regulation and how will they affect the work of data protection officers in hospitals, banks, energy and telecommunications industries, state bodies that process personal data of all citizens of the Republic of Croatia? Find out the answers to these and other current questions at the conference on January 27, 2023. at the Westin in Zagreb.
The aim of celebrating the European Personal Data Protection Day is to raise the level of awareness of the importance of data protection among all stakeholders and to improve the field of personal data protection in the Republic of Croatia. This is of exceptional importance for the Republic of Croatia in the context of the preservation of European democratic values, the development of a single digital market, the free flow of data between the countries of the European Union and third countries, economic growth and cyber security.
