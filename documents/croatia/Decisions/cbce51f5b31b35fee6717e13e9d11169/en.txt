During October, the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data organized educational workshops for students from the 4th to the 8th grade of the 1st Primary School in Dugave in order to show the students the importance of personal data protection when using the Internet and modern technologies.
Although the age limit for opening a profile on social networks is 13 years, (in the Republic of Croatia, if a child is under 16 years of age, permission must be given by a parent or guardian to open a profile on a social network), most children under the age of 13 today use at least one social network. Thus, students in lower grades use Snapchat and TikTok, while older students use TikTok, Facebook and/or Instagram. However, in the multitude of interesting videos and photos they scroll through every day, there are many dangers hidden that it is important to continuously point out.
Therefore, in order to warn students of all the pitfalls of using the Internet and social networks and to learn how they can protect themselves and their personal data when using them, Goran Rožić from the Personal Data Protection Agency held an interactive lecture in which he explained what personal data in general, how to deal with them, where we leave them without even realizing it, and the most important thing, what are the dangers lurking behind the screen, how to recognize them and ultimately prevent them.
During the workshop, students shared their own experiences they encountered while using social networks, asked numerous questions such as what happens to a photo/video that is deleted from social networks, where all our data is recorded or what if someone hacks their profile and similar . The majority of students from the 4th to the 6th grade admitted that their parents monitor their behavior on the Internet and that they spend an average of 30 minutes to 2 hours a day on the Internet. The older ones, from 7th to 8th grade, spend more time on the Internet, but under less parental supervision.
At the end of the workshop, each class received a diploma confirming that they learned how to properly protect their own and other people's personal data, and the students promised that they would apply what they had learned on a daily basis.
The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data, after the improvement of the epidemiological situation, will continuously hold workshops for elementary school students, in order to make students aware of the importance of personal data protection.
Basic tips for responsible behavior on the Internet:

Never give your personal information, name, surname, mobile phone number, residential address, e-mail, etc., to unknown persons
Set your profile to private, let only your friends see what you post
Accept only people you really know
Never communicate with people you don't know (inform your parents immediately if you receive a message from an unknown person)
Never meet people you met online (you never know who is really on the other side of the screen)
Do not post or forward photos of others unless you have their permission
Keep passwords to yourself, don't write them down, just remember them
Think before you post every status, photo and video - once posted, it stays in the virtual world forever

And remember, although the Internet allows for a certain level of anonymity, the same rules of good behavior apply there as in the real world - don't do unto others what you wouldn't want others to do unto you. You can always turn to your parents and teachers for help and advice, they are there to protect you!
