The Personal Data Protection Agency warns citizens that fake pages of shopping malls and well-known brands with fake prize games have reappeared on social networks, and whose alleged organizers are asking for photos of citizens' ID cards.
On this occasion, the Personal Data Protection Agency advises citizens to handle their personal data with increased caution in everyday life and not to pass on their personal data to other persons, especially not via the Internet. Also, if they want to participate in various prize games, we advise citizens to check the credibility of the prize game, as well as the source of the publication (whether it is a website, social networks, etc.) before any inclusion in a prize game.
