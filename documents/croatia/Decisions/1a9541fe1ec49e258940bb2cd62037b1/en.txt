In the run-up to Black Friday, when merchants are "tempting" with discounts and reduced prices, we warn citizens to be especially careful when shopping online. Big discounts can be very tempting, but to make sure they are not fake, we advise the following:

Beware of "too good offers" on unverified online shops
Check the name and address, telephone number and e-mail address of the merchant
Use verified online stores. You can check the credibility of the internet domain at the following link: https://www.scamadviser.com/
Research reviews before you buy
Do not send copies of your ID cards and bank cards
If you pay by card, when purchasing, pay only through a secure payment service provider
Only pay when connected to a secure connection - avoid free or open WiFi
Only pay on a secure device - regularly update your operating system and security software
Do not open e-mails, attachments and suspicious links from unknown senders
