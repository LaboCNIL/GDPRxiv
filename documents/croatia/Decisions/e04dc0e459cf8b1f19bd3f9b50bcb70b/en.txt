Are you familiar with the obligations prescribed by the General Data Protection Regulation? Not sure who is the manager and who is the processor? What is the role of the data protection officer and do you need a privacy policy? Do you know what measures you must take for an adequate level of security of personal data processing? If you are not sure of the answers to these and many other GDPR questions, then the workshop is just for you.



The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data invites primarily data protection officers from the public and private sectors, but also all others who are interested in how to harmonize business with the GDPR to the free online workshop "GDPR - basic module", which will be held on April 25, 2023. starting at 10:00 a.m.
The workshop is intended primarily for data protection officers, but also for everyone else who wants to learn the basics of the General Data Protection Regulation, to be informed about their obligations, as well as their rights. Also, the workshop is an opportunity to ask specific questions to the Agency's experts and clarify your doubts.
We recommend reading the brochure: 10 Key Steps to GDPR Compliance:  and the GDPR Compliance Self-Assessment Questionnaire.
*registration for the workshop is not required, but we recommend that you join ten minutes early via the link below to ensure your place in the workshop (the number of participants is limited to 100).
