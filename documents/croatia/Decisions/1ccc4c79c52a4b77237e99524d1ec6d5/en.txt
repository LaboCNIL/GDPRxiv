The General Data Protection Regulation, better known by the English acronym GDPR, regulates the way companies process and manage personal data. The GDPR has been directly applicable in the Republic of Croatia and all EU Member States since 25 May 2018 and must be complied with by all companies, enterprises, business entities, public authorities and state administration bodies that process personal data. This Decree represents the biggest change in the EU rules on data protection in more than 20 years, said in an interview with Privredni.hr the director of the Agency for Personal Data Protection Zdravko VukiÄ‡.
