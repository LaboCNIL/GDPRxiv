The Agency for Personal Data Protection warns citizens that the appearance of fake sweepstakes, generated through fake pages of retail chains and well-known brands, has been noticed again on social networks. Currently, these are the brands Lesnina, Konzum and Lidl, and whose alleged organizers are asking citizens or participants to submit photos of their ID cards.
Considering that in the specific case there is a justified suspicion of committing criminal offenses under Art. 146 of the Criminal Code (illegal use of personal data), as well as other criminal offenses, the Ministry of the Interior and the State Attorney's Office are responsible for investigating the case and prosecuting the perpetrators. Therefore, we instruct the citizens that, if in the context of these fake prize games they passed on their data to unknown persons, they should first report the case to the competent Police Station.
On this occasion, the Agency for Personal Data Protection calls on citizens to be more careful when it comes to their personal data and not to pass it on to unknown as well as insufficiently known persons whose identity cannot be determined in advance.
Also, if they want to participate in certain prize games, we advise citizens to first check the credibility of the organizer of the prize game, as well as the source of the announcement (whether it is a website, social networks, etc.) before any inclusion in a prize game.
