In March, the Personal Data Protection Agency, in cooperation with the HUP Regional Office in Osijek, is organizing a series of workshops on the topic "How to harmonize business with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?".

The way personal data is used and stored has changed significantly in the last few years. The General Data Protection Regulation gives individuals greater control over their personal data and regulates the way every business and organization must handle consumer and employee data.
Good data management is not only important for your business reputation, but there are also penalties for non-compliance.
Namely, all data processors who dispose of the personal data of individuals, including craftsmen, micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Articles 24, 25 and 35), are obliged to take all appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to adequately protect the personal data of their employees, users, clients, in short individuals (respondents) and reduce the risk of personal data violations and misuse to a minimum.
Data controllers who do not act in this way are exposed to serious consequences: reputational risk and high fines.
As part of the ARC project, co-financed by the European Union's "Rights, Equality and Citizenship" program, we designed a website and various activities to help small businesses comply with the GDPR.
