We invite all data protection officers from the education sector to a free online training "Personal data protection in the education sector - the role and responsibilities of data protection officers" organized by the Personal Data Protection Agency on June 16, 2021 starting at 10:00. During their daily work and online trainings for public sector data protection officers, the Agency's staff noted that there are still many ambiguities related to the application of the General Data Protection Regulation in this sector. Data protection officers in the education sector continue to face problems in determining the legal basis for the processing of personal data, so a large number of data controllers and data protection officers continue to believe that processing is legal only with the consent of the individual. The education of controllers, data processors and data protection officers in the education sector is extremely important, especially when we consider that according to the General Data Protection Regulation, children enjoy special protection with regard to the processing of their personal data as they are less aware of the risks. their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Precisely for these reasons, this workshop is designed and tailored to their specific needs and challenges they face in everyday work, and when it comes to protecting the personal data of children, employees and parents.
Apply for training, get acquainted with your obligations and find out the answers to the questions: who is the leader and who is the executor of processing, whether consent is required for each processing of personal data, what is the legal basis, what is a legitimate interest, are they allowed to be photographed children at school events and whether these photographs may be made public, which means technical and organizational measures, which internal acts need to be drafted to prove compliance with the General Regulation, whether and to whom children's personal data may be passed and many others . You can ask your questions in advance via the registration form or during the training.
All interested officials in the education sector who register via the online registration form available at https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/dpo-obrazovnisektor will receive a link and instructions for participating in the online training the day before the training.
