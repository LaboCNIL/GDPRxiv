On 28 June 2021, the European Commission adopted two decisions on adequacy for the United Kingdom - one under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the other for Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the competent authorities. authorities for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offenses or enforcing criminal sanctions and on the free movement of such data.
Personal data can now be freely transferred from the European Union to the United Kingdom under the same level of protection as that guaranteed by European Union law. Decisions on adequacy also facilitate the proper implementation of the Agreement on Trade and Cooperation between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which provides for the exchange of personal data, for example for cooperation in cases of a legal nature.
The UK data protection system continues to be based on the same rules that were applicable while the UK was a Member State of the European Union. The United Kingdom has fully incorporated the principles, rights and obligations of the GDPR and Directive 2016/680 into its post-Brexit legal system.
