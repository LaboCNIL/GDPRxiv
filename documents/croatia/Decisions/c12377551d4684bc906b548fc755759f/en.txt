The Personal Data Protection Agency had the privilege of hosting and organizing a two-day workshop on binding corporate rules (BCR), which took place on May 17 and 18, 2022, in Cavtat ahead of the Spring Conference. Binding corporate rules are one of several possible legal instruments for the transfer of personal data to third countries in accordance with Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Representatives of national data protection authorities from the European Economic Area (EEA) as well as representatives of the secretariat of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) participated in the workshop. The fact that it is an important and current topic and that colleagues showed an exceptional interest in participating is also visible in the number of participants. Namely, about 50 experts from national data protection authorities from a total of 24 European countries participated in the workshop.
In accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, the competent supervisory authority approves the BCR, therefore the workshop in question is important in the context of the effective development of mutual cooperation between national authorities in accordance with the consistency mechanism. During the workshop, numerous expert discussions were held on the challenges posed to the national supervisory authorities, which arise from every single submitted application for the approval of the BCR. Also, it is important to point out that the workshop greatly contributed to the exchange of knowledge and experience on practices and procedures, from the very receipt of the request to its final approval, both by the national supervisory authorities for data protection and by the secretariat of the EDPB.
