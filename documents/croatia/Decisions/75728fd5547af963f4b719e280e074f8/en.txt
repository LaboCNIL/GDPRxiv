On 4 June 2021, the European Commission adopted two sets of standard contractual clauses (SCCs), one for use between the controller and the processor and the other for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
The modernized standard contractual clauses reflect the new requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and take into account the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union Schrems II, ensuring a high level of data protection for citizens.
These new tools will offer greater legal predictability to European businesses and will help, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, to ensure compliance with the requirements for secure data transfer, while allowing data to move freely across borders, without legal obstacles. In addition, they reflect the new requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and include the current challenges facing modern business.
The new standard contractual clauses take into account the joint opinion of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor, the feedback from participants during the public consultation and the opinion of Member States' representatives.
Some of the main innovations of the new standard contract clauses:

Update in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);
A single entry point covering a wide range of transfer scenarios, instead of separate sets of clauses;
Greater flexibility for complex process chains, through a "modular approach" and offering the possibility for more than two parties to join and use clauses;
A practical set of tools to comply with the Schrems II judgment.
