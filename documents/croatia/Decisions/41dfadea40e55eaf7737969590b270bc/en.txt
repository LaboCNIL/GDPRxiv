PROJECT CO-FINANCED FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION PROGRAM "RIGHTS, EQUALITY AND CITIZENSHIP 2014-2019", REC-RDAT-TRAI-AG-2019
PROJECT DURATION: 24 months, from March 2020 to March 2022

PARTNERS: DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION IRELAND, VRIJE UNIVERSITY BRUSSELS
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The General Data Protection Regulation is a key part of consistent and modernized EU data protection legislation applicable in the European Union from 25 May 2018. Data protection is being approached more seriously than ever before, which has a far-reaching effect on various stakeholders and sectors.
A number of stakeholders in the overall concept of personal data protection, with a special focus on SMEs, consider that they do not have enough information on the requirements of the General Regulation or that they do not have enough support to comply with new data protection rules. Consequently, in order to provide the best possible support to small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Commission provides grants to data protection authorities for the implementation of project activities aimed at raising awareness of personal data protection with emphasis on these target groups.
During its work, the Agency noticed a strong need for education in the field of personal data protection among medium and small entrepreneurs. Most large companies have sufficient financial and human resources to comply with the new data protection rules, while many small companies, due to the lack of them, still face a number of doubts when complying with the General Regulation.
Considering that the successful implementation of the General Regulation depends on good information of all stakeholders affected by data protection regulations, in 2019 the Personal Data Protection Agency applied for a project tender for a grant under the European Commission's program entitled "Rights , equality and citizenship ‚Äù. At the beginning of 2020, the European Commission approved the implementation of the project and the award of grants that will be focused on the education of medium and small enterprises.
PROJECT OBJECTIVE: ARC is a transnational project that aims to support small and medium-sized enterprises in complying with the General Regulation in terms of educating about the practical implications of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation.
KEY ACTIVITIES:
- conducting a survey among medium and small entrepreneurs in order to identify and analyze their needs and accordingly the development of educational modules and promotional materials
- trainings and seminars organized in regional centers throughout Croatia and Ireland (16 trainings in Croatia, 16 in Ireland)
- development of manuals and guidelines for compliance with the General Regulation
- organization of two international conferences with the aim of disseminating knowledge about the General Regulation and presenting the results of the project to the general public
- digital media campaign
- making an animated promotional video
- development of a website with interactive materials and tools to help comply with the General Regulation
During the implementation of project activities, which will include consultations where experts from the Agency will instruct entrepreneurs to comply with the General Regulation, Agency representatives will point out that the General Regulation is an opportunity to regulate their business related to personal data processed and how they manage them, and at the same time the obligation to take into account the privacy and data protection of users when developing new products and providing services. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to base their customer / consumer relationship on trust and reliability.
EXPECTED RESULTS:
- increased knowledge and understanding of the General Regulation among small and medium-sized enterprises
- strengthening the capacity to address the challenges of applying the General Regulation in a national context
- raising the level of awareness of personal data protection among the general public
- raising awareness and understanding of the role, competencies and main responsibilities of personal data protection bodies
- strengthening cross-border cooperation, exchange of knowledge and experience with transnational partners
We emphasize that the Agency will implement this project as a coordinator, while the Data Protection Commission, the Irish Data Protection Supervisor and the University of Brussels in Vrije will participate in the project as a partner, and this cooperation will enable the exchange of knowledge and experiences between data protection, greater visibility and reach of the project as well as the transnational dimension of expected project results.
