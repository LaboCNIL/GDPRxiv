The Personal Data Protection Agency imposed an administrative fine on the data controller - a telecommunications company in the amount of EUR 20,000.00 for violating Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, and in connection with Article 5, Paragraph 1, Point d) of the General Regulation on data protection. In particular, due to failure to maintain up-to-date and accurate data, i.e. due to failure to take measures to regularly check the up-to-dateness and accuracy of the respondent's personal data, the data controller unlawfully processed (retained) the respondent's personal data even after the termination of the contractual relationship.
Namely, the Agency received a request to determine the violation of the right to the protection of personal data in which the applicant (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) stated that her personal data is being processed by a telecommunications company, although the respondent has not been their user for more than ten years. The respondent found out about the information that her personal data is still being processed during the security incident notification she received from the telecommunications company, and the same was confirmed to her by the customer service.
In the case in question, it was determined that the telecommunications company found out after the respondent's inquiry that it was still processing her personal data, all due to the fact that the data controller linked the existence of a non-existent debt to the respondent for unknown reasons, which is why the computer system did not allow the deletion of personal data, until non-existent debt was not canceled manually. As a result of the above, the processing manager illegally processed the personal data of the respondent from the contractual relationship, in such a way that without a legal basis from Art. 6, paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation retained personal data after 12 months have passed since the termination of the contractual relationship.
Otherwise, the Agency has so far imposed 29 administrative fines in the total amount of EUR 810,656.57 for various violations of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Law on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation.
