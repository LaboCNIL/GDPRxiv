The Croatian Medical Chamber and the Faculty of Law of the University of Split, with the co-organization of chambers in healthcare, organized the 4th Congress of Coordination of Chambers in Healthcare (KoKoZ) and the 6th Croatian Congress of Medical Law, which was held from April 21 to 23, 2023 in Novi Vinodolski, which was attended by Deputy Director Igor Vulje and Agency officials.
During the congress, numerous lectures and panels were held on current topics in healthcare and medical law, and one of them was the eKarton information system. On the second day of the congress, the eKarton system was discussed on a panel by deputy director Igor Vulje and Agency officials, representatives of the Ministry of Health, Ericsson Nikola Tesla, the Faculty of Law in Split and the Croatian Medical Chamber.
eCarton was the topic of the lectures held by the Agency's officials. It was emphasized that when processing health data, as a special category, it is necessary to have a justified purpose and to process such data only if it is necessary for the purposes of, for example, patient treatment or scientific research with the application of anonymization, while it is not justified to access the e-Card for the private purposes of a doctor , since the aforementioned would entail corresponding responsibility from the aspect of the General Data Protection Regulation. Likewise, the participants had the opportunity to hear about organizational and technical measures for the protection of personal data in healthcare systems. At the same time, emphasis was placed on raising awareness of the importance of applying personal data protection measures to all employees in an institution, from the highest to the lowest level of the organizational structure.
