The Agency for Personal Data Protection and the Secretariat of the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union are organizing the European conference Data Protection Day 2020 - Facing New Challenges, within the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, on 16 January 2020 in Zagreb.
The Data Protection Day 2020 - Facing New Challenges conference was organized with the support of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice and the Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society.
The conference will bring together the Croatian and international community of data and privacy experts, senior civil servants, representatives of public authorities, academia and academia, representatives of the European Commission, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board, representatives of businesses from various sectors , and will cover the most current topics in the field of data protection, such as: data protection as a business opportunity in the digital economy, online manipulation, profiling and targeted advertising, application of privacy by design and privacy by default in IT system design, application of artificial intelligence in private and public sector with an emphasis on legal and ethical aspects, the impact of disinformation and publicity campaigns on the rule of law in the EU.
Namely, data protection is one of the key factors in the process of digital transformation of our society, especially bearing in mind that the dangers of misuse are greater than ever before because in the digital age many actors in different ways collect, process and use personal data. In this context, the participants and the organizer of this conference want to actively and professionally develop public-private partnerships, share expertise, experiences and examples of good practice and thus effectively contribute to the development of Europe as a community of values. The main goal of this expert meeting is the strong need to raise awareness of all stakeholders and citizens about the fundamental rights and rule of law of the European Union, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and a comprehensive and effective approach to prevention in personal data protection.
In addition to all the above, the conference is an event that will mark the European Data Protection Day for the first time marked in 2007, after the Council of Europe decided to mark January 28 as the European Data Protection Day. This date also represents the day of signing the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108), which guarantees the privacy rights of every natural person with regard to automated processing of personal data in each signatory state.
