ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS ON THE SCREEN FOR ANDROID 

DEVICES 

INTRODUCTION 

This technical note analyses the mechanisms that exist on the ANDROID ecosystem 
for apps to be able to access the device’s screen. As will be detailed below, permission is 
requested when the app accesses the screen without providing proper information to 
the  data  subject,  he  can’t  check  if  the  permission  was  granted  neither  withdraw  the 
permission granted previously. 

This  document  is  addressed  to  users  and  developers,  to  users  so  that  they  can 
understand  the  implications  and  shortfalls  of  these  permissions,  as  well  as  the 
problems with accepting the dialogue boxes on apps, and to developers so that  they 
adapt  the  measures  of  transparency  and  accountability  when  designing  apps  that 
access the screen.  

STUDY OF PERMISSIONS FOR ACCESSING SCREEN  

In  2014  the  Android  5.0  Lollipop  version  was  released,  which  incorporated  the 
version of its API 21.1 Via the API android.media.projection2, methods are provided that 
make the capture and shared use of the mobile screen possible.3 

This function lets an app access the screen to record or send the screen shot to other 
devices.  This API does not permit the capture of audio on the device or access to the 
content of a window that is marked as secure.4 

Starting  with  Android  6.0,  permissions  are  no  longer  requested  when  installing  an 
app, but instead the user is asked for permission at run time,5 when the app is about to 
access a resource for the first time. However, the apps that want to capture or share the 
screen do not need any permission to do so. Via an intent,6 the app can request to start 
recording  or  broadcasting  the  screen,  displaying  a  simple  dialogue  box  to  the  user, 
which does not represent permission for the app.

For  example,  the  app  AZ  SCREEN  RECORDER,  available  on  the  Google  Play  Store,7 
requests permissions for storage, contacts, camera and microphone when it is run.   If 
only the storage request is accepted so that the files can be recorded as shown in Figure 
1, when recording starts, the application displays the textbox shown in Figure 2, which 
must be accepted by the user.

Figure 2 

It checks that the app is able to capture the screen of a mobile device, as shown in 

Figure 3. 

Via the call to this API, any app for which the user accepts this dialogue box will be 
able to record the apps that are displayed on the device’s screen. When developing an 
app, the FLAG_SECURE8parameter can be activated for some activities9 (app screens), 
which  lets  the  region  of  the  screen  occupied  by  this  app  appear  as  black  during 
recording. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, FLAG_SECURE also has a series of problems, like permitting the capture of 
child  windows,  autocomplete  and  the  virtual  keyboard,  despite  having  this  security 
flag10 activated. Figure 4 shows a concept test for this circumstance.11

Further,  vulnerability  CVE-2018-952412  existed  in  Android  versions  7  to  8.1,  which 
made it possible to overlay a dialogue box over another one. Thus, an attacker could 
display  a different  text  over  the  info  box  on  starting  screen  capture,  so  that  the  user 
would not know that the device’s screen was going to be captured.13 The only clue that 
the user would have would be on the device’s task bar, which would continue to display 
the “cast” icon, as shown in Figure 5.  

In November 2018, AOSP released a patch to mitigate this vulnerability.14 The device 
update, if the manufacturer implements it, is the only solution existing to prevent the 
dialogue box overlay. 

CONCLUSIONS AND ADVISE 

Acceptance  by  the  user  to  record  the  screen  does  not  comply  with  the  consent 
permissions if they have not been previously clearly informed of the purposes for this 
processing, pursuant to article 13 of the GDPR. Likewise, it does not comply  with the 
principles of transparency when the screen recording takes place without users being 
aware when it this is being done, regardless of the fact that they have granted consent 
at some point. 

App developers, if they use screen recording, must assure they gather user consent 
after  providing  the  information  required  by  GDPR  and  provide  a  easy  method  to 
withdraw such consent. More the over, they must provide mechanisms for the user to 
be fully aware in the moment they are doing such screen recordings. 

 Users  should  not  accept  those  applications  asking  for  screen  access  without 
providing the right information about the purpose of such access, the disclosure of the 
recording to a third party, retention periods, and the rest of requirements pursuant to 
GDPR article 13. 

Otherwise, they should not grant screen access and in any case do not tick the option 
“Don´t show again” in the warning message before the first access. Users should also 
keep their devices up to date with the last security updates.
