FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

II

A first question arises that the list of the BOE is of 10 people, the one that
appears as the subject of the complaint is 140. No reason has been given for the type, purpose and legitimacy
of the exhibition of the 140 members of the list, since it does not appear related to the BOPA.
There is no legitimizing basis for the aforementioned exhibition, which is why it was imputed to claimed the
Violation of article 6.1 of the RGPD that states: “Legality of the treatment””1. treatment alone
will be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met: "listing different, not
concurring none of them for the treatment carried out on the page indicated as
how it has been done.

Although an infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD was imputed, in the proposal of
resolution the classification of the infraction is changed, since it is considered more appropriate to classify
the facts object of the complaint as incardinated in article 5.1 a). Thus, the exposure
publication of the lists with the data: DNI, name and surnames, and landline telephone numbers
and/or mobile phones, and results of the calls with annotations, in the electronic office of the
Principality of Asturias with access for any person, supposes an infraction of the aforementioned
article, as there is no legitimacy for the set of elements that are published,
also adding that it could be a process already completed since 2015 and
remains exposed.

Article 5.1.a) of the RGPD indicates: “The personal data will be:

processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

a)
("legality, loyalty and transparency");

The exposed document could rather be described as an internal document of
management, as it is contained as a block, data that does not have to be exposed to give them publicity
that looks for the concurrence of the processes, if it is about employment exchanges or any other
selective process. After the development of the tests, it seems that a list is made of
which annotations are produced, and in no case is there legal authorization to exhibit in a
web, in electronic headquarters said list to the knowledge of third parties. It could be due to an error
denotes lack of diligence. Therefore, there is no legitimizing cause that enables the exhibition
of the data in the open electronic headquarters as it was given, a kind of management document
of the process that is not related to qualifications or transparency when exceeding
these elements.

In addition, as a basic principle of the RGPD, when processing data, it has always been
to opt for the minimum data necessary for the group of affected parties to achieve its purpose. I know
therefore proves the commission of the infringement of article 5.1. a) of the RGPD.

Likewise, it must be understood that the listings should not remain on the page when
fulfilled its purpose and the defendant does not justify reasons that in the processing of this
procedure these lists survived, even if it was with an incomplete DNI.

Article 83.5 of the RGPD

III

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the

will publish on its website with due separation the resolutions referring to the entities
of section 1 of this article, with express indication of the identity of the person in charge or
in charge of the treatment that had committed the infraction.”
