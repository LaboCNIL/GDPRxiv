Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and

in consideration of the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 08/17/2018 it has entry in the Spanish Protection Agency
of Data (AEPD) a letter from D. ª A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) in which
states that FLIP ENERGIA, S.L., with NIF B87075982 (hereinafter, the claimed or
ALTERNA) has charged two receipts to your bank account despite not being your client
nor have been in the past and that it has not authorized such charges.

Attach a copy of the following documents to your claim:

-
 The complaint filed at the Police Station on 08/17/2018 in
who, among other things, states that she is the owner of the bank account with
IBAN ***ACCOUNT.1 and that in that account, erroneously, two
charges, for amounts of 17.68 euros and 28.42 euros, from
ALTERNATE who is not or has not been a client.
Two documents with the BBVA logo relating to both
-
debits by direct debit on account, charges that he proceeded to return. In
both documents the creditor is FLIP ENERGÍA, S.L., with CIF B87075982
and A.A.A. appears as debtor. In both documents the “Ref. owed” and the
“Ref. mandate” is DH20180604095. One of the debts, amounting to
28.42 euros and date 07/13/2018, indicates in the concept section: “Invoice
Alternate electricity for ***ADDRESS.1 (SH20180604 095SE02)”. In the
another, dated 07/27/2018 and for an amount of 17.68 euros, is indicated in the
concept section: “Alternate electricity bill for ***ADDRESS.1
(SH20180604 095SE04)”

SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the claim, the AEPD, in the
framework of file E/5681/2018, and in accordance with the provisions of article
9.4 of Royal Decree-Law 5/2018, on urgent measures to adapt the
Spanish law to the regulations of the European Union regarding the protection of
data, through a document signed on 09/27/2018, transferred it to the person claimed
so that within a period of one month it would provide this Agency with an explanation of the
facts exposed in the claim, will detail the measures adopted to prevent
similar situations continue to occur in the future and also proceed to
Communicate your decision to the complainant.

The document was notified to the claimed party electronically, being the date of
available and the date of acceptance of the notice on 09/27/2018, as

accredits the certificate issued by the FNMT that is in the file.

Likewise, in a document signed on 09/27/2018, the AEPD acknowledged receipt of the
claim and communicated to the claimant the transfer of the claim to the entity
claimed.

The defendant responded to the information request of the AEPD on 10/05/2018 in the

who made the following statements:

That “All the contracts that arrive at ALTERNA come
-
by Phone House store personnel. Dated 06/11/2018 from
a Phone House store send us a contract signed in the name of
A.A.A., hereinafter the PLAINTIFF, (DNI: *** DNI.1) for the point of
light supply CUPS ***CUPS.1”.
-
It adds that, following the implemented protocol, an email was sent to
the address ***EMAIL.1 in which he was informed that he had contracted the
supply with that entity and that on 06/23/2018 began to consume
energy billed by ALTERNA.
-
It states that the claimant contacted them for the first time on
08/22/2018 and requested a copy of the contract that he had allegedly signed
and the bills.
-
The entity affirms that the claimant paid the pending invoices
XXXSE01 and XXXSE02 with penalty. It adds that the complainant says that
"the discharge was given without his consent" and that "For this reason he was not
will claim the pending invoice with reference XXXSE04”. And continues
saying, “You will need to go to the Phone House store where the
hiring without your consent to request reimbursement of invoices
already paid that have not been returned”. (The underlining is from the AEPD)
-
Lastly, it indicates that the supply has been withdrawn with ALTERNA and
that today the relationship between the complainant and FLIP has been terminated
ENERGY.

The respondent submitted the following attached documentation to the Agency:

 

Copy of an electricity contract bearing the reference XXX. as data
-
 ***DNI.2,
of the contracting party include the following: A.A.A., with NIF
CUPS ***CUPS.1, and address of ***ADDRESS.1. The e-mail adress
***EMAIL.2 and mobile phone ***PHONE.1. In another document,
also integrated in the contract of reference XXX, the data of the
direct debit to the bank account ***ACCOUNT.2. In the last page of the
document appears a signature of the contracting party that differs completely from the
signature that appears on your statement of claim filed with the Agency and
on the copy of your police report.
-
  It is noteworthy that the NIF that appears in that document
(NIF ***DNI.2) is different from the one stated in the letter that FLIP
ENERGY directed to the AEPD: ***DNI.1. The latter is the NIF that the claimant
provided as yours in your claim; letter of which the Agency transferred
to FLIP ENERGY to explain the facts.

The same consideration to that of the NIF can be made regarding the address. The
claimant, both in the claim filed with the Agency and in the

police report, provided as address ***ADDRESS.2. However, in
the contractual document with reference XXX that the respondent has provided,
As in the invoices provided, the address is the
***ADDRESS 1.

It is equally noteworthy that bank debit documents
into account that the claimant has contributed relate to an account of her
ownership identified with the reference ***ACCOUNT.1. This data appears
also in the complaint that the affected person filed with the Police in which
affirmed that several invoices had been charged to that account that
they don't belong to you. Well, in the copy of the contract provided by FLIP
ENERGY the bank data for the direct debit refers to another account in
that same entity: ***ACCOUNT.2.

The respondent provides a copy of the following invoices issued to

-
A.A.A name:

Reference XXXSE01, dated 06/23/2018, for an amount of 5.24

Reference XXXSE02, of 06/30/2018, of 28.42 euros
Reference XXXSE03, dated 07/26/2018, negative amount, -16.13

Reference XXXSE04, dated 07/24/2018, for an amount of 17.68 euros.
In the invoices that provide the only address of supply and CUPS that appears
is the aforementioned ***ADDRESS.2 and the CUPS number ***CUPS.1.

THIRD: Dated 04/01/2019
the Director of the AEPD agrees to initiate
sanctioning procedure to the one claimed for the presumed infraction of article 6.1.a)
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5. a) of the RGPD.

FOURTH: The respondent presented arguments to the initial agreement that had
entry into the AEPD on 04/07/2019 in which he requested that the AEPD proceed to the
file of the sanctioning procedure that concerns us because the data of the
claimant were not processed by it or included in its files.

 Affirms that the treatment of the data of the claimant that constitutes the object
of this sanctioning file was not the consequence of a negligent action by
its part, but rather it was the consequence of an error made by BBVA.

         In support of his claim he makes these statements:

- That there has been an error in the facts object of the claim since the
claimant, Mrs. A.A.A., holder of NIF ***DNI.1
 and domicile in
***ADDRESS.2 and account number in the BBVA entity ***ACCOUNT.1 is not
client of FLIP or The Phone House and that although it was this lady who
received receipts from ALTERNA in his bank account, this was “due to the
error and the internal redirection operated by the banking entity BBVA”

- That the person who contracted the services with her was Mrs. A.A.A., with NIF ***DNI.2 and
address at ***ADDRESS.1. That this person, who is your client, came in
date 06/04/2018 to The Phone House store and signed a contract of
electric power with AC.

-

The respondent provides proof of what has been stated, the copy of the contract that the
aforementioned lady subscribed with her through The Phone House store as well
like a copy of your ID. From the examination of this identification document,
notes the obvious similarity between the signature of the DNI and that of the contract concluded
with the claimed The contract contains the transcribed client data plus
above as well as your bank details for direct debit at the BBVA entity
of payment of bills. The account ***ACCOUNT.2.

- Adds the claim that on 05/25/2018 signed with The Phone House
the corresponding data access contract -document from which you provide
copy- in which the former occupies the position of data controller and
the second in charge of treatment.

- That as a result of the development of the contractual relationship between ALTERNA and its
client issued two invoices on dates 06/29/2018; 07/12/2018 and 07/27/2018
against the bank account of your client, account ***ACCOUNT.2, whose data
contained in the contract and of which this Agency was informed in the writing of
response to the information request (E/05681/2018)

- He adds that he turned the receipts for the collection of the invoices against the account of his
client and that in no case could he turn them against the account of the claimant
because such data does not appear in their files since the claimant is not a client
Yours has not been.

- In short, concludes the claimed entity, it has a client with the same
name and two surnames as the claimant and both have a bank account in
the BBVA entity; has proven that she turned the receipts correctly, against
your client's account and not against the claimant's account, so the
facts about which the claim is based are the result of an error by BBVA,
who is liable administrative sanction but not to
ALTERNATE who has acted with the utmost diligence and has carried out all
the precise internal procedures to make the charges that proceed to their
client and not the claimant.

Provide a copy of the following documents:

document similar to the latter except that it includes “EUR”>17.68”
and in the final reference, it appears “(XXXSE04)”. these references
identify the invoices issued by the claimed party.

 
FIFTH: On 11/19/2019 a trial period is opened in which it is agreed

A.A.A. and its attached documentation as well as the documents obtained and generated
by the Inspection Services before FLIP ENERGIA S.L. Documents that make up the
file E/05681/2018.

Consider reproduced for the purpose of evidence the allegations of the initial agreement
PS/00423/2018 presented by the respondent and the documentation that they
accompanies.

It is agreed to request Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA) these

evidentiary proceedings:

1. To provide the Agency with a copy of the supporting documentation of the order of
direct debit that, allegedly, received from FLIP ENERGÍA, S.L., to carry out the
charges to your customer's account.

2. To explain what was due to the fact that, despite the fact that FLIP ENERGÍA, S.A., accredits
which was recorded in the order sent to that financial entity, so that it could carry out the
debit, the bank account of its client, BBVA "redirected" the debits against the
account of a third person (who is not a client of FLIP ENERGÍA) whose name and
surnames coincide with those of the client but that it was a different person, such as
Your ID number proves it.

BBVA was granted a period of ten business days to complete the process of
test, a term that ended on 12/03/2019 without a response from that
entity.

SIXTH: Law 39/2015 of Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP) provides in its article 89, under the rubric
"Proposal for a resolution in sanctioning procedures":

       “The investigating body will resolve the completion of the procedure, with a file of the

of treatment.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them those of "lawfulness, loyalty and
transparency". The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/11

Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party;”

Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the

assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

  "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

conditions:

(…)”

The infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD is typified in article 83
of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of fines
administrative”, says:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

For its part, Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and
Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the rubric
"Infringements considered very serious" provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

  (…)
b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file shows that the invoices
issued by ALTERNA that were charged against the bank account of the
claimant correspond to the contract that A.A.A., with NIF ***DNI.2 (NIF that does not
coincides with that of the claimant) and domicile in Madrid, ***ADDRESS.1, which is
also the address of the point of supply according to the documentation that is

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/11

has (and that is different from the address provided by the claimant, ***ADDRESS.2)
they had held through their treatment manager, The Phone House.

In this regard, the file contains a copy of the contract entered into between
ALTERNA and its client in which their personal data is recorded: A.A.A., holder of the NIF
***DNI.2 and address at ***ADDRESS.1. This contract is signed and the signature
coincides with the one that appears on the copy of the DNI of the owner of the supply point.
Likewise, the contract provided by the claimed entity includes the account
bank account of the receipts provided by your client, ***ACCOUNT.2.
Current account that, although it belongs to the BBVA entity like the account of the
claimant against whom the invoices were drawn, ***ACCOUNT.1, differs absolutely
her.

It follows from the preceding statement that ALTERNA was legitimate, under
of article 6.1.b, of the RGPD for the treatment of the personal data of your client,
the holder of the NIF ***DNI.2.

As regards the treatment of the personal data of the complainant -which is
the object of the sanctioning file that concerns us- the documentation that the entity
claimed has provided us, shows, on the one hand, that in the
documents of "Debit by direct debits" with the anagram of BBVA that received the
The claimant includes, among other information, the following: in the “concept” section,
consists of "Alternate electricity bill for ***ADDRESS.1", and the indication
SH20180604 095SE04.

On the other hand, that the account debit orders issued with respect to the
invoices drawn against the claimant's account were issued by that entity
-ordering the payment- against the account of its client and not against the account of the
claimant.

In this sense, as stated by the respondent in her arguments, in no case
was able to turn them against the claimant's account because such information does not appear in her
files because the claimant is neither his client nor has he been.

As indicated in the Proven Facts, the respondent has provided captures of
screen that he affirms correspond to the receipts of the debit orders that
sent to BBVA.
 

These documents deal with debit orders for the months of June and
July 2018. They identify the entity ordering the charges (the defendant)
by name and NIF; the date of the charges; the amount (5.24 euros and 17.68
euros) the name and two surnames of your client; your client's bank account - in
none of the documents shows the claimant's bank account- and the indication
“Alternate electricity bill for ***ADDRESS.1”. In one of the documents
(XXXSE01) and in another the indication “(XXXSE04).

In short, the documentation provided by ALTERNA in its discharge
constitutes a reasonable and solid indication that, as she has maintained, she was not the
responsible for processing the personal data of the claimant specified in
having issued against your bank account invoices linked to the contract of a third party

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/11

person whose name and two surnames coincide with those of the claimant but not their
NIF nor their address and that they have in common that their respective checking accounts
They belong to the financial entity BBVA.

Let us remember that the RGPD article 4.7 RGPD defines the “responsible for the
treatment” or “responsible” as “the natural or legal person, public authority,
service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the ends and means of the
treatment; if the law of the Union or of the Member States determines the purposes and
means of treatment, the person responsible for the treatment or the specific criteria for
their appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the States
members".

In light of the documentation available, it is not proven that the
claimed had carried out any treatment of the personal data of the
claimant.

In order to verify the veracity of the documentation that the
claimed contributed to this Agency and if, as stated, the treatment of the
data of the claimant that constitutes the object of the sanctioning procedure was
consequence of an error in which BBVA would have incurred, in the testing phase
carried out evidentiary proceedings before BBVA in which they were asked to send
a copy of the debit order you received from ALTERNA to pass
to the collection of two invoices in your client's account (***ACCOUNT.2). BBVA did not respond to
the requested tests.

At this point, it should be noted that the LPACAP provides in its article 89
that "The investigating body will resolve the completion of the procedure, with a file of the
actions, without it being necessary to formulate the resolution proposal,
when in the instruction of the procedure it is made clear that there is
any of the following circumstances:

a) The non-existence of the facts that could constitute the infraction.
b) When the facts are not proven.
c) When the proven facts do not constitute, in a manifest way, an infringement

administrative.

d) When it does not exist or it has not been possible to identify the person or persons

liable or appear exempt from liability.

e) When it is concluded, at any time, that the infraction has prescribed.

         This is how things are, since the documentation provided by the entity claimed
constitutes a solid indication that she was not the subject responsible for the treatment of
the personal data of the claimant in which the infringement of the article materialized
6.1 of the RGPD that was attributed to it in the agreement to start the sanctioning file
that concerns us, under article 89 of the LPACAP, it is appropriate to agree on the file of the
record taking into account that the facts that could constitute a
violation of the RGPD are not attributable to the claimed one that, according to all the
indications, would be exempt from liability.

               The foregoing consideration is not an obstacle for this Agency, insofar as the
infringement has not prescribed, carry out investigative actions aimed at identifying the
