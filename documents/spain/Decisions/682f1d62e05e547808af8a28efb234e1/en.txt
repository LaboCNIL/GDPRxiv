In sanctioning procedure PS/00196/2020, instructed by the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, to the entity DERDIX 5000 SL, with CIF.: B66773599, (in
hereinafter, "the claimed entity"), by virtue of a complaint filed by, Ms. A.A.A. Y
Ms. B.B.B., (hereinafter, "the claimants") and based on the following:
 

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 10/17/19, you entered this Agency in writing, submitted by
the claimants, in which, among others, it indicated:

“That dated ***DATE.1 in the publication number ***NUMBER.1 of your magazine
***MAGAZINE.1, on page ***PAGE.1 the activity ***ACTIVI-
DAD.1 (with photo and text of activity that was also plagiarized). This activity is

we have given any consent for the publication of the same. We have
contacted four times with different workers of this publication
requesting information in this regard, that they seek advice on the rights of
minors whose photos they publish, but from this magazine they assure us in a rude way
and arrogant that they have obtained the photo from the internet, that this is the usual procedure and
They do not have to assume any responsibility in this fact. A copy is attached
of the journal page where the denounced publication appears.

SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant, the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out actions for its clarification, under the investigative powers
tion granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD). A) Yes,
dated 11/06/19, an information request is addressed to the entity SIERRA MOLE-
RO S.L., entity advertised by the image of the girls and on 11/08/19 to the entity KIO-
SKO Y MAS MANAGEMENT COMPANY OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM S.L, publi-
cation denounced by the publication of the photograph.

THIRD: On 12/30/19, the entity SIERRA MOLERO S.L, sends this
Agency, written, in which it informs, among others, of the following:

"One of the mothers who made the claim, worked in the Encanto del Valle del
Lozoya from 2015 to 09/10/18. Among other tasks, he was in charge of the
promotion of the ***ACTIVITY.1 Experience, which we carried out in the Encanto del
Valley (Lozoya Choker). Until that date, apart from the employment relationship, we were united
a relationship of friendship and between both we develop and promote the activity.
During that time there was consent on the part of the claimants for the
publication of the photo referred to and was used voluntarily by the
own mother for the promotion of the activity while working on the Enchantment of the
Valley. Below, we attach photos that show evidence of consent

for the diffusion of the photo for the activity in El Encanto del Valle. We don't know the
reason why the journal has made the publication referred to in
the claim. We received the news of the publication on 07/24/19 at
through a WhatsApp of an acquaintance who sees the magazine. Attached screenshots
showing our surprise at the publication.
  
A few days later, the claimant received news of the publication and asked us
she. We inform you of our ignorance and surprise. The magazine was not put on
contact us at any time and of course if you had known,
obviously we would not have used that image, just as we have not published
no other pictures of the girls since the mother doesn't work with us.
 
The mother asks us at that time to remove the photo from our website (which is
originally hung up at the launch of the activity in the Encanto del Valle to have its
authorization as has been seen in the screenshots shown above). Y
as soon as we could the photo has been removed as can be seen in our
web, because as we have already indicated we have no interest in using it. They can
verify the non-existence of the photos on our website: ***URL.1, but the two mothers,
To this day, they continue to share the photo on their social networks.
 
We are not clear where the magazine took the information from. It cannot be assured that
the magazine will take the photo of the Encanto del Valle website since since the claimant
began to carry out the activity in Aravaca, its publications on social networks have
been wrong and very confusing, so much so that at the time customers called us and
they did not know where the activity was taking place, whether in El Encanto or in Aravaca (one of the
places where the claimant currently carries out the activity). In the Enchantment of the Valley
we were unaware of the publication of the article in the magazine in which the photo is used

others more innovative and renewed that we currently use in our networks.

Both claimants were aware of the use that was being made of the image and
they approved it as it is demonstrated in the captures provided where they
They share and promote the activity in El Encanto. To avoid any
type of misunderstanding in the future we have eliminated the photo object of the claim in
our website, as we have no interest in using photography”.

FOURTH: On 12/05/19, the entity KIOSKO Y MÁS S.L., sends a letter to this
Agency, in which, among others, it indicates:

“KIOSKO Y MÁS is an entity dedicated to the distribution and marketing to the public
content through a digital service, such as online newspapers or magazines.

An Internet search has been carried out on the entity that owns said journal, with
in order to verify if with the company name something could be found in the systems
more from KIOSKO AND MORE. In this way, on the website of the Official Property BO
intellectual property, it has been found that the journal in question is owned by the publishing entity
DERDIX 5000, S.L.“, with which KIOSKO Y MÁS does not have and has not had any relationship.

With all of the above, we understand that the claim made by the Interested Parties
against KIOSKO Y MÁS, is due to an error in them when associating the review
ta “*** REVISTA.1" with KIOSKO Y MÁS, for having a partial coincidence in the name
name and probably because when entering certain keywords in Internet search engines,

It has been verified that at no time has any communication been received from the
themselves, so it is understood that the Interested Parties contacted the entity

FIFTH: In view of the facts exposed, the Subdirectorate General for Inspection
of Data proceeded to carry out actions for its clarification, under the protection of the
investigation rights granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the.
Thus, on 12/17/19 and 04/14/20, two requests are addressed to DERDIX 5000
SL.

SIXTH: On 06/12/20, the entity DERDIX 5000 SL., presents a written allegation
tions in this Agency, in which, among others, it indicates:

"1. The photograph referred to in the request was indeed published in the

In short, said in journalistic language, it is not a question of a "stolen" image but of
an authentic "posed" made for the web of a service activity, which is
unthinkable that it has been carried out without the consent of the holders of the

communication that I represent. Especially if you take into account that other images of
the same girls have been spread on the internet and social networks, as I credit with
the impressions of the sites that I attach, grouped, as doc. No. 4”.

SEVENTH: On 08/11/20, the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the claimed entity, by virtue of
the established powers, for failing to comply with the provisions of article 6.1 of the RGPD, sanctions
tionable in accordance with the provisions of art. 83 of the aforementioned RGPD, with an initial sanction
of 2,000 euros.

EIGHTH: Notified of the initiation agreement, the claimed entity has not submitted any
any pleadings written in this Agency, in the period of time granted to the
effect.
