Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character

Article 5.1 c) of the GDPR

Since the use of WhatsApp is common for communication and sending
documents or images of documents, it must be taken into account to whom they are sent
WhatsApp messages when personal data is included in said messages,
given that if these personal data do not belong to the person who sends the message or the
recipient of the message, there must be a justification for sending to third parties
personal data by WhatsApp.

The GDPR establishes in article 5 the principles related to data processing
Personalities that need to be considered:

“The personal data will be:

(…)

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization")

This article enshrines the principle of data minimization in the treatment of
personal information. It assumes that said treatment is adjusted and proportional to the
purpose to which it is directed, and the processing of excessive data must be restricted
or proceed to the deletion of these.

Regarding the need to process personal data, it can be said that
any data processing implies per se and starting, the restriction of the right
essential, when the collection and disposal of these by the person in charge takes place
who will work with them.

According to jurisprudence, due to the affectation that the processing of personal data
supposes for a series of fundamental rights, the limitation of the right
fundamental to the protection of personal data must be strictly necessary.

This implies that, if the achievement of the intended purposes can be carried out without
processing of personal data, this route will be preferable and it will mean that it is not
necessary to carry out any data processing, which will mean that such right,
With the limitations that it entails, it would not be in contention, since there are no data. The collection,
storage and use constitutes per se a limitation of the right of protection of
data that must comply with the regulations. This therefore requires first of all analyzing and

ensure that data collection is necessary for the stated purpose or
intended and that it is proportional.
 
In the specific case under review, compliance with the principle of minimization
would require identifying the specific data that must be communicated according to the
purpose, as well as limiting them to those strictly necessary for their adequate
communication via WhatsApp. Therefore, in relation to the minimization and necessity
of the treatment, there are less harmful alternatives for the protection of personal data.

Consequently, it is considered that the accredited facts are constitutive of
infringement, attributable to the claimed party, due to violation of article 5.1.c) of the
GDPR.
