In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 of the RGPD, it consists
carrying out personal data processing, whenever EVERIS performs, in-
among other treatments, the collection, conservation, use and dissemination of the following
personal data of insured natural persons, such as: identification data,
data of the subscribed policies, bank details…etc.

EVERIS carries out this activity in its capacity as data processor, given that
is the person who processes personal data on behalf of the data controller, by virtue of
of the aforementioned article 4.8 of the RGPD.

EVERYS is a provider of technological infrastructure management services for
REIAL AUTOMÒBIL CLUB DE CATALUNYA (hereinafter, RACC), a company provided-
assistance services on behalf of GACM SEGUROS GENERALES, COMPA-
ÑÍA DE SEGUROS Y REASEGUROS S.A.U. (GACM) as reinsurance entity of
attendance.

Article 4 section 12 of the RGPD defines, in a broad way, the "violations of se-
security of personal data” (hereinafter security breach) as “all
those breaches of security that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
accidental or illicit of personal data transmitted, conserved or processed in another
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

In the present case, there is a security breach of personal data in the cir-
circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality, by
having published in different forums the sale of the users of a security company
guros dedicated to the automobile sector, as well as records with personal information
of Spanish clients of the insurance company ZURICH INSURANCE PLC SUCUR-
SALT IN SPAIN.

It should be noted that receiving a complaint about a security breach
does not imply the imposition of a sanction directly, since it is necessary to analyze
the diligence of those responsible and in charge and the security measures applied.

The security of personal data is regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the
RGPD, which regulate both the security of the treatment, the notification of a violation
of the security of personal data to the control authority, as well as the
communication to the interested party, respectively.
