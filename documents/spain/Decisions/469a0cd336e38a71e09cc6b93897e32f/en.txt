prior with them.

Attached to the claim is a response from Equifax and Experian to the right to
access exercised by the claimant dated September 16, 2019, where it is stated
in the history of consultations, of the last six months, that the entity BBVA made a
consultation dated September 6, 2019.

SECOND: In view of the facts denounced in the claim and the
documents provided by the claimant and the facts and documents of which he has
had knowledge of this Agency, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection
proceeded to carry out preliminary investigation actions for the
clarification of the facts in question, by virtue of the investigative powers
granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), and
in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

As a result of the research actions carried out, it is confirmed

that the data controller is BBVA.

In addition, the following extremes are noted:

On November 26, 2019, BBVA states that the events that have

grounds for this claim are:

1.- “On January 30, 2019 BBVA sent to the AEPD the communication that on 29
January 2019, the entity sent the claimant in writing informing him, among
other things, that on February 19, 1998 you signed a Loan policy with
Argentaria, currently BBVA, and on February 12, 1993 a contract of
Preciados Galleries Card in which you intervene as a Person
Authorized”. This writing is provided.

2.- Since the claimant did not agree with the contracts
cited, requested information and documentation in this regard. The Customer Service

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

3/13

BBVA customer, told him that they were looking for the loan agreement, that
until that moment it had not been located, and as for the card contract
Galerías Preciados, where the claimant appeared as authorized and not as owner, the
Customer Service asked him to facilitate his representation in order to
respond to your claim. This document is attached.

3.- In addition, before the claim filed by the claimant before the Bank of
Spain. BBVA, presented a brief of allegations proving that it no longer appeared as
person authorized in the card contract and blocking the personal data of the
claimant. These writings are provided.

4.- In relation to the claim filed with the AEPD, they state that the
On September 27, 1999, the loan contract was canceled and on September 18
of 2019, the Galerías Preciados Card contract was cancelled, since the claimant did not
acknowledged having any relationship with this last contract.

5.- They add that, “after analyzing the specific case, it has been proven that on the 6th of
September 2019 BBVA consulted the personal data of the claimant in the
asset and credit solvency information files in order to guarantee the
better resolution of the claims presented to the Entity by the claimant.

Consequently, given that until September 18, 2019 the claimant
maintained a contractual relationship with BBVA, the consultation of the information files
capital and credit solvency was carried out within the operating margins
usual contractual, and within and within the strictest legality in force”.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

         Article 58 of the RGPD, “Powers of Attorney”, says:

                 “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers
corrections listed below:

(…)

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

(...)

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period.

(…)

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular

(…)”

III

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "lawfulness, loyalty and
transparency". The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:

a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the

interested party (<<legality, loyalty and transparency>>);”

          Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/13

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

The infraction for which the claimed entity is held responsible is
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

IV

The documentation in the file offers evidence that BBVA,

violated article 6.1 of the RGPD.

Likewise, article 20 of the LOPDGDD, provides in its section e) "that the
Data referring to a specific debtor can only be consulted when
who consults the system maintains a contractual relationship with the affected party that
implies the payment of a pecuniary amount or this would have requested the celebration
of a contract that involves financing, deferred payment or periodic billing as
occurs, among other cases, in those provided for in the legislation of contracts of
consumer credit and real estate credit contracts.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, in order to consult the data it is necessary to
that the interested party has contracted or requested the contract, which is not the case.
It appears in the file that the claimant intervenes as a Person
Authorized; and in this sense does not sign any contract with the entity.

 

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it is questionable

the diligence used by BBVA.

The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court, in
assumptions such as the one presented here, has considered that when the owner of the
data denies the hiring, the burden of proof corresponds to those who affirm their
existence, and the third-party data controller must collect and
keep the necessary documentation to prove the consent of the holder.
We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Basis of Law
Fourth.

However, and this is essential, BBVA does not accredit the legitimacy for the

treatment of the claimant's data.

Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of the fundamental right
of protection of personal data requires that it be accredited that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. Failure to act in this way -and this Agency, who is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

          In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

                 “Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

         “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
applied under articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;

  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
or indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

          "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of data processing

personal.

c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission of

the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the

infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) Affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person in charge or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between them and any interested party.”

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to be imposed
in the present case, the party claimed is considered responsible for an infringement
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, concurrent
the following factors.

As aggravating the following:

-

The intentionality or negligence in the infringement (article 83.2 b).

Basic personal identifiers (name, surname, NIF) are affected

-
(article 83.2 g).

This is why it is considered appropriate to adjust the sanction to be imposed on the person claimed and

set it at the amount of €30,000 for the infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD.
