of the products that appear on the web and information about it has been requested in
several times, by email (both to the address provided for
commercial, such as the address provided for the purpose of addressing the rights of
protection of data of its clients), as well as by postal mail, but it has not been
got an answer about it. In this regard, the defendant has collected a
of postal notifications addressed to the postal address of "XXXXXXXXXXXX".

Therefore, when verifying that the privacy policy of the website ***URL.1 does not
collects all the information required in article 13 of the GDPR, and not having obtained
any response from the owner of said website that justifies such deficiency, this

opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
