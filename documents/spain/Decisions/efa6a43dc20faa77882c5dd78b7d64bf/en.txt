email message sent from atencionherederos@bbva.com, addressed
to the email address of two third parties (interested in the
probate file), sending said entity certificates and statements of

Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), by means of electronic notification,
were collected on April 8, 2022, as stated in the acknowledgments of receipt
that are in the file.

On May 24, 2022, this Agency received a written response
indicating that “…The incident that has given rise to the request for information to which
response is being given is due to the fact that in the processing of the
testamentary no. 20027251, corresponding to the deceased C.C.C., Mrs. A.A.A.
claimant and heir, requested on 07/28/2020 from BBVA a certificate that accredited
where the amount that existed in an investment fund was deposited
signed by the deceased in February 1993.
The BBVA probate processing department sent, on 08/27/2020,
the nominative certificates and position statements of 28 investment funds, among which
which, by mistake, found 9 funds in which the deceased was listed
solely as authorized...
The incident that causes this claim is due to the fact that the Entity committed the
mistake of providing Mr. D.D.D., grandson of the deceased and representative of his father D.
E.E.E., the statement of position of 9 investment funds where the originator was listed
as authorized but not as owner. Of the 9 referred funds; 6 are owned by the

In said file and between 06/26/2020 and 03/28/2022, they have been exchanged, between
BBVA and the heirs, a total of 4,803 emails. Therefore, in the case of
a very voluminous file that has given rise to a mistake in the sending of
one of multiple communications.
Due to the age of the information requested, transfers and movements of a
fund subscribed in 1993, BBVA carried out a search based on the DNI number of the
originator, which caused by mistake certificates of all the funds in
for which their DNI was reported, both in their capacity as owner and as authorized.
Said information was sent by email to Mrs. A.A.A. and his nephew
Mr. D.D.D. (representative of his father D.E.E.E.) …”.

BBVA informs this Agency that the facts reported refer to an error

offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the assessment of the degree of
