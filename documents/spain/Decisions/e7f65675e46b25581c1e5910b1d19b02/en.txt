in ***ADDRESS.1 with ***ADDRESS.2, there being indications of a possible breach
compliance with the provisions of the data protection regulations.

The reasons that support the claim and, where appropriate, the documents provided
by the claimant are the following:

"The establishment (...) has installed two (2) video surveillance cameras not se-
marked on the side façade (*** DIRECTION.2) and on the main façade (*** DIREC-
TION.1).

These unmarked cameras excessively and unnecessarily capture both lanes
public, the transit of people and vehicles, as well as facades of third parties with a
front or side frame.

The building has a single access in ***ADDRESS.1, which leads to a large
private entrance hall that allows the installation of video surveillance equipment
without the need to frame and record the street.

The camera at ***ADDRESS.2 does not protect any entrance and records access to said
street in all its width as well as the perpendicular intersection with ***ADDRESS.1 to
complete.

The framing and viewing angle of the camera in ***DIRECTION.1 (75º-130º depending on mo-
delo) allows the recording of the entire street from a certain distance from the point of origin.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation-
General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), recognizes each Authori-
Control Authority, and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures processed by the
Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of the Regulations
to (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, on a subsidiary basis, by
the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a personal data.
and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2 of the
GDPR defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the reported video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the treatment to be considered lawful.

For its part, article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, regarding the principles of treatment, provides

yield to the suppression of these.

The relevance in the processing of the data must occur both in the field of
collection of the data as well as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out on them.

Article 13, sections 1 and 2, of the RGPD, establishes the information that must be provided
to the interested party at the time of collecting their data. In the case of treatments
of personal data for surveillance purposes through camera systems or video-
cameras, the duty of information can be fulfilled by placing, in the areas
video-surveillance, of an informative badge located in a sufficiently visible place
ble, both in open and closed spaces, and using forms in which
The information provided is detailed, which the person in charge must make available to
the interested.

The content and design of the informative badge must comply with the provisions of article
ass 22.4 of the LOPDGDD.

On the other hand, in accordance with the provisions of article 22 of the LOPDGDD, referred to
specifically to "Processing for video surveillance purposes", the processing of
images in public places can only be made -if applicable and prior compliance-
compliance with the legally enforceable requirements-, by the Security Forces and Bodies
unless the exception established in the aforementioned article 22 of the LO-
PDGDD for natural or legal persons, public or private, respecting the con-
conditions required in said article.

In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a system

- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a private security company that meets the requirements contemplated
two in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.

- The video cameras will not be able to capture images of people who are
outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since
the treatment of images in public places can only be carried out, unless
Government authorization concurs, by the Security Forces and Bodies. Either
spaces owned by third parties may be captured or recorded without the consent of
their owners, or, where appropriate, of the people who are in them.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection
of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or inside,
it may be necessary to guarantee the security purpose the recording of a por-
tion of the public road. That is, cameras and video cameras installed for the purpose of
security will not be able to obtain images of public roads unless it is essential

In relation to the above, to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the Agencia Es-

the Guide on the use of video cameras for security and other purposes, as well as the
Guide for compliance with the duty to inform (both available in the section
“Guides and tools”).

It is also of interest, in the event of carrying out low-risk data processing, the
facilitates free tool (in the “Guides and tools” section), which through
specific questions, allows to assess the situation of the person in charge with respect to the
treatment of personal data that it carries out, and where appropriate, generate various do-
documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with measures of
guideline security considered minimum.

v

The claim is based on the presumed illegality of the installation by the claimed
of a video surveillance system, made up of two cameras located on the facades
main and side walls of the property located at ***ADDRESS.1 with ***ADDRESS.2, which
could disproportionately capture images of public areas.

In addition, the claimant warns that the reviewed property does not have a sign in the
that the presence of the cameras and the identity of the person responsible be reported
of the processing of the data, so that the interested persons can exercise the
rights provided for in arts. 15 to 22 of the GDPR.

As proof of these statements, the claimant provided the evidence indicated-
given in the “Facts” section, first point, of this agreement.

Thus, in the photographic images it is observed that the street camera ***DIREC-
CION.1, due to its orientation, could be capable of capturing beyond access to
building and the minimum of sidewalk adjacent to the perimeter. In the same way, the camera
of ***ADDRESS.2 could capture a substantial portion of the pedestrian street exceeding
giving the minimum adjacent to the perimeter. There is no informative sign in this regard
indicating that it is a video-monitored area.

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
These, as a control authority, are established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among them
are the power to issue a warning -article 58.2 b)-, the power to
impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD -article 58.2 i)-,
or the power to order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations
ns of treatment comply with the provisions of the RGPD, where appropriate, of a
certain manner and within a specified period -article 58. 2 d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine.
treat.

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the RGPD, the aforementioned Regulation provides
ne in your art. 58.2 b) the possibility of a warning, in relation to what is indicated
in Recital 148:

“In the event of a minor infraction, or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute
be a disproportionate burden on a natural person, rather than sanction by
fine, a warning may be imposed. However, special attention must be paid
attention to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction, to its intentional nature
to the measures taken to mitigate the damages suffered, to the degree of res-
responsibility or any relevant prior violation, to the manner in which the authority
of control has been aware of the infraction, to the fulfillment of or-
sentenced against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of conduct and
any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

In the present case, it has been taken into account, in particular, that it is a small
company and that there is no recidivism, because there is no record of the commission of more than
an offense of the same nature.

For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is a warning.
in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in relation to
what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.

All this without prejudice to proving compliance with the necessary measures
to prove the legality of the system in the terms set forth, for which it may
make use of the means of evidence necessary for such purposes.

It is noted that not meeting the requirements of this body may be considered
classified as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, typified
as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the opening
