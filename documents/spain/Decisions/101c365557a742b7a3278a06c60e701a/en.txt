FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the consent
treatment under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

  The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in particular, the
following:

(…)
b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

In relation to his allegations that he is not Responsible for the treatment and not even
is a data processor, it must be stated that Royal Decree-Law 3/2020,
of February 4, of urgent measures by which they are incorporated into the legal
various Spanish legal directives of the European Union in the field of
public procurement in certain sectors; private insurance; of plans and
Pension funds; of the tax field and tax litigation, establishes in its article
203 the Condition of responsible or in charge of the treatment.

1. For the purposes provided in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, as well as in
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27
of 2016, relative to the protection of natural persons with regard to
treatment of personal data and the free circulation of these data: a) The agents
insurance and bancassurance operators will have the status of managers
of the treatment of the insurance company with which they had celebrated the
corresponding agency contract, under the terms provided in title I. b) The
insurance brokers and reinsurance brokers will have the status of
responsible for the treatment with respect to the data of the people who come to
they. c) The external collaborators referred to in article 137 will have the
condition of in charge of the treatment of insurance agents or brokers with
those who have entered into the corresponding commercial contract. In this case, just
may process the data for the purposes set forth in article 137.1. 2. In the event
provided for in letter a) of section 1, the agency contract must make
include the ends provided for in article 28.3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27, 2016. Similarly, in the
course provided for in section 1.c) must be included in the commercial contract
entered into with external collaborators the ends provided for in article 28.3
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27
of 2016. 3. The insurance companies may not keep the data that

provided by insurance brokers, and that do not result in the conclusion of a contract
insurance, being obliged to eliminate them unless there is another legal basis that
allows legitimate data processing in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27, 2016.

Therefore, the collaborator acts before the interested party as the person in charge of the
treatment of the client company.

In the case examined, the regulations set forth and the statements
carried out by the claimed party, it can be inferred that the latter acts as the person in charge of the
treatment of entities Hubside Iberica, S.L. Sfam Iberica Servicios, S.L and
Cyrana Spain General SL

In article 4.8, the person in charge of the treatment is defined as the natural person or
legal entity, public authority, service or other body that processes personal data for
account of the data controller.

All processing of personal data carried out by a person in charge must be governed by a
contract or other legal act in accordance with the Law of the Union or of the States
members concluded between the person in charge and the person in charge, as stipulated in the
Article 28, paragraph 3, of the GDPR.

In this regard, Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of "responsible for the
treatment” and “processor” in the RGPD, adopted by the CEPD, on 7
July 2021, detail the following:

“Although the elements provided for in Article 28 of the Regulation constitute its
essential content, the contract must serve so that the person in charge and the person in charge
clarify, by means of detailed instructions, how these will be applied in practice.
fundamental elements. Therefore, the treatment contract should not be limited to
reproduce the provisions of the RGPD, but must include more information
specific and concrete on how the requirements will be met and the degree of
security that will be required for the treatment of the personal data object of the
treatment contract. Far from being a merely formal exercise, the negotiation and
stipulation of the contract conditions serve to specify the details of the
treatment."

They add that “In general, the treatment contract establishes who is the party
determining (the data controller) and who, the party that follows the
instructions (the person in charge of the treatment). Now, “If one party decides in the
practice how and why personal data is processed, that party will be the
responsible for the treatment, even if the contract stipulates that it is the person in charge”

To determine the responsibility of the claimed party, it is necessary to take into account
that if a data processor infringes the Regulation in determining the purposes and
means of treatment, will be considered responsible for the treatment with respect to
such treatment (article 28, paragraph 10, of the RGPD).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

10/14

On the "Ends and means" the aforementioned guidelines include the following
considerations:
“(…)
Dictionaries define the word end as an "anticipated result that is pursued
or that guides the intended action" and the word means as the "way in which
achieves a result or achieves an objective”
(…)
Determining ends and means is equivalent to deciding, respectively, the
why and how of treatment: in a specific treatment operation, the
The data controller is the party that determines why the processing takes place.
treatment (i.e. “for what purpose” or “what for”) and how this objective will be achieved
(ie what means will be used to achieve it). A natural or legal person who
influences in this way in the treatment of personal data participates, therefore, in the
determination of the purposes and means of such treatment in accordance with the
definition provided for in article 4, point 7, of the RGPD.

The data controller must decide on both the purpose and the means
treatment, as described below. Consequently, you cannot
limit itself to determining the end: it must also make decisions about the means of the
treatment. In contrast, the party acting as processor can never determine
the end of treatment. In practice, if a data controller uses a
manager to carry out the treatment on behalf of the former, the manager
you will usually be able to make some of your own decisions about how to do it. The
CEPD recognizes that the person in charge of the treatment may enjoy a certain margin of
maneuver to make some treatment decisions. In this sense, it is
necessary to clarify what degree of influence on the "why" and "how" entails that
an entity is considered responsible for the treatment and to what extent can the
person in charge of the treatment make their own decisions.
(…)”
In this case, taking into account the above, it can be concluded that the
mere fact of using the contracting terminal of the Hubside Iberica entities,
SL Sfam Iberica Servicios, S.L and Cyrana España General SL does not exempt
responsibility to the claimed party. It has not proven that it acted following the
detailed instructions of those responsible, so it can be considered that
has acted as data controller, since it has decided for itself
treat the personal data of the complaining party in order to be given
registration in the services provided by them. It has also decided how to
treat them by determining the organizational means of this treatment, as there is no
proof that the contracting has been carried out following the instructions of the
responsible.

Thus, the party complained against violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it made the
treatment and transferred the personal data of the claimant without legitimacy for it
in order to register a mobile insurance, a gift card and a page of
domains or web creation not requested by the complaining party, without
accredited that he had contracted legitimately, had his consent
for the collection and subsequent processing of your personal data, or there is any
other cause that made the treatment carried out lawful.

28001 – Madrid

Consequently, it has processed the personal data of the party
claimant without having accredited that he has the legal authorization to do so.

Article 6.1 RGPD says that the treatment "will be lawful if it is necessary for the
performance of a contract to which the interested party is a party.

It was therefore essential that the respondent prove before this Agency that the
claimant had contracted any of the aforementioned services.

The complaining party proves that charges were made in his bank account for the
entities “Cyrana, Sfam and Hubside” to which the respondent gave her data.

Well, it is stated in the statements made to this Agency dated 5
August 2021 by Hubside Iberica, S.L., Sfam Iberica Servicios, S.L., and on August 9
November 2020 by Cyrana España General S.L. that on June 18, 2020, the
