III

In the present case, it is appropriate to analyze the alleged illegality of the installation,
of a video surveillance system composed of two cameras and located on the poles
access to the property of the respondent located at ***ADDRESS.1 ***LOCATION.2
(TO CORUÑA).

The facts proven in this sanctioning procedure show
manifest that the cameras installed in the access to the property located in paragraph
above disproportionately capture public roads. Regarding this issue, the
Article 22 of the LOPDGDD, regarding processing for video surveillance purposes,
provides that, in order to guarantee the safety of people and property, they may
capture images of public thoroughfares "to the extent that it is essential", in
correspondence with the principle of data minimization established in the article
5.1.c) of the GDPR.

Taking into account the foregoing, in the event that it is a question of guaranteeing the
security of an area of access to a property or its perimeter, the area of public roads
captured should be kept to a minimum. In the case subject to this proceeding
this means that, to guarantee the security of access to housing, the images
can reach a part or portion of the sidewalk at the minimum of the longitudinal axis
that corresponds to the access or perimeter, but it is not considered proportionate to capture or
the entire width of the sidewalk or the roadway. Extensive uptake would entail that
pedestrians and motorists are excessively affected their right to
protection of the physical image.

Expanding on this issue, it is reported that the ability to capture images
on public roads is attributed, in general, to the Police Forces and Corps
Security in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 4/1997, which
regulates the use of video cameras by the Security Forces and Bodies in
public places and their implementing regulations.

With regard to compliance with the duty of information contained in the
article 12 of the RGPD, article 13 of the same legal text provides the information that
must be provided when the personal data is obtained from the interested party,
situation that occurs in cases of image capture by a system of
video surveillance. In this sense, article 22.4 of the LOPGDD establishes that "The
duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
understood fulfilled by placing an informative device instead
sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information". Therefore, a poster that only informs about the existence of
a video-monitored area does not comply with the obligation to provide the minimum information,
must also include the identity of the person responsible and the possibility and manner of
exercise the rights recognized in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD; without impairment
that the rest of the information must also be kept available to those affected.
information stipulated by the RGPD.

Finally, it is reported that access to images by third parties
other than the data controller must be regulated by the existence of a
contract and that those systems that are connected to a receiving center
alarm system or a control center must comply with the provisions of Law 5/2014 of 4
April of Private Security and other applicable regulations.

It is not considered for the purposes of infringing the data protection regulations

the publication of the images in the social network account.

IV

In the present case, when deciding the appropriate sanction to impose,

In particular, the following elements have been taken into account.

 That it is an individual whose main activity is not linked to the

treatment of personal data.

 That there is no recidivism, because the commission is not recorded, in the term of

one year, of more than one infraction of the same nature.

For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is
WARNING, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1, for respective infractions of the
articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a sanction

You must prove the following:

 That it has proceeded to remove the cameras placed on the poles of the
access to the property or its reorientation by reducing the angle of

 That he has proceeded to complete the information offered on the poster
informative (it must be identified, at least, the existence of a treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights
provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD), locating this device in
conspicuous place.
