saturate the computing platform in a way that causes users to have
very difficult to obtain a free appointment with the administration and they are forced
to require their services.

By going to these places, users have been forced to provide their data
personal information, both in writing and by providing a copy of your documentation
identification, to the employees or people who offer this service so that, with
said data, they can book the appointment with the administration, since said
Appointments are nominal and it is not possible to appear at the documentation offices

perform the requested procedure.
