the one claimed in which you request:

“We are transferred through the unique authorized electronic address (DEHU) of the
administrative file of related procedures PS/00210/2021;

right, the name of the company from which the search is made, only 12 of
August 2021, also at the bottom of the computer you can see the date of

proposal.

-Although the previous letter indicated that the right of access of the
claimant, we have proceeded to review all emails managed
from the first day of the year 2019 to the date of this writing, without finding any

such an exercise, so he could not answer him, since in addition, only with the data of
name and surnames "he has not been able to identify him in his files with certainty", without
have more reference data to communicate, because in the transfer that is given from
the claim by the AEPD did not include more data, indicating that "As soon as

of registration, it will proceed to attend to the rights”.

-Considers that the claimant, having the correct addresses in which
exercise the right, which were deduced from that letter of 11/28/2019, it did not and has not
done. The AEPD also did not indicate the claimant's email address, and if from the
principle had there been "transfer of the full claim to the claimed one", it could
have fulfilled the request. The AEPD only moved screens of some emails
e-mails of the claimant in which the e-mail address does not appear,
pages 74 and 75.

-The notification of the resolution of the protection of rights is made electronically and
the AEPD had "certainty that it had not been received, it was not notified by post",
generating defenselessness, not having knowledge that he had to act as
stated in the resolution. The same refers to the agreement to start this
process. In addition, it considers that the telematic notification "does not appear
registered in the electronic folder of notifications of the claimed party, justifying it
with the screenshots of the electronic headquarters itself”, understanding that “by not
having received any communication, it was impossible to act accordingly and
Submit the corresponding statement of discharges.

-States that "the claimant's data was automatically deleted with
date 07/08/2019, by including the telephone number in the cancellation file
that those in charge of treatment send to the person in charge of the treatment
periodically”

The LOPGDD states in its article 71: "Acts and behaviors constitute infractions
referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this organic law.

Article 58.2 of the RGPD, indicates, among others, the following powers of the authority of
control:

exercise of the rights of the interested party under this Regulation;”

“i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"

The unfulfilled resolution of article 58.2 of the RGPD, is precisely the one that resolved
the legal guardianship TD/00320/2019 in which it was expressly indicated:

“ESTIMATE the claim made by … and urge AD735 DATA MEDIA

[…]”

“m) Failure to comply with the resolutions issued by the authority for the protection of
competent data in exercise of the powers conferred by article 58.2 of the

on the fulfillment of the resolution of protection of right.

Considers the claim that there is no accredited valid notification on the resolution
of the protection of rights resolved on 01/16/2020 that motivates the subsequent
breach of not meeting the requirement it contained, nor of the act of
requirement of 03/05/2020, which was sent to you as a reminder. Also, that the
agreement to initiate this procedure incurs the same defect.
 
 To prove these extremes, he provides the claimed searches that he made, on the date
03/21/2022:

"in the Service of Electronic Notifications and Electronic Address Enabled of
the FNMT-RCM
 ” not finding any notification of the indicated periods. Contribute

third from 03/06 to 03/31/2020 with “no results found”. the menu of
searches indicates that "from this option you can download the certification of a
notification/communication collected or rejected by the user” In the menu of
search and on the screen it does not appear from which direction the search is carried out.

-“notification screen”, this time from the DEHU, showing in the margin
right the name of the company of the claimed from which the search is made,
only from August 12, 2021, in notifications made with different states of
notification: accepted, expired and rejected, with “no results found for
the selected filters.

It should be mentioned that for all shipments taken into account electronically,
automatic availability and rejections are listed. Both of the resolution of the
guardianship as well as reminder of compliance, and procedures derived from and included in the
same:

-the resolution of the protection of rights resolved on 01/16/2020, made available:
01/21/2020 13:56:03, automatic rejection date: 02/01/2020.

-the letter of 03/05/2020 addressed to the respondent, on the status of compliance with the
resolved in guardianship, made available: 03/06/2020, date of automatic rejection:

If you agree to the notice on time, it will be available in your DEH for 90 days.

If the notice access period expires, the notice will remain in your DEH for

Expired applications through the General Access Point – Citizen Folder.”
But also, on the other hand, there were more notifications in the guardianship procedure
that if they appear sent and collected by the claimed:

- Thus, it appears after the electronic shipment has been made, it appears written notification of
departure date of 07/08/2019, the transfer of the claim to the claimed, although not
of its content, by postal mail, picking it up on 07/24/2019. Written to which he replied
the one claimed in writing on 11/28/2019 within the guardianship procedure.

 -It is also stated, for the same reason, that the claimant's brief was served
in the guardianship, to make the allegations, in the so-called process of
"responsible hearing", which contains the extremes of his complaint, in which
contained his address, e-mail, telephone, among other data, sent by post,
in writing dated 12/16/2019 received on 12/20/2019.

In both notifications that he did receive, he was told, reiterated and alluded to that
type of communication was exceptional, given the obligation to communicate in the
electronic modality with the literals: "Given that you have not accessed the aforementioned
notification, exceptionally and for information purposes we proceed to its referral by
postal mail, reminding you that, from now on, the notifications will be made
electronically pursuant to the LPACAP.”

Thus, if the requested party had the necessary elements to meet the
right, and there has been no violation of the right in the notifications or
defenseless, when he is obliged to interact electronically with the
Management.

It even now indicates that it canceled the claimant's data on "07/08/2019, by
the inclusion of the telephone number in the cancellation file that those in charge of
treatment send to the person in charge of the treatment periodically”, a fact that does not
stated in his allegations of guardianship, specifying then that it could not be
identified. The date referred to coincides with the submission of the claim.

Regarding the allegations of rolling back the file for not considering the response to the
evidence requested, it is estimated that defenselessness has not been caused, since the
facts proven after their contribution nor with the allegations made is derived
material defenselessness.
