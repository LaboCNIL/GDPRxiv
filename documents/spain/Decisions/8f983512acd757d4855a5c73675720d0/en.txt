control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate

Horizontal Property, indicates the assumptions in which the exposure of data of
personal nature related to matters arising from the management of the Community of
Owners. Its article 9. h) indicates as an obligation of the owner "Notify whoever

person by the neighbors who do not own the property, to be able to also include their
name and surnames in mailboxes, claimant to whom the quality of debtor is attributed,
may affect your honor. This note with the data as a means of information, in this
case does not comply with the LPH and violates the claimant's right to data protection,
