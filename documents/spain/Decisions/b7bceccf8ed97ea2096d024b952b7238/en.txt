N/REF: 0060/2021

The query refers to the request received by the National Commission for
Markets and Competition, from the Government Delegation
Against Gender Violence of the Secretariat for Equality and Against
Gender Violence of the Ministry of Equality, through which it is requested that
the mobile and fixed telephone numbers of a sample of
women to be able to carry out the European Survey on Violence by telephone
of Gender that is part of the current National Statistical Plan.

In this sense, the Ministry of Equality motivates its request in the
current pandemic scenario, stating that it would need, possibly,
carry out the surveys by telephone due to the material impossibility of
carry them out in person derived from circumstances such as
provincial and interprovincial travel limitations, the possible
refusal to enter homes or the need to guarantee distances
of security.

Likewise, the report of your Data Protection Delegate is attached
in which it exposes the main characteristics of the EEVG, the legal bases
that would support the communication of the data and collects a series of
aspects related to the security measures adopted.

Finally, the Ministry of Equality adds that the telephone interview
It will only be carried out if the pandemic makes it strictly necessary and if the
personal interview response rate is low, although it adds that the
phone numbers will also be used for interview encouragement
online or to make an appointment for the interview
face-to-face, clarifying that the telephone numbers of those
subscribers who have made use of their right of opposition to appear in the
phone listings.

This consultation raises, once again, the possible communication of
personal data to the telephone numbers of subscribers to the service

determined, in order that they be treated with a different purpose for

On this issue, which has been reiterated since the beginning of the
pandemic, this Agency has had the opportunity to speak out on numerous
occasions, establishing as a general principle, when assessing the
source of such communication, not the fact that the survey was
is included in the National Statistical Plan and is carried out
obligatory for the Administration, but that of voluntariness or compulsory
in the completion of the survey by those affected.

In this sense, in our last report, referring to a request from the
Center for Sociological Research, whose specific regulations include the
principle of voluntariness of the answers, this analysis is carefully analyzed
situation and the different pronouncements of this Agency are collected
according to the indicated criteria:

I

This Agency has had occasion to pronounce itself on repeated occasions
on the same object of the query raised again, in relation to the
communication to the CIS of the telephone numbers that are in possession
of the CNMC.

In this regard, it should be noted that, given the situation resulting from the
current situation caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and the
restrictions derived from the declaration of the state of alarm by the Real
Decree 463/2020, of March 14, and given the need expressed by the CIS
of having to replace household surveys and carry them out by telephone
to carry out its monthly Barometers and other specific surveys, this
Agency ruled in Report 31/2020, of April 7, regarding the possible
transfer to the CIS, by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of the
fixed and mobile phones of the population selected in the samples for
execute the functions attributed to the CIS, and in report 35/2020, of 27
April, regarding the communication by the CNMC to the CIS of landlines and
mobiles of the selected population in the nominative samples that are
prepared for the CIS by the INE, requesting, in both cases, a greater
information in order to determine the adequacy of such communications
of data to the regulations on protection of personal data.

Subsequently, and given the need expressed by this Agency for
adopt additional guarantees for the protection of the personal data of the
affected, and after a meeting with representatives of the CIS in order to
collaborate in the correct identification of said guarantees, a question was
new consultation collecting what was agreed at said meeting, in which
proposed the possible assignment to the CIS, by the National Commission of
Markets and Competition (CNMC) of telephone number listings by
province for the exclusive purpose of conducting pre-electoral surveys
Basque and Galician Among the additional guarantees, it was specified that said
telephone numbers would not be associated with any other identifying data,

referring exclusively to the corresponding province, and not
would include the numbers of those people who have made use of their
right of opposition to appear in the lists of telephones.

Said consultation was reported favorably by this Agency in the

Report 49/2020, which due to its importance, is transcribed below:

I

As this Agency has repeatedly pointed out in successive
reports issued during the state of alarm, said statement does not
implies the suspension of the fundamental right to data protection,
without prejudice to the fact that it may be affected as a consequence
of the causal event that has given rise to the declaration, foreseeing the
RGPD the appropriate channels that allow us to respond to the situation
of a health crisis, respecting the fundamental right to protection of
personal information. Therefore, any data processing
personal data that must be carried out as a consequence of the pandemic and
the declaration of the state of alarm must respect the right
fundamental to the protection of personal data, adjusting to the
provisions of the RGPD, which allows, as we have seen, to establish
specific rules regarding the exercise of said right, adjusted to the
GDPR itself, as well as the doctrine developed by the Court
Constitutional when interpreting article 18.4 of our Constitution,
particularly with regard to the principle of proportionality.

Starting from the foregoing, and taking into account the strict terms of
the query, and referring to the communication of the numbers
telephone numbers available to the CNMC, it must be analyzed, previously,
the legal basis under which the CNMC can proceed to the
treatment of the personal data of the subscribers to the services of
electronic communications, as well as the specific purpose for the
that such data is collected and processed.

In this sense, as has been repeatedly pointed out by this
Agency, the legal obligation to allow the provision of the service of
telephone directory under conditions of effective competition and the
specific transfer of data that it entails, stems from the
provided in articles 25 and 49 of the current Law 9/2014, of 9
May, Telecommunications General -LGT-.

In this way, in relation to the fulfillment of said obligation,
Article 25.1 c) of the LGT, within the regulation of the service
world, remember that:

“Under the aforementioned concept of universal service,

In any case, respect for the rules that regulate the protection of
personal data and the right to privacy.

The guarantee of the fundamental right to personal data protection
personal character appears expressly recognized among the objectives
and principles of Law 9/2014, of May 9, by establishing within the
same article 3 j):

“Defend the interests of users, ensuring their
right of access to electronic communications services
in adequate conditions of choice, price and good quality,
promoting the ability of end users to access and
distribute the information or use the applications and services
of your choice, in particular through open access to
Internet. In providing these services, they must
safeguard the
constitutional imperatives not to
discrimination, respect for the rights to honor and
privacy, the protection of youth and children, the protection
of personal data and secrecy in communications”.

Regarding the regulation of telephone directories, the

Article 49.1 of the LGT establishes that:

“The elaboration and commercialization of the guides of
subscribers to electronic communications services and the
provision of information services about them will be carried out
under free competition”.

Likewise, article 48.3 establishes that:

Regarding the protection of personal data and the
privacy in relation to the directories of subscribers, users
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

end of electronic communications services will have
the following rights: a) To appear in the subscriber guides. b)
To be informed free of charge of the inclusion of their data in the
guides, as well as their purpose, prior to
to said inclusion. c) To not appear in the guides or to request the
omission of some of your data, to the extent that such data
are relevant to the purpose of the guide that you have stipulated
your provider."

Regarding the duty to supply information for the
free competition provision of directory publishing services
telephone calls or making telephone consultations, add your own
article 49.1 of Law 9/2014 that:

“For this purpose, the companies that assign numbers of
telephone to the subscribers will have to give course to all the
reasonable requests to supply relevant information
for the provision of information services on numbers
subscribers and guides accessible to the public, in a format
approved and in equitable, objective conditions, oriented
based on costs and non-discriminatory, being subject to
the provision of said information and its subsequent use to the
regulations on data protection in force in each
moment".

For this reason, as this Agency has been reiterating in
different legal reports -by all, the Nº 0008/2020, of April 2
of 2020-, "(...) the legislator comes to specify expressly, in a
norm with the rank of Law, the possibility that, in a development
subsequent regulation, the operators are required to contribute the
data necessary to fully comply with the rights/duties
that he himself consecrates in the Law itself.”

Consequently, in the general context - to which the
exercise of its powers- the communication of the data to the
National Commission of Markets and Competition finds its
based on the legal obligation to guarantee free competition in
the market. For its part, the legal basis legitimizing the treatment of
the data thus obtained by the assignees of this information is
incardina in the legitimate interest of these when they intend to provide the
telephone directory service on subscriber or information numbers
on subscriber numbers under conditions of free competition.

In particular, the provisions of the second

of the right that subscribers have not to appear in the guides or to

As can be seen, in the present case it is requesting
the communication of personal data for a purpose other than
which had been obtained. As it is a data communication
between administrative agencies, it must be, in the first place, along
provided for in its specific regulations, based on the configuration of the
CIS as an "autonomous body of an administrative nature, with
legal personality and its own assets, whose purpose is the
scientific study of Spanish society”, as provided in article 1
of Law 39/1995, of December 19, on the Organization of the Center for
Sociological Research, whose article 2 adds that “The Center for

Article 5 includes the principles of action and the regime
law of survey research, including
that of voluntariness and that of protection of personal data:

The studies that the Center for Sociological Research
carried out using the survey method will abide by the
following principles:

a) Voluntary responses, especially when
inquire about ethnic, political, religious or
ideological, as well as circumstances that refer to the
personal or family privacy.

b) Investigative transparency, informing the
respondents regarding the body conducting the study and the
nature and purpose of it, as well as the guarantees that
assist in relation to the protection of your identity and privacy.

c) Specialty, using the information for the
purposes of the research and always within the
statutory objectives of the Center.

d) Protection of personal data, adopting in
any phase of the investigation process, and after the
same, the necessary measures to guarantee the right to
privacy and intimacy of individuals and families.

The functions provided for in this article that are
carried out both by entities and by interviewers or
coordinators of the Center's field network, will be considered
included in article 196.3 e) of the Law of Contracts of
Public Administrations, and will be governed by said Law.

In particular, in relation to the electoral polls to which
consultation refers, the second additional provision refers to what
provided for in Organic Law 5/1985, of June 19, on the Regime
General Election:

Article 10.

3. The same obligation is incumbent on all institutions and
public entities of the State Administration, the
Autonomous Communities and Local Corporations.

When it is necessary to carry out statistics
the use of data from administrative sources,
the bodies, authorities and officials in charge of their
custody will provide the fastest and most agile collaboration to the
statistical services.

 In accordance with the Explanatory Memorandum of said legal text “It is
stresses, however, the importance for statistical purposes of
use of data already collected by other offices or dependencies
administrative as a result of their ordinary activity, which allows, for
other hand, a considerable saving of means and avoids going back to
informants to collect data that is already in the possession of the

with the people who are going to participate in the survey, being the data

statistical operations.

Therefore, they would be relevant for the intended purposes.
in article 12 of Law 12/1989, that is, in order to articulate the
way to get the information:

that allow their computer treatment, always in accordance with
the provisions of the rules that regulate each statistic in
particular.

3. Expenses incurred by informants for shipments
and communications to which the compilation of statistics gives rise
for state purposes, they will be paid from the budgets
of statistical services.

Said precept expressly refers to two ways of obtaining
the information, by mail or by personal visit, for which purpose it would be
enough to know the domicile of the interested party, being enough, to
these effects, obtaining the information contained in the Register
municipal and expressly provided for in article 16.3 LBRL. But without
that it be extrapolated, without further ado, the legitimacy to treat the data of the
address to the treatment of the data of the fixed telephone number and the telephone
mobile, since this last data can be much more intrusive in the
right to personal data protection. At this point, taking into
Note that the text itself provides for the possibility of carrying out statistics
by mail, the impossibility or
inefficiency thereof, or where appropriate, through other means
technological that do not require the treatment of the telephone number,
to assess the proportionality of the requested assignment.

To this end, the CIS has stated the following:

“In this way, it has been raised as a possibility for the
carrying out the surveys the use of telephone means.
This way of carrying out surveys and studies is the most
suitable for cases in which the face-to-face option is not
possible, but also in a society context of the
information such as the current one, ways should be explored in that sense,
to be able to make traditional surveys compatible with other
more modern forms and according to current times. other way
would be telematics, however, it must be abandoned as
consequence of not allowing access to some samples
acceptable values of the population, since it includes an economic bias and
very relevant age. On the other hand, there are currently no
developed mechanisms that can allow a survey to
carried out through a computer, without contact, can reach
the same levels of validity as one conducted by a
professional and expert interviewer, either in person or
through phone call.

Another alternative is the mail, however, in addition to
be applicable the last defects that were pointed out with respect to
telematics entails higher costs and implications
logistics that are not assumable. On the other hand, one would not have
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

control over who agrees to take the survey and
who do not, until a long time has elapsed, with which they do not
the sample could be adapted according to the refusals.
Likewise, there would be no formulas to control the time in which
the survey is answered nor that there may not be
external influences that prevent responding naturally and
direct”.

Consequently, taking into account the urgency arising from the call
of the electoral processes, the problems to adjust in time the
survey in the case of being carried out by mail and the bias that
would occur in the case of using the Internet, the CIS justifies, as the only
possible alternative, the use of telephone means, understanding this
Agency that, in the specific case that is the subject of this query, and
starting from the impossibility, at least as long as it results from the
declaration of the state of alarm, to carry out consultations
face-to-face, conducting the surveys by telephone is
provided, provided that in obtaining the telephone numbers
additional guarantees are adopted to guarantee the protection of the
fundamental right to the protection of personal data.

When determining these guarantees, two things must be taken into account:
singular circumstances that concur in this case:

In the first place, that the participation in the surveys carried out
the CIS is always voluntary, as stated in article 5 a) of
Law 39/1995, of December 19, previously cited: "Voluntariness
of the answers, especially when inquiring about issues
ethnic, political, religious or ideological, as well as circumstances
that refer to personal or family intimacy”.

  of

  Common Administrative Procedure of

Second, given the administrative nature of the
CIS, as an Autonomous Body, it must be taken into account that,
in accordance with Law 39/2015, of October 1, of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
October,
the
Public Administrations, the ordinary mode of communication with the
managed is the address provided by them or the one that can
obtain by the Registry Administration in the procedures initiated
ex officio (article 41.4), without the companies being obliged to
provide your telephone number among the information that is necessarily
must contain the request in the procedures initiated at the request of
the same (article 66). Therefore, there is no legal obligation
of those administered to provide their telephone number to the
Administration, which can only be dealt with when it has been provided
voluntarily by them and for the strict purpose for which they were
have facilitated. Therefore, it cannot be considered to fall within the
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

expectations of the interested parties that the Administration contact the
themselves by phone.

At this point, as we have seen, there is only one assumption of
legal obligation of communication of telephone numbers by
of the operators to an administrative body, the CNMC, for the purposes
indicated in this report, and recognizing as a right of the
interested parties “not to appear in the guides or to request the omission of
some of your data, to the extent that such data is relevant
for the purpose of the guide stipulated by your provider” (Article
48.3 of Law 9/2014). In these cases, as stipulated in article 68.2 of the
Royal Decree 424/2005 "The data referring to subscribers who
have exercised their right not to appear in the guides accessible to the
will only be provided to the entities holding the
emergency call service. For these purposes, it
understand that the emergency call services are the
provided through number 112 and those others determined by the
Secretary of State for Telecommunications and for the Society of
Information".

Based on the above, the CIS proposal includes some

guarantees that are considered fundamental:

In the first place, only the data corresponding to the
mobile phone number and the province to which it corresponds, without
provide any other identifying information.

Second, they will not be included in the list provided by
the CNMC the telephone numbers of those people who have
exercised their right not to appear in the guides accessible to the public.

On the other hand, not all the data will be processed.
telephone numbers of subscribers in the province, but only
the percentage that is considered adequate to guarantee that it adjusts to the
corresponding sample, a percentage that, depending on the Community
Autonomous, would range between 5.1% and 6.3% of its population, to be distributed
proportionally by province, according to its population, which
will be selected randomly.

Thus, in the opinion of this Agency, the communication of the
data of subscribers to the telephone service by the CNMC to the CIS
for conducting electoral polls would find its
based on article 6.1.e) of the RGPD (“the treatment is necessary
for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller”)
and is consistent with the principles of purpose limitation and
minimization of data of its article 5, as well as the doctrine of our
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

At this point, it does not correspond to this legal report

However, taking into account what was stated by the consultant herself,
It should be noted that, since the participation of a company is planned for the
carrying out the surveys, supplying the corresponding

regarding information regarding the processing of personal data
that will be provided verbally to those who participate in the
surveys, it must include the basic information provided for in the
article 11.2 of the LOPDGDD for the "first layer", indicating a
electronic address or other means that allows easy access
and immediate to the rest of the information.

Therefore, this Agency considers adjusted to the
regulations on protection of personal data communication
by the CNMC to the CIS, of the necessary telephone numbers
to carry out the surveys corresponding to the
electoral processes to be held in Galicia and the Basque Country, in the
terms indicated in this report.

Lastly, considering the urgency with which the request for the
this report, given the proximity of the electoral processes to the
that the query refers to, which would require adopting measures
exceptional, it must be avoided, in any case, that said measures
exceptions may, without further ado, become generalized once said
period, and given the possibility of using other alternative measures, such as
already indicated in Report 36/2020, a criterion of
prudence that allows a calm analysis of its implications and, in
In any case, and with regard to the powers of this Agency, a
rigorous study of the risks to the rights and freedoms that
these treatments imply and of the necessary guarantees to protect
the right to the protection of personal data, taking into account the principle
proactive responsibility.

For this reason, taking into account the principle of prudence already pointed out, as well
as stated by the consultant regarding the Annual Program
2020 of the National Statistical Plan 2017-2020, whose section 28
recommends the promotion of multi-channel data collection in surveys
homes through electronic and telephone means, taking into account
account the evolution of society in the use of the Internet and the effectiveness
telephone data collection, this Agency considers it necessary
that, in the event that the generalization of the surveys to
through electronic and telephone means, promote the
corresponding legislative modification that guarantees the security
legal and the adequacy of the corresponding data processing
to the RGPD and the doctrine of the Constitutional Court, through
the establishment of the specific guarantees that are considered
adequate.

 
Subsequently, this same criterion has been reiterated in the reports
75/2020 and 78/2020, referring to the communication of telephone numbers by
part of the CNMC to the statistical services of different organizations for the
conducting surveys included in the National Statistical Plan, highlighting
that the relevant criterion in order to determine the way in which it will proceed
said communication does not derive from the obligation to carry out the
survey by the corresponding public body, but in the mandatory
of its completion by those affected, and that by not attending the
surveys carried out by the CIS, additional guarantees must be adopted.

This is what we said in Report 78/2020:

The consultation, which is accompanied by the report issued by the
data protection delegate of the ministry, raises the need to
that, in order to carry out the 2020 Sports Habits Survey,
sent by the National Commission of Markets and Competition
(CNMC) the telephone numbers of the people selected in the
sample of the survey carried out by the National Institute of Statistics
(INE).

The query justifies its request in the fact that it is
a statistic of mandatory completion, invoking in this regard the
stated by this Agency in its Report 70/2015, and that as
consequence of the social and health situation caused by the pandemic
of the coronavirus COVID-19 and the restrictions derived from the measures
adopted by the autonomous communities in matters of public health,
It is not possible to do them in person.

Likewise, it is specified that the telephone number is part of
the information requested in the survey questionnaire as
instrument for quality control of the steps taken, that its
use would be limited exclusively to carrying out field work
of the Survey, so that it would not be subject to additional treatment,
proceeding to its destruction once given the approval of quality
to the report made, guaranteeing, likewise, the confidentiality of the
treatment as it is subject to statistical secrecy by Law 12/1989, of 9
of May, of the Public Statistical Function.

The query refers to the preparation of official statistics,
mandatory, included in the National Statistical Plan
and executed by the statistical services of the State, for the realization
of which is necessary, given the restrictions derived from the
COVID-19 pandemic, pre-obtain phone numbers
of those surveyed by the CNMC, which implies, as
indicated in the Report of this Agency 49/2020 the communication of some
personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were
obtained. As it is a communication of data between organizations
administrative, it must be, in the first place, what is foreseen in its
specific regulations, constituted, in the present case, by the Law
12/1989, of May 9, of the Public Statistical Function, whose article
23 includes, within the State Statistical Services, in addition to the
INE and the Superior Council of Statistics, to “the units of the
different ministerial departments and any other
public entities dependent on it to which it has been
entrusted that function”, attributing in its article 33 to the
statistical services of ministerial departments, among others
competences, in its letter f), "The elaboration and execution of the
statistical projects entrusted to them in the Statistical Plan

On the other hand, the aforementioned law, in its article 7.1. points out that "It
shall establish by law the statistics for the preparation of which are required
mandatory data” collected in the additional provision
fourth of Law 4/1990, of June 29, on General Budgets of the
State for 1990 the mandatory completion statistics between
which the second additional provision of Law 13/1996, of 30 of

May, of the Public Statistical Function, those whose realization
is mandatory for the Spanish State due to the requirements of the regulations
of the European Union. Likewise, the statistics that could be made
under article 8.3 of the aforementioned Law”.

Likewise, and in what refers to the adequacy of the same to the
provided for in the General Data Protection Regulation, article 25

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations
specifically, it turns out that, in the present case, we are faced with the
assumption of a mandatory completion statistic as it is
included in the National Statistical Plan approved by Royal Decree
410/2016, of October 31, appearing among the information that must be
Provide, as indicated in the query, the telephone number as
instrument for quality control of the procedures carried out, so
that “This variable becomes, therefore, not only a
instrument of initial contact with the informant, but it is also
part of the content of the questionnaire.

And since it is a mandatory completion statistic,
there is a legal obligation of citizens previously
selected in the survey sample to provide the information
requested, typifying in article 50 of Law 12/1989 as
minor infraction “The referral or delay in sending data when it is not
has caused serious damage to the service, and there is an obligation to
supply them”, as a serious infraction “The non-remission or the delay in the
sending the required data when there is serious damage to
the service, and there is an obligation to supply them" and as a very
serious “The notorious resistance, habitual or with the allegation of false excuses
in sending the required data, when there is an obligation to
supply them."

It is precisely the obligation to complete the
the survey that allows us to differentiate this assumption from those
others in which it is voluntary, such as those carried out
by the Center for Sociological Research, since, by involving the
treatment of special categories of data, article 5 of the
Law 39/1995, of December 19, on the Organization of the Center for
Sociological Research collects the principle of voluntariness
of the answers, which requires that, in the case of claiming the
communication of telephone numbers by the CNMC to the
CIS, additional guarantees should be adopted, as discussed
in Report 49/2020.

Therefore, in the present case, the communication of the data
of subscribers to the telephone service by the CNMC for the
elaboration of an official statistic, of obligatory completion,
included in the National Statistical Plan and executed by the services
statistics of the State would find its basis in article 6.1.e)
of the RGPD ("the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a
mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers
conferred on the data controller”).

In any case, it must be fulfilled by the person in charge of the
treatment with the principles established in article 5 of the RGPD,
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

pointing out in the consultation that the use of these telephones would be limited
exclusively to carry out the field work of the
Survey, so that it would not be subject to further treatment,
adapting to the principles of purpose limitation and
minimization of data and that the principle of limitation of the term of
conservation would also be guaranteed by destroying the numbers of
provided telephone number, once the quality approval has been given to the report
accomplished.

Likewise, the rest of the guarantees of the
exercise of the statistical function, such as submission to secrecy
statistical analysis or the dissociation of the data from the moment in which
conducts the survey, separating the answers given by the
respondents of the telephone numbers, as well as the rest of the measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee respect for the
rights and freedoms of those affected and the adequacy of the treatment to
the regulations on protection of personal data that corresponds
adopt the Ministry of Culture as responsible for the treatment,
in accordance with the principle of proactive responsibility.

For all these reasons, this Agency understands that the communication of the
telephone numbers by the CNMC to the statistical services of the
Ministry of Culture, in the terms provided in this report,
is protected by the RGPD as long as, as already
indicated in Report 70/2015, the data is only used
for the realization of the statistics in whose field it is requested.

All this without prejudice to the fact that, basing the consultation on the
restrictions derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and as
advanced in Report 49/2020, being recommended in the section
28 of the 2020 Annual Program of the 2017-2020 National Statistical Plan, the
promotion of multi-channel collection in household surveys through
of electronic and telephone means taking into account the evolution of
society in the use of the Internet and the effectiveness of the collection
telephone data, this Agency considers it necessary that, in the case of
that the generalization of the surveys be foreseen through
electronic and telephone, promote the corresponding modification

corresponding processing of personal data to the RGPD and to the
doctrine of the Constitutional Court, through the establishment of the

For all these reasons, this Agency reiterates the criteria set forth, so

subscribers that are in the power of the CNMC to the CIS, guarantees must be adopted
additional, similar to those provided for in report 49/2020.

Likewise, this Agency insists on the need, already indicated in the
previous reports, that the corresponding modification be promoted
legislation that guarantees legal certainty and the adequacy of the
corresponding processing of personal data to the RGPD and the doctrine of

specific as deemed appropriate.

In the present case, as results from the report issued by the DPD, the
survey involves the processing of personal data included within the
special categories of data and that, in any case, will only be provided
voluntarily.

This voluntariness results from the provisions of article 11.2 of the Law
12/1989, of May 9, of the Public Statistical Function, which states that "In

data likely to reveal ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or ideological convictions and, in general, how many circumstances
may affect personal or family privacy.

Therefore, as it is a completion survey
voluntarily by those affected, so that the communication of the numbers
telephone numbers of the subscribers that are in the possession of the CNMC to the CIS must
adopt additional guarantees, in addition to the generic ones derived from the
regulations on the Public Statistical Function, including statistical secrecy, as well
as well as the European Statistics Code of Good Practice.

In this regard, from the report of the DPO and from the consultation letter itself,
these additional guarantees would consist of the limitation of the sample, so
that the sample of telephone numbers does not reach 6% of the population
during the initial period of obtaining the sample; in the realization of
strict controls of anonymization and dissociation of data, so that the
special categories of data will be kept in a file segregated from the
telephone file and other identification data from the moment of the
survey, so it will be practically impossible to associate these data with
their owner and will be safely deleted once they are no longer needed
for the same, or for subsequent quality control work without allowing
no other use. Likewise, it is specifically foreseen that the
numbers of those people who have made use of their right to
opposition to appear in the phone lists, this should be understood
guarantee in the sense that they will not be provided by the
CNMC.

However, and without prejudice to its assessment by the person responsible for the
treatment in accordance with the principle of proactive responsibility, although the
additional guarantees indicated could be considered sufficient, however,
The need for the communication of personal data is not proven
corresponding to the telephone numbers by the Ministry of
Equality.

In this sense, the submitted documentation refers to said
need hypothetically, noting that "In the current situation of
pandemic the DGVG may need to conduct these surveys by telephone
given the material impossibility of carrying them out in person…”. What's more,
provides for the use of other means, including conducting the survey by
Internet (CAWI), pointed out, for this assumption, that "it is also planned
carry out telephone incentives, since it is essential to be able to achieve
adequate response rate by this method.

And, consequently, with this hypothetical nature and in order to justify
necessity, adds that “The telephone interview will only be carried out if the
pandemic makes it strictly necessary or if the response rate of
personal interview is low”.

Taking into account that the need for data processing, in the
In this case, the communication by the CNMC of the telephone numbers must
attend at the time it is proceeded to, this Agency considers
that only said communication will proceed, with the guarantees
previously indicated, if it is duly accredited that the pandemic does
strictly necessary due to the impossibility of carrying out the surveys
face-to-face or if, as a consequence of the pandemic, the response rate
of personal interview is low.

On the other hand, this Agency considers it necessary to reiterate, once again, the
need to proceed to a legislative amendment that guarantees the
legal certainty and the adequacy of the corresponding data processing
personal data to carry out telephone surveys to the RGPD and to the
doctrine of the Constitutional Court, through the establishment of the
specific guarantees deemed appropriate, as we have already had
the opportunity to propose in our Report 46/2021, referring to the
Preliminary draft of the General Telecommunications Law.
