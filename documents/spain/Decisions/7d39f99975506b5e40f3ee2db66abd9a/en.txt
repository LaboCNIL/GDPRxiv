In relation to the person responsible for processing the personal data processed by
the web portal ***URL.1 as well as the possible existence of a delegate of
data protection (DPD), by BAYARD it is answered:

 The controller of this portal is BAYARD REVISTAS S.A.
 The DPD is GRUPO ADAPTALIA LEGAL FORMATIVO S.L, however, in the
At the time of the security breach, there was only one
consulting contract on data protection, and that this contract is

data of the person in charge BAYARD REVISTAS S.A. This link is also
communicated to this Agency on March 3, 2022, through the
Subdirectorate General for Promotion and Authorizations, we are provided with a copy of the
registration document.

Regarding the type of affected data and chronological description of the
events that occurred, BAYARD replies:

That on October 22, 2021, an email signed by an external person is received, which is
identified as a supposed researcher and disseminator specialized in cybersecurity
web, reporting that he had managed to access the company's data as a result of
a vulnerability of the website, providing as proof a screenshot with the
names of the database tables, without providing evidence about the leak of
data.

That this attack had not been carried out for malicious purposes but with the intention of
ethical hacking, therefore of the vulnerability notice to the person in charge of the web without
no criminal purpose.

That the filtered data correspond to identification data, contact data,
Approximate location and in some cases identification data of children under the age of
age.

That from this moment the services of a third company were contracted

That no user has communicated that their data could have been used.

Regarding the risk analysis and the security measures that were
implanted prior to the incident, BAYARD answers that they did have analysis of
risks previously carried out through the AEPD MANAGES tool,
providing an annex as evidence of this.

However, after analyzing it, it is concluded that this document refers to the
report generated by the EIPD MANAGEMENT tool of this Agency and is
includes both a description of the data life cycle and a relationship of
regulatory compliance requirements aimed at risk management, but not
identify or analyze other risk factors with different origins of non-compliance
normative, for example, those related to the technology used.

The security measures implemented prior to the breach, and which had been
shown to be inefficient, were:

- (…)

Regarding the containment measures, the following are indicated:

- Hire cybersecurity services to identify all the vulnerabilities that
allowed the filtration and apply reinforcement measures to protect the SQL DBs from the
company.
- Communicate the breach to GRUPO ADAPTALIA LEGAL FORMATIVO S.L, provider
external specialized in data protection (which at that time provided services
advice on data protection, to analyze and determine the needs and
obligations regarding notification and communication to both the AEPD and those affected.
- Refresh and implement internally the action protocol in case of
security breach so that all staff know what to do in the event of a breach.

Regarding the notification of the gap before this Agency, BAYARD answers that
immediately after analyzing the gap by GRUPO ADAPTALIA, we proceed to
notify the same before this Agency, providing as proof a copy of the registry of
notification input.

From the analysis of this we can extract the following information:

- That it is detected on October 22, 2021 by the notification of an external third party and that
It is considered resolved on October 26, 2021.

 It is reported by an external person who has been able to have access to the data by sending

- That the data affected are basic, location and contact data.
- They indicate that among the affected people there is data identifying minors.
- That the incident log has been updated.
- That among the new security measures is the performance of audits

Article 4 paragraph 12 of the RGPD defines, in a broad way, the "violations of
security of personal data” (hereinafter security breach) as “all
those breaches of security that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
accidental or illicit of personal data transmitted, conserved or processed in another
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

In the present case, there is a security breach of personal data in the
circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality when
having accessed the data of the users of the web portal, due to a vulnerability of the
website.

It should be noted that the identification of a security breach does not imply the
imposition of a sanction directly by this Agency, since it is necessary
analyze the diligence of those responsible and in charge and the security measures
applied.

Within the principles of treatment provided for in article 5 of the RGPD, the
integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f)
of article 5 of the RGPD. For its part, the security of personal data comes
regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD, which regulate the security of the
treatment, notification of a violation of the security of personal data to

confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it is stated that the personal data of those affected, contained in the
BAYARD's database, were improperly exposed to a third party.

On October 22, 2021, BAYARD receives an email signed by an external person, who
identified himself as a supposed researcher and disseminator specializing in
web cybersecurity, reporting that he had managed to access the data of the
company as a result of a website vulnerability, providing as evidence capture

Although the risk analysis they provide is the output report generated by the

In the present case, it is clear that BAYARD has evidence of having suffered a
security breach of personal data on October 28, 2021 and has not
reported to this Agency, to date on November 11 of that same year.

On October 28, there was already evidence of the existence of web vulnerabilities that
would have made possible the loss of confidentiality in personal data, and it is in that
moment when it is transferred to the data protection advisory company so that
You will be told how to act accordingly.

To assess the notification needs, they used the formula that appears in the
“Guide for the management and notification of security violations”: Risk = P
(Volume) x I (Type x Impact), using the following parameters:

o Volume = 4 (Over 100,000)

o Typology = 1 (Non-sensitive data)

o Impact = 8 (Public, accessible on the internet)

However, and taking into account that on October 28 there was already evidence of the
possible breach that would affect personal data, there is a temporary delay in relation to
with the notification of the gap to this Agency, since it takes place on November 11
of 2021.

The same happens with the communication to those affected, which is carried out on a date
approximately November 20, 2021.

For this reason, it was decided to make a new request for information to BAYARD on the date
April 24, 2022 to clarify the following issues:

- Reasons that would justify the delay in notifying the Agency.

- Reasons that would justify the delay in communication with those affected.

Regarding the delay in notifying the security breach to the Agency,
indicate that, at the time of knowledge of this, BAYARD could not guarantee that
said gap was real, and therefore was unaware of the existing risk to the rights
and freedoms of the interested parties.
