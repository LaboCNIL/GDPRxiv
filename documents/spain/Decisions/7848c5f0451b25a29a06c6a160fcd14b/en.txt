clarification of the facts in question, by virtue of the investigative powers
granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), and
in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

As a result of the research actions carried out, it is confirmed

that the data controller is the claimed party.

In addition, the following extremes are noted:

On April 9, 2019, within the framework of file E/04416/2018, after
analyze the documentation that was in it, a resolution was issued by the
director of the AEPD, agreeing not to admit the claim for processing.

On the 13th of the same month and year, he filed an optional appeal for reconsideration,
contributing new recordings in which different tones of voice are identified that
point to the impersonation of their identity and abundant documentation related to the
opening of preliminary proceedings in the Investigating Court number 5 of Igualada,
giving rise to the fact that on November 22, 2019, a resolution will be issued by the AEPD,
agreed the estimation of the mentioned resource of replenishment.

On the other hand, the respondent states in its answer to this
Agency, which adopted as a precautionary measure the suspension of recovery actions
of the debt and the exclusion of the data from the file, transferring it to the Analysis Group
of Risks to proceed with its study.

Later they state that after an exhaustive study there are indications

sufficient to determine that the contracts have the appearance of legality.

They also present a copy of the contract and recordings of the contracting of six
telephone lines deactivated due to non-payment on June 1, 2016 and have verified
that the orders for the requested terminals were delivered to the domicile of the

They also state that the debt persists, as well as the inclusion of

communications to the claimant.

THIRD: On December 17, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed, for the
alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD.,
granting him a period of ten business days to formulate allegations and propose the
tests that it deems appropriate.

FOURTH: Once the aforementioned initial agreement was notified, the respondent requested an extension of
term and subsequently presented a brief with arguments in which, in summary,
stated that: “among the telephone lines that are the subject of this proceeding, the
corresponding to the number ***TELEPHONE.1, is the one whose activation occurred in
last place, more specifically on February 5, 2015, has elapsed between the
contracting of the services until the opening of the sanctioning procedure the term
legally established, this being greater than the three years foreseen for the
prescription of the infraction contemplated by the LOPDGDD.

Also in the event that this Agency considers that the term of the
prescription of the infraction begins to count from the moment in which the
claimant knew the facts that gave rise to his complaint, it must be pointed out to the
regarding, …, that all the invoices generated by the contracted services were
paid until in June 2015 they are no longer paid by the claimant. By
Therefore, it is evident that the claimant had knowledge of the alleged
fraudulent contracts no later than the referenced date.

In fact, even if this Agency considers that we are
in the face of a permanent infraction that is characterized in that the conduct constituting
a single offense is maintained for a prolonged period of time, this part has
to point out that all the telephone lines object of analysis in the present
procedure were deactivated and discharged, at the latest, on June 1,
2016, as can be seen in the CRM screenshots.

They have already been provided as documents annexed to the brief of complementary arguments,

line activation contracts that convincingly prove that this party
had a legitimizing basis for the processing of personal data of the
claimant, all in accordance with the provisions of article 6.1 b) of the
GDPR. … .

Therefore, no new relevant documentation has been provided to the procedure.
that justifies the change of opinion and the consequent positive decision by the
of this Agency.

The disputed lines are deactivated, the debt is not claimed
pending payment, and the data of the claimant are excluded from the files of
equity solvency.

in June 2015 they stop paying.

That you have not been notified of the decision not to admit the claim for processing,

article 76.2 of the LOPGDD.

In defense of his claim, he points out that it is not feasible to compare voices to

certain degree of certainty the result of the analysis.

attached document number 1 copy of the delivery notes of the terminals
allegedly acquired by the claimant on different dates from points of

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. The
personal data of the claimant were incorporated into the information systems
of the company and inclusion in the Asnef credit information file, without there being
accredited that he had his consent for the collection and treatment
of your personal data, or there is any other cause that makes the
treatment carried out.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
persons who contracted on behalf of the claimant.

It should be noted that the party claimed in the brief of September 9, 2018

addressed to the claimant stated the following:

“We inform you that by virtue of the claim filed by you before the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection has carried out a study by the Group
of Risk Analysis of this company in order to determine the existence of
irregularities in the contracts made in your name.

In this sense, it has been possible to verify the existence of contracts and
recordings of the verification company of the telephone contracting process in the
that grants consent for the activation of the lines ***TELÉFONO.5,
***TELEPHONE 1,
Y
***TELEPHONE.6, having the same full appearance of legality. Likewise, it
has verified that the invoices generated by the services have been paid
contracted, currently pending payment an amount of 13,403.19
euros corresponding to invoices issued between 06/26/2015 and 07/26/2016.

 ***PHONE.4,

 ***PHONE.2,

 ***PHONE.3

Therefore, given that it has not been possible to demonstrate the existence of irregularities
in the contracts made that allow this company to catalog the
contracting that is the subject of controversy as fraudulent, nor has it been
provided the corresponding absolutely necessary police report, this merchant
is not able to attribute falsity to the registration of lines in which they have been fulfilled
contracting regulatory requirements. That said, the debt that currently
maintained in this company is considered certain, expired and demandable.”

  Well, on the part of the defendant, the claim of the
claimant; not having been sufficiently accredited that the treatment of
personal data has been made in accordance with the precepts indicated
previously; having verified that Orange has associated the personal data
of the claimant to the registration of six telephone lines that he denies having contracted.

    The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court, in
assumptions such as the one presented here, has considered that when the owner of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

data denies the hiring, the burden of proof corresponds to those who affirm their
existence, and the third-party data controller must collect and
keep the necessary documentation to prove the consent of the holder.
We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Basis of Law
Fourth.

The personal data of the claimant were registered in the files of the
claimed and included in the Asnef credit information file and were treated
for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the claimant. Consequently,
has carried out a processing of personal data without having accredited that
have the legal authorization to do so.

However, and this is essential, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy to

the processing of the claimant's data.

In short, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
one that shows that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one who
claimed to hold

Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of the fundamental right
of protection of personal data requires that it be accredited that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. Failure to act in this way -and this Agency, who is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

On the other hand, regarding the allegations made by the respondent,
observes in the first place that the prescription did not occur since it appears in the
entity files the outstanding debt and Orange carried out actions to recover the
debt and therefore there was data processing, as stated by the one claimed in its
letter of September 9, 2018.

On the other hand, as recognized by the claimed in the drafting of the articles
64.2 first and second paragraphs and 65.1, 2 and 4 of the LOPDGDD is not established
expressly the mandatory nature of the notification of the Resolution of non-admission to
processing of the claim, nor the approving resolution of the reversal appeal.

It should be noted that the reference made by the respondent to article 118.1 of the
LPACAP, that “when new facts or documents are to be taken into account
collected in the original file, they will be revealed to the interested parties to
that within a period of not less than ten days nor more than fifteen, formulate the allegations and
present the documents and supporting documents that they deem appropriate”.

   Well, this sanctioning procedure does not refer to new
facts are the same. Thus, the sanctioning procedure has been opened with
all the legal guarantees and therefore there is no place for said allegation.

Regarding the merits of the controversy, as indicated by the SAN of May 12,
2014, “Telephone recording that cannot be granted validity for purposes of
unequivocal consent, not only because such consent is not alluded to
but, above all, because such consent of article 6.1 LOPD must be of the
owner of the personal data and in the present case it is evident that it is not,
since the voice that appears in the recording is masculine and not feminine.

On the other hand, and with regard to the alleged existence of
tacit consent as a result of the payment of electricity bills by
part of the complainant. That payment does not mean, as this Chamber has stated in
previous occasions, the agreement of the affected party with which their
personal data from…”

The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations
it is therefore evident. Diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the data controller be in a position
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

IV

In accordance with the provisions of the RGPD in its art. 83.1 and 83.2, when deciding the
imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case will be
taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in the article
indicated, as well as any other that may be applicable to the circumstances of the
case.

                 “Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

         “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the

e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;

  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
or indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

         "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of

personal information.

c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the commission

of the offence.

infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) Affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person in charge or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between them and any interested party.”

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the
sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in the
article 83.5.a) of the RGPD for which the claimed party is responsible, they are estimated
concurrent the following factors:

As aggravating criteria:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

12/13

- In the present case we are dealing with an unintentional negligent action, but

identified significant (article 83.2 b).

- Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, a

identification number, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the infraction committed by violating what is established in article 6, it allows establishing
a fine of 80,000 euros (eighty thousand euros), typified as "very serious", to
