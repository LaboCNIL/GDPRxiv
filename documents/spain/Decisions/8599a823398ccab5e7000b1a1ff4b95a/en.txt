Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and in

BACKGROUND

FIRST: They have been received by the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD)
ninety-six (96) claims against EQUIFAX IBÉRICA, S.L., with NIF
B80855398, (hereinafter, the claimed or EQUIFAX) for alleged violation of the
data protection regulations.

The claims deal with the treatment of the personal data of the
claimants made by EQUIFAX and materialized in its incorporation to the File of
Judicial Claims and Public Organizations (hereinafter, FIJ) associated with
alleged debts mostly contracted, presumably, with Public Administrations
Public. In general, the personal data subject to treatment linked
to presumed debts appeared in documents of the Public Administrations, the
entities or bodies of Public Law dependent on them or in resolutions
of the jurisdictional bodies that were published through bulletins or newspapers
officials, through its insertion in the bulletin boards located in the headquarters of
entities or organizations or on the single judicial edictal board, with the purpose of
make effective the notification of an administrative or judicial resolution.

EQUIFAX IBÉRICA, S.L., with NIF B80855398, is responsible for the FIJ. so it has
recognized in any of the documents in the file, such as the letter
which he sent to claimants number 36 (E/6174/2019), number 43 (E/11624/2019) and
number 48 (E/2050/2020) to inform you of the inclusion of your personal data in
the FIJ.

It should also be remembered that the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, on the Protection of
Personal Data (LOPD) regulated in its articles 14 and 39 the Registry
General Data Protection, for public consultation, which reported on the
data processing, the purposes of such processing and the identity of the

EQUIFAX appeared as responsible for the FIJ, being the purpose of the file and the uses
provided for the "provision of capital solvency and credit services".

Although the opening agreement and the motion for a resolution indicated that they were
97 the claims made against EQUIFAX, and this is stated in the list of
claimants listed in Annex I and in the description of the claims
(First Background), there are actually 96 claims that make up this
file, given that claimant 3 and claimant 27 are the same person who
has presented at two different times different attached documentation.

Taking into consideration that we must not make any rectification in the
Antecedent Second, since said Antecedent was incorporated into the list of
proven facts as First Proven Fact, its content is not altered, which

The model letter used by EQUIFAX to respond to requests for access to
the data included in the FIJ after the GDPR became effective
(since 05/25/2018), of which there are numerous examples in the file, has the
following text:

It begins by informing the affected party that they are sending "information associated with their

At the same time, they also work on the file -exclusively linked to the
claimants 36, 43 and 48- the letters that EQUIFAX sent them on 10/18/2018,
08/22/2019 and 08/24/2019, respectively, informing them of the inclusion of their data
in the IJF. In that model letter, the respondent provided the following information:

SIXTH: Allegations to the initial agreement: Request for extension of the term of
allegations and a copy of the file.
On 08/04/2020, the Agency received a document from the respondent in which
requests, under articles 32.1 and 53.1.a) of the LPACAP, the extension of the term

The AEPD, in writing dated 08/12/2020, agrees to extend, for the maximum allowed
legally, the period initially set to present allegations and refers to the
requested a copy of the administrative file. The notification of the writing and the
Delivery of the copy of the file was made by postal courier since the
volume of the file makes it impossible to send it by electronic means. work in
the procedure the proof of the MRW company that proves that the documents
were received by the claimed party on 08/12/2020.

SEVENTH: Allegations to the initiation agreement: Written allegation.
On 08/19/2020, the letter of allegations to the
initiation agreement presented by the respondent in which it requests that it be issued
resolution declaring the nullity of full right of the procedure.
Subsidiarily, that the file of the procedure be agreed. and subsidiarily
with respect to the previous request, that a warning or reprimand or
significantly reduce the amount of the sanction provided for in the settlement agreement.
beginning.

It puts forward the following arguments in support of its claims:
The first allegation deals with the defenselessness caused to EQUIFAX as
consequence of having set in the agreement to open the procedure the amount
of the sanction instead of expressing in said agreement, only, the limits of the
possible penalty to be imposed. Other circumstances that in his opinion would have caused
defenselessness, nullifying the procedure, are the following: not having had
the opportunity to express your opinion about the circumstances that could result
applicable to the case; the summary motivation of the aggravating circumstances that is made
in the initial agreement and the one that has been substantially affected the
impartiality of the instructor in clear breach of the phase separation principle
instructor and sanction.

The second allegation is under the rubric “Of the defenselessness of EQUIFAX due to access
late to the administrative file and its content”. In it he explains the
helplessness suffered as a result of having seen limited and reduced
ostensibly his ability to formulate "complete and
informed”. In this regard, he highlights two facts: the late delivery of the copy of the
file, which was transferred on 08/12/2020, one business day before the
the ordinary term of ten working days expires, therefore, although the Body
The sanctioning party agreed to extend the term until 08/20/2020, the period of time in which
that has been able to access the documentation was only 6 business days.

Secondly, it highlights that the copy of the file suffers from various
defects that imply, at least, the need to “proceed to the suppression of
a large part of the Background of the agreement itself”. These deficiencies would be
following: (i) The submitted file refers to a limited number of the
claims that are mentioned in the initial agreement, since there is no such
claim file or any document related to 43 claimants. (ii) It
include in the file, at least three claims that are not related to the
object of the file.

Regarding the claims that do appear in the documentation of the file
administrative data that the AEPD sent to it, the respondent draws the conclusion that these

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

52/184

are not related to the substantive issues contained in the foundations of the
initial agreement “since practically all of them referred to the exercise by the
interested parties of their rights of access and deletion” Classifies the claims
formulated, on which documentation was provided in the copy of the file that
was sent, in the following groups:
(i) Those in which the interested party exercises before the AEPD a right that has not been
previously exercised before EQUIFAX. (ii) Those in which the claimant has
requested the deletion of your data from the FIJ and EQUIFAX has responded to your request. (iii) AND
others in which the interested parties exercise their right of access before EQUIFAX, which is
attended, and without contacting EQUIFAX, request the exercise of the right of suppression
directly before the AEPD "alleging issues such as that the treatment is not

data from bulletins and official newspapers or even that the Administration author of the
publication expressed its disagreement with the very existence of the FIJ”. A) Yes,
qualifies as bad faith the actions of the representative of several claimants who, with
regardless of whether the respondent had complied with the exercised right of access,
did not hesitate to send the AEPD a claim that had nothing to do with the right
initially exercised.

The entity concludes that of the 47 claims that appear in the file, it gave
full satisfaction of the right that the claimant exercised before it, although, in
occasions, the interested party addressed a claim to the AEPD that was unrelated
with what was requested before EQUIFAX.

The third allegation deals with the regulations pre-existing the RGPD and the actions of
the AEPD in relation to the FIJ. The respondent says that “[..] as recognized by the
The Agreement itself, the substantive rules whose violation is attributed to my client are not
have changed in terms of their content as a result of the reform operated by
the GDPR”. Analyze the similarities and differences between the text of article 6.1.f) of the
GDPR and article 7.f) of Directive 95/46; indicates that the reasoning contained
in the recitals of the RGPD about the requirements of legitimate interest and how
carry out the necessary weighting to verify your application derives directly
of the jurisprudence issued by the CJEU in its ruling of 10/24/2011 (issues
C-468/10 and C-469/10, Asnef, Fecemed) that declares the direct effect of the
Article 7.f) of Directive 95/46. It also refers to the Group document
Working Group of article 29 (hereinafter, GT29) “Opinion 6/2014 on the concept of
Legitimate interest of the data controller under article 7 of
Directive 95/46/EC”.

Considers that the data processing carried out by the FIJ was lawful under the
previous regulations and that “starting from the similarity, if not identity, between the
regulations previously in force and the one contained in the text of the RGPD, it is necessary to have
taking into account that systems such as the FIJ appeared expressly recognized in the
article 29.1 of the “LOPD. “[...] that the alleged treatment carried out by my
client [...] was not only not contrary, but expressly protected in the
regulatory framework in force prior to the entry into force of the RGPD [...]”. He adds that the
regulatory framework has not been altered, but on the contrary reiterated, with the entry
in force of the RGPD.
Regarding the actions of the AEPD, it says that “This legality was not only known by
that AEPD, but that it came repeatedly to highlight it,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

53/184

dictating numerous resolutions in which he considered perfectly in accordance with the
data protection regulations the behavior of Equifax” in conducts
Totally similar to those that are now the subject of the sanctioning file. mentions
the resolutions issued in TD/00724/2015 and TD/02085/2016.

It indicates that the data processing carried out through the FIJ "has not only been
been carrying out during the validity of all low data protection regulations
the view, science and patience of the AEPD, but that it has repeatedly blessed
occasions the legality of said treatment that is now anathematized by the very
institution". “If this is so and the AEPD declared the legality of a treatment that now
is considered radically opposed to data protection regulations, it would be possible
conclude, with the greatest respect, that this institution collaborated
necessarily in the perpetration of such radically illicit conduct with the
consequent damage to the fundamental right that it has as its mission
essential to guarantee and protect.

Regarding the action of the AEPD after the entry into force of the RGPD, it indicates
that this Agency is perfectly aware of "the existence of
information similar to the FIJ” because the Code of
Conduct presented by the Multisector Information Association (ASEDIE) to the
which belongs to EQUIFAX and whose first version was presented on 05/24/2018 and the last
in May 2020.

It invokes the bankruptcy of the principle of legitimate expectations in which the AEPD has incurred,
which now considers illegal behaviors that it previously considered fully legal. bankruptcy
of legitimate expectations would determine the absence of a culpabilistic element in the
conduct of the claimed party and, consequently, proceed to file the
proceedings. He specifies that this is so because, even when the change of criteria is based
in a normative change, the normative reform has left unchanged the precepts in
which previously the Agency founded the legality of the FIJ. Consider that they are fulfilled
all the necessary requirements to assess the violation of the principle of trust
legitimate in the terms described in the STS 02/22/2016 (cassation appeal
1354/2014) Invokes the SAN of 02/04/2009 (appeal 304/2007) which maintains that the
breach of the principle of legitimate expectations must lead to the annulment of the resolution
sanctioning object of the appeal.

It also denounces the disproportionate nature of the measures that the AEPD intends to
adopt: “excessive sanctions” and “completely irreversible” measures. Y
explains that the imposition of a sanction in the amount established in the initial agreement
of the procedure would imply that this company left the market “for the benefit of
other competing companies that handle the same information”. draw attention
on the fact that the AEPD has decided to "adopt the measures of greatest
severity provided for in the data protection regulations” when the RGPD offers
control authorities a wide range of corrective measures (article 58). to it
In addition, article 83 RGPD expressly provides, in the event of a breach
regulation, the possibility of not imposing an administrative fine and sanctioning
any other corrective measures of article 58 RGPD.

The fourth allegation is headed "Of the legal basis of the treatment of the FIJ".

The claim refers, in the first place, to the implications that derive from the
regulation of reuse of public sector information, Law 37/2007, of 16
November, of reuse of information of the Public Sector (LRISP) and indicates that "the
sources from which it has collected the data to which the claims refer
formulated and, in general, the data included in the FIJ, expressly enable the
reuse of said information. Therefore, it concludes, the aforementioned LRISP, without prejudice
of the application of its article 4.6, does not constitute an obstacle for the collection of
data that she makes. Mentions for this purpose the general conditions of reuse
of the BOE website and adds that, in the other sources used, the
conditions of each one allow reuse as long as the
current legislative framework and, in particular, the RGPD and the Intellectual Property Law.

Reiterates that there is a legal concept of publicly accessible sources -as
evidence, says the defendant, the mention made of them in the STJUE of
11/24/2011 and in the ASEDIE Code of Conduct project presented to the AEPD
in May 2020- that "imply the possible knowledge and access by any
person to the information they contain and that the fact that
information is available to any person makes the processing of data
that they could include affects the private and family life of the interested parties to
which the data refer to an enormously less degree than would be produced
when the data does not come from such sources, which allows the weighting
required by article 6.1.f) RGPD can operate more easily for the benefit of the
legitimate interest of the person responsible for processing such publicly accessible data”.

On the principle of necessity, he shows his disapproval with the reference that the
start agreement made to the STJUE of 12/16/2008 (case C-524/2016) and the judgment
of the ECHR of 03/25/1983 and proposes, for the interpretation of the concept of necessity,
resort to the criteria followed by the T.C. to analyze the proportionality of a measure
restrictive of a fundamental right.

Regarding the requirements to apply the legal basis of article 6.1.f) RGPD,
In accordance with the doctrine of the GT29 in Opinion 6/2014, it mentions the following:
1. Existence of a legitimate interest of the data controller or of any
third. 2. Compliance with the principle of necessity linked to the principle of
suitability. 3. The favorable result of the weighting. Only when it is possible to consider
that the impact on the rights of the interested parties is tolerable in view of the
result obtained by the treatment, it can be carried out. Next
comments on the characteristics of each of the weighting terms and the
factors that should be taken into consideration in the mandatory weighting.

Remember the link that exists between the concepts of purpose and legitimate interest and
criticizes the considerations made by the initial agreement on the basis of the comment
of Opinion 6/2014 of the WG29. It then goes on to describe the legitimate interest
satisfied with the treatment of the data carried out by the FIJ. Distinguish a double interest
legitimate: an interest linked to the evaluation of the solvency of those affected -of which
would be EQUIFAX holders, the third parties that access the data and the borrowers and
consumers- and a legitimate interest linked to the prevention of fraud. summon
legal regulations, opinions, circulars and reports on which it considers it is based
the legitimate interest that each of them holds.

It dedicates a section to “the weighing of the prevalence of the legitimate interest in the
present case”. He affirms that there are multiple elements that lead to the conclusion that
the “legitimate interest of Equifax, its user companies and the company itself in the
treatment of the data of the FIJ prevails over the rights and interests of the
debtors to whom the data refer. Mention for these purposes the following
items:
a. That the LOPD included a rule that determined the prevalence of the aforementioned interest
legitimate because, "article 29.1 of the aforementioned law referred expressly to the legality of the
processing of data in these systems. And remember that, regarding the treatment at
that we refer to, there has not been a substantial change in the applicable regulations,
but that "the legal bases and principles applicable to the treatment remain
unalterable as a result of the entry into force of the GDPR”.

b. The regulation of the LOPDGDD. In this sense, it indicates that the aforementioned Law
recognizes the prevalence of legitimate interest by establishing a presumption in favor in the
credit information systems and adds that in these systems "the legitimate interest
that justifies the treatment is identical to that pursued by the FIJ” from which it concludes that
is an indication of the weighting in favor of the legitimate interest that we examine, "even
when there is no regulation in the new Law similar to the old article 29.1 of
the LOPD.” It goes on to state that “the fact that the impact on the rights and
interests of the interested parties as a result of the processing of their data in the FIJ
is substantially similar to that generated by the processing of your data in the systems
of credit information, with respect to which the prevalence of interest is presumed

In the opinion of the respondent, the evidence cited, together with the fact that they were fulfilled
their understanding of the requirements established by the GT29 in its Opinion 6/2014, accredited
sufficiently the legitimate interest whose prevalence it defends. For this reason, he explains the
entity, continued with the treatment through the FIJ and considered it unnecessary to carry out
an analysis of the specific legitimate interest for the FIJ because “[...] the regulations themselves
carry out the weighting of interests applicable to the treatment regulated in article 20

invokes to reinforce its argument the citation of article 35.10 of the RGPD: "[...] when the

of general impact in the context of the adoption of said legal basis, the
sections”

It states that in 2019 it prepared a "weighting report" in order to
“minimize the impact of treatment below the standards required by the
treatment by adopting additional measures to those that would be sufficient to
consider applicable the provisions of article 6.1.f of the RGPD.” It requires that some
of these measures have already been implemented, others are in the implementation phase and others
are under development for future adoption. between updates
that he claims to have entered is the "notification of inclusion of the data to
the interested parties, in the same terms established for the information systems
in article 20.1 c), second paragraph of the LOPDGDD” because, it affirms, that the
approval of the LOPDGDD “supposed the disappearance of the exemption from the duty of
inform that the jurisprudence had already expressly recognized in relation to the
information systems contained in article 29.1 of the LOPD.”

On the concurrence of "reasonable expectations of the interested party" shows its
discrepancy with what is indicated in the initiation agreement and affirms that "the interested party not only
has the reasonable expectation that their data may be consulted, but that
reasonably expects to be fortunate that access to the
themselves so that whoever contracts with him does not have real knowledge of his
capital solvency and credit.

The last issue commented on in the framework of his fourth allegation – “From the basis
legal treatment of the FIJ”- refers to the exercise by the interested parties of their
rights of suppression and opposition. In this sense, he criticizes the following paragraph included
in the startup agreement:
“There are very numerous communications that the claimants addressed to EQUIFAX
in which they requested the cancellation of their personal data. If it had been
consistent with the alleged legitimate interest in which, in his opinion, the
data processing performed, EQUIFAX should have qualified those requests
as an exercise of the right of opposition.

It manifests the claim that such a surprising affirmation would lead, as the only
logical conclusion, to deprive the interested party of the possibility of exercising the right of
suppression in any manifestation of those provided for in article 17.1 of the RGPD
that differs from the right of opposition, thus obliging him to invoke the reasons
related to your particular situation that justify your request. Therefore, says the
entity, "reached the conclusion that the right of suppression is not derogated
in the modalities other than the right of opposition”, it complied with the
requirements established in the data protection regulations, so that “when
the requests demanded the deletion on the mere basis that the interested party did not
had given its consent, Equifax could not attend to the request, since
said consent is not required in this case, as has been stated
repeatedly". "In the same way, when the alleged falsehood or
inaccuracy of the data, Equifax did nothing but comply with the requirements of the
data protection regulations when requesting the contribution by the applicant of
the information that proves the inaccuracy, given that, otherwise, proceeding
the data from an official newspaper, it was not possible to conclude without further ado that the data was illegal”.

In the fifth allegation of the allegation brief to the initial agreement, “On the
compliance by Equifax with the principle of data accuracy”, reiterates, first
term, that, with respect to this principle, the RGPD has not introduced modifications in
relation to what the Directive established, neither in the enunciation of the principle nor in its
consequences, and that the AEPD, until the publication of this initiation agreement,
“considered at all times the IJF fully respectful of the provisions of the
personal data protection regulations, in which it already clearly appeared
collected the aforementioned principle of accuracy (articles 6.1.d) of the Directive and 4 d) of
the LOPD)” Therefore, it considers that the initial agreement implies that the Agency has
adopted a "new criterion" which concludes that the action of the AEPD is
contrary to the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations.

It states that, since the data comes from public sources, it must be presumed
its accuracy, so that no responsibility can be derived for EQUIFAX from the
inaccuracy that they suffer from or the absence of any of them in the source
original. He claims to have acted with full respect for the rules of reuse of the
information established in each case and having incorporated into the FIJ the data "as
as they appear in the cited sources.

Insists that the data is collected in the terms in which they are published and
accessible by any person and “to the full extent that said publication allows
identify the interested party. Therefore, in the event that one of the
mentioned data in the FIJ this [...] is due [...] to the pure and simple fact that this
data is not included in the official gazette or in the edict from which the information is obtained.
information."

He considers article 4.2 fully applicable to the case. LOPDGDD, in particular the
section d), precept that provides:
"two. For the purposes provided in article 5.1.d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it will not be
attributable to the data controller, provided that the latter has adopted all the
reasonable steps to promptly remove or rectify the inaccuracy of
personal data, with respect to the purposes for which they are processed, when the data
inaccurate:
[...]
d) Were obtained from a public registry by the person responsible.”

It states that it has taken the “necessary measures to guarantee the accuracy of the
information collected”, since, within a month from the moment of the
collection of the information, it proceeds to notify the interested party of its inclusion in the FIJ.

On the reversal of the burden of proof invoked in the initiation agreement, part in
your disclosure of the claim that the data EQUIFAX obtains from newsletters
and official newspapers enjoy a "presumption of accuracy" "given the very nature of the
source from which it is obtained. Therefore, such a presumption can only be destroyed if the
The interested party itself proves the inaccuracy of the information or the source itself proceeds to
its rectification. Thus, the conclusion is that no reversal of the charge of the
evidence exists, since the published information is accurate as long as it is not
prove the opposite.

He also cites article 14 of the LOPDGDD which, on the occasion of the regulation of the
right of rectification states “By exercising the right of rectification recognized in the
Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the affected party must indicate in their request to
what data it refers to and the correction to be made. must accompany,
when necessary, supporting documentation of the inaccuracy or character
incompleteness of the data subject to treatment.

Finally, it refers to the cases in which it has requested the interested party
additional documentation to link with it the existence of a certain
editorial publication. For example, it has asked the interested party to indicate the
possible addresses to which the publication of a
certain edict that affected him. In this regard, he says the following:
“This request, [...] is carried out, [...] but to guarantee full compliance and
exercise of their rights, in order to be able to proceed to the suppression of any
data that should not appear collected in the FIJ.” And he explains the following: “In this
sense, that AEPD is fully aware that, until the entry into force of the
LOPDGDD, the regime of edictal publications carried out by the different
newsletters, newspapers and bulletin boards from which Equifax lawfully collects
information was characterized by dispersion, so that the scope of the data
published by each of them differed substantially, including some of them,
but not all, the identification document of the interested party or their address.

In this way, my client cannot be blamed for the fact that sometimes the
identification data of the interested party are not linked to a document
identity, but rather that said lack of connection comes directly from the
source from which the data is collected, endowed with the presumption of accuracy to which
reference has been made repeatedly throughout this allegation.”

The sixth allegation refers to the modifying circumstances of the responsibility
according to the initial agreement. The entity states that, in the event that
appropriate to adopt "a coercive measure against Equifax" this should be limited, to the
most, to the warning and the requirement to adopt the measures that the AEPD
deemed necessary. The respondent justifies this statement in the "qualified
extenuating circumstances “which in his opinion are present in this case, to which is added “the
own conduct of the AEPD that would have come to generate in Equifax the full
conviction of the legality of data processing in the FIJ”.

It invokes the following as mitigating factors:
(i) That since the approval of the LOPDGDD and the RGPD, measures have been implemented
“aimed at minimizing even more the impact that the treatment [...] could produce
in the private sphere of the interested parties. Refers to the measures provided for in the LIA
contributed -examination of the prevailing legitimate interest- which it affirms are additional measures
that would not be necessary in principle to achieve a favorable weighting. (ii) What
EQUIFAX has never been sanctioned by the AEPD in relation to the treatment
carried out by the FIJ. (iii) That it has repeatedly complied with the requirements or
requests for information from the AEPD. (iv) That as an entity associated with ASEDIE
is automatically adhered to the Code of Conduct promoted by that association.
The claimed one does not specify the precept of the RGPD in which the
mitigating factors it invokes.

On the other hand, in relation to the aggravating circumstances found in the initial agreement,
comments that “The performance of a conduct that
the AEPD itself had been recognizing it as lawful”; that “it is not possible to appreciate the existence
of a lawful benefit” in which he has obtained with a conduct that the AEPD was
knowledgeable” as well as the circumstances surrounding the treatment. And that,
even less, it can be considered a continuing infraction that "carried out with the approval of the
of the controlling authority”.

On 12/28/2020, a letter from EQUIFAX has entered the AEPD in which
states that it has received at its offices on 12/28/2020 the encrypted CD that
contains a copy of the file and requests that the
term initially set in the letter dated 12/23/2020 to formulate the second
pleadings and provide documents.

In writing signed and notified electronically on 01/13/2021, accepted by the
claimed on 01/14/2021, the instructor of the file informs you that:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of article 76.1 of Law 39/2015, of the Procedure

procedure until expired on 01/15/2021.”

TENTH: Additional arguments of the one claimed to the agreement to initiate the
proceedings. (I) Presentation of your allegations in the AEPD. (II) Allegations
supplements made.

I. On 01/20/2021 a "Receipt for presentation at the Registry Office" is generated,
issued by GEISER (Integrated Management of Registry Services), registration number
O00007128e2100001973, referring to the alleged presentation by the respondent of a
brief of complementary allegations to PS/240/2019, without the aforementioned receipt
No writing or document will be attached.

The receipt issued by GEISER contains, among others, these indications: “Date
presentation: 01/20/2021 10:38:13 (peninsular time)”; “Type of documentation:
Digitized attached documentation”; “Interested: Equifax Ibérica, S.L.”. Also, low
the heading “Registry Information” indicates: “Type of subject: entry”;
“Summary/subject: Complementary arguments to PS 240/2020”; "Unit of
processing destination/Directive Center: Data Inspection-XXXXXXXXX/Agency
Spanish Data Protection”.

Taking into account that with the receipt of presentation of GEISER it did not enter the registry
of the AEPD nor the document mentioned, "Complementary allegations to the PS
240/2019”, nor any other, on 01/21/2021 the instructor of the file, through
communication notified electronically to EQUIFAX, informs you of this incident and
that, having carried out the pertinent technical checks, the IT services of
the Agency considered that the issuer of the shipment -the claimed one- did not get to go up to the
did not see any document or, if it did, it made an error that determined that the
shipping was unfeasible.

Also on 01/21/2021 there is evidence of another "Receipt of presentation in
Registry Office”, issued by GEISER, in which the date of presentation appears
on 01/20/2021, at 21:34:58 (Peninsular time); the reference O00007128e2100002152
and as interested Equifax Ibérica, S.L., in which it appears as "Summary/subject"
“Request for extension of the deadline for submitting evidence”.

Given this fact -that on 01/21/2021 there were two GEISER entrances from
EQUIFAX, referring to "Complementary arguments to PS/240/2019" and "Request
extension of the deadline for presenting evidence”, with which neither the
document that the entity claimed to provide or any other - and, since, according to the
information offered by our computer application the claimed had not yet
accepted the electronic communication that was sent to you on 01/21/2021 to
inform you of what happened regarding the first entry, the instructor of the file
send an email to the EQUIFAX representative, at the email address
contained in the form used for the presentation of documents relating to
this procedure, in which both incidents are brought to your attention.

The email sent on 01/21/2021 at 1:12 p.m. has been incorporated into the
file by diligence of the instructor signed on 01/21/2021.

EQUIFAX responded to the email on 021/21/2021 at 8:48 p.m. and
explained that they had submitted the two documents electronically again,
supplementary arguments to the initial agreement and request for extension of the term
for the provision of evidence. On 01/22/2021, this Agency continues without receiving the
EQUIFAX documentation, which is communicated to the entity through another email
email from the instructor sent at 9:59 am. On 01/24/2021 at 1:51 p.m.
the EQUIFAX representative sends an email in which he states that
both letters have been sent again through the headquarters of the AEPD and attached the
supporting document All these communications exchanged via email have been
incorporated into the file by means of a diligence signed by the instructor on
01/25/2021.

II. On 01/24/2021, the document of
complementary allegations to the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure
filed by the defendant.

In said brief, after requesting that "allegations be considered formulated in relation to
with the content of the administrative file of which he was not aware until his
referral on December 28, 2020, and they should be considered
complementary to those formulated in its day to the Start Agreement...”, makes these
requests:

That the nullity of the procedure be declared null and void for the reasons that
detailed in the first allegation of the allegation brief; subsidiarily, the file
of the procedure and, in a subsidiary manner with respect to this last claim, the
imposition of a warning or caution or a significant reduction in the
amount of the fine established in the initiation agreement.

Also, as it did in its first pleadings brief on the initiation agreement, it requests
“[...] the opening, [...] of a trial period in which it can contribute to that AEPD the
documents that it considers necessary in the event that it does not
grant veracity to what was affirmed by my principal in section 2 of the allegation
third of this writing.

The arguments that he uses in support of his petitions are structured in three
allegations:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

62/184

The first allegation is headed “Of the exceptional affectation of the right to
Effective judicial protection derived from the situation that occurred in the file
administrative in this proceeding. In this section he states that "the
administrative file sent by the AEPD was, in the words of the
Control Authority itself, severed in no less than 1,345 pages” and that lacked
of information on said circumstance because, “having processed the same [the
file] by that AEPD without his knowledge”, he had not been able to know the scope
of the administrative file sent. It highlights that, of the complainants "now
incorporated into the file”, the AEPD had only transferred it, for the purposes
of articles 37 and 65.4 LOPDGDD, of three of them.

In this line of argument, he recalls that, in his allegations to the agreement to initiate
08/19/2020, requested “to limit the prosecution of this case to the claims
actually contained in the administrative file, resulting in said
file did not contain any information on 43 of the relationships to which
referred to the initial agreement. However, more than four months after
formulate such allegations, the AEPD informs him that the file was
“amputated” in more than 30 percent of its length; sends you a new copy of the
record and does not give you the opportunity to argue what is appropriate to your rights,
"Limiting itself to agreeing a delay in the start of the probationary period."

The respondent affirms that this way of acting is contrary to the regulatory regulations
of the administrative procedure, articles 65.2.f) LPACAP and 89.1 of the same text
legal, regarding which he comments that “the process of hearing the
interested parties and the right of the accused to formulate allegations, in view of the
administrative file, are configured as an essential guarantee of the
procedure, being the reflection in the sanctioning administrative procedure of the
right to effective judicial protection that assists the accused.”

It concludes from the foregoing that "the action of the AEPD in the present case, [...] supposes
a violation of their right to defense, which makes the procedure incur in
the vice of nullity established in article 47.1 e) of the LPACAP, since it has been
dispensed with such an essential procedure as the hearing of the defendant in a
penalty procedure. And said vice cannot be remedied by the fact that my
principal issues these allegations.”

Regarding the alleged omission of the hearing procedure, it makes these considerations:

On the one hand, that the principles applicable to the procedure have not been respected
sanctioning party “by not having been able [...] to have real knowledge of the file, except
with the scope of which was notified prior to the formulation of its
allegations to the Initiation Agreement.” It explains that “The AEPD affirms that said file
must be completed until conforming to the one that was submitted and registered in the
offices of my principal on December 26, 2021, despite the fact that said file
does not correspond to the one previously sent for allegations, on the sole basis
to affirm, in the document notified to my principal, that said file is the
complete and that it must replace the one previously notified.” That, "despite ignoring the
reasons why it was not sent at the appropriate time of the procedure the
complete administrative file, as it is recorded in a procedural act issued by the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

63/184

instructor” is not going to question such a statement. Add that we are in this
case “in the absence of more than 30 percent of the file and that “there is not even
correlation between the indices of the two submitted files. That is, not only
produces an addition of 1435 pages to the file, but also that supplement
is interspersed throughout the entire procedure, which makes it even more difficult to adequately
exercise by my principal of his right to defense.”

It indicates that the violation that has occurred throughout the processing of this
procedure, "is even more aggravated when in his letter of December 23,
2020 the AEPD not only does not grant any term to my client for the issuance of the
cited allegations, but more abundantly seems to give it the
concession or grace consisting of delaying the initiation of the trial period for
within ten days from the delivery of the aforementioned “completed” file or
"supplemented".

Through the second allegation of the brief of complementary allegations to the
initial agreement is ratified in the allegations made in his brief of
allegations to the start agreement of 08/19/2020. As for “what constitutes the
substance” of the sanctioning procedure, ratifies what was stated in the allegations
third to sixth of his brief and reiterates "the full legality" of his actions in relation to
with the IJF. He reiterates what he stated in his first allegations about "the scant,
when not non-existent, link” between the issues that are debated in the
sanctioning procedure and the claims that were made.

The third allegation of the complementary arguments brief is entitled
“About the claims not included in the file in its additional remission and
that are included in the nine version sent on December 26, 2020”.

It begins by referring to the fact that, in general, the claims included in the
that she calls “this new version of the administrative file” have
features largely similar to those of the claims on the
copy of the file initially provided by the AEPD, but, unlike those,
In this group, it is exceptional that the AEPD transferred the claim to the
effects provided for in articles 37 and 65.4 LOPDGDD.

The respondent understands that the AEPD issued the agreements for admission to processing without
know or assess any point related to the claim, except for the reference
to the "treatment of the data in the file of judicial and administrative incidents", and
decided to admit them for processing even when the documentation provided
by the claimants it appeared that the claims were made “with respect to
requests that were still pending a response by EQUIFAX, made
reference to the processing of claimants' data in files other than the FIJ or
that were not even accompanied in some cases by the slightest
information regarding the formulation of such claims”.

Regarding the period between the date on which the claim was filed with
the AEPD and the date on which the Agency agreed to admit it for processing highlights that
“It is extremely prolonged, sometimes reaching a duration close to
eighteen months".
 

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

64/184

It maintains that, from the content of the file, it is concluded that "the AEPD considers that
admission for processing is nothing more than a formality that must be fulfilled, without taking into account
account the legally established term or by the mere presentation of a claim
when, probably, it has already been decided, without carrying out an inspection
any, initiate a sanctioning procedure and with the sole objective of increasing even
plus the file.”

Next, the respondent analyzes the claims and groups them into the following
categories: A first group formed by the cases in which the entity responded to
the claims of the interested parties and, in addition, proceeded to the deletion of the data
with respect to which the owner had exercised this right. In it includes
the claimants identified with the numbers 22; 47; 48; fifty; 67; 80; 87 and 96.

Regarding this group of claims, he comments that “in practically all of the
assumptions listed, the claims were filed with the AEPD when
The legally established period of one month had not yet elapsed to give
response to the petitioner's request. And he adds that even in some cases,
like that of claimant 87, the terms were not greater than one week. mentions
the case of claimant 80, in which the claim before the AEPD was made after
that the claimed party had complied with the right of suppression, as a consequence of
have provided the documentation that accredited the payment of the debt included in the
FIJ, and in which the AEPD agreed to admit the claim for one year and two months
after the date on which it should have been done, 06/11/2020, fifteen months
after the date of the complaint and fourteen months after the response of the
claimed to the AEPD.

A second group made up of those claims in which the interested parties
exercised before the respondent the right of access to their data held in the FIJ, which
was attended by her in a timely manner, and, without having sent her a request in
In this sense, the interested parties claimed before the AEPD "the lack of attention of the
right of erasure”; right that either had not been exercised before the claimed
“Either it was simultaneously or even later before [the respondent], alleging
issues such as that the treatment was not based on their previous
consent, that the collection of data from bulletins and newspapers was not lawful
officials or even that the Author Administration of the publication expressed its
disagreement with the very existence of the FIJ.” He cites as an example the claims
presented through the representation of Inzertia regarding the claimants 23;
24;46; 47; 64; 66; 68; 69; 70; 71; 74; 79; 81; 82; 83 and 84. It also highlights that,
Regarding claimant 47, the data was deleted despite the fact that it was not
That's your initial request. And regarding claimant 80, despite having exercised the right
of access, he was informed that there were no data in the FIJ.
 
A third group of claims would include those in which the
interested parties exercised the rights of “access, rectification, cancellation and opposition”,
"which makes the response by my client extremely complicated." In this
of course there would be the claimants 76; 85; 90; 91; 92; 93 and 94.

The respondent declares that, with respect to the claims framed in this
category, since the cancellation was requested, its origin was analyzed, but not
it was possible to grant it “by not providing information about the satisfaction of the

28001 – Madrid

debt." He says that it was also not possible to attend to the request for opposition "because
The interested party may provide any information about the special circumstances
derived from her personal situation that protected her. For this reason, it was requested
all cases, the provision of additional information.”

Another group would be made up of those claims in which the
claimed the deletion of a certain data included in the FIJ but in which the
The interested party did not provide the information proving that the debt had been satisfied.
In this case would be the claimants 21; 49; 73; 86 and 89. In addition, it indicates the entity,
that “these assumptions, as reasoned in the allegations to the Initiation Agreement, are
exercises of the right of suppression and not of the right of opposition, given that what is
affirms is that the treatment is not lawful because the debt is paid (article
17.1 d) of the RGPD).

Finally, it refers to a group made up of various claims: The
claimant 78, of which he says that he does not refer at any time to the FIJ or the
reference to it can be found in the administrative file, so there is no

identification. Or that of claimant 95, who entered the AEPD on 05/06/2019 and did not

EQUIFAX maintains, after analyzing the 43 claims that "now appear in the
administrative file and of which this party was not aware”, that his
action was respectful of data protection regulations and that, as already
stated in his pleadings to the initial agreement, "it is not possible to appreciate the existence of
a real relationship between the claims made and the legal basis of the
Agreement, appearing, to be said with all due respect, that the aforementioned claims
they act rather as an excuse to justify the opening of a file of the
magnitude of the present that as the foundation of what later considers
attributable to my principal the sanctioning body”.

claimed and first request for proof. (III) Request for extension of the term for
respond to the requested tests. (IV). Respondent's response

I. In accordance with the provisions of article 77 of the LPACAP, on the date
01/19/2021 it is agreed to open a trial phase in the sanctioning procedure for
a maximum period of fifteen business days. This is stated in the diligence signed in that
date in the file.

II. In writing signed on 01/19/2021, notified electronically and accepted by the
claimed on 01/20/2021, you are informed of the opening of the test phase and the
evidentiary proceedings to be carried out.

ninety-seven claims mentioned in the Background of the settlement agreement
of PS/00240/2019 and its attached documentation; (ii) the documents generated and
obtained by the Subdirectorate of Inspection in the informative request prior to the

EQUIFAX, in which it requests the extension of the term for the second allegations to the
initiation agreement and (vi) the response letter from the instructor of the procedure that
the respondent was notified on 01/13/2021.

It is convenient to review here -although this means altering the chronological order
followed in the account of the actions carried out - that, on a date subsequent to the written
of notification of opening of the test phase, by diligence dated
02/11/2021, the instructor of the file recorded that there were
incorporated into
the second
allegations/complementary allegations of the one claimed to the initial agreement, which
they had entered this Agency on 01/24/2021. This was requested by the respondent in a

1.- To the question formulated in point 4.1., in which he was required to provide a
copy of the record of data processing activities (hereinafter, RAT)
related to the FIJ and it was expressly requested that he provide the date on which
prepared the document, responds by providing five documents, four of which
correspond to the initial version of the FIJ RAT and the fifth to the final version. Without

requested nor does it appear in any of the five documents provided.

The initial version of the RAT is included in documents 1 to 4. All of them have
the first folio the legend “Register of treatment activities. Article 30 GDPR. v
01”. They have, respectively, this “Registry Name”:
“Downloading information from public sources”; “Generation and sending of files to
other platforms”; "Integration of information in B.D." and “Access to the judicial file”
.
The fifth document contains the final version. The first page indicates: "Registration of
Treatment Activities. Article 30 GDPR. Final V”. “Registry Name.
Download, generation and integration of information from public sources by
EQUIFAX and access to the file by clients”. In the RAT, final version,
section 3, "Purposes of the treatment" indicates, schematically, the phases of the
processing and its purposes.

The first, the "download of information", "in pdf format from the page of the BOE and
of the TGSS. The purpose of this activity is to generate the following files
main: BORME, Administrative Notifications, Claims and Judicial”.
Once the loading and updating of the information in Pick is finished, the lists are saved in
database (registrations, modifications and cancellations of records in Pick) that serve as a source
of information to other environments, platforms and products, guaranteeing the integrity
of the shared information. “Once the files are downloaded in the directories
and having processed the information and prepared the format of
loading, the information is integrated into the database.” And finally,
“Once the information is integrated, the entities that have contracted the service access (for
name and surnames or DNI) to the Equifax database to be able to do the analysis
of solvency on the interested parties.”

Point 8 of the RAT, final version, which is headed "Deadlines for suppression of the
information", it says: "The information is accessible for 3 months and then
saved in a Linux directory in order to be able to work later with the
data. Said information, saved in “PDF” format, will be available for a
period of 10 years from the date of publication, and this for the sole purpose of being able to
deal with possible claims and respond to requests for information
by the competent administrative body, as well as the courts and
courts." In the initial version, document 4, there is a clause 8 identical to the one
we have transcribed (emphasis ours)

2.- To the question formulated in point 4.4., regarding the weighting of the
conflicting interests and rights in the processing of data that the entity carries out
through the FIJ and in which it would have concluded that the interests or
fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested parties against the interests
persecuted by her or by third parties, she responds that she has already provided this document with the
arguments to the initial agreement but which, nevertheless, facilitates it again.

Document number 8 that is provided for this purpose in this procedure –“LIA Judicial File.
Legal Analysis. December 2019”- is the same that was sent to the AEPD as an annex to
the allegations to the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure. In their
allegations to the initial agreement and in its response to the evidence process the one claimed
has warned of the confidential nature of the documentation and, moreover, the document
Number 8 bears the indication “Internal use only” on its first page.

The Document called LIA Judicial File, very extensive and whose content
consists, in essence, of a reiteration of the arguments put forward by the
claimed in their pleadings; in reflections on the action that would be
desirable that the AEPD adopted in this matter and in the description of the measures
that it intends to adopt, but without specifying the dates, is structured in the
following epigraphs from which we extract the most relevant content:

1.Scope of this report. Indicates that the purpose is to determine if the treatment
carried out as a consequence of the capture of public access sources would be
legitimized in accordance with the personal data protection regulations.

2. Regulatory evolution in Spain of the sources accessible to the public and evaluation of
solvency. Organic Law 5/1992, of October 29, regulating
of the automated processing of personal data (LORTAD); the law
Organic 15/1999, on the protection of personal data (LOPD), in particular
articles 3.j; 6.2.; 28 and 29.1 and the Development Regulation of the LOPD, approved
by Royal Decree 1720/2007 (RLOPD). It refers to the RGPD and the fact that the
term public access sources appears only in Recital 61 and in the
article 14.2.f. Cites Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
and Guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD) and refers in particular to the
articles 11.3.b) and article 4.2.d)

3. General considerations on the legitimate interest as a legitimizing cause of the
treatment of personal data. Indicates that this legal basis of the treatment does not

measures aimed at accrediting their concurrence. This requires proper analysis.
of the requirements demanded in the precept to be able to conclude that an operation of
treatment is covered by it. He mentions here the Opinion 6/2014 of the GT29 and the
methodology that describes to verify the origin of the application of the base
law provided for in article 7.f) of the Directive as well as the STJUE of 11/24/2011.

4. Concurrence of the prevailing legitimate interest in the treatment of the information of
public access sources. In the analysis distinguishes: 1. The legitimate interest of Equifax; two.
The legitimate interest of the credit system; 3. The legitimate interest of the insurance sector; Y
4. The legitimate interest of the insurance sector for the prevention of fraud.

Regarding section 1, (the legitimate interest of EQUIFAX) says that the RGPD does not
contains a provision such as article 29.1 LOPD on which, it says, "legitimized
the credit bureaus to the processing of personal data obtained from records
and sources accessible to the public. He adds that the fact of not having defined these
concepts (that of public access sources) “by itself would not simply exclude the
legality of the processing of data from these sources, and in particular from the
Bulletins and Official Gazettes, taking into account their universal accessibility by
any person, although the presumption of prevalence of the disease would no longer apply.
legitimate interest established by the previous regulations.” and cites in support of his thesis the
Judgment of the CJEU of October 24, 2011, paragraphs 44 and 45:

Regarding judicial notifications, he points out that Equifax only includes in its
judicial information files procedures processed by the Courts of
First Instance, First Instance and Instruction (excluding in any case the
judgments of faults), of the Mercantile and of the Social. In this way, it does not proceed to
processing of data related to criminal jurisdiction.

Regarding administrative infractions, the RGPD does not contain a provision
with respect to them, so it does not establish any limitation or specialty in relation
with your treatment. However, the first two sections of article 27 of the
LOPDGDD establish a special regime for this type of treatment, although,
judgment of the defendant, the precept exceeds the limits in relation to the powers that
GDPR recognizes member states. Then add:
“Given this situation and, specifically, taking as an interpretive criterion the Judgment
of the Superior Court of Justice of the European Union, (Second Chamber) of May 4
of 2017, we believe that the AEPD should follow the same line
interpretation than the one followed by the jurisprudence, to the extent that the data
manifestly public or from public sources should be framed within the
legitimate interest in its subsequent use, when the purpose pursued is to provide
operators in the market the most reliable information possible in order to help the
proper functioning of the market in our country, because in this case there is no
would be violating fundamental rights, as is the case with the SIC of art.

underlining is ours)

Remember the general conditions of reuse of the BOE website and that
Equifax extracts from it information related to seizures, auctions, claims
administrative, published by the General Treasury of the Social Security and the
Agency
You understand that there may be a reasonable expectation, on the part of the interested parties
(whose data have been published in the BOE, BORME or TGSS) of use of your data
for the purpose of evaluating your solvency in a credit application, when
has previously proceeded to claim the payment of a tax debt or the
Social Security that is still pending payment, purpose for which, said data,
would be integrated into the Judicial file of Equifax.

It concludes by saying: “we consider that the legitimate interest of
Equifax in the treatment of said information in order to judge the solvency of the
potential borrowers, prevent fraud in contracting financial products and
of insurance, whose debt data with public administrations appear in

consequently, for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued by the entity
manager of the system, the entities participating in it and the
consumers in their capacity as potential beneficiaries of financing, it has already been
indicated that the knowledge of delinquency information from sources
such as the BOE or the page of the Social Security Treasury is a measure
suitable for the achievement of the objective pursued.”

6. Impact of the treatment of sources accessible to the public on the rights and
freedoms of those affected.

It says that the processing of data related to the download of Judicial information
such as (CIF/NIF/NIE, name of the defendants/bankruptcies and
plaintiffs, addresses, amounts of seized movable property, names and
mail of the bankruptcy administrator, social security number, name and address to whom
claims the debt) implies an affectation to the privacy of consumers.

However, the fact that this limitation occurs would not impose
necessarily a weighting of the aforementioned right over the legitimate interests that
have been described as long as the due guarantees are adopted that
allow legitimate interest to prevail over the limitation of privacy that
involves treatment.

And he warns: “In any case, it must be taken into account that the treatment being
referring only to breaches of obligations
monetary, financial or credit of the applicant of a credit or insurance, as it happens
with the SIC of art. 20 of the LOPDGDD. This means that the system in no
case is intended to reveal additional information that refers to said
subject or other data other than those published by publicly accessible sources.

Therefore, the level of interference of the treatment in the private sphere of the affected
must be modulated according to this objective condition and the fact that it does not reveal
additional information to the situation of credit default of the interested party.”

7. Operation of EQUIFAX files with information obtained from sources
public access.

At this point in the document it is indicated: “Through the process of Charges of
Judicial information and BORME it is possible to import very useful information for
Equifax on natural and legal persons that is published in free access media
such as the BOE or the page of the Social Security Treasury.

The database in which this information is integrated and consolidated is managed by
the Operations area and is called Pick It should be noted that there are additionally
enrichment processes of the data contained in Pick by importing
of files from information providers and other public sources.
(emphasis ours)

From this Pick database, the information is exploited to generate products for
Equifax customers and is also used to feed other files
company databases and platforms: Host (IT), EDEN (UK), SAS (D&A) and
Oracle.

The document includes a table that “describes the complete flow of the process,
starting with downloading and obtaining information from external sources,
continuing with the processing of this information and ending with the loading or
integration in the Pick database, generating the files: BORME, Notifications
Administrative (Pre-judicial), Claims and Judicial. The result obtained is
a complete and integral Pick database with quality information and that serves the
source data for a large number of Equifax processes and products. It is important
know that the key field of the records contained in Pick is the identifier of
person (natural or legal). This identifier can be the CIF, NIF, NIE, Number of the
Social Security or a provisional number assigned to you. This identifier is
relates to the rest of the information in the registry, each data being associated
directly to the data source from which it was obtained.” (emphasis ours)

The products that are currently generated with this information are the following:
Judicial Consultations (Batch); Consult Bankruptcy Situations (Batch); queries
ASNEF File Companies by Third Parties (Batch); Consultations File ASNEF Companies

7.1. Downloading and obtaining data from external sources and processing of files.

It is the process by which Equifax downloads and obtains all the necessary information
to incorporate into the Pick database. In the table in Annex I that includes the
document describes, among other issues, the main data obtained, the
data sources and the download website so that, later, it can be carried out
its integration in the Pick database correctly.

The files that are downloaded automatically are initially stored in the
directories of the production machine and those that are downloaded manually are
are initially downloaded to a network repository that is the same as the
they deposit the downloaded files automatically and processed. “IT generates backups
from this network directory, but the original files will be kept according to the
retention periods defined according to GDPR. This solves the problem
of access to historical information since, according to regulations, files can only be
be in BOE for consultation for 3 months.”

7.2. Recording criteria for defendants, plaintiffs or debtors.

Every record that is going to be integrated into the database must comply with the
following requirements, distinguishing between natural and legal persons. Regarding
natural persons: It must be a contactable person, by full name or by
complete address, we will have to take into account several concepts
•
When only DNI/NIE is published, we will check the database. In
If we have a history of this DNI/NIE, we can incorporate it, otherwise
we can't incorporate it.
•
  If the name and surnames appear published with full address
we would search the database, in the event that all the data matched the
we would select, otherwise we would assign a provisional number.
•
we could not integrate them.
•
surname or a name (a word) we could not integrate it.

Next, the document jumps from point "7" to point "IV" which is signed
“Description of the guarantees and the rules of operation of the file of
judicial information.

In this section IV it indicates that, “Once the existence of a legitimate interest has been described
enough that it could be considered as a legal basis for the treatment” and taking into account
Keep in mind that this treatment supposes a limitation of the right to privacy of the
affected, analyzes "the guarantees that the system is going to establish in order to reinforce the
protection of the rights of the interested party” following the constitutional jurisprudence
cited. And adds:
“At this point, it should be noted that, as has been said before, the forecasts
enabling legal provisions for the creation of these systems would allow the same
could be considered covered by the rule of article 6.1 f) of the RGPD through the
compliance with guarantees merely equivalent to those required for systems
of credit information regulated by the LOPDGDD.” The document does not specify the
date on which these guarantees are to be adopted.

1. Guarantee of data protection principles:

1.1 Principle of finality
It indicates, among other things: “On the other hand, the principle of finality includes the limitation
of the subsequent uses of the data, since the RGPD prohibits in its article 5.1 a)
the subsequent processing of the data for purposes incompatible with those that motivated its
collection, although excepting from this limitation the use of data for the purpose of archiving
public interest or scientific or statistical research.

The statistical treatment of the data contained in the file, once
After the period established for its conservation, which we subsequently
we will refer, it is undoubtedly useful to have an adequate knowledge of the
behavior of the company in relation to credit, being able to analyze the
evolution of the habits of the citizens in this matter or of the level of
indebtedness, particularly if confronted with the evolution of the economic cycle.

For this reason, Equifax anticipates the further use of the data for statistical purposes. Nope
However, in order to fully guarantee the rights of those affected, so that
the information cannot be associated with identified or identifiable persons, will submit
that data to an aggregation process, so that the data can no longer
stand out for a particular subject. In addition, this operation will be carried out
with a minimum level of aggregation of twenty subjects per category, so that no

affected. Therefore, although it might be possible to use the data, even
pseudonymized, for statistical purposes, only that prior use will be carried out
aggregation of the same, so as to prevent their singularization in the future.”

1.2 Principle of minimization.
The full guarantee of the principle of minimization is intended, so that the systems
do not include any information that is not absolutely essential to
to assess the creditworthiness of customers. The data whose inclusion in the system
would be essential for the proper fulfillment of its purpose, without
incorporate any other additional information, even when it could be
relevant for the achievement of said purpose, are those that appear in Annex I as data of.

corresponding period is adequate for the purpose pursued by the data file.
judicial information, also taking into account that this is the term included in the
Article 20.1 d) of the LOPDGDD.

1.4. accuracy principle
In compliance with this principle and given that the edictal publication only
recognizes the existence of the obligation to satisfy what is owed, but there is no
of additional information that allows to know effectively if that amount is
due at the time of listing notification, a possible solution to this
problem would be the limitation of very short deadlines referring to the aforementioned
communications, and in the analyzed system this requirement is met, by reducing the
term to the publications occurred in the last five months. However, this
reduction does not allow to fully avoid the risk derived from the treatment of
these data, being able to see the qualification of an interested party negatively by the
fact of incorporating an edictal notification referring to a debt already satisfied by the
same way that the subject could be favorably affected

proceeded to pay the amount due.

1.5 Guarantee of the Principles of purpose and minimization in access to the file.
Enabling assumptions and uses of the data. Data likely to be accessed.
The application of the principles of purpose and minimization will be reinforced as soon as
access to data with the application of the following guarantees:

- Only entities that maintain a relationship with their clients will be able to access the data.
relationship that determines the inclusion of your data in a SIC or to which those affected
have requested the conclusion of a contract whose execution would determine the inclusion
of such data.

sedeagpd.gob.es

75/184

- Measures will be adopted to sanction or even expel from the system those
entities that carry out unauthorized access to data.
- The data related to the previous consultations of the file, which will not include the entity
who had accessed it will only refer to the accesses produced in
the last six months.

In any case, the entities could not use the information collected from the file of
public sources in order to know the functioning of the sector nor
in order to send any type of commercial offer to those who do not have the condition
of its clients.

2. Transparency and information to interested parties
In cases of treatment based on the prevailing legitimate interest,
reinforce the mechanisms of information to the interested party about the treatment of the
data, in the terms established in article 14 of the RGPD.

2.1 Information subsequent to the collection of data from public sources
Equifax must inform the interested party about the inclusion of their data in the file.
in compliance with art. 14 of the RGPD: It will correspond to Equifax to accredit the
compliance with the duty to inform, regardless of the means used to do so.
It says that the data contained in the file of public sources will not be accessible
by the adhered entities as long as the term of thirty
days established for the SIC in art. 20 LOPDGDD. In addition, the information referred
to the notification made, it is incorporated into the notification database, in order to
prove compliance with the AEPD.
The data referring to the cases in which the
occurred the return of the notification for reasons other than its rejection, unless
that had been sent to the contractual domicile of the debtor and the debtor appeared as
unknown, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.2 d) of the LOPDGDD,
according to which: “For the purposes set forth in article 5.1.d) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, will not be attributable to the data controller, provided that the latter has
taken all reasonable steps to have them removed or rectified without
delay, the inaccuracy of personal data, with respect to the purposes for which
are treated, when the inaccurate data:
d) Were obtained from a public registry by the person responsible”.
In this way, sufficient guarantees are established to determine that there is no
risk in the treatment of this information.

2.2 Material impossibility of information in case of not having the address of the interested party
There are assumptions in which the information published in public access sources
does not include a postal address to which you can make the notification of inclusion in
the terms of art. 14 GDPR.
In these cases, and following the interpretations of the Working Group of article 29,
in the Transparency Guide under the regulatory regime of the RGPD, of 11/29/2017,
revised and adopted on 04/11/2018, it is limited to transcribing the following:
“59. The situation in which it is "impossible" under Article 14.5 (b) to provide
information is an all or nothing situation because something is impossible or not; Nope

period of time, the reasons that caused the "impossibility" no longer exist and it is

3. Rights of those affected
Specific protocols are foreseen to address the rights of articles 15 to 22
of the RGPD, whose requests, in general, will be attended within the term of
fifteen business days from receipt by the person responsible for the file.

3.2 Rights of rectification, deletion and limitation of treatment
a) Rectification The request for rectification must indicate the data that is erroneous and the
correction to be made and must be accompanied by documentation
justification of the requested rectification.
b) Suppression The interested party may exercise the right of suppression with respect to the
data that should not appear in the system, either because it does not correspond to the
reality, either as a consequence of the expiration of the conservation period to which
has referenced in an earlier place. When the right of suppression entails the

c) Limitation of treatment. Article 18 of the RGPD lists the assumptions

especially relevant those related to the cases in which the affected party
exercises the right as a consequence of the invocation of letters a), b) and c) of the
article 18.1; that is, when "the interested party contests the accuracy of the data
personal, during a period that allows the person in charge to verify the accuracy of the
themselves", when "the treatment is illegal and the interested party opposes the deletion of
personal data and request instead the limitation of its use” or when “the
responsible no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the treatment, but the
interested party needs them for the formulation, exercise or defense of
claims”.
In these cases, the problem arises that the exercise of the right at the time
immediately prior to the request for a financial credit operation could
imply that the query of the system yielded an image of the interested party not adjusted to
reality, subtracting from said image certain data that were being
object of valuation and, during that period, had their limited treatment.
It provides that in public source files a rule equivalent to the

illicit treatment, it will be treated as a cancellation proceeding to the deletion of the data in the

that invokes its right of opposition for being included in a database whose
information has been obtained from a public source, the interested parties may exercise their

right of opposition to appear in the Judicial file at your simple request, without the need
to require you to justify said request with specific reasons, except for accreditation of your
identity or current payment certificates in AEAT or SS. In this case, it
will proceed to the exclusion of all your data from the file automatically.

3.4 Automated personal decisions and information to those affected
Article 22 of the RGPD recognizes the right of the affected party not to be the subject of a
decision based solely on the automated processing of your data, including the

4.- The question asked in point 4.5 of the request for evidence was about
the criteria/s that the FIJ uses to organize personal data in its systems
processed so that their owners are duly identified. I know
requested information on both the criteria used initially and the changes
adopted with indication of dates.

The respondent explains that the criteria for integration in the FIJ of the data it captures
referring to natural persons is based on the sources from which they come
since, he says, “The way in which the different public bodies have come
publishing the information, it has varied over time”, so it has had to
adapt to such changes, “so that the holders can be duly and
unequivocally identified. He adds that the last variation in the form of
publication of the data derives from the seventh additional provision of the LOPDGDD.

It should be noted that the respondent has not provided the information requested,
referring to the dates on which the different criteria were adopted. offers us the
following information without specifying on what date you implemented these criteria:

a) In the event that only the NIF/NIE is published: then “it is verified if on the date of
publication, the NIF/NIE in question is registered in the active information
of the FIJ (thus excluding the one that is blocked). Depending on the result
obtained, different actions are carried out:
a´) If the identifier is already included in the FIJ associated with a name and surname,
registers in the FIJ the new published information.
a´´) If that identifier is not included in the FIJ, the record recording is discarded.

b) In the event that the name and surnames and incomplete NIF/CIF are published:
discards the recording of the data in the FIJ file.

c) Cases in which the name + surnames + address is published: Proceed
to the recording of the record in the FIJ file, associating both data.

d) Cases in which only name + surname appears published: In this
Of course, the recording of the data in the FIJ file is discarded.

And he added: “Consequently, it can be concluded from what has been described that only
those notifications that either contain the name and
surnames associated with a complete DNI or NIF (which no longer happens as
consequence of the application of the seventh AD of the LOPDGDD), or to a
determined domicile. Outside of these cases, only those

sedeagpd.gob.es

81/184

data in the event that the information referring to a DNI was already in it
complete and associated with its owner.

4.- The question in point 4.6. dealt with the number of natural persons of which
active data records existed in the FIJ for the last six years, and should
provide the information broken down by years and provide the documentation that serves as
basis for your answer.

The respondent provides two tables with this information. On the one hand, a table with the
“average number” of natural persons that in the period 2016-2021 appeared in the FIJ.
Year 2016: 4,624,312; year 2017: 4,879,391; year 2018: 4,940,225; year 2019: 4,657,196;
year 2020: 4,183,445; year 2021: 3,826,436.

On the other hand, it provides a table with the number of individuals who have been included in
the FIJ since 05/25/2018: In the year 2018: 196,653; in 2019: 62,113; in 2020:
20,193 and in the year 2021: 2,358.

The respondent, despite being expressly requested, does not provide any document
that proves the veracity of the information offered. In addition, it does the following
comments:
That since 05/25/2018 a total of 282,037 natural persons have been included and
produced “a systematic reduction in the number of people included” which is
due “to the progressive implementation of the rules established in the provision
additional 7th of the LOPGDD.
That most of the records that remain in the file are prior to the
entry into force of the RGPD, when article 29.1 of the repealed LOPD established
a term of conservation of the data in the file of 6 years. and concludes by saying
that “[...] most of the records that remain in the FIJ were collected
before the entry into force of the RGPD, when it had not existed by the AEPD
any objection or question of any nature about the sufficiency of
the legitimate basis of the treatment in the file had not been discussed at any time
by the former compliance with the principles established in the regulations of
Data Protection."

5.- In point 4.7. asked about the total annual global turnover during the
financial year 2019. Respond by providing your individual annual accounts
(document 19) as of 12/31/21019 that include a turnover for an amount
net of 42,259,655 euros.

6.- The question in section 4.8 dealt with the economic result obtained by the
claimed during the last six years derived, exclusively, from the activity that
has developed through the FIJ, broken down the result by annuity or, where appropriate,
exercise and documenting your response.

The respondent has provided a table with the amounts of "direct income in
relation to the FIJ access service provided to customers directly
since 2015”. These revenues range between €316,204 in 2015 and
€1,734,763 in 2020. However, the defendant specifies “that the contracting of
other services by clients may include, in addition, the
possibility of consulting the FIJ, agreeing with the clients a joint price for the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

82/184

entire service. In these cases, [the respondent] does not have information
accountant that allows to determine what imputation of the price satisfied by the clients
could be done [sic] to the IJF.” (emphasis ours)

Extreme from which it is concluded that, necessarily, the figure is much higher since the
Most of the entities - we could say that, at least, all of the entities in the
financial- have access to the two files whose services the requested party provides.
This means that the figures provided do not offer a true picture of the result
relative to the FIJ.

On the other hand, the respondent has warned that the information offered does not allow
break down what part of that direct income obtained comes from access to
information relating to natural persons and which of access to information relating to
legal persons, to whom the data protection regulations do not apply, therefore
that, he says, the figures he has provided should be considered discounted. accurate
also that the financial information provided refers to the amount of income
obtained direct, without taking into account the costs, because it does not have a system of
allocation of costs linked to each of the files it manages.

7.- The question formulated in point 4.9. was about the number of associates “who
has and has had the claim” with access to the information offered by the FIJ.

The defendant clarifies again that there are assumptions of direct contracting of the FIJ and
others in which access to the FIJ occurs as a complementary service to the
hired by clients. Indicates that the number of entities that have contracted the
access to FIJ information directly is 18 but that another 310
Entities can access the FIJ as a complementary service to those contracted with
she.

8.- The question in section 4.10. dealt with the documents -to which he alluded in
their allegations to the initial agreement - in which the AEPD, with its actions, "had
concluded unequivocally lawful the action of EQUIFAX”. This, without prejudice to the
Protection of rights resolutions to which he referred in the brief of
allegations to the initiation agreement.

The respondent responds that “The actions of the AEPD that this party is aware of
who have come to ratify both the legitimacy of the data processing carried out by me
represented in the FIJ [...] and that are embodied in specific documents
are the resolutions of the Guardianships of Law that have estimated and confirmed,
Even after the entry into force of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD, the criteria
followed by EQUIFAX to deny the requested deletion in those cases in which
that the interested party did not prove the payment of the debt that was registered in the FIJ. “

It adds that “[...] it respectfully understands that the behavior of the AEPD (unless
through resolutions that even appear in the administrative file) did not
but to show the conclusion that the treatment was lawful and
covered by data protection regulations. To this end, it is necessary to put
manifest that if in a procedure in which an interested party invokes that a data object
of treatment must be suppressed the Control Authority concludes in the
inadmissibility of carrying out this deletion, does nothing other than validate the legality

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

83/184

of the treatment, since otherwise this deletion would proceed, in accordance with
to the provisions of article 17.1 d) of the RGPD.

If the AEPD considered the treatment unlawful, as appears to be derived from this
file, you should have first agreed to the deletion of the data and, then,
require EQUIFAX to carry out the necessary actions to adapt the
treatment to current legislation on the matter. However, the AEPD did not take
none of these decisions, but confirmed that the data to be deleted
requested should remain in the IJF. (emphasis ours)

In this way, the conduct of the AEPD reveals its opinion that the
treatment carried out by EQUIFAX was completely in accordance with the regulations
of data protection (we insist that also after the full application
of the RGPD, as stated in the file), so such resolution is a
unequivocal statement of the AEPD on compliance with the regulations of
data protection by EUIFAX, embodied in an administrative act endowed with full
enforceability.”

TWELFTH: Test phase. (I) Second request for evidence to the one claimed. (II)
Request for extension of the term to respond (III) Respondent's response to the
tests.

I. In writing signed by the instructor on 02/01/2021, whose electronic notification
It is accepted by the recipient on 02/02/2021, the requested new
tests (second tests or additional tests). The entity is required to:
within ten days, provide the following documents and/or explanations:

“1.-That, with respect to the File of Judicial Incidents and Public Bodies
(FIJ), detail the protocol that EQUIFAX has had implemented during the six
previous years aimed at guaranteeing that the personal data that
are included in said file were at all times
duly updated. You must provide the documentation that proves your
demonstrations.

2.- Taking into account that EQUIFAX has argued that when the data
are incorporated into the FIJ directs communications to those affected in order to
to inform them of their inclusion in that file, detailing the means
that you use and have been using for the last six years to carry out
the communications you have alluded to. You must provide the documentation that
substantiate your claims.

3.- What percentage of the incidents incorporated into the FIJ during
each of the preceding six years were communicated by EQUIFAX to the
affected. You must provide the documentation that proves your statements.

4.- Regarding the communications that EQUIFAX would have sent to the
affected by notifying them of the inclusion of their personal data in the FIJ, which
detail what percentage of those sent were returned to EQUIFAX or were
unsuccessful for other reasons. You must provide the documentation that proves
its manifestations.

5.- To send a copy of the document that EQUIFAX makes available to
its associates/clients regarding the use that they can make of the data
to which they access through the FIJ (exclusively that part of the
document dealing with such issue). You must provide the document/s
provided during the last six years in case they have been modified
during this time. If you provide several versions, you must specify the date
during which each was in effect.”

II. On 02/09/2021, this Agency received a document from the claimant in the
that, in addition to requesting that, by virtue of the provisions of article 76 of the LPACAP,
consider reproduced for the purposes of evidence the complementary allegations that
filed on 01/24/2021, requests that the period initially set be extended by five days
to answer additional tests. The extension of the term is agreed
requested, a fact that is communicated to the claimed party in writing dated 02/11/2021,
notified electronically on the same date, which was accepted by the addressee on
02/12/2021.

III. Respondent's response to the second request for evidence.

On 02/23/2021, the response is received at the electronic headquarters of this body
from the one claimed to the additional evidence requested; writing that takes as
title “Response to the request for additional information made by the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. February 23, 2021” and consisting of 6 pages.

He begins his response by invoking the "confidentiality and business secrecy of
documents provided together with this brief [...]” with respect to which it requests that
are treated without diffusion of the elements that affect their business configuration
nor to the secrecy of its commercial performance.

However, the respondent has not provided an annex to the brief with any document or
Nor has this Agency received any document at a later date with the
purpose of accrediting the veracity of what was affirmed in his answer to the tests
requested supplements. Extremely relevant because it was required
expressly to provide the documentation that accredits their
demonstrations. The acknowledgment of receipt from GEISER dated 02/23/2021, proves that the
claimed filed on that date, at 22:20:48 (Peninsular time), exclusively,
the reply brief to the second request for evidence. Says nothing about assumptions
attached documents.

The response of the respondent to the additional evidence requested is the
Next:
1.-To the first question he answers: “To guarantee that the data captured in the FIJ
are up to date, Equifax relies primarily on:

1) Limitation of the sources from which the FIJ file is fed: as already reported in
our previous writings, Equifax collects the information that is registered in the FIJ of
the Official Gazettes published by the State, the Autonomous Communities
Provincial councils.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

85/184

The exclusive use of this source guarantees that all the information that is
collects is considered official and authentic as stated in article 3.1 of the
Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the official gazette <<Boletín
State Official>>. Therefore, the use of this source is, in our opinion, a
guarantee that there are no doubts about the updating and veracity of the
information incorporated into the FIJ.
The newsletters are downloaded the same day they are published, so the information
of the FIJ is updated daily with the information contained in the Bulletins.

2) Automatic information capture processes: downloading bulletins and
subsequent registration of the data in the FIJ is carried out through automated processes
thus avoiding possible errors from manual processes. for reading
the data of the bulletins are used OCR reading processes that guarantee the
correct reading and recording of the data published in the bulletins

3) Recording criteria: as we have pointed out in the answer to the first
request for information from the AEPD, Equifax has implemented criteria for
specific recording and previously detailed to that AEPD, in order to ensure that
the holders are unequivocally identified so that their inclusion in the
FIJ. These criteria guarantee that there is only data on holders duly
identified

4) Notification of inclusion: this part has been made to the holders whose data have
been collected since May 25, 2018, a specific notification of your
inclusion in the FIJ, as a measure to guarantee the updating of the data. sayings
communications allow interested parties, in a free and simple way,
check if indeed the data that have been published by the different
official bulletins and that have been collected by my client contain some error.

5) Attention of Exercise of rights: through the attention of claims of the
holders in the exercise of their rights, the interested parties may, in accordance with the
provided for in the data protection regulations, know what data is included in
the FIJ, for what purpose they are used, and, at all times, rectify, cancel, oppose and
limit the processing of your personal data”.

2.- To the second question he answers, first of all, recalling that the Audience
Nacional reiterated through its Judgments -SSAN of 06/29/2001 (Rec.1012/1999);
11/29/2001 (Rec.531/2000) and 02/27/2008 (Rec. 358/2006)- that the
protection of data contained in the already repealed LOPD did not contemplate a
obligation to notify interested parties of the inclusion of their personal data in the FIJ.
Transcribe the following excerpt from the SAN dated 02/27/2008:

“[...], it must be concluded that the notification of the inclusion is only required in the event
in which two notes concur: that the data refer to compliance or
breach of monetary obligations; and that they are provided by the
creditor or who acts on their behalf or interest. From which it is inferred that, having
taken the personal data, in the case now prosecuted, from the Official Gazette of the
Community of Madrid, there was no obligation to notify its inclusion in the
File of Judicial Incidents to the owner of the same.”

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

86/184

The defendant acknowledges that until the entry into force of the RGPD, it did not carry out
any notification to those affected; which justifies that there was "an express endorsement
in this sense by the National High Court”.

It indicates that, after the entry into force of the RGPD, "within the framework of its obligations of
proactive responsibility established [...] and even when the doctrine of [...]
The National High Court had not been affected", it has considered appropriate to notify the
inclusion of those affected whose data was recorded in the FIJ. However, he warns
continued that “the question of whether or not to carry out such notification has not
definitively adopted within the framework of the existing relationship between the AEPD and
ASEDÍE within the process of elaboration and approval of the Code of Conduct to the
that Equifax has already made repeated reference in its pleadings to the Settlement Agreement
Start."

It adds that the notifications to the interested parties of the inclusion of their data in the FIJ are
carried out through an independent third party, who carries them out through a
auditable procedure.

3.- Answer the third question indicating that, consistent with the above,
You can only provide notification data from 05/25/2018, the date on which you
deemed appropriate to do so. He states that his computer files show that,
since 05/25/2018, they have sent a total of 509,470 notifications.

SIXTEENTH: Request for extension of the term to make allegations to the

90/184

On 03/30/2021, a document from the
claimed in which it requests that the extension of the period initially set be agreed
to formulate allegations to the proposal for the maximum legally permitted.

The AEPD responds to the extension request in writing dated 03/30/2021, whose
notification is accepted on 03/31/2021, in which, under article 32.1 LPACAP,
agrees to extend by one business day the initial deadline set to formulate allegations to the
resolution proposal.

SEVENTEENTH: EQUIFAX arguments to the resolution proposal:

On 04/15/2021, the document has been entered in the electronic registry of the AEPD,
sent by EQUIFAX, by means of which it formulates its allegations to the proposal of
resolution of PS/240/2019 that the entity received on 03/29/2021.

The defendant requests that a resolution be issued declaring the nullity of full right
of the procedure or, where appropriate, its expiration, for the reasons detailed in the
third claim. Subsidiarily, that the file of the procedure be agreed upon not
constitute the conduct object of valuation infraction of the regulations of
personal data protection. Subsidiarily with respect to the previous requests
to impose a sanction of warning provided for in article 58.2 b) of the
RGPD or, failing that, a significant reduction in the amount established in the
proposed resolution in response to "the many concurrent circumstances in
the supposed fact prosecuted, which would suppose a very qualified reduction of the
unlawfulness and culpability of Equifax.”

In support of these claims, it invokes the following arguments:

1. In the first allegation "ratifies and reiterates" in its entirety the content of the
allegations made to the initial agreement because, in his opinion, the proposal for
resolution does not refute in any way what is stated in said allegations.

2. The second allegation deals with the existence of a “medial contest between the
totality of the infractions referred to in the motion for a resolution that prevents
accrue potential sanctions.

It states that the proposal identifies a plurality of infractions that,
allegedly, would have committed EQUIFAX "when in reality all
them subsumed and embedded in other infractions for which the AEPD wishes
sanction [it], giving rise to various cases of medial contest in the
terms provided in article 29.5. of Law 40/2015 [...]”

It affirms that the AEPD cannot sanction EQUIFAX for all of the
infractions to which the proposal refers, since they are clear assumptions of insolvency
medial, so that only one sanction can be imposed, in his opinion, the one that
“wrong”, is imputed with respect to article 6.1.f), in relation to article 5.1.a)
GDPR. It states that, in accordance with article 29.5 of the LRJSP, infractions must
be subsumed in the most serious “we understand that the one that the AEPD imputes with respect to art.
6.1.f) (in relation to article 5.1.a) RGPD”.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

91/184

Considers that, according to what was stated by the AEPD in the proposal, the
infractions attributed to EQUIFAX “[...] cannot be understood to have been committed
one without the other, requiring among them that some be executed to appreciate the
execution of the others”, “[...] insofar as all the infractions allegedly
committed are directly connected and cause one another, it is
inappropriate and contrary to the law to consider them as independent infractions”.

Through six sections, it details the existence of six cases of medial insolvency that
justifies with references to the draft resolution proposal of which he reproduces several
fragments. These assumptions are the following:
a. Appreciates the existence of a first medial contest between the infractions of art. 6.1
(in relation to article 5.1.a) of the RGPD, 5.1.b) and 5.1.d) of the RGPD.
 
It says to this effect: "In this way, the alleged lack of compatibility of the ends together with
with the presumed infringement of the principle of accuracy configure the infringement of the
principle of legality of the treatment, by which it is also intended to sanction
Equifax. As can be seen, there is already a first medial competition with
Regarding violations of art. 6.1 (in relation to article 5.1.a) of the RGPD,
5.1.b) and 5.1.d) of the RGPD.”

It argues that, “regarding the alleged violation of the principle of limitation of
purpose, the AEPD considers, which will be refuted later, that the purpose of the
original treatment and that of subsequent treatment by Equifax are incompatible”.

That the AEPD, in order to determine whether the subsequent treatment is compatible with the
original treatment mentions, among other aspects, “(i) that it does not exist between the
claimants and Equifax have no relationship linked to the context, so that the
affected could not have had any reasonable expectation that their data would be
object of this treatment -quod non- (being the non-existence of expectation of
treatment one of the criteria to determine the alleged violation of the principle
of legality); and that (ii) the File of Judicial Incidents (“FIJ”) fails to comply with the principle of
accuracy in its manifestation of updating the data (quod non), which, from
the point of view of the AEPD, aggravates the adverse consequences for the
claimants whose data have been incorporated into the FIJ.”

It adds that, “Furthermore, the AEPD indicates that the judgment of suitability is not met [...]
every time that, so that the treatment carried out by the FIJ could really satisfy
the interests it invokes, it would be essential that the information on the alleged
debts attributed to the claimants was up to date -principle of accuracy-.”

b. Appreciates the existence of "a second manual media contest [...]" between the
alleged infringements of articles 5.1.b), 5.1.c) 5.1.d) and 14 RGPD, of which
derives the alleged infringement of article 6.1.f) of the RGPD.

The respondent transcribes these paragraphs of the proposed resolution that lead her to
affirm that the AEPD subsumes within the infringement of the principle of legality all and
each of the other infractions that it also imputes:

“As has been stated in the preceding ground, it is proven that the
treatment that EQUIFAX has been doing of the personal data of the claimants
It violates the principle of limitation of the purpose provided for in article 5.1.b) of the RGPD.
This breach has the consequence of causing the legitimate interest invoked

sedeagpd.gob.es

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

92/184

by EQUIFAX, on whose alleged prevalence supports the legal basis of the
processing of data that it carries out (article 6.1.f, RGPD), cannot meet the requirement of
legality.
(…)
The illegality of the interest pursued by EQUIFAX is reinforced by the fact that the
data processing carried out by the FIJ not only violates the principle of limitation of
the purpose (article 5.1.b RGPD), but, as will be explained later, we estimate
that breaches other provisions of the RGPD: the principle of data accuracy (article
5.1.d); article 14 of the RGPD in relation to article 5.1.a) and the principle of
data minimization (article 5.1.c)” (Underlining is ours)

c. Appreciates the existence of a third medial contest between the infractions of the
articles 6.1., in relation to article 5.1.a) RGPD, 5.1.b) and 5.1.d) of the RGPD.
Argue the following:
“Regarding the alleged violation of the principle of accuracy, in the opinion of
the AEPD, the alleged disparity and incompatibility between the purpose of the treatment
originating and the one pursued by the FIJ determines that the information that this file
collects is fragmentary and, moreover, is disconnected from the evolution of the debt.
On the other hand, among other considerations, the Proposal indicates (a point of view that does not
we share) that the FIJ fails to comply with the principle of accuracy also with regard to
the identification of the debt holders and the conclusion that can be drawn is
that it can hardly serve the legitimate interest that it wants to serve linked to the
fraud prevention (which, in case there are any doubts, would be related to the
alleged violation of the principle of legality). (emphasis ours)
d. In point 4 he mentions the existence of two new media contests: The fourth,
between articles 6.1, in relation to article 5.1.a) RGPD, 5.1.b), 5.1.c) and 5.1.d)
GDPR. The fifth between the infringement of article 5.1.c) and 14 of the RGPD.
It refers that "the AEPD considers" that "the alleged violation of the principle of
minimization is nothing but the sum of the alleged infractions of the principles of
limitation of the purpose, accuracy and legality and, in turn, derives in the breach of the
art. 14 of the GDPR.”
To substantiate its allegation, it reproduces the following excerpt from the brief of
proposal:

“Compliance with this principle by the respondent, as is the case with other
principles already examined, such as legality or accuracy, is conditioned by the
infringement of the principle of limitation of the purpose in which the entity incurs with the
collection of data from newspapers and official bulletins that pursue a
purpose incompatible with that of the FIJ.
As a result of the illicit nature of the subsequent processing of the data collected
-that is, the one that the respondent carries out through the FIJ- it is becoming evident that the
data controller is in a situation where it is practically impossible to
respect the rest of the principles that, according to the RGPD, govern the treatment. (…)
As a first point, it should be noted that, as has been shown when examining
other principles, particularly that of accuracy, the data that EQUIFAX obtains through
of bulletins and official newspapers that feed the FIJ are not adequate for the purpose that
pursues the file, so they violate the principle of data minimization. The reason
fundamental is that they do not allow an update of the information referring to the
debtor's solvency. It is added to the above that, while the publication of the data
does not include the address of the owner of the data, the claimed party is not in a position to
to be able to comply with the information obligation provided for in article 14 RGPD”.

and. He alludes to the existence of a fifth media contest -which he already announced in the section
precedent- between the principle of data minimization and article 14 of the RGPD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

93/184

It states that in the opinion of the AEPD "it is not possible to carry out the informative notification to the
interested in lacking the information of the address and that the attempt to link the number
identification of an interested party that is published in an official journal with the information
that is included in the FIJ, constitutes in turn an infringement of the principle of
data minimization (which this part denies).”

In support of this conclusion, he transcribes this excerpt from the proposal for
resolution:

“On the other hand, there is no doubt that EQUIFAX is obliged to inform interested parties
in the terms of article 14 RGPD each time you incorporate your data into the FIJ
personal.
In line with this obligation, we must reiterate what was already stated about the
violation of other provisions of the GDPR. In the behavior analyzed we start from a
illicit treatment of personal data, since data that was treated
initially with a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose pursued by the
subsequent treatment, that is, the FIJ, which conditions, how could it be otherwise,
compliance with the obligations that the RGPD imposes on the data controller
to the point that these are impossible to comply with if it is not infringing
for this other provisions of the RGPD”.

F. The defendant limits itself to mentioning the existence of a sixth medial contest that
would occur between the infractions of articles 5.1.b), 6.1. and 14 of the RGPD.

It should be added that the respondent, when she analyzes in her pleadings brief each one
of the infractions of the RGPD that are attributed to it, affects again the existence
of a medial contest between the different imputed infractions.

3. The third allegation of the brief of allegations to the proposed resolution bears the
heading "Of the vices of nullity concurrent in the present procedure".
 
The respondent appreciates the existence of the causes of absolute nullity provided for in the
sections a) and e) of article 47.1 of the LPACAP. He affirms that these vices of nullity
they have generated real and material defenselessness; that we are not facing a violation
merely formal, but before vices from which a material effect of
helplessness and a real and effective impairment of the right of defense, with the
consequent damage.

The causes of nullity invoked are assessed in relation to the following
behaviors:
a. The inclusion of the amount of the penalties in the initiation agreement, which in his opinion
constitutes a defect of absolute nullity provided for in article 47.1.a) LPACAP:

Reiterates what was alleged in the initiation agreement in the sense that the fixation in it of the
amount of the sanctions that would proceed to impose, without having previously heard the
allegedly infringing party, violates his right to effective judicial protection,
generates absolute defenselessness and implies a breach of the principle of separation
between the instructional and resolution phases of the procedure, for which reason it incurs in
the vice of radical nullity of article 47.1.a) LPACAP.

Rejects the interpretation that the AEPD makes of article 85 LPACAP, in accordance with the
which “the determination of the amount of the sanction and the consequent evaluation of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

94/184

concurrent circumstances in the case comes from what is established in article 85
LPACAP.” Considers that this interpretation is contrary to the Spanish Constitution
violate the protection of the fundamental rights that are granted through it and
that the “efficiency that could be pursued with the determination of the amount of the
sanction in the initiation agreement could never justify the infringement of the rights
fundamental rights of the accused that such an action entails”.

b. Violation by the AEPD of the rules that regulate the procedure
penalty in terms of personal data protection and "the consequent
expiration a limine of the procedure”, which constitutes a vice of nullity of the article
47.1.e) LPACAP.

Affirms that the AEPD has completely and completely dispensed with the procedure
legally established in articles 64 and 67 of the LOPDGDD and has incurred a
abandonment of the powers attributed to it by the LOPDGDD and the RGPD. Abandonment
that has caused him harm “because it has been considered by the AEPD as
aggravating circumstance such as the continuing nature of the alleged infringement
during the period in which the AEPD declined to carry out any offense against
Equifax”.

Regarding the procedure, it transcribes articles 64.2 and 67 of the LOPDGDD and says
that from these provisions it is unequivocally inferred that the LOPDGDD, by
reasons of legal certainty for the company, has established a procedure
regulated and with clearly marked time limits”. Therefore, according to
the foregoing, considers that the admission
to process the claim within a period of three months; the optional execution of
investigative actions for a maximum period of twelve months and the opening of
a penalty procedure. Thus, it affirms that the admission for processing of a
claim by the AEPD implies recognition of the existence of
indications of violation of the data protection regulations and this must imply
-argues EQUIFAX- that prior investigation actions be carried out or, if
considers that the infringement is manifest, as appears to be the case in the present case,
to proceed immediately to the opening of the sanctioning procedure.

In view of the foregoing, the respondent arrives at the "obvious consequence" that if the
The first claim was admitted on May 30, 2019 and the AEPD decided not to carry out
carry out investigative actions “the Agreement to initiate this proceeding
should be from that date, so, being the maximum duration of the procedure of
nine months, the resolution [...] should have been issued on March 2, 2020.” Y
adds: “In this way, the AEPD issued the Start Agreement long after
the date on which the resolution should have been issued if it had met the requirements
established in the data protection regulations, with which all actions
should be considered expired.” (emphasis ours)

It also refers to the situation of "inactivity" in which it considers the AEPD incurred in
in connection with the claims that were brought against EQUIFAX relating to the FIJ.
It supports such a conclusion that of the 97 claims admitted against EQUIFAX only
some of them were transferred to the DPD; in that although all were admitted to
processing some were "without a minimum legal reasoning"; in which the first
claim (claimant 25) entered the AEPD on 05/30/2019 and that the AEPD did not

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

95/184

carried out preliminary investigation actions, so, he affirms, since the admission
to process the claims until the Agency issues the agreement to start the
sanctioning procedure that concerns us, on 07/24/2020, did not carry out any other
action.

c. It mentions the “main circumstances” that have occurred during the
processing of the procedure whose overview shows that the procedure
has been processed with a complete and repeated impairment of the rights that in the
framework of the sanctioning administrative procedure granted by sections 1 and 2 of the
Article 53 of the LPACAP. It refers to the following circumstances:

1. No investigative actions were carried out prior to the opening of the
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.
2.Delay in sending the copy of the administrative file: it is received by the
entity on the penultimate day of the ordinary period granted to claim, although it is granted
by the AEPD the extension of the term for the maximum legally permitted, five days, and
Consequently, he received it when there were only six days left to issue his writ of
allegations. Remember that the submitted file had an extension of 2,974 pages.
3. On 12/23/2020, the AEPD sends you a letter indicating that “there has been
found that, unfortunately, an incident of a technical nature severed part
of the documentation that made up the administrative file. He says that in the quoted
In writing, no period of arguments is granted since it was limited to indicating that the
instructor would not proceed to the opening of the test phase until after the
least ten business days computed from the date of notification of the writing. Add:
“All this without any reference to the principle of integrity of the administrative file
electronic consecrated by article 70.3 of the LPACAP”.
4. "The aforementioned file turned out to be increased to 4,319 (that is, a
extension superior in more than 45% to that of the originally sent file), which
which motivated my principal to expressly request the granting of a term for the
issuance of allegations and that the term for it be extended. The AEPD limited itself to
respond to said request indicating the specific date on which it would agree to open the
trial period, but without expressly granting my client any period to
allegations.” (emphasis ours)
5.The test phase does not start until 01/20/2021, when almost
six months from the opening of the initiation agreement.
6.The proposed resolution is notified to EQUIFAX on 03/29/2021. In it, the two
initial imputations, contained in the initial agreement, are extended with three new
infractions “without any of them resulting from obtaining information
any additional information that could have justified that triple imputation.” warns not to
we are not before a new legal classification of the infractions but before three new
offenses added by the AEPD “[...] in the last stage of the procedure, three
new accusations on a legal basis that could have been used in his
integrity at the time the Initiation Agreement was issued.”
7. That, in accordance with the changes introduced with the proposed resolution, it was requested,
under article 32.1 LPACAP, the extension of the term of allegations by the
maximum legally allowed (five days). However, "the AEPD limits this
extension to the term of a single day in view of the evident risk of expiration of the
process". It states that “In this way, my principal seems to be denied a right
granted by law as a result of the delay in processing the

procedure solely attributable to the performance of that AEPD, which in no case
should result in the detriment of the Administrator.” (emphasis ours)

d. The inclusion of new offenses in the proposed resolution constitutes another
the reasons that -in the opinion of the respondent- cause the radical nullity of the
procedure under article 47.1.a) of the LPACAP.

He explains that the new infractions attributed to him in the resolution proposal
 “right to know the
have generated an undoubted defenselessness by having deprived him of the
specific accusations directed to limine against her and her rights of defense and
provision of means of evidence pertinent to their right, enshrined in article
24.2 of the Constitution as a manifestation of the right to effective judicial protection.” (The
underlining is ours)

 

In his opinion, the determination in the proposed resolution of new infractions
It is not covered by the regulations governing the administrative procedure in
general nor, in particular, in the data protection procedure.
In accordance with articles 89.3 LPACAP and 90.2 that it transcribes, it formulates the following
conclusions:

(i) That it is the initial agreement that will establish the limits over which it may
carry out the definitive qualification in the proposed resolution.
(ii) That the proposed resolution cannot make new imputations. Can
modify the initial rating made in the startup agreement by making an imputation or
imposing a more serious sanction than the one established in the opening agreement, all of this
in accordance with article 64 of the LPACAP. It indicates that not even the Royal Decree
1398/1993, of August 4, which approved the Rules of Procedure
for the Exercise of Sanctioning Power (REPEPOS), repealed by the LPACAP,
provided for the making of new accusations but, solely and exclusively, the
modification of the qualification of the infractions that had already been communicated to the
embedded in the startup agreement.
(iii) That the LPACAP does not allow the proposed resolution to make new
additional allocations to those included in the initial agreement, since this
would cause an irreparable impairment of the rights granted to the accused
(iv) That the additional imputations would require the processing of a new
process.
(v) That any action that is not “the referral of the file to the
sanctioning body in order to resolve on the opening of the procedure
sanctioning in case of coinciding with the assessment of the instructor on the
concurrence of new infractions" would violate the rights of EQUIFAX by depriving it
of the guarantees that the company has recognized in the procedure
sanctioning, in particular in article 53.2 a) of the LPACAP (right to “be
notified of the facts that are imputed to him, of the infractions that such facts
may constitute and the sanctions that, if applicable, may be imposed on them, as well
as well as the identity of the instructor, the competent authority to impose the
sanction and the norm that attributes such competence”).

4. Through its fourth allegation, under the heading “About the valuations made
by the AEPD on the basis of law IV of the resolution proposal”, he maintains,
on the one hand, that the AEPD has violated the principle of legitimate expectations and on the other

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

97/184

that in this case the subjective element of the infraction is missing, in such a way that
no sanction could be imposed by virtue of the principle of culpability recognized in
Article 28 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public (LRJSP)
The first section of this fourth allegation refers to the pre-existing regime at
GDPR and maintains that until the full application of the GDPR, and even after,
until the entry into force of the LOPDGDD "there was an express legal provision that
recognized the legality of information systems that collect information obtained
with the consent of the interested party or from sources accessible to the public for the purpose
to assess the solvency of the interested parties. (emphasis ours)

He mentions alleged reflections expressed in the motion for a resolution, which in no way
case were made, and indicates that article 29.1 of the LOPD was not repealed neither totally nor
partially by the STJUE of 11/24/2011 nor by the STS of 02/08/2012 “nor the same
they supposed a limitation to the application of the precept that legitimized the treatment of
the personal data of the interested parties that were incorporated into sources
accessible to the public.” It says that “For this reason, the statement contained in the
Resolution Proposal, which intends to indicate that the treatment carried out by
Equifax in the FIJ did not find protection in a legal presumption of prevalence of the
legitimate interest, simply lacks the reality of the provisions of the jurisprudence and
the aforementioned regulations.
Once again it states that the AEPD was fully aware of the existence and
operation of these information systems; that even after the
STJUE, has considered sufficient to assess its legality the fact that the data
came from the aforementioned sources accessible to the public and that despite this the
AEPD did not direct any action against the FIJ to reproach the breach of the
data protection regulations.
In proof of these manifestations, he brings up the following actions of the
AEPD:
-The resolution issued in E/04639/2013, in which -it says- the basis for
agreeing on the file was that the file (from Axesor, Incidents Database
judicial) was covered by article 29.1 and 4 of the LOPD.
-The inspection actions mentioned in the resolution issued in the
PS/104/2004, directed against a financial entity that claimed to have collected the
IJF data. The Legal Basis III of the resolution mentions the practice of
an exhaustive inspection in EQUIFAX “in which it was verified, examining the
historical records of the file of Judicial Incidents, which indeed there were
annotations related to the complainant but that do not coincide with those registered in
Bank of Madrid. Therefore, there is no evidence of violation of the regulations of
data protection by Equifax Ibérica, S.L.”
- The SAN of 03/29/2012 (appeal 525/2010), filed by EQUIFAX against the
sanctioning resolution of the AEPD of 05/05/2010, PS/368/2009, of which
Fourth legal basis "it follows the legality of the treatment carried out
for my principal”. The Legal Basis that is transcribed by the entity is the
Next:

“In the brief of conclusions, the appellant details its legal reasoning and
affirms that it is not that he has obtained the data of the complainant outside of a
source of public access and that has treated them without their consent, but
obtaining the data from a lawful source (such as the Bulletins) has added
information from the Bulletins that did not correspond to it.”

98/184

-The numerous procedures processed against EQUIFAX for the alleged
Failure to comply with the obligation to inform the affected party. He states in this regard that the
sanctioning resolutions were annulled by the A.N. in his sentencing
02/27/2008 (Appeal 358/2006).
-The internal report of the General Subdirectorate of the General Register of Protection of
Data issued on 01/25/2019 which -says- “evidence that there is a formal criterion
emanated from a body integrated in the AEPD that pronounces clearly and
manifests in favor of the legality of information systems similar to the FIJ, which
collect relevant information on the solvency of the interested parties from the sources
accessible to the public”. He explains that the report, regarding the information systems
similar to the FIJ, says the following:

In general, the code regulates the collection of personal data, in particular
when it is done through web pages, for which the obligations to
those to which associates are subject (article 6), as well as public sources (article
8). A consideration is made about the sources accessible to the public, of which the
infomediary sector is a traditional user, such as those that can be consulted
by any person without general restriction of access to certain categories of
users, even when a consideration is required (article 8), which is online
with the interpretation that is made of this type of sources, and the principle of
accuracy of the data when they are collected, also in line with what is
collected in article 4 of the LOPDGDD. In addition, in Annex III corresponding to the
marketing activity, includes an expository list of the sources of access
public."

He qualifies as "false" the following argument presented in the proposal, since the
AEPD does not require the complaint of an affected party to carry out actions of
prior investigation:

“For the AEPD to have been able to rule on the legality of data processing
carried out by the FIJ, as claimed by the claim made by this Agency,
It would have been essential that, previously, the Agency had carried out an analysis
on the aspects that have been indicated in the preceding paragraph. And that analysis only
could well have been carried out within the framework of a sanctioning procedure that
had as its object the presumed violation of the principles that, according to the LOPD
presided over the processing of the data through the treatment carried out by the FIJ, or
in response to a query from the Legal Office that the entity would have considered
opportune to raise about the legality of the treatment that was being carried out.”

And underlines the inaccuracy of the comments made in the proposal about the TD
invoked by EQUIFAX because the valuation made in it is incorrect
on the scope of the rights protection procedure.

Concludes from the preceding exposition that the arguments are distorted
exposed in the Legal Basis IV of the proposed resolution.

It also concludes that the FIJ was fully known by the AEPD and that the
treatment has been carried out under the sight, science and patience of this
Control authority that at no time decided to carry out actions of
ex officio nor adopted any decision in terms similar to those that appear in the
resolution proposal. Therefore, the AEPD, says the defendant, fails to comply with the principles
of legitimate trust and legal certainty in the terms described in the
jurisprudence cited in the allegations to the initial agreement.

Starting from the consideration that there has been a breach of the principle of
legitimate expectations with the processing of this sanctioning file, the
respondent understands that the conduct under examination in this proceeding is
absent of guilt His performance, he says, "is situated in a field alien to that of the will
offender" and that "Her action had been known and recognized (if not consented)
by the AEPD itself (and even when the latter differs from this opinion, it is undeniable
that Equifax had reasonable grounds, set forth above, to
consider that it was).

In accordance with the foregoing, it affirms that “all the sanctions referred to in the
Motion for a resolution must be annulled”.

5. The fifth allegation deals with the breach of the principle of limitation of
purpose.
It states that this principle has not undergone any modification in the RGPD, since
reproduces almost entirely what was established by Directive 95/46/CE on it, and,
then goes on to state that "within the system of transposition of the Directive
to our Law [...]” Article 29.1. of the LOPD “did not appreciate that [...] it turned out
contrary to the purpose limitation principle enshrined in Directive 96/46/EC,”
the treatment of personal data carried out by those who are dedicated to the
provision of information services on asset solvency and credit
consisting of the collection of personal data obtained from the records and
the sources accessible to the public established for this purpose.

It also states that “the legal basis that justified the collection of the data subject to
publication [was] to obtain information on the solvency of assets and the credit of the
interested parties based on the available information related to them”, and that
“This legal basis was expressly included in the LOPD,
 owing
Article 29.1 should be interpreted in the sense that the processing was protected
in the prevailing legitimate interest of those who proceeded, like my principal, to
processing of the data, as there is an unequivocal legal authorization for said
treatment could take place. (emphasis ours)
The respondent ends its argument regarding the "non-compliance with the principle of
purpose” with the paragraph that we reproduce:

“In short, the processing of personal data does not take place in this case.
contained in the FIJ for a purpose other than the one that motivated its collection, since
this was precisely what justifies the maintenance of the data in the system and its
access by the entities that were adhered to the FIJ with the purpose of
know the equity solvency and the credit of its debtors or potential debtors,
on the basis of a prevailing legitimate interest that, at least until the entry into
force of the LOPDGDD was expressly enabled by the regulations of
personal data protection." (emphasis ours)

In the same line of argument he says that "this compatibility (or that character "does not
different" from the purpose) was appreciated even after the entry into force
of Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the official newspaper «Boletín
Official of the State» (hereinafter, “RDBOE”), to which the
Proposal". Also, after the entry into force of Law 37/2007, of 16
November, on the reuse of public sector information and Law 19/2013, of

December 9, transparency, access to information and good governance. (The
underlining is ours)

He also makes another equally surprising statement: “[...] it must be remembered that the
measures adopted by RBOE, which would come to reflect the restrictions that
subsequently, with regard to open data, the Group revealed
Working Group of Article 29 (hereinafter WG29) in its Opinion 3/2013 on the
limitation of purpose, [...], do not refer to data processing such as that carried out
carried out by my principal through the FIJ, in which access to information is
limited to creditors or potential creditors of the interested party. These measures, for
On the contrary, they try to avoid an access subject to the condition of creditor, real or
potential, but an indiscriminate access to the data object of publication in the
official journals.” (emphasis ours)

Insisting on erroneous statements, he says: "If you take into account that since 2008, and
Until December 7, 2018, the RBOE coexisted with the regime contained in the
article 29.1 of the LOPD, no other conclusion can be reached than to consider that the
limitations referred to in the first-cited rule cannot be
applicable to the case provided for in the second, which enjoys a legal basis
specific and proper that legitimizes it.” (emphasis ours)

6. The sixth allegation deals with “the legality of data processing in the FIJ and the
application of the weighting rule of article 6.1.f) of the RGPD.”

States that none of the arguments contained in the motion for a resolution is
enough to refute what was stated in his allegations to the initial agreement;
allegations that he considers reproduced and complemented with what he now exposes:
That EQUIFAX has an "obvious legal basis, the concurrence of an interest
prevailing legitimate, for the treatment of data in the FIJ.” Thus, he says that “[...]
These information systems were expressly equipped with a
presumption of prevalence of the aforementioned legitimate interest”. (emphasis ours)

Later he adds:
“Evidently, article 29.1 of the LOPD did not regulate the basic principles or the
legal bases of the treatment, but determined that, based on principles and
legal bases identical to those contained in the RGPD, the processing of data
collected in it was lawful. In other words, either article 29.1 of the LOPD is
overreached with respect to the regime contained in the Directive, enabling nothing less
that a treatment that violated its articles 6 and 7 in the terms assumed by the
Motion for a Resolution, something that neither the Court nor the Institutions of the Union
Union (and even less so the AEPD itself) did not even insinuate at any time or,
principles and legal bases remaining immutable, this treatment is as
according to the RGPD as it was to the Directive. This fact is indubitable, however
try to force the argument in another direction.” (emphasis ours)

It states, on the other hand, that in its previous allegations it proved that, in the
present case, the triple judgment concurred - suitability, necessity and proportionality strictu
sensu- required by constitutional jurisprudence so that the treatment carried out
by the FIJ will be in accordance with the RGPD; weighing that, he affirms, is favorable to the
legitimate interest that justifies it. With regard to the triple judgment mentioned, it is limited to

make various considerations in relation to what is argued in the proposal of
resolution. Considerations that, for the most part, do not conform to the truth or do not
they respect the context in which they were made. We reproduce some of them:

“[...] the Resolution Proposal: [considers] that the legitimate interest underlying the
processing of the data in the FIJ is nothing more than a mere "convenience" for
"perpetrate" what is called "intromissions a la carte" in the rights of
stakeholders (the expressions used are from the Motion for a Resolution, not from me)
represented)."
“[...] in the opinion of the AEPD, the [CIRBE is] the only information system that contributes to
the purpose pursued by the treatment carried out by the FIJ.”

“[..] converting the AEPD the principle of reasonable expectation (derived nothing less
of the fact that these systems exist in our law and have been expressly
regulated by it since 1992 and that the debtor should reasonably expect
that your creditworthiness will be assessed before obtaining credit) in the “reasonable hope”
delinquent debtor that his debt is not known and the financing is granted, even
when this harms the principles of responsible credit enshrined in the
legislator".

7. The seventh allegation refers to “Equifax’s compliance with the principle of
accuracy"
He places the starting point of his allegation in the necessary clarification of "what is the
purpose of the FIJ”, since “article 5.1.d) of the RGPD links “accuracy” with “the
purposes for which the data is processed.
It goes on to state that the “purpose of the FIJ” is to “reflect the existence of a debt
as stated in the announcement and at the time of its publication in the official source
correspondent". (emphasis ours)

From the foregoing, he infers that the circumstance that the FIJ cannot show which is the
debt situation at the time of the query does not allow the information to be qualified
of inaccurate in the terms provided in article 5.1.d) RGPD. It is not inaccurate, says
claimed - because it correctly collects the information that is necessary for the
purpose sought by the FIJ, "to help Equifax customers to assess solvency".

For this reason, he clarifies, the information would be inaccurate if, "contrary to what the
file”, will not correctly reflect the information contained in the published announcement.
He conjectures that the AEPD, with the aim of qualifying as inaccurate the data contained
in the FIJ, has proceeded in the proposed resolution, incorrectly, to associate the
“evaluation of the solvency of those affected” with information about the “situation
current” at the time of the consultation of the debt of the people.”

It goes on to refer to the suitability of the information contained in the FIJ to assess the
solvency of a person; suitability that, it affirms exhaustively, is out of all
doubt as has been confirmed for twenty-five years by the “enormous number of
entities that have been resorting to the FIJ to assess solvency” He warns that a
suitability judgment requires a thorough knowledge of the subject matter and that to the extent
knows the AEPD is not an entity that carries out analyzes on a day-to-day basis
of solvency.

102/184

It states that the FIJ "covers an undeniable need of the creditor market and the
fight against late payments and fraud” and then states: “[...] it is clear that
the FIJ information constitutes a complement to the files referring to the
debts contracted with in the private sector [...]. It is obvious that "in an ideal world"
it would be preferable if the FIJ could be updated as completely as it is
with the credit information systems of article 20 of the LOPDGDD.
Unfortunately, this is not possible since the Administrations do not publish
information in this regard, without such circumstance being considered in any
case as an assumption of "inaccuracy" of the information, for the reasons already stated."
(emphasis ours)

It also argues, as it did in the pleadings brief on the initial agreement,
that article 4.2 d) LOPDGDD establishes a presumption of accuracy that cannot
be distorted “by the result of the AEPD investigation, not even by the
contribution of evidence by the interested party” and “contains an imperative mandate of
exemption from liability to the person who has collected the data under their
contents".
It indicates that this provision - 4.2.d) LOPDGDD- has to be connected with the
regulatory regulations of the BOE that "establishes a presumption of veracity and
authenticity of the information contained therein, which guarantees the principle of
accuracy” and concludes that “the accuracy of the information referred to in the notifications
incorporated into the FIJ [...] derives directly from said publication [in the BOE] and the
LOPDGDD”.

Finally, it invokes two more arguments: That until the repeal of the LOPD
EQUIFAX “was [...] protected by the express legal authorization contained in the
article 29.1 LOPD and the action of the AEPD by which documentation was required
accrediting the payment so that it proceeded to its suppression”. And regarding the accuracy of
identification data of the alleged debtors, states that "it proved during the
trial period that only proceeds to the treatment of those data regarding
of which it has sufficient means to guarantee the accuracy of the information
treated.” In this sense, it adds that, as a consequence of the entry into force of the
LOPDGDD, adopted measures so that only the data of
the interested parties of whom there are sufficient elements to guarantee their
full identification, which has been reflected in a decrease in the number of
inclusions in the file.

8. The eighth allegation analyzes “Equifax’s compliance with the principle of
data minimization.
The respondent states that the presentation made by the proposed resolution in
In relation to the infringement of the principle of data minimization that is attributed to it, it does not
allows us to discern its connection with the aforementioned principle. He adds that “nowhere in
The Proposal indicates that the collection of data referring to the name, surnames,
identification document, address and characteristics of the debt contracted are not
adjusted to the aforementioned purpose nor is a judgment or assessment of proportionality carried out
something about it." It concludes that the aforementioned infringement appears to have been included in the
resolution with “a mere intention to increase, [...] in a completely
artificial reproach directed against” EQUIFAX.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

103/184

It indicates that the reasoning of the AEPD in the proposed resolution leads to the fact that,
when it is considered that a certain treatment breaches the principle of
limitation of the purpose (which the defendant denies) "there would also be a breach of the
principle of minimization, given that the processing of more data than
those legally required in the opinion of the Agency. This argument, by definition
would be inadmissible, [...]”

Lastly, it adds that, as a consequence of the entry into force of the LOPDGDD,
“has put into practice measures aimed at making the processing of the data
adjusted to the principles of accuracy and minimization and that only the
treatment in the event that compliance with such principles is guaranteed, for
which fails to understand the effect that the entry into force of said provision
can generate in the alleged violation of the principle of minimization.”

9. Ninth allegation, regarding the non-existence of infringement of article 14 of the RGPD.

With regard to this infraction, the defendant analyzes three different scenarios.
(i) The regime prior to the entry into force of the LOPDGDD, in which, it affirms,
exempted from the obligation to inform the interested parties of the processing of their data
carried out in the FIJ as confirmed by a "repeated
jurisprudence” that determined that from the SAN of 02/27/2008 the AEPD does not
dictate any sanctioning resolution for non-compliance with the obligation to
notify.

(ii) The existing regime during the term of the LOPD, from the date on which it is
dictates the judgment of the CJEU of 24/11/2011. Considers that the situation was identical to the
above and that it was the proposed resolution that "creates ex novo" a line
argument that understands that the previous criterion was modified from the aforementioned
STJUE. In the opinion of the respondent, the proposal eliminates “the possibility of founding the
of the FIJ in the provision of article 29.1 LOPD”. Therefore, it requires that the
exclusion from the duty to inform did not derive from the nature of the sources from which
obtained the information, but from article 29.1, in relation to 29.4 and in relation to
article 5.5. LOPD.

(iii) The system after the effective application of the RGPD, in which EQUIFAX has
considered “necessary to comply with the duty to inform”. After which, add
that, “despite the fact that he could have considered that the causes that exonerated him from said
obligation under the LOPD that, do not forget, remained in force until the 7th of
December 2018, they continued to protect him.” This commitment assumed as a result of the
effective application of the RGPD has materialized in the "notification to all
interested in the inclusion of their data in the FIJ", which constitutes a "commitment
of the entity with the guarantee of the right to data protection”.
The respondent affirms that the proposal considers that "this duty of information is not
has complied with respect to the data included in the FIJ prior to entry into
force of the LOPDGDD, that is, when there was a rule that excluded the duty to
information."

It also states that after the entry into force of the LOPDGDD, it would be possible to distinguish
“two types of data”:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

104/184

(i) Those introduced prior to the entry into force of the RGPD, with respect to the
which states that “[...] the principle of minimization and the cited interpretation of article 11
excluded the possibility of obtaining additional information with the sole protection of giving
compliance with the duty to inform”. Regarding article 11 RGPD, it indicates that it is possible
interpreted by analogy, in what affects the treatment of additional data to those
required for the fulfillment of the purpose of the treatment, the provisions of that
provision, according to which “[i]f the purposes for which a data controller processes data
personal data do not require or no longer require the identification of a data subject for the
responsible, it will not be obliged to maintain, obtain or treat information
with a view to identifying the interested party for the sole purpose of fulfilling the
this Regulation”. Considers therefore that it could be concluded that, if the purposes of the
treatment do not justify the treatment of additional data, it could not hide behind the
GDPR compliance to collect such data.

(ii) Those incorporated into the FIJ after said entry into force, with respect to the
that Equifax chose, compared to the other entities in the sector, to comply with the
Article 14, proceeding to notify all interested parties of the incorporation of their
data to the FIJ.

It concludes that it has fully complied with the duty of information regarding all
those treatments carried out since the entry into force of the RGPD, then, "Under the
previous regulation (LOPD) was exempt from compliance with that obligation.” and after
“The entry into force of the RGPD, the provisions of the law were applicable to these treatments.
in article 14.5 a) of the RGPD, as the information is impossible or requires efforts
disproportionate, something that the Proposal itself explicitly recognizes.”

EIGHTEENTH: Letter from EQUIFAX in which it requests that reports be sent to it
inmates of the SGRGPD and the suspension of the term to formulate allegations to the
resolution proposal.

On 04/07/2021, the AEPD receives a letter from EQUIFAX addressed to the Deputy Directorate
of Inspection of the AEPD in which it states that, through the Cabinet Report
Legal 89/2020, has become aware of the existence of two reports issued by
the General Subdirectorate of the General Registry of Data Protection of dates
01/25/2019 and 09/18/2020. It indicates that, as they are relevant for the defense of their
rights within the framework of PS/240/2019, requests that this Subdirectorate send it
copy of both documents. It requests that “the suspension of the
term for the issuance of the allegations to the Resolution Proposal during the
period that mediates between the present request and the referral to that of the reports
requested.”

The Deputy Director General of Inspection addresses the Deputy Director of the RGPD in writing
signed on 04/08/2021 and transfers the letter sent by EQUIFAX for the purposes
opportune. On 04/09/2021, the Subdirectorate of Inspection receives a letter from the
Deputy director of the RGPD informing that on that date he has proceeded to transfer
EQUIFAX of the requested reports.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and the documentation
in the file, the following have been accredited:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: The documents that the claimants
sent to this Agency with their claim or in a subsequent procedure, which inform
of the entries for debts that appear in the FIJ on the date that appears in the
corresponding document, linked to your personal data (name, surnames and
NIF; Name and surname; only NIF or, sometimes, some of these data combined
with home).

The information offered by the documents provided by the claimants on the
annotations for debts linked to your personal data has been collected in the
Background Second of this proposal. To said Second Antecedent, the
information on the documents provided, indicating the date that appears on the
EQUIFAX informative document, the personal data that identifies the
claimant, the registration date of each annotation, the source from which the
information, the creditor Administration and, where appropriate, the amount of the debt and the
non-payment concept.

Therefore, such information collected in the Second Precedent regarding the
claimants constitutes a proven fact integrated in this First Proven Fact
in which it is considered reproduced.

SECOND: According to the documents that are in the administrative file
relating to the result of access to the FIJ that the claimants provided to this Agency
It has been verified that, after the date of entry into force of the
LOPDGDD, on 12/07/2018, being the origin of the information TEU -BOE, they were given
High entries for alleged debts. Among these cases are those of
claimants 9; 10;15;31; 77; 83; 87 and 89.

THIRD According to the documents that are in the administrative file,
evidence that the identification of interested parties carried out by the FIJ takes into
consideration the data of the address for lack of NIF. We refer to the assumptions
raised by the claimants 18; 27; 27; 30 and 33, among others.

Likewise, there are entries for debts in which the entry date of the entry
-in which EQUIFAX places the initial term for the computation of the maximum time of
permanence of the data in the file, which is six years - is after the date
maturity of the obligation. This is the case of claimant 18; 26; 29 among others.

FOURTH: That, based on the documentation in the file, the FIJ
reflected non-existent debts with respect to the claimants identified with the numbers
37;38; 40;41;42;48; 50;52;53;54;59;62; 75 and 95. There are many claimants
who, without providing supporting documentation, deny the existence of the debt that
It is listed in the FIJ.

FIFTH: EQUIFAX affirms that the number of natural persons that existed in
The FIJ active data records for the last six years is shown in the

-A table with the “average number” of natural persons who, in the period 2016-2021,
featured in the FIJ:
Year 2016: 4,624,312; year 2017: 4,879,391; year 2018: 4,940,225; year 2019:
4,657,196; year 2020: 4,183,445; year 2021: 3,826,436.

- A table with the number of natural persons who have been included in the FIJ since
on 05/25/2018:
In the year 2018: 196,653; in 2019: 62,113; in 2020: 20,193 and in 2021:
2,358.

The entity states that since 05/25/2018 a total of
282,037 individuals and that most of the records that remain in the
file are prior to the entry into force of the RGPD.

SIXTH: EQUIFAX affirms, in response to the requested proof, that the criteria that
uses the FIJ to organize the personal data that is subject to treatment with the
In order for their owners to be duly identified, they are the
following:

a) In the event that only the NIF/NIE is published: then “it is verified if on the date of
publication, the NIF/NIE in question is registered in the active information
of the FIJ (thus excluding the one that is blocked). Depending on the result
obtained, different actions are carried out:
a´) If the identifier is already included in the FIJ associated with a name and surname,
registers in the FIJ the new published information.
a´´) If that identifier is not included in the FIJ, the record recording is discarded.

b) In the event that the name and surnames and incomplete NIF/CIF are published:

c) Cases in which the name + surnames + address is published: Proceed
to the recording of the record in the FIJ file, associating both data.

d) Cases in which only name + surname appears published: In this
Of course, the recording of the data in the FIJ file is discarded.

”
SEVENTH: EQUIFAX, in response to the question regarding the protocol that
has had in place for the past six years to ensure that data
personal information that was incorporated into the FIJ were duly updated, in all
moment, states the following:

“To ensure that the data captured in the FIJ is up to date, Equifax
mainly based on:
1) Limitation of the sources from which the FIJ file is fed: as already reported in
our previous writings, Equifax collects the information that is registered in the FIJ of
the Official Gazettes published by the State, the Autonomous Communities
Provincial councils.
The exclusive use of this source guarantees that all the information that is
collects is considered official and authentic as stated in article 3.1 of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

107/184

Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the official gazette <<Boletín
State Official>>. Therefore, the use of this source is, in our opinion, a
guarantee that there are no doubts about the updating and veracity of the
information incorporated into the FIJ.
The newsletters are downloaded the same day they are published, so the information
of the FIJ is updated daily with the information contained in the Bulletins.

2) Automatic information capture processes: downloading bulletins and
subsequent registration of the data in the FIJ is carried out through automated processes
thus avoiding possible errors from manual processes. for reading
the data of the bulletins are used OCR reading processes that guarantee the
correct reading and recording of the data published in the bulletins

3) Recording criteria: as we have pointed out in the answer to the first
request for information from the AEPD, Equifax has implemented criteria for
specific recording and previously detailed to that AEPD, in order to ensure that
the holders are unequivocally identified so that their inclusion in the
FIJ. These criteria guarantee that there is only data on holders duly
identified

4) Notification of inclusion: this part has been made to the holders whose data have
been collected since May 25, 2018, a specific notification of your
inclusion in the FIJ, as a measure to guarantee the updating of the data. sayings
communications allow interested parties, in a free and simple way,
check if indeed the data that have been published by the different
official bulletins and that have been collected by my client contain some error.

5) Attention of Exercise of rights: through the attention of claims of the
holders in the exercise of their rights, the interested parties may, in accordance with the
provided for in the data protection regulations, know what data is included in
the FIJ, for what purpose they are used, and, at all times, rectify, cancel, oppose and
limit the processing of your personal data.” (emphasis ours)

EIGHTH: EQUIFAX affirms that during the validity of the LOPD it did not notify the
affected the inclusion of their data in the FIJ, conduct that justifies the existence of
"an express endorsement in this sense by the National High Court" that in
numerous sentences -SSAN of 06/29/2001 (Rec.1012/1999);
  11/29/2001
(Rec.531/2000) and of 02/27/2008 (Rec. 358/2006)- declared that the regime of
data protection contained in the LOPD, article 29.1., did not impose an obligation
to notify the interested parties of the inclusion of their personal data in the FIJ.

NINTH: EQUIFAX affirms that, after the entry into force of the RGPD, it has considered
appropriate to notify the inclusion to those affected whose data was registered in the FIJ.
It also states that, since 05/25/2018, its computer records show the shipment
of a total of 509,470 notifications, which is broken down as follows
(year/notifications sent): 2018: 339,436; 2019: 116,236; 2020: 47.3888; 2021:
6,407.

expressly.

TENTH: Regarding the total number of notifications of inclusion that EQUIFAX claims to have
sent to those affected, has reported those that were unsuccessful, broken down
for the following return reasons:
01, wrong signs; 02, deceased; 03, unknown; 04, absent; 05, refused; 06,
others; 07, insufficient direction; 08, wrong address.

Unsuccessful notifications for years:
-. Year 2018. Total unsuccessful claims: 66,418. Of these, for reasons 01 and
03 a total of 61,182.
-. Year 2019. Total unsuccessful claims: 24,812. Of these, for reasons 01 and
03 a total of 22,797.
-. Year 2020. Total unsuccessful claims: 9,673. Of these, for reasons 01 and
03 a total of 8,873.
-. Year 2021. Total unsuccessful claims: 1. Reason 01: 1.
It is verified that reasons 01 and 03 represent more than 90% of the notifications
unsuccessful.

ELEVENTH: In the final version of the RAT corresponding to the FIJ that EQUIFAX has
provided, point 8, “Information suppression periods”, reads as follows:
“The information is accessible for 3 months and then it is stored in a directory
Linux in order to be able to work with the data later. Bliss
information, saved in “PDF” format, will be available for a period of 10
years from the date of publication, and this for the sole purpose of being able to meet the
possible claims and respond to requests for information by the
competent administrative body, as well as the courts and tribunals.”

TWELFTH: In the document provided by EQUIFAX regarding the interest analysis
prevalent (LIA, judicial file, 2019), in point 7, and in the section dedicated to the
measures that it proposes to implement, specifically with respect to the guarantees of the
data protection principles, includes the following:

“1.1 Principle of finality” “On the other hand, the principle of finality includes the limitation
of the subsequent uses of the data, since the RGPD prohibits in its article 5.1 a)
the subsequent processing of the data for purposes incompatible with those that motivated its
collection, although excepting from this limitation the use of data for the purpose of archiving
public interest or scientific or statistical research.” (emphasis ours)

“1.4. Principle of accuracy” “In compliance with this principle and given that the
edict publication only recognizes the existence of the obligation to satisfy the
owed, but there is no additional information available that would allow us to know
effectively if that amount is due at the time of notice of
inclusion, a possible solution to this problem would be the limitation of deadlines very
brief references to the aforementioned communications, and in the analyzed system this
requirement is fulfilled, by reducing the term to the publications that have occurred in the last
five months. However, this reduction does not allow to fully avoid the
risk derived from the treatment of this data, being able to see the qualification of a
interested negatively by the fact of incorporating an edictal notification
referring to a debt already satisfied in the same way that could be affected
favorably the subject to whom a notification had been made with a

seniority of more than five months and had not proceeded to pay the amount
owed.” (emphasis ours)

THIRTEENTH: The Deputy Director General of the General Registry of the AEPD, in the
written response to the requested evidence, dated 02/10/2021, states that, in
that date, the draft code of conduct presented by ASEDIE for its
approval by the AEPD was in process, pending the report of the
Legal Office of the AEPD, and that the aforementioned Association had not been notified
of any report issued on the draft code of conduct.

FOURTEENTH: Work in the administrative file the response of the Secretariat
General of AEBOE to the consultation of several claimants (among others, claimant 55)
about whether it is lawful for your personal data to be collected, which appear in the
notifications inserted in the Supplement of notifications of the BOE, to
incorporate them into a for-profit database in which it concludes:

“In accordance with the foregoing, this State Agency considers that the reuse of
personal data such as names, surnames, ID associated with debts, published
in the BOE, that you requests, it would not be a lawful processing of personal data
of those provided for in art. 6 of RGPD and, therefore, in accordance with what is regulated both
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,
they must not be reused by third parties.”

FIFTEENTH: The respondent affirms that the net amount of the turnover of
EQUIFAX IBÉRICA, as of 12/31/2019, amounted to €42,259,655.

Regarding the "direct income in relation to the access service to the FIJ provided
to customers directly since 2015” reports these amounts:
€316,204 in 2015; €291,950, in 2016; 289,854 in 2017; €290,256 in 2018;

Applicable provisions

The RGPD dedicates its article 5 to the principles that govern the processing of data
personal, precept that provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,
loyalty and transparency»);
b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; according to article 89,
paragraph 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");
c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");
d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable to eliminate or rectify without delay the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (“accuracy”);
e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties during

Article 6.1. of the RGPD, under the heading "Legality of the treatment", specifies the
assumptions in which data processing is considered lawful:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said

Of the alleged nullity of this procedure.

III

It is appropriate to examine, first of all, the question of the nullity of the
sanctioning procedure that the respondent has invoked repeatedly, both in its
two briefs of allegations to the initial agreement -the one dated 02/19/2018 or first
allegations to the initial agreement and the one dated 01/24/2021 or allegations
complementary - as in the arguments to the proposed resolution.

In particular, in the brief of allegations to the proposed resolution, it uses the
concurrence of the causes of absolute nullity provided for in sections a) and e) of the
article 47.1 of the LPACAP and affirms that these vices of nullity have generated a
material and real defenselessness since, in addition to not being a violation
merely formal has suffered a real and effective impairment of the right of defense,
with the consequent damage.

The following behaviors that relate in writing their allegations to the proposal
would have caused, in his opinion, the vices of nullity that he alleges:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

112/184

a. The inclusion of the amount of the penalties in the initiation agreement, which constitutes
a vice of absolute nullity provided for in article 47.1.a) LPACAP.

With this, it reiterates its allegations to the agreement to open the procedure in which
held that the proceeding was vitiated by the lack of defense
generated by having fixed in it the amount of the sanction instead of expressing only the
limits of the possible sanction. That, due to this circumstance, the initial agreement exceeded
of the legally foreseen content, violated article 68 of the LOPDGDD, and it looked
affected the impartiality of the investigating body, which it knew before starting the
procedure the criterion of the body to which the file must be submitted, in clear
breach of the principle of separation of the instruction phase and sanction (article 63.1 of
the LPACAP).

It also considered in those allegations that the rules of article 85 of the LPACAP
were not applicable to the present case but to the cases in which the rule
sanctioning imposes a fixed and objective fine and that the application that is
had made this precept in the initial agreement did not respect its literal tenor,
according to which the amount of the pecuniary sanction may be determined “when the
sanctioning procedure", for which, he affirms, it would be assimilating "the act itself
of initiation with the fact that the procedure is initiated”.

As stated in the motion for a resolution, this Agency cannot share the
position of the respondent that having included in the initial agreement the sanctions
that could correspond for the imputed infractions is determinant of
helplessness or involves a breach of the principle of separation of the phases of
instruction and resolution; On the contrary, it fulfills the requirements
provided for in articles 64.2 and 68 LPACAP.

Nor can it be ignored that article 85 of the LPACAP -which contemplates the
possibility of applying reductions on the amount of the sanction in the event that
the offender acknowledges his responsibility and in case of voluntary payment of the sanction-
obliges to determine these reductions in the notification of the agreement to initiate the
procedure, which necessarily implies that said agreement must establish the
amount of the sanction corresponding to the imputed acts.

On the other hand, contrary to what was expressed by the complainant, article 85 of the LPACAP does not
provides that the amount of the penalty will be determined once the procedure has begun.
On the contrary, it is the acknowledgment of responsibility and the voluntary payment of
sanction what has to take place after that moment and not the fixation of the
amount of the penalty.

EQUIFAX considers that this interpretation of the AEPD - according to which "the determination
of the amount of the sanction and the consequent evaluation of the concurrent circumstances.
in the case comes from [...] what is established in article 85 LPACAP”- it is contra-
to the Spanish Constitution every time that, he says, it violates the protection of the rights
fundamental benefits that are granted through it and that the “efficiency that could
be followed with the determination of the amount of the sanction in the initiation agreement never
could justify the violation of the fundamental rights of the accused that such an act
tuation entails”.

113/184

It is added to what has already been stated in the proposal phase that the AEPD understands that the interpretation
literal interpretation of the precept that he has been doing is consistent with the provisions of the di-
different sections of the article and that it is not the responsibility of this body to pronounce on
on the alleged unconstitutionality of this legal provision. On the other hand, the room
of the Administrative Litigation of the National High Court has resolved numerous re-
courses against resolutions of the AEPD issued in procedures whose agreement of
the beginning fixed, as in this one, the amount of the sanctions, without it having been raised by
the appellants nor by the Court the controversy over the interpretation and application of
the standard that the claim raises.

On the alleged rupture of the principle of separation of the phases of investigation and
resolution derived from having set the decision-making body in the initial agreement the im-
size of the sanction, thus conditioning the independence of the instructor, it does not seem that
In the case that concerns us, the conditioning of the instrumental organ has taken place.
tructor to which allusion is made by the claimed.

b. Violation by the AEPD of the rules that regulate the procedure
penalty in terms of personal data protection and "the consequent
expiration a limine of the procedure”, which entails a vice of nullity of the article
47.1.e) LPACAP.

EQUIFAX maintains that the AEPD has totally and absolutely dispensed with the procedure
legally established in articles 64 and 67 of the LOPDGDD and has incurred in
a derogation from the powers attributed to it by the LOPDGDD and the RGPD. Let-
tion that has generated damage “because it has been considered by the AEPD
as an aggravating circumstance of the type the continuing nature of the alleged infringement
during the period in which the AEPD declined to carry out any offense against
Equifax”.

Regarding the procedure, it transcribes articles 64.2 and 67 of the LOPDGDD and says
that these provisions unequivocally infer that the LOPDGDD, for reasons
legal certainty for the company, has established a procedure re-
glado and with clearly marked time limits”. Consider, therefore, that
The admission to processing of the claim must occur without interruption
within three months; the optional performance of investigative actions
for a maximum period of twelve months and the opening of a sanctioning procedure
pain Thus, it affirms that the admission to processing of a claim by the AEPD su-
puts the recognition of the existence of indications of violation of the regulations of
protection of data and this should imply -argues EQUIFAX- that they carry out
preliminary investigation actions or, if you consider that the infringement is manifest,
as seems to happen in the present case, to proceed immediately to the opening
of the sanctioning procedure.

In view of the foregoing, the respondent draws the "obvious consequence" that if the
The first claim was admitted on May 30, 2019 and the AEPD decided not to carry out
carry out investigative actions “the Agreement to initiate this proceeding
should be from that date, so, being the maximum duration of the procedure of
nine months, the resolution [...] should have been issued on March 2, 2020.” Y

adds: “In this way, the AEPD issued the Start Agreement long after
the date on which the resolution should have been issued if it had met the specific requirements
established in the data protection regulations, with which all actions
should be considered expired.” (emphasis ours)

It also refers to the situation of "inactivity" in which it considers the AEPD incurred in
in connection with the claims that were brought against EQUIFAX relating to the FIJ.
It supports such a conclusion in that of the 97 claims (96, because the claims are repeated),
parties 3 and 27) admitted to EQUIFAX, only some of the
they; in that although all were admitted for processing, some were "without a minimum
legal reasoning”; in which the first claim (claimant 25) entered the
AEPD on 05/30/2019 and in which the AEPD did not carry out investigative actions
prior, so, he affirms, from the admission to processing of the claims until
the Agency dictates the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure that concerns us, the
07/24/2020, did not take any other action.

The procedures carried out by this Agency to which the respondent refers must
do with the process of admitting the claims received, which included for
some of them the transfer of the written claim to the person in charge prior to the
agreement of the AEPD of its admission for processing.

In accordance with the provisions of article 55 of the RGPD, the AEPD is competent
to perform the functions assigned to it in article 57, including that of
enforce the Regulation and promote the awareness of those responsible and
in charge of the treatment about the obligations incumbent on them, as well as
deal with the claims presented by an interested party and make the necessary
relevant research.

Correlatively, article 31 of the RGPD establishes the obligation of those responsible
and those in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority that requests it in
the performance of their duties. In the event that they have appointed a
data protection delegate, article 39 of the RGPD attributes to him the function of
cooperate with that authority.

Article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD has provided for a mechanism prior to admission to
processing of the claims that are formulated before the AEPD that consists of giving
transfer of them to the data protection delegates designated by the
responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes provided in article 37 of
the aforementioned norm, or to these when they have not been designated, so that they proceed to the
analysis of said claims and to respond to them within a month. It is about
of an optional procedure, so that this transfer is carried out if the AEPD so
esteem.

In accordance with this regulation, prior to the admission for processing of the
claims that give rise to this proceeding, the claimant was notified
of some of the complaints received so that it could proceed with its analysis,
response to this Agency within a month and prove having provided the
claimant the due response.

The result of said transfer was not satisfactory, therefore, for the purposes foreseen

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

115/184

in its article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, it was agreed to admit claims for processing
presented through agreements that were duly notified to the claimants
and not the one claimed, in accordance with the provisions of article 65.5 of the LOPDGDD.

The respondent affirmed in her arguments to the initial agreement that the previous phase of
investigation remained open for more than sixteen months without any
exercise. In this regard, we must underline that the opening of a preliminary phase of
The investigation is optional in accordance with article 67 of the LOPDGDD.

No legal consequence can be attributed to the time elapsed between the
admission to processing of the claims and the opening of the procedure, as there is no
no rule that limits the time available to the Administration to start this
type of procedures beyond the rule of prescription and the effects that are
attribute.

The respondent draws attention to the inactivity of the AEPD which, in her opinion, is
evidenced in the time elapsed between receipt of a claim and
the opening of the sanctioning procedure. In relation to claimant 25, whose
claim entered the AEPD on 05/30/2019, considers that, since it was decided not to
transfer the claim or open preliminary investigation proceedings, it should
having issued the agreement to open the sanctioning file in that same
date, 05/30/2019, so the resolution should have passed on 03/02/2020, several
months before the Agency agreed to open the sanctioning procedure
what concerns us

EQUIFAX understands that this unjustified inactivity results in the expiration of the
present procedure, given that the term to resolve would be expired in the
same date on which the initiation agreement was issued. In this sense, he considers that the
Articles 64.2 and 67 of the LOPDGDD establish three successive phases without solution of
continuity (admission for processing, preliminary investigation actions and opening of the
sanctioning procedure), each of them with marked time limits,
so that, if you choose not to carry out preliminary investigation actions, once
Once the claim is admitted for processing, proceed immediately to the opening of the
penalty procedure.

This statement by the respondent is not admissible. It should be noted that not
there is no rule applicable to the sanctioning procedure in terms of protection
of personal data that establishes a preclusive period to agree on its opening. That
the expiration term of this procedure, established in nine months, is computed
from the date on which its start is agreed, so it is inadmissible to add to that
computation, in order to measure the duration of the administrative file, another period, such
as the time of the previous investigation actions, in the event that
had agreed to its realization, or, in this case, the time corresponding to the phase
admission to processing of the claims submitted.

This has been repeatedly declared by our Supreme Court. In Judgment of
10/21/2015 cites the Judgment of 12/26/2007 (appeal 1907/2005), which declares the
Next:
“[…] the term of the procedure […] is counted from the initiation of the file
sanctioning, which obviously excludes from the calculation the time of the information

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

116/184

reserved";" […] the greater or lesser duration of the preliminary phase does not entail the
expiration of the subsequent procedure.

Also in the Judgment of the Supreme Court of 10/13/2011 (appeal 3987/2008) that
examines a ground of appeal relating to the calculation of the expiration period of the
procedure, the following is declared:
“We cannot share the reasoning that the Court of Instance exposes to set a
dies a quo different from the one established by the Law, indicating as the initial date of the
computation the day following the completion of the preliminary informative proceedings.
[…]
Well, once these preliminary actions have been carried out, the time it takes for the
Administration in agreeing to initiate the procedure […] may have the
consequences that proceed in terms of the computation of the prescription (extinction of
law); but it cannot be taken into consideration for expiration purposes, since
what this figure intends is to ensure that once the procedure has started the
Administration does not exceed the term available to resolve. in the foundation

Abounding in the invoked inactivity of the AEPD, it cannot even be considered that
that period to which the claim refers, which includes the time elapsed
between the admission for processing of the claimant's claim 25 and the opening of the
procedure that concerns us, is a period of inactivity of this Agency, given
that during that time the admission procedures were carried out for the rest of the
claims.

procedure has been carried out with a complete and repeated impairment of the
rights that within the framework of the sanctioning administrative procedure are granted by the
sections 1 and 2 of article 53 of the LPACAP and to this end refers to the following
circumstances:

1. No investigative actions were carried out prior to the opening of the
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.

Regarding what was stated by the complainant in point 1, we refer to the
considerations made in section b) above.

Regarding the statement in point 4, according to which the documentation that
was not sent to EQUIFAX on 08/12/2020 represented "more than 45%" of the file

the action of the AEPD violated their right to defence. He then stated that
had violated articles 65.2.f) and 89.1 of the LPACAP because “the process of
hearing of the interested parties and the right of the defendant to formulate
allegations, in view of the administrative file, are configured as a guarantee
essential part of the procedure, being the reflection in the administrative procedure
sanctioning the right to effective judicial protection that assists the accused.”

The omission of the hearing process would have materialized, in his opinion, in these
behaviors:
On the one hand, in that he could not have real knowledge of the file except with the
scope of which he was notified before he formulated his allegations to the agreement of
beginning. That four months after he presented his allegations to the
initial agreement, the AEPD sent him a full copy of the file that
manifest that in the first copy received more than 30 per cent of the
file, with no correlation between the indexes of the two copies. For other,
the omission of the hearing procedure was specified in his opinion in that the AEPD, in the
letter that notified him on 12/23/2020, did not grant him a term to make allegations to the
initial agreement but, says the entity, “[...] the concession or grace consisting of
delay the initiation of the trial period for a period of ten days from the
delivery of the aforementioned "completed" or "supplemented" file.

On the issues then raised by EQUIFAX, various
clarifications in the motion for a resolution relating to certain factual elements
to which the entity alluded when it based its request for radical annulment of the
administrative Procedure.

One of the details dealt with the electronic file that the AEPD has
implemented, that guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the documentation and that
reflects all the actions carried out in a certain procedure and all the
documentation that includes it.

In the electronic file, the computer system orders the documents and
procedures carried out following, exclusively, a chronological criterion. it's own
system that generates or prepares the copy of the file, so that this
circumstance, together with the extraordinary volume of the file, meant that, in the copy
generated to respond to the transfer requested by the respondent on 08/03/2020, no
would have detected that not all of the documentation that
integrated. The fact that the 1,435 documents omitted from the first copy
appeared in the copy transferred to the one claimed in December 2020 interspersed
with the previous ones, with the consequence that the initially provided index was
also altered, was the result, exclusively, of the chronological criteria followed by the
computer system to order documentation.

The second precision was related to the assertion made by EQUIFAX that
that the AEPD did not grant him a period to formulate complementary allegations to the
initiation agreement once she had access to the full copy of the file
administrative. We refer in this sense to the Eighth, Ninth and
Tenth in which the "iter" of the events is detailed. The Eighth Antecedent
refers to the letter that the instructor sent to the respondent on 12/23/2020 in the

that, in addition to informing him that on that date he was sent a CD, encrypted,
With the complete copy of the administrative file, I communicated the following:

after December 28, 2020. If the notification of this communication were
prior to December 28, the ten business days will be computed from that date, for
be on this date that, ultimately, the courier company has
guaranteed that you will deliver the shipment containing the CD media with the
documentation referred to. (emphasis ours)

The brief dated 12/23/2020 that was notified to the respondent emphasized that, once
who had in his possession the complete copy of the administrative file, the procedure to be
to follow was "to make allegations and provide the documentation it deems pertinent", to
which was necessary a period of time in which the procedure was not
advance to the next phase, the test phase. Materially what was granted to the
claimed in the aforementioned brief was a period to argue, regardless of whether the
expression was formally inappropriate.

The same conviction of respect for the right of the respondent to make allegations, is
reflected in the response to his request for a delay of five days plus the
opening of the evidence phase of the sanctioning procedure. In the writing of the
Instructor in response to your request for extension of the term to allege, dated
01/13/2021, received by the respondent on 01/14/2021, indicating:
“Notwithstanding the provisions of article 76.1 of Law 39/2015, of the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (LPACAP), with the same
purpose of guaranteeing the legitimate right of defense of EQUIFAX that inspired the

12/23/2020, you are informed that the evidentiary phase of the case will not be opened.
procedure until expired on 01/15/2021.” (emphasis ours)

It was also recalled - we refer to the Tenth Precedent, section I - that, given
aware that the acknowledgment of GEISER, relative to the presentation by EQUIFAX in the
electronic headquarters of the AEPD on 01/20/2021 of a document of allegations
complementary to the initiation agreement PS 240/2019, indicated that no
incorporated neither that document nor any other, various steps were taken to
alert the respondent of what happened and prevent the presentation of their claims from being frustrated.
supplementary arguments to the initial agreement, until finally, on the date
01/24/2021, it was recorded in the acknowledgment of presentation of GEISER that the
claimed annexed the aforementioned pleadings brief.

The legal effect that the respondent attributed then (in its allegations to the agreement
beginning) and continues to attribute to the exposed facts, is the absolute nullity of the
administrative procedure, under article 47.1. LPACAP, precept that
has:
“The acts of the Public Administrations are null and void in cases
following: [...]

28001 – Madrid

120/184

a) Those that violate rights and freedoms subject to constitutional protection
[...]
e) The dictates disregarding totally and absolutely the procedure legally
established or of the norms that contain the essential rules for the formation of
the will of the collegiate bodies.”

As stated in the proposal document, taking into account the procedures
followed in the procedure, procedures described in the Background and, in particular,
for what is of interest here, in the Fifth to Tenth Antecedents, it is obligatory to reject
the defendant's thesis that there had been a "total" and "absolute" omission
of the rules of procedure.

If there was a delay of the AEPD in the delivery of the copy of the file that, in
words of the respondent, meant that the period for pleadings was reduced to six
business days, it was due to the volume of the file that prevented a notification
electronics; but this circumstance cannot make us forget that the entity left
One business day has elapsed since the initiation agreement was notified to you, on 07/30/2020, and
until he requested the Agency, on 08/03/2020, to send a copy of the file.
Nor can it be forgotten that both with regard to his initial allegations,
08/19/2020, as to the complementary allegations the Agency has always agreed
the requested extension of time. On the other hand, although the entity argues that, as
consequence of the reduction of the time available, has been ostensibly limited
their ability to make “full and informed” allegations against the
agreement to start the sanctioning file, nothing prevented him from completing his
allegations in what it deems appropriate after the expiration of said period, in accordance with
to the provisions of article 76 LPCAP, which it did not do.

It was added that EQUIFAX could have formulated in the second pleadings brief
to the initial agreement, dated 01/24/2021, these “complete and informed” allegations
which, she says, she was forced to do without due to lack of time, especially when she
itself had recognized that there were no substantial differences between the
claims that made up the copy of the file initially sent and the 42
omitted claims whose documentation you could access on 12/24/2020 -yes
we abide by what is indicated in the acknowledgment of receipt of the MRV company that operates in the
file- or on 12/28/2020 -according to one of the versions of the entity- or in
date 12/26/2020 -according to another of its versions-.

As indicated then, it was enough to go to the brief of complementary arguments
of EQUIFAX to verify that in it the entity was limited to ratifying its
arguments to the initiation agreement presented on 08/19/2020; to do an analysis of the
42 claims omitted based on the same categories that had been differentiated in
his first pleadings brief and, mainly, to argue his claim that
the nullity of the procedure will be declared for being vitiated by absolute nullity.

In short, it is not possible to accept the claim of the respondent that there had been
produced a total and absolute omission of the legally established procedure -which
is the presupposition of the rule of article 47.1.e) LPACAP whose application invokes neither
therefore, the procedure was vitiated by radical nullity.

It was answered by this Agency with a mention to the SAN, Contentious Chamber
Administrative, Section 1, of 03/08/2019 (appeal 20/2018), F.J. Fourth, reflecting the
position on the matter held by the Supreme Court:

“[...] When a procedural step has been omitted, but it has not been totally and
absolutely of the legally foreseen procedure, we find ourselves with the
possibility that the act may be voidable in accordance with art. 48.2 of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, although in this case only the declaration of
nullity if the act lacks the essential formal requirements to achieve
its end or if it has left the interested parties defenseless, as has already been pointed out.
However, there is no defenselessness for these purposes, as stated by the
Judgment of the Supreme Court of October 11, 2012 -appeal no. 408/2010 -, "yes

purpose, all the proceeding resources, both administrative and jurisdictional"
(STS of July 20, 1992). (emphasis ours)

Therefore, "if the interested party in an administrative or contentious-administrative appeal

real interests of the appellant and for the objectivity of the control of the Administration,

to the same and that excludes useless procedural actions for the purposes of the procedure"
(SS.TS. of July 6, 1988 and June 17, 1991).

In addition, it also declares the High Court Judgment of October 11, 2012, which
"If despite the procedural omission, the trial court has the
sufficient elements of judgment to form a conviction that serves to decide
the dispute correctly, must go on to analyze and prosecute the merits of the matter"; and
this is so "because the theory of nullity of administrative acts must be applied

delay the resolution of the substantive issue" (SS.TS. of June 14, 1985, 3 of

In summary, the Supreme Court concludes that "the vice of form or procedure does not

to what is invoked by EQUIFAX, we must abide by the criteria set by the
case law in interpreting the scope of the aforementioned LPACAP provision.

The jurisprudential doctrine on the matter requires that, in any case,
produced an effective and real injury to the right whose violation is invoked.

Although the respondent affirms that she has suffered a real and effective impairment of her right
of defense, the truth is that this injury is not proven since it has been able to
exercise their right of defense by formulating their pleadings within the
deadlines granted for this purpose. We refer on the matter to the STC 78/1999, of 26
April, in which Legal Basis 2, states:
“Thus, according to reiterated constitutional doctrine that is synthesized in the foundation
legal 3 of the STC 62/1998, "the estimation of an amparo appeal by the
existence of breaches of procedural rules 'does not simply result from the
assessment of the eventual violation of the right due to the existence of a defect
procedural more or less serious, but it is necessary to prove the effective concurrence
of a state of material or real defenselessness' (STC 126/1991, legal basis 5º;
STC 290/1993, legal basis 4º). So that a helplessness can be estimated

defenseless material, an effective and real impairment of the right of defense (STC
149/1998, legal basis 3), with the consequent real and effective damage to the
affected stakeholders (SSTC 155/1988, legal basis 4, and 112/1989,
2nd legal basis)." (Underlining is ours)

Finally, it remains to respond to the two behaviors outlined by the claimed in the
points 6 and 7 as determinants of the nullity of the procedure.

The first of them, the extension of the object of the sanctioning procedure in the phase of
motion for a resolution -since the defendant was charged with three new
infractions, of articles 5.1. b), 5.1.c) and 14 of the RGPD, which were added to the two
provided for in the opening agreement, article 6.1., in relation to 5.1.a, RGPD and the
5.1.d) RGPD- which will be the subject of an independent analysis in the following section.

Regarding the conduct described in point 7, the following is indicated. The claimant has
stated that, in accordance with the changes introduced with the proposed resolution,
requested, under article 32.1 LPACAP, the extension of the term of allegations
for the maximum legally permitted (five days) but the Agency limited such extension.
within a single day, in view of the evident risk of expiration of the procedure.
therefore, “In this way, my principal seems to be denied a right that the
law grants him as a consequence of the delay in processing the sole procedure
attributable to the actions of that AEPD, which in no case should result in
to the detriment of the Administrator.” (The emphasis is ours).

Article 32 LPACAP provides that “1. The Administration, unless otherwise stated,
may grant ex officio or at the request of the interested parties, an extension of the deadlines
established, which does not exceed half of them, if the circumstances so
they advise and with this the rights of third parties are not harmed. The expansion agreement
It must be notified to the interested parties.” (The emphasis is ours).

This Agency considers that, while article 32 LPACAP specifies the potestati-
vo that the Administration has to agree on the extension of the procedural deadlines, the
not having granted EQUIFAX the requested extension of the term, given that

sa of the claimed or an infraction of the rules of the administrative procedure,
still less can it imply that this decision would have completely dispensed with
and absolute (article 47.1.e) of the rules that regulate the procedure.

d. The fourth reason that, in the opinion of the claimed invalidity radical the
sanctioning procedure is the defenselessness generated by being deprived of the
“right to know the specific accusations directed to limine against her and her
rights of defense and contribution of evidence pertinent to their right,
enshrined in article 24.2 of the Constitution as a manifestation of the right to
effective judicial protection.”

Vice of nullity that would be a consequence of the fact that the resolution proposal extended the
object of the procedure and in it the defendant was charged, in addition to the two
Sections of the RGPD established in the initial agreement (articles 6.1 and 5.1.d) three new
infractions, of articles 5.1. b), 5.1.c) and 14 of the GDPR.

cial made in the initiation agreement, making an imputation or imposing a sanction
more serious than that established in the opening agreement. And that the additional imputations
would require the processing of a new procedure.

In the matter that concerns us, the facts prosecuted were qualified in the agreement of
beginning of the sanctioning file as constituting respective infractions of the
articles 6.1, in relation to 5.1.a) of the RGPD and 5.1.d) RGPD, infringements
both typified in article 83.5 RGPD and qualified by the LOPDGDD, for the purposes
of prescription, of very serious infractions.

In the resolution proposal phase, it was considered necessary to broaden the object of the
proceeding based on the facts that had been detailed in the settlement agreement.

said agreement, two violations of articles 5.1.b) RGPD, 5.1.c) RGPD and 14
RGPD, all typified in article 83.5 of the Regulation and qualified by the
LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, of very serious infractions.

Regarding whether or not it is appropriate to extend the legal classification in the proposal phase
of the facts set forth in the Home agreement and the impact that such a change may
have in the right of defense of the denounced entity, it should be noted that nothing

prevents making this modification as long as, as is the case now, it remains
The facts on which the accusation made is based are invariable.
 
The first of the rights that article 53.2 of the LPACAP recognizes in favor of the
The responsible party in the sanctioning procedure is the one who is notified of the facts
that are imputed to him; the infractions that such facts may constitute and the sanctions
that, if applicable, could be imposed on them.

The Constitutional Court has been pointing out that “the essential content of the right
to be informed of the accusation refers to the facts considered
punishable by the accused” (STC 95/1995). Unlike what happens
with the facts, the Constitutional Court (TC) in Judgment 145/1993 warns that the
communication to the presumed offender of the legal qualification and of the possible sanction to
imposing does not integrate the essential content of the right to be informed of the accusation.

To such an extent, it is important to make known the constitutive facts of the
the administrative infraction, that the T.C. declared that the requirements of article
24.2 of the CE are satisfied fundamentally with the sole communication of the facts
imputed to be able to defend themselves on them (STC 2/1987 and 190/1987). In this
line the Supreme Court, Judgment of March 3, 2004, states that "the purpose
of the initial agreement is to report on the alleged facts and not on the
legal qualification, which will be in charge of the resolution proposal”. (The underlined
is from the AEPD).

The respondent considers it legally inadmissible that in the proposed resolution
the object of the procedure could be extended and affirms that this possibility is
proscribed in the LPACAP and that was not even allowed during the term of REPEPOS
that it only admitted to change in the process of resolution proposal the qualification
legal facts.

For these purposes we have to bring up the SAN of 03/12/2016 (appeal 312/2014).
The second Legal Basis begins by reflecting the issues raised
by the plaintiff that affect the sanctioning procedure, among which it alleges "the
infringement of the informative principles of the sanctioning law and, specifically of the
principle of "reformatio in peius", alluding to the fact that although the procedure was initiated
on the occasion of an infringement of art. 5.1 of the LOPD, classified as mild, and another of the
art. 6 of said norm, considered as serious, the proposed resolution altered the
legal qualification, appreciating two infractions of art. 6 of the LOPD, qualified
as serious, and a violation of art. 5.4 of the indicated standard, also qualified
as serious. [...]”

The SAN responds to the question raised by the plaintiff in the following terms:

“As a result of what was raised by the plaintiff, it is convenient to reflect the constitutional doctrine
and the jurisprudence on the scope of the right of those sanctioned to be in-
formed of the accusation during the processing of the sanctioning administrative procedure
and the limits to be respected by the sanctioning body in the exercise of its
sanctioning power safeguard the right of defense of that.
The inspiring principles of the criminal order are applicable, with certain nuances, to the
Sanctioning Administrative Law, given that both are manifestations of the

punitive system of the State, as reflected in its own Constitution, a reiterated
jurisprudence of our Supreme Court and the doctrine of the Constitutional Court
(in this sense, Judgments of the Supreme Court of April 28, 2014 -appeal no.
364/2013 -, and of April 9, 2014 -appeal no. 212/2013 -, among others)

[... For its part, the Supreme Court has also established that one of the guarantees
applicable to the sanctioning administrative procedure derived from the right of
defense recognized in art. 24 of the Constitution is to be informed of the
accusation to be able to adequately defend oneself, as established in the Judgment
of the Supreme Court of November 3, 2003 - appeal no. 4,896/2000 -, whose
doctrine is reiterated in the Judgments of said Court of May 21, 2014

in numerous resolutions a consolidated constitutional doctrine, which cites
as applicable, without exhaustiveness, the right of defense, which proscribes

b) Among the guarantees applicable to the sanctioning administrative procedure is

of the same and the sanction that is proposed. Now, the strict correlation
between accusation and decision refers to the facts and not so much to the legal qualification,
since the facts subject to the charge remain unchanged, the proposal for
resolution and, ultimately, the sanctioning decision may use another title of
sentence with two limits: the impossibility of being included in said resolution of the
procedure a legal qualification of greater seriousness than that reflected in the
communication of charges addressed to whoever is subjected to the sanctioning file, and
the impossibility of appreciating in the resolution a legal qualification different from the
communicated if there is heterogeneity in the legal rights protected or if the
infringement definitively considered incorporates some element of the type that does not
corresponds to that which was notified and on which the sanctioned party has not had, in
consequently, defense opportunity. And there is no variation of the facts between the
statement of objections, the resolution proposal and the sanctioning decision when,

defense, having been deprived of the possibility of providing the evidence that
considered appropriate for the legitimate exercise of their right, it should be remembered that the
Article 82 LPACAP, which regulates the hearing process, provides in section 2:
"Those interested, within a period of not less than ten days nor more than fifteen, may
plead and present the documents and justifications they deem pertinent.”

Therefore, in view of what has been exposed through sections a) to d)
precedents, in which the reasons that, in the opinion of the respondent, have been examined
would determine the radical nullity of this proceeding due to the concurrence of the
circumstances of article 47.1.a) and e) LPACAP, we believe that such claim must be
be rejected.

IV

Of the presumed recognition by the AEPD of the legality of the FIJ during the validity of the
legal regime prior to the RGPD and the legal effects that in the opinion of the
claimed are derived from it.

1. Reference to the legal regime prior to the RGPD.

Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the protection of personal data
(LOPD), which transposed Directive 95/46/CE, of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of 10/24/1995, established in its article 6:
"1. The processing of personal data will require the consent
unequivocal of the affected party, unless the law provides otherwise.
2. Consent will not be required when personal data is collected
for the exercise of the functions of public administrations in the field
of their competencies; [...] or when the data appears in sources accessible to the public and
its treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued by the
responsible for the file or by the third party to whom the data is communicated, always
that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party are not violated.”

In turn, article 3 of the LOPD defined public access sources as follows:
“j) Sources accessible to the public: those files whose consultation can be made,
by any person, not impeded by a limiting norm or without further requirement that,
where appropriate, the payment of a consideration.”

The judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 11/24/2011 (cases
C-468/10 and C-469/10), which resolved the preliminary ruling raised by the
Supreme Court and whose pronouncement was collected in the STS of 02/08/2012
(appeal 25/2008) states (paragraph 36) that the Member States cannot
introduce, under the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 95/46, principles
regarding the legitimacy of the processing of personal data other than those
set forth in Article 7 of that Directive or modify, by means of requirements
additions, the scope of the six principles established in said article 7.

It added in paragraphs 38 and 39 that article 7, letter f), establishes two requirements
cumulative for a processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, by a
part, that the processing of personal data is necessary for the satisfaction of the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third party or

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

127/184

third parties to whom the data is communicated, and, on the other, that the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party. And he concluded that it follows
that, with regard to the processing of personal data, article 7, letter f), of the
Directive 95/46 opposes any national legislation which, in the event that there is no
consent of the interested party, impose additional requirements that are added to the
two cumulative requirements mentioned in the previous section.

Given the incorrect transposition that was made in the national law of said precept, the
STJUE (paragraphs 51 and 55) recognizes the direct effect of article 7.f) of the Directive
95/46 with the consequence that from then on it had to be understood as displaced (which
not annulled) the rule of article 6.2 LOPD in favor of the aforementioned precept.

Until the publication of the judgments of the CJEU and the TS, the AEPD and the Courts of
justice applied article 6.2. LOPD in connection with article 3.j) and concluded
without further ado than the treatment of data obtained from those access sources
public was deemed lawful.

As a result of the judgments of the CJEU and the TS, the circumstance that the data
data had been obtained from a public access source defined in the
Article 3. j) LOPD could no longer, by that mere fact, constitute the legal basis
of personal data processing.

The relevance that from then on could be attributed to the circumstance that the
data object of treatment came from sources of such nature is the one mentioned
in paragraph 44 of the STJUE which indicates that with regard to the weighting
required by article 7, f) of Directive 95/46 “it is necessary to take into account the
fact that the seriousness of the injury to the fundamental rights of the person
affected by said treatment may vary depending on whether the data already appears, or
no, in sources accessible to the public.”

After the STJE, the National High Court, in a judgment of 05/31/2012,
upheld the contentious appeal filed against the resolution issued by the AEPD that
sanctioned for infraction of article 6.1 LOPD, as a consequence of the treatment
of the data of those affected without their consent to whom they sent emails
electronic mail advertising your candidacy in the elections of a Professional Association.
The sanctioning resolution had rejected the legitimate interest invoked by the
sanctioned as the basis of the treatment on the premise that the data
treatises did not come from publicly accessible sources. The judgment of the Court
National says:
“[...] It is possible, ultimately, and in accordance with said Community Jurisprudence, that
there are personal data treatments that do not appear in one of those that our
internal legislation calls "public access sources" (article 3.f) LOPD and article
7 RLOPD) but that, however, do not require the consent of the holders of
such data because their treatment is necessary to satisfy a legitimate interest of the
responsible
of the same, or of the transferee, provided that the rights and freedoms of the
interested party [...]” And he adds: “[...] Weighting of conflicting interests [...] will depend on
the specific circumstances of each case and in which, however, it can be taken
into consideration, in order to determine the possible infringement of the rights
of the data subject, the fact that the data already appears, or not, in sources

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

128/184

accessible to the public. Plus it, simply, as one more element of weighting.”
(emphasis ours)

In the regulatory framework of the RGPD, the position of the AEPD regarding calls
public access sources is reflected in Report 136/2018, which recalls:

“[...] already in the 10th annual session it was stated that with the GDPR one cannot speak of a
legal concept of public access source as the one existing with the previous LOPD. The
Article 14.1 f) of the RGPD only mentions said concept to establish the
obligation of the data controller to provide the data subject with information on whether
your personal data comes from publicly accessible sources, but without defining these”.

In the same sense, the Report of 10/03/2019, (Entry Registration 045824/2019)
pointed out that “[...] as of the entry into force of the RGPD, one cannot speak of a
legal concept of “sources accessible to the public” such as the one that existed in the previous Law
Organic 15/1993 [...] The RGPD only speaks of public access sources when regulating the
right to information if the data has not been collected from the interested party”.

2. In the brief of allegations to the proposed resolution, through his allegation
fourth - "On the assessments made by the AEPD on the basis of legal
IV of the proposed resolution" - the respondent adduces, as it did in its
allegations to the initial agreement, that the AEPD has violated the principle of trust
legitimate and therefore does not concur in the performance of EQUIFAX the subjective element
of the infraction, in such a way that no sanction could be imposed by virtue of the
principle of guilt recognized in article 28 of Law 40/2015, of 1
October, of the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (LRJSP)

The first allegation of the brief of allegations to the proposal ratifies in its entirety
the allegations that the respondent made against the agreement to open the
process.

As reflected in the proposed resolution, the respondent alleged that, in the present
In this case, all the required elements were present to appreciate that the Agency had
violated the principle of legitimate expectations and mentioned to this end the STS of 02/22/2016
(appeal 1354/2014) according to which the breach of this principle would require the
concurrence of these elements:
(i) that is based on undeniable and external signs; (ii) that the expectations generated in
the administered must be legitimate; (iii) that the final conduct of the Administration
is contradictory with the previous acts, is surprising and incoherent.

In the opinion of EQUIFAX, this breach of the legitimate expectations of the AEPD would force the
archive of the procedure due to the absence of the culpabilistic element of the infraction.
In that sense, he invoked, in defense of his thesis that the AEPD had broken the
principle of legitimate expectations, the SAN of 02/04/2009 (appeal 304/2007) that declares
that the breach of this principle should lead to the annulment of the sanctioning resolution
resource object.

The sentence indicates that it is true that the motivation of the resolutions
administrative procedures required by article 54 of Law 30/1992 must allow the
change of criteria in decision making "but this change of criteria cannot

have retroactive effect, especially in cases in which there had been
previous exculpatory pronouncements in the face of identical conduct
 .” This SAN appointment, to his
 
again, another from the same Court on 06/13/2008 (appeal 55/2005) in which it indicates that “In
sanctioning matter, the new criteria, however reasonable they may be, [...]
their effects must unfold into the future, but never be projected into
past performances that fit existing criteria.

In turn, in the allegations that EQUIFAX made to the opening agreement, among other
many considerations, stated specifically that the legal framework existing before
of the effective application of the RGPD and after the STJUE of 11/24/2011, no
had been altered if not reiterated, both in relation to the principle of legality and the
principle of accuracy (remember that the opening agreement attributed to the claimed
violation of both principles). Thus, on folio 18 of the pleadings brief to the
opening agreement says the following:
“This also leads to the conclusion that the alleged treatment carried out
carried out by my client [...] not only was it not contrary, but expressly
covered by the current regulatory framework prior to the entry into force of the RGPD,
being also necessary to add that this framework has not been altered, but by the
contrary reiterated with said entry into force, both in what affects the principle of
legality (which was also included in article 6.1.a) of the Directive as well as in what
concerns the principle of accuracy [...]” (emphasis added)

On folio 22 of the pleadings to the opening agreement, the respondent underlined that
the content of the rules allegedly violated had not been modified. It says in that
sense:
“Everything that has been indicated, there is no doubt that it implies the existence of a
manifest change of legal criteria on the part of that AEPD, which now considers
radically illicit the treatment that had been understood to be lawful (without
modified the tenor of the rules allegedly violated [...]”

At the same time, the respondent exposed in her allegations the opening agreement (which
let us remember has expressly reiterated in his allegations to the proposal) that the
initial agreement of PS/240/2019 represented a change of legal criteria, of
way that the Agency violated the principle of legitimate expectations and security
legal, principles that must govern the actions of the Public Administrations
in accordance with article 3.1.e, of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the
Public Sector, (LRJSP).
If the AEPD had indeed violated the principles of legitimate expectations and
legal certainty - which obviously has not happened - the consequence could be
the filing of the file due to the absence of the culpabilistic element of the infraction.

Now, for a violation of the principle of legitimate expectations to be appreciated, the
change of legal criterion must be arbitrary and, therefore, cannot be motivated by
a regulatory change.

At this point, it should be noted that, in the case we are analyzing, this
normative change exists, so that in no case is it possible to conclude, as
claims the claimed, that the AEPD has arbitrarily modified its criteria
thus breaking the principle of legitimate expectations. The regulatory change is
specifically in the repeal by the LOPDGDD of article 29.1 of the LOPD.

EQUIFAX repeatedly implies that, to the extent that the rules that
regulate the principles of legality and accuracy in the RGPD and in Directive 95/46 have not
varied in essence, there is no other regulatory change that justifies the criterion
followed in this proceeding processed before it.

The truth is, however, that EQUIFAX wields in its various writings of
allegations, as a legal basis for the data processing carried out by the FIJ,
an “express legal provision” that, says that entity, recognized the legality of systems
such as the FIJ: article 29.1 LOPD.

The controversy therefore arises around the legal framework in force before the
effective application of the RGPD and after the STJUE so many times cited and if said
legal framework considered or not in accordance with the regulations governing the right to
protection of personal data the treatment that the FIJ carried out.

In the brief of allegations to the initial agreement, the respondent tried to corroborate her
particular conception of the scope of article 29.1 LOPD with what is indicated in the agreement
opening of the procedure. Thus, the motion for a resolution stated the following:
“The third allegation of the brief of allegations to the opening agreement of the
procedure is dedicated to the “[...] the regulations pre-existing the RGPD and the
action of the AEPD in relation to the File of Judicial Incidents”.
Arguments that the respondent expressly reiterated in her second written statement of
pleadings to the opening agreement or complementary pleadings.
The entity stated in that third allegation of its brief that “[..] as
recognizes the Agreement itself, the material norms whose violation is imputed to my
principal have not changed in terms of their content as a result of the reform
operated by the GDPR.”
 “[..] based on the similarity, if not identity, between the regulations previously
in force and the one included in the text of the RGPD, it is necessary to take into account that the
systems such as the FIJ were expressly recognized in article 29.1 of the "
LOPD. And that, in light of the jurisprudence issued by the CJEU, the conclusion is reached
“that the data processing carried out by the FIJ was based on the
provided for in Article 7 f) of the Directive [...]”. (emphasis ours)

He added “[...] that the alleged treatment carried out by my client [...] not only
was not contrary, but expressly protected in the current regulatory framework
prior to the entry into force of the RGPD [...]” And that said framework has not been seen
altered, but on the contrary reiterated with said entry into force, both in what
It affects the principle of legality as well as the principle of accuracy. (The
underlining is ours)

These considerations of EQUIFAX forced to warn in the proposal of
resolution that “the opening agreement referred, solely and exclusively, to the similarity
that exists between article 6.1.f) of the RGPD and article 7.f) of Directive 95/46. The
manifestations of the claimed may imply that the reference to the article
7.f) of Directive 95/46 that was made in the initial agreement is the same as the reference
that she does to the regime provided for in the previous regulations, in which it is included,
among other provisions, article 29.1 of the LOPD. Question that would lack all
importance were it not for the fact that after establishing such equivalence the claimed

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

131/184

goes on to affirm that the FIJ was recognized in article 29.1 of the LOPD and from there to
affirm that the "data processing" carried out through the FIJ in the legal regime
prior to GDPR was lawful.”

Well then, in the brief of allegations to the proposed resolution, the one claimed -in
its fourth allegation, which is headed “On the assessments made by the
AEPD on the basis of law IV of the resolution proposal "- continues
stating that, until the full implementation of the GDPR, and even after, until
the entry into force of the LOPDGDD "there was an express legal provision that recognized
the legality of information systems that collect information obtained with the
consent of the interested party or of sources accessible to the public with the purpose of
assess the solvency of the interested parties. (emphasis ours)

The defendant expresses the thesis that she defends more clearly, not in this allegation
fourth of the brief of allegations to the proposal but in the sixth allegation related to the
legality principle.

Without prejudice to the fact that we return to the issue on the occasion of analyzing the infringement
of article 6.1 RGPD, we anticipate that the defendant affirms, after saying that
has an "obvious legal basis, the concurrence of a legitimate interest
prevalent, for the treatment of the data in the FIJ.” He adds that “Obviously, the
Article 29.1 of the LOPD did not regulate the basic principles or the legal bases of the
treatment, but determined that, on the basis of principles and legal bases
identical to those contained in the RGPD, the treatment of the data collected in the
itself was lawful. In other words, either article 29.1 of the LOPD exceeded its limits with respect to
of the regime contained in the Directive, enabling nothing less than a treatment that
violated its articles 6 and 7 in the terms assumed by the Resolution Proposal,
something that neither the Court nor the Institutions of the European Union (and even less the
own AEPD) even insinuated at any time or, remaining immutable the
principles and legal bases, this treatment is as consistent with the GDPR as it was under
Directive. This fact is indubitable, no matter how much it is tried to force the
argument in another sense. (The emphasis is ours.

Given the continuous references of EQUIFAX in its allegations to the initial agreement
that sought to protect the treatment carried out by the FIJ in article 29.1 LOPD,
in the proposed resolution it was noted that the aforementioned file would have a place in the
category or file system provided for in that precept as long as it respects
the principles that governed the data protection regulations provided for in article 4
of the LOPD, data quality, and, in particular, the principle of limitation of the
purpose of the treatment. And that, being the FIJ a credit information system that
does not obtain the data from the information provided by the interested party, nor does he provide his
consent to treatment, but obtains the data from “records and sources
accessible to the public”, the legal basis for this treatment could be, solely, the
provided for in article 7.f) of the Directive.
It should be remembered, for this purpose, that article 37.1 of the RLOPD established that "The
treatment of personal data on capital solvency and credit,
provided for in section 1 of article 29 of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13
December, will be subject to what is established, in general, in said organic law and
in these regulations.”

132/184

The change in the legal criteria of the AEPD, which in the opinion of EQUIFAX represents the
procedure followed in front of her does not arise - as the
claimed- regarding the legal bases of data processing or the principles
governing it provided, respectively, in the Directive and the RGPD.

On the contrary, the change in the criterion attributed to the AEPD and that, supposedly, was
reflected in the procedure at hand revolves around article 29.1 LOPD. Plus
exactly, the intended change of criteria is nothing more than the disparate interpretation of the
norm, of its meaning and scope, that do, respectively, this Agency and
EQUIFAX.

In any case, article 29.1 LOPD is not in force. It was repealed by
LOPDGDD, which entered into force on 12/07/2018, and neither in the RGPD nor in the LOPDGDD
there is an equivalent standard.

For the reasons stated, the thesis that the AEPD has violated the
principle of legitimate expectations. The procedure directed against EQUIFAX is
consistent as has been indicated with the meaning of the STJUE and with the
repeal of article 29.1 LOPD in which that entity intends to protect the
treatment carried out through the FIJ.

Infringement of the purpose limitation principle

v

1. The behaviors that are subject to assessment in this sanctioning procedure
are related to the treatment carried out by the claimed person through the FIJ of
personal data of those affected that he obtained, for the most part, from the BOE, plus
exactly from the Single Edictal Board of the BOE (TEU-BOE); of the official journals of
the autonomous communities; of the Provincial Bulletins (BOP) and through the
electronic or physical headquarters of Public Law bodies or entities. so what
accredit the documents that are in the file related to the response to the
access to the FIJ requested by those affected. In the light of these documents there are in the
FIJ entries of alleged debts attributed to the claimants who were given
registration in the file on very different dates, some of them in 2013.

The RGPD dedicates to the principles that govern the treatment of personal data
article 5. Among them, it refers to the limitation of the purpose in article
5.1.b) according to which personal data will be "collected for specific purposes,
explicit and legitimate, and will not be further processed in a manner incompatible with
said purposes; according to article 89, paragraph 1, the further treatment of the
personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, research purposes
scientific and historical or statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the purposes
initials” (emphasis added)

Recital 50 of the RGPD contributes to clarify the scope of this principle and
He says:
“The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which they have been
initially collected should only be allowed when compatible with the purposes
of your initial collection. In such a case, no separate legal basis is required, other than
which allowed the collection of personal data. If treatment is necessary

133/184

for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
public powers conferred on the data controller, the tasks and purposes
for which subsequent processing must be considered compatible and lawful can be
determine and specify in accordance with the Law of the Union or of the States
members. Further processing operations for archiving purposes in the interest
public, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes must
be considered compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis
established in the Law of the Union or of the Member States for the treatment
of personal data can also serve as a legal basis for further processing.
In order to determine whether the purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose of
initial collection of personal data, the data controller, after having
fulfilled all the requirements for the legality of the original treatment, you must take into account
account, among other things, any relationship between these purposes and the purposes of the
intended further processing, the context in which the data was collected, in
particular the reasonable expectations of the data subject based on their relationship with the
responsible for its subsequent use, the nature of the personal data, the
consequences for data subjects of the intended further processing and the existence of
adequate guarantees both in the original treatment operation and in the
planned further processing operation. If the interested party gave his consent or the
treatment is based on the law of the Union or of the Member States that
constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the
responsible must be empowered for the further processing of personal data,
regardless of the compatibility of purposes. In any case, it must be guaranteed
the application of the principles established by this Regulation and, in particular,
the information of the interested party about those other purposes and about their rights, including the
right of opposition. The indication of possible criminal acts or threats to the
public security by the data controller and transmission to the
competent authority of the data regarding individual cases or diverse cases
related to the same criminal act or threat to public safety must
considered to be in the legitimate interest of the controller. However, it should be prohibited
that transmission in the legitimate interest of the person in charge or the subsequent processing of data
personal information if the treatment is not compatible with an obligation of legal secrecy,
professional or otherwise binding.”

The principle of limitation of the purpose prevents a treatment from being carried out
subsequent personal data if the purposes of this treatment and those pursued by the
original treatment are not compatible. Article 6 RGPD, regarding the "Legality of the
treatment”, dedicates its section 4 to enumerate the elements that allow to determine
if processing for another purpose is compatible with the initial purpose for which they were collected
the data:
“When the treatment for another purpose other than that for which the data was collected
personal data is not based on the consent of the interested party or on the Law
of the Union or of the Member States which constitutes a necessary and
proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard the stated objectives
in article 23, paragraph 1, the data controller, in order to determine
if processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which they were collected
initially the personal data, will take into account, among other things:

134/184

a) any relationship between the purposes for which the data was collected
data and the purposes of the intended further processing;
 b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular by what
regarding the relationship between the interested parties and the data controller;
  c) the nature of the personal data, specifically when categories are processed
special personal data, in accordance with article 9, or personal data
relating to criminal convictions and offences, in accordance with article 10;
d) the possible consequences for data subjects of the envisaged further processing;
e) the existence of adequate safeguards, which may include encryption or
pseudonymization”

2. For the purpose of determining whether the treatment of the data of the claimants that
has made EQUIFAX through the FIJ is or is not respectful of the principle set forth in
Article 5.1.b) RGPD, the starting point must be the origin of the processed data.
 
As has already been indicated, the data of the claimants were obtained, in their great
majority, from the BOE, more precisely from the Single Edictal Board of the BOE (TEU-BOE); of
the official journals of the Autonomous Communities; of the Provincial Bulletins
(BOP) and through the electronic or physical headquarters of organizations or legal entities
Public. The fact that the data of the complainants come from public sources,
basically from newspapers and official bulletins, evidence that these had been subject to
prior treatment for a specific purpose.

“When those interested in a procedure are unknown, the place is ignored.

It will be done by means of an announcement published in the «Official State Gazette».

Likewise, previously and on an optional basis, the Administrations may
publish an announcement in the official gazette of the Autonomous Community or the Province,
on the bulletin board of the City Council of the last domicile of the interested party or of the
Consulate or Consular Section of the corresponding Embassy.

The Public Administrations may establish other forms of notification
complementary through the remaining media, which will not exclude the
obligation to publish the corresponding announcement in the “Official State Gazette.”

Article 45 of the LPACAP, “Publication”, provides:
"1. The administrative acts will be published when so established by the
regulations governing each procedure or when advised by reasons of interest
public appreciated by the competent body.

In any case, the administrative acts will be published, supplying the
effects of the notification, in the following cases:
a) When the act is addressed to an indeterminate plurality of people or
when the Administration considers that the notification made to a single interested party is
insufficient to guarantee notification to all, being, in the latter case,
additional to the one carried out individually.
b) In the case of acts that are part of a selective procedure or
competitive competition of any kind. In this case, the call for

only the individual aspects of each act.

3. The publication of the acts will be carried out in the corresponding official newspaper, according to

4. Without prejudice to the provisions of article 44, the publication of acts and

These precepts detail the cases in which the Administrations

Likewise, the publication of acts and resolutions will be used in the cases of
article 45 LPACAP. Assumptions that, following Gamero Casado's criteria,
We can group as follows:
(i) Substitute publications of the notification (that is, when the acts are published
instead of being notified), which is appropriate when the act is addressed to a
indeterminate plurality of people or in the case of acts that make up a
selective or competitive procedure.
(ii) Supplementary publication of the notice (in addition to the notice is
publication is mandatory), which happens when reasons of interest advise it.
public; in procedures in which there are several interested parties, when
notify only one and it is feared that it is insufficient to guarantee the knowledge of the
act by all of them and when the rules governing a specific procedure
so establish it.

With the exception of the "substitute publications of the notification" provided for in the
article 44 LPACAP, in which, as indicated, publication in
the BOE, in the rest of the cases the publication is made in the official gazette
corresponding to the Public Administration from which it comes. The LPACAP, Article
45.4 authorizes that through specific legal or regulatory provisions you can
imposing the publication of acts and communications on bulletin boards or
edicts, although it adds that this obligation will be understood to be fulfilled with the publication
in the corresponding official gazette.

In terms similar to article 44 of the LPACAP, article 112 of the
Law 58/2003, of December 17, General Tax, which provides for the summons, to be
notified by appearance, through announcements published in the BOE. Also
Article 29.2 of the Consolidated Text of the Real Estate Cadastre Law, approved by the
Royal Legislative Decree 1/2004, of March 5, provides for the notification
mandatory by means of an announcement in the BOE. The Consolidated Text of the Law
General Social Security, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 8/2015, of
October 30, provides in article 132.4 that notifications that have not been able to
be made at the electronic headquarters of the Social Security or at the domicile of the
interested, will be practiced exclusively by means of an announcement published in the
Official State Gazette in accordance with the third additional provision of the Law
39/2015.

3. The publication that the Public Administrations carry out of acts or resolutions
administrative that include personal data, implies for the administered a
restriction to the fundamental right that they have recognized in article 18.4 of the C.E.

Through the publication of an act or administrative resolution -which, as has been
indicated, article 39 of the LPACAP conditions its effectiveness- it is wanted to guarantee to the
interested parties the exercise of their right to defense -which in turn connects with the
right to effective judicial protection recognized in article 24.1 of the E.C.- and allows
to the Public Administrations the exercise of their powers. In such a way that the
purpose pursued with this obvious limitation to the right to data protection
it is directly connected to a public interest.

The publication of the personal data of those affected in these cases is, therefore,
outside his will. It is established by a norm with the force of law and is justified by the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

137/184

public interest it pursues. Well, it is precisely these personal data,
that have been published in official gazettes and journals without the consent of the
will of its owners in compliance with a legal obligation and with the purpose of
satisfy a public interest, the data from which the FIJ is nourished. Evidently
when its content is related to situations of non-compliance with
monetary obligations.

The subsequent treatment of these data that EQUIFAX carries out pursues a purpose
clearly different from the public interest that justified its publication. If we don't stick to the
legitimate interests that EQUIFAX seeks to satisfy through the FIJ, it is evident
that these are different purposes. While the data processing of the
administered by the Public Administrations through the publication of acts
administrative in newspapers and official gazettes seeks to satisfy a public interest,
the subsequent treatment that EQUIFAX makes of said data through the FIJ -as it has
declared the claimed in the pleadings brief to the initiation agreement- is
linked to the evaluation of the solvency of those affected and the prevention of fraud.

Article 6.4 RGPD provides some criteria to determine if the subsequent treatment
of claimants' data through the FIJ is compatible with the treatment
original. Added to these are the indications offered in Recital 50 of the
GDPR.
In the present case, in light of the guidelines that both offer, it can be affirmed that
the purpose of the original treatment and that of the subsequent treatment by EQUIFAX are
clearly incompatible: There is no relationship between the purpose of the treatment
carried out through publications in bulletins and official journals that include
personal data of those affected - the public interest connected with the right to
effective judicial protection of those administered and the effective exercise by
Public Administrations of the powers attributed to them- and the purpose for which
EQUIFAX processes the data, which it has specified in the evaluation of solvency and in
fraud prevention.

Nor is there between the claimants and the data controller any
relationship linked to the context in which the data was collected, so that the
affected could not have had any reasonable expectation that their data would be
object of this treatment. The consequences that derive for the claimants whose
data have been included in the FIJ are clearly adverse, since we are facing a
negative file of patrimonial solvency that identifies them as debtors before
anyone who makes a query to that file, with the added aggravation that the
FIJ clearly breaches the accuracy principle in its update statement
of the data. And, obviously, EQUIFAX has not established additional guarantees for
that the processing does not affect the fundamental right to data protection
that the purpose that the FIJ seeks to satisfy requires having the identity data of
the affected.

The principle of proactive responsibility of article 5.2 RGPD obliges the person in charge
of the treatment to be able to prove that it complies with the principles that
preside over data processing; so here we are interested in the principle of limitation
of the purpose. On the other hand, both article 6.4 RGPD and Recital 50 are
refer to the data controller as the subject who must determine whether the
purpose of the subsequent treatment that it intends to carry out is compatible with the purpose

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

138/184

for which the data was initially collected, which is consistent with the principle
of proactive responsibility that must govern the actions of the person in charge of the
treatment.

It seems obvious that EQUIFAX has been fully aware that the treatment of
data that it carries out through the FIJ violates article 5.1.b) RGPD.

In this sense, due to its clear relevance to the element of guilt, we pass
to reproduce this fragment of document number 8 of those provided in response to
the evidence proceedings - “LIA Judicial File. Legal analysis. December 2019”-,
document that the respondent previously provided to the AEPD annexed to the writ of
allegations to the initiation agreement. The document, as indicated in its point 1, has
for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a prevailing legal interest in the treatment
carried out by the FIJ against the rights, freedoms and interests of the holders of the
data. Well, point 7 of the document – “Operation of the files of
EQUIFAX with information obtained from publicly accessible sources”- dedicates a section
to analyze the guarantees that the file intends to implement and in point 1.1., under the
heading "Principle of purpose", states the following:
On the other hand, the principle of finality includes the limitation of the subsequent uses of
the data, since the RGPD prohibits in its article 5.1 a) the subsequent treatment of
the data for purposes incompatible with those that motivated its collection, even if
except from this limitation the use of data for archival purposes of public interest or
scientific or statistical research. [...].” (emphasis ours)

It is noteworthy that the respondent has invoked in her pleadings brief the
initial agreement that, with regard to the implications derived from the regulations of
reuse of public sector information, “[...] the sources from which information has been
collected the data to which the claims made refer and in general
the data incorporated into the FIJ expressly enable the reuse of said
information, therefore, without prejudice to the application of article 4.6 of the LRISP, the
reference to said standard will not be relevant as an obstacle that allows the
collection of the data by it.” (emphasis added) And,
then, refer to the general conditions of reuse of the website
of the Official State Gazette.

It is surprising that he invokes the information on the BOE website when the regulation that
is applicable as far as the reuse of public sector information is concerned
is article 4.6 of Law 37/2007, of November 16, on "reuse of
information from the public sector”, according to which when the documents contain
personal data the applicable legal regime is that of the regulations of
data protection and, therefore, respect for the principle of limitation
of the purpose provided for in article 5.1.b) RGPD.

Let us also remember that the AEBOE's response to the
query made by claimants 35 and 55 about whether it was lawful for
your personal data included in the notification announcements could be treated
in order to integrate a database for profit. The AEBOE
answered:
“[...] In accordance with the foregoing, this State Agency considers that the reuse
of personal data such as names, surnames, ID associated with debts,

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

139/184

published in the BOE, that you requests, it would not be a lawful treatment of data of
personal nature of those provided for in art. 6 GDPR and therefore in accordance with
what is regulated both in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in Organic Law 3/2018, of
December 5, they must not be reused by third parties.”

4. The legislator has established various measures that contribute to respecting the principle
limitation of the purpose and that seek to reduce the impact on the right to
protection of data of the administered that could derive from the obligation that
Public Administrations have to publish through newspapers and bulletins
official administrative acts containing personal data.

In this sense, it is worth mentioning, on the one hand, articles 40.5 and 46 of the LPACAP.
On the other hand, we must refer to the fact that Law 15/2014, of September 16, of
rationalization of the Public Sector and other administrative reform measures, introduced
the twenty-first Additional Provision of Law 30/1992, on the Legal Regime of
Public Administrations (LPAC) from which the implementation of the
06/01/2015 of the Single Edictal Board, where acts of all the
Public administrations.

The announcements of notifications that are published through the BOE are integrated in
an "independent" document, called "Supplement of
notifications”. Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the newspaper
official Official State Gazette, modified as a result of Law 15/2014, configures for the
Notifications supplement a regime different from the one foreseen for the BOE. Among
other specialties, the aforementioned Royal Decree, restricts to three months from its
posting the period of time during which the Notice Supplement will be
accessible to the public.

Pursuant to Royal Decree 181/2008, the official gazette is structured as (i) “The content
of the "Official State Gazette", which includes sections I to V and the "Section of the
Constitutional Court”, and in (ii) “a Supplement of notifications of a
independent” in which the notification ads will be inserted.

Article 11 of this Royal Decree specifies that "The State Agency Official Gazette of the
The State shall guarantee, through open telecommunications networks, access
universal and free to the electronic edition of the official newspaper of the State, without prejudice to
the provisions of article 14.4.” And article 14.4 says:
"4. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sections, the Supplement to
notifications will remain freely accessible on the electronic headquarters of the Agency
State Official State Gazette for a period of three months from its
publication, after which the verification code of the

or his representative, as well as by the bodies and Administrations that may
specify it for the exercise of the powers that correspond to them.

The State Agency Official State Gazette will adopt measures aimed at avoiding the
automatic indexing and retrieval of verification codes by subjects
different from those contemplated in the previous paragraph.

Without prejudice to the provisions of the first additional provision, once the
period of three months established in the first paragraph, the State Agency Bulletin
Official of the State will facilitate, upon request, the information contained in the announcement of
notification only to the interested party or his representative, to the Public Prosecutor, to the
Ombudsman, and to the Judges and Courts.” (emphasis ours)

In the same sense, article 11 of the Royal Decree specifies that "The State Agency
Official State Gazette will guarantee, through open telecommunications networks,
universal and free access to the electronic edition of the official newspaper of the State, without
prejudice to the provisions of article 14.4.”

The precautions that Royal Decree 181/2008 adopts regarding the Supplement to
notifications, whose content is notification ads, do not end here.
Article 13 restricts the printed edition of the Notification Supplement to that
the circumstances described in section 1.a). And article 17, which provides that
the State Agency Official State Gazette (hereinafter AEBOE) will offer in its
electronic headquarters, with a differentiated character to the electronic edition of the BOE "a base
of free data that allows the search, retrieval and printing of the
provisions, acts and announcements published in the “Official State Gazette”, adds:
“However, the search, retrieval and printing, through the database service
data, from notification announcements published in the Notification Supplement,
It will only be possible during the period of three months provided for in article 14.4.”(The
underlining is ours)

Any citizen who wishes to do a search for the Notifications Supplement
published in a BOE three months after its publication you will not find it. In its
Instead, the BOE website offers this message: “In accordance with article 14
of Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the official newspaper "Boletín
Official of the State", the Supplement of notifications corresponding to this date has
no longer freely accessible. More info"

Well, while in accordance with article 14.4 of the regulatory norm,
After the period of three months, they will only be able to access the information
contained in an advertisement, with prior authorization from AEBOE, the interested party or their
representative, the Public Prosecutor, the Ombudsman and the Judges and Courts,
we find ourselves with the paradoxical situation that EQUIFAX has that information
in the FIJ, accessible to its associates for a period of six years under the
documentation that works in the file.

The claimed party, aware of the time limit imposed by article 14.4 of the Real
Decree 181/2008, has adopted the technical measures to store the information and
dispose of it beyond the three months following publication.

The FIJ RAT, both the final version and document 4 of the first version, which
EQUIFAX has contributed in response to the test carried out, as it shows. The
Section 8 of the RAT, under the heading "Information suppression periods", says:
“The information is accessible for 3 months and then it is stored in a directory

information, saved in “PDF” format, will be available for a period of 10

years from the date of publication, and this for the sole purpose of being able to meet the
possible claims and respond to requests for information by the
competent administrative body, as well as the courts and tribunals.” (The
underlining is ours)

  5. In its arguments to the proposed resolution, EQUIFAX states that this
principle has not undergone any modification in the RGPD, since it reproduces almost
fully what was established by Directive 95/46/EC on it, and then goes on to
affirm that “within the system of transposition of the Directive into our Law [...]”
article 29.1. of the LOPD “did not appreciate that [...] it was contrary to the principle of
purpose limitation enshrined in Directive 96/46/EC,” the processing of data
personal data carried out by those who are dedicated to the provision of services
of information on the patrimonial solvency and the credit consisting of the collection of
personal data obtained from records and sources accessible to the
public established for this purpose.
It also states that “the legal basis that justified the collection of the data subject to
publication [was] to obtain information on the solvency of assets and the credit of the
interested parties based on the available information related to them”, and that
“This legal basis was expressly included in the LOPD,
 owing
Article 29.1 should be interpreted in the sense that the processing was protected
in the prevailing legitimate interest of those who proceeded, like my principal, to
processing of the data, as there is an unequivocal legal authorization for said
treatment could take place. (emphasis ours)
The respondent ends its argument regarding the "non-compliance with the principle of
purpose” with the paragraph that we reproduce:

“In short, the processing of personal data does not take place in this case.
contained in the FIJ for a purpose other than the one that motivated its collection, since
this was precisely what justifies the maintenance of the data in the system and its
access by the entities that were adhered to the FIJ with the purpose of
know the equity solvency and the credit of its debtors or potential debtors,
on the basis of a prevailing legitimate interest that, at least until the entry into
force of the LOPDGDD was expressly enabled by the regulations of
personal data protection." (emphasis ours)

In the same line of argument he says that "this compatibility (or that character "does not
different" from the purpose) was appreciated even after the entry into force
of Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, organizing the official newspaper «Boletín
Official of the State» (hereinafter, “RDBOE”), to which the
Proposal". Also, after the entry into force of Law 37/2007, of 16
November, on the reuse of public sector information and Law 19/2013, of
December 9, transparency, access to information and good governance. (The
underlining is ours)

He also makes another equally surprising statement: “[...] it must be remembered that the
measures adopted by RBOE, which would come to reflect the restrictions that
subsequently, with regard to open data, the Group revealed
Working Group of Article 29 (hereinafter WG29) in its Opinion 3/2013 on the
limitation of purpose, [...], do not refer to data processing such as that carried out
carried out by my principal through the FIJ, in which access to information is

28001 – Madrid

limited to creditors or potential creditors of the interested party. These measures, for
On the contrary, they try to avoid an access subject to the condition of creditor, real or
potential, but an indiscriminate access to the data object of publication in the
official journals.” (emphasis ours)

Indeed, the regulation of the principle of limitation of the purpose contained in the
Directive 95/46/EC is practically the same as the text of article 5.1.b) of the
GDPR. It is at this point that we can only agree with what is alleged by the
claimed in its defense against the infringement of the purpose limitation principle
that is attributed to him.

The defendant denies the violation of article 5.1.b) RGPD and affirms that the proposal
has made a forced interpretation of Recital 50 of the RGPD. Interestingly, the
explanation offered is certainly a forced interpretation. Thus, it shows that the
processing of the data contained in the FIJ does not have a purpose other than that
that has motivated its collection since, precisely for that purpose -the one that motivated the
data collection - is what justifies keeping them in the system and
adhered entities have access to them.

This statement is based on the consideration that the purpose that gave rise to what
calls "the collection" of the data is identified with the collection that EQUIFAX makes
of the data published in newspapers and official bulletins and not with the collection of data
for the original treatment, which is the one to which the RGPD, like the Directive, is
is referring. Affirmation that is based, in turn, on the fact that the rule of article 29.1
LOPD established the prevalence of a legitimate interest of those responsible for the
asset solvency information systems such as the FIJ “since there is a
unequivocal legal authorization so that said treatment could take place”

Two issues must be specified in this regard: the first is that the rule of the
Article 29.1 of the LOPD was repealed by the LOPDGDD, which entered into force on
07/12/2018. The second, that the interpretation of article 29.1. LOPD that defends
would mean that under this precept the data controller was exempted from
an information system such as the FIJ of the fulfillment of the obligations that
imposed by the LOPD, such as those provided for in article 4.2 LOPD.

Well, article 37 of the RLOPD, "General regime", framed in title IV -
Provisions applicable to certain privately owned files - Chapter I
-information files on equity and credit solvency-, established:

“The processing of personal data on capital solvency and credit,
provided for in section 1 of article 29 of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13
December, will be subject to what is established, in general, in said organic law and
in these regulations.”

In short, at the same time it argues that the purpose limitation principle does not
has changed its regulation in the Directive and the RGPD -affirmation that seeks to support its
thesis that there has been no regulatory change between the existing legal regime
during the term of the LOPD and that provided for in the RGPD, so having adjusted
their behavior to the same legal regime is the AEPD who, given the identity
standards, is adopting different solutions - and affirms that it does not violate the principle

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

143/184

limitation of the purpose provided for in the Directive - which was transferred to our Law
in article 4.2 LOPD – because a rule of domestic law, which has no
correlated in Directive 95/46/CE, article 29.1. LOPD, exempts you from complying with said
beginning. And this, supported by his statement that article 29.1 LOPD “does not
I appreciate that the treatment to which he referred was contrary to the principle of limitation of
purpose.

Thus, through the interpretation of article 29.1 of the LOPD, this
provision has the scope to establish a legal presumption of prevalence of interest
of the entities responsible for files such as the FIJ and to exempt them from
compliance with the obligations imposed by the LOPD, in particular for what is here
interested in article 4.2. LOPD.

On the other hand, the claimed, brings up on several occasions the Royal Decree
181/2008, ordering the official gazette Official State Gazette (RDBOE). Nail
times to affirm that “this compatibility (or this “non-distinct” character of the
purpose) was appreciated even after the entry into force” of the RBOE and
others to make inadmissible considerations, such as that the measures adopted by
RDBOE, "do not refer to data processing such as that carried out by my
principal through the FIJ, in which access to information is limited to
creditors or potential creditors of the interested party.”

6. From the preceding statement it is concluded that EQUIFAX has been treating the
personal data of claimants through the FIJ in violation of the principle of
limitation of the purpose provided for in article 5.1.b) of the RGPD.

This infringement is typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, which establishes:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; [...]”

On the other hand, for prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD qualifies in its article 72.1.a)
the violation of article 5.1.b) of very serious infringement.

Of the infringement of the principle of legality

1. The RGPD deals in article 5 with the principles that govern the treatment of
personal data and in section 1.a) provides that personal data
They will be treated in a "lawful, fair and transparent manner in relation to the interested party". In
In the same sense, Recital 39 states that "All processing of personal data
must be lawful [...]”

In accordance with article 6.1 of the RGPD so that the processing of personal data is
lawful must be based on, at least, one of the circumstances that this precept
relates. Letter f) of article 6.1. provides that the processing of personal data

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

144/184

will be lawful when “the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of interests
legitimate pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
over said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
particularly when the interested party is a child.

The STJUE of 11/24/2011, cited so many times, which declared the direct effect of the
provision of article 7.f) of Direct 95/46, regarding the legal basis of the
prevalence of legitimate interest, pointed out that the aforementioned precept establishes two requirements
cumulative for a processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, by a
part, that the processing of personal data is necessary for the satisfaction of the
legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third party or
third parties to whom the data is communicated, and, on the other hand, that the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party (section 38). Also add to
purpose of the weighting, which will depend, in principle, on the circumstances
specific to the particular case in question and in which framework the person or institution
carrying out the weighting must take into account the importance of the rights that
articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
granted to the interested party (section 40).

Recital 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 contributes to the task of specifying
the content and scope of the legitimizing circumstance of article 6.1.f) RGPD. The
Opinion 6/2014 prepared by the Article 29 Working Group (hereinafter,
GT29) regarding the "Concept of legitimate interest of the data controller
data under article 7 of Directive 95/46/CE”, dated 04/09/2014, facilitates the
interpretation of article 7.1.f) of the Directive and offers guidelines for the mandatory
weighting of conflicting interests and rights.

The application of article 6.1.f) RGP requires that there is a legitimate interest of the
data controller or third party; that the treatment is necessary for the
satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued; and that in weighing the interest
of the data controller or third parties on the one hand and the impact that
on the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party causes the
treatment of data that is intended to be carried out, on the other, the first prevails.

However, in order to conclude that a certain processing of personal data
is based on the prevalence of the legitimate interest of the controller or third parties against
to the interests or fundamental rights of the owners of the data -as
EQUIFAX adduces with respect to the FIJ- , following the guidelines of the Opinion of WG29 6/2014,
the analysis must begin by examining whether the legitimate interest invoked (i) is lawful, is
that is, in accordance with national and EU legislation. applicable; (ii) sufficiently
specific, that is, it is articulated clearly enough to allow the
balancing test is carried out against the interests and
fundamental rights of the interested party and (iii) represent a real and current interest, not
speculative.

Therefore, the first element to examine is the legality of the legitimate interest invoked;
that is, if the treatment necessary to satisfy such interest is in accordance with the legislation
national and EU WG29 Opinion 6/2014 says that an interest can
considered legitimate “provided that the data controller can pursue

28001 – Madrid

145/184

this interest in accordance with the laws relating to data protection and with the
rest of the legislation. (emphasis ours)

The respondent has specified in her pleadings brief to the initial agreement what is
the legitimate interest that it seeks to satisfy with the data processing carried out by the FIJ and
states that it is a double interest:
(i) An interest linked to the evaluation of the solvency of those affected and (ii) an interest
linked to fraud prevention. Regarding the first -related to the evaluation
of solvency - considers that they hold it themselves, EQUIFAX; the third parties that
consult the information contained in the file and the borrowers and consumers.

She justifies the interest linked to the evaluation of the solvency of which she is the holder in
that information systems related to solvency information
they are a necessary tool to know the risk in which the
borrowers in their operations and, he affirms, that the legislator implicitly recognizes
that function of information systems related to information on
solvency by having articulated in article 20 of the LOPDGDD a presumption iuris

precept. It also invokes the STJUE OF 12/18/2014 (case C-449/13) which recognizes the
possibility that the lender resorts to these sources to assess the creditworthiness of the
consumer.

Regarding the interest linked to the evaluation of the solvency that the
third parties who consult the information contained in the FIJ explains that, through the
file, obtain complete information on the circumstances that occur in the
potential borrower when joining the one that the credit institution obtains from the
information regulated in article 20 of the LOPDGDD. In his opinion, the recognition
of this legitimate interest of third parties is reflected in the Preamble of the Circular
1/2013, of May 24, of the Bank of Spain, on the Information Center of
Risks and in the obligations that, in order to make effective the principle of granting the
responsible credit, impose Law 16/2011, of June 24, on credit contracts to the
consumption and Law 5/2019, of March 15, regulating credit contracts
real estate.

It also asserts a legitimate interest related to the evaluation of the solvency of
borrowers and consumers, which justifies that a more correct assessment of the
risk in the granting of credit will allow better conditions in its granting
and will benefit all consumers, which leads him to conclude that therefore "the
Legitimate interest pursued by the treatment also has a dimension of interest
Social".

Regarding the legitimate interest linked to the prevention of fraud, he says that through
of data processing carried out through the FIJ provides the borrowing entities
information that allows them to verify if the information they have and that they associate with
certain data is consistent or inconsistent with that contained in bulletins and
official newspapers and adds that the AEPD revealed the existence of an interest
legitimate in the common fraud prevention systems that is reflected in the
Legal Cabinet reports 318/2013, 105/14, 106/14, 103/16 and 256/16.

2. Thus, the interest of the data controller will be legitimate if it is “lawful”, that is
that is, if the treatment necessary to satisfy it is respectful of the legislation
national and EU that is applicable. Therefore, from the point of view of the RGPD
It will be necessary to determine if the data processing that the claimed party carries out through
of the FIJ complies with the norms that regulate the fundamental right to the protection of
data and, in particular, the principles that govern the treatment.

As has been stated in the preceding argument, it is proven that the
treatment that EQUIFAX has been doing of the personal data of the claimants
It violates the principle of limitation of the purpose provided for in article 5.1.b) of the RGPD.
This breach has the consequence of causing the legitimate interest
invoked by EQUIFAX, on whose alleged prevalence it supports the foundation
legal of the data treatment that it carries out (article 6.1.f, RGPD), cannot comply with the
legality requirement.

Ultimately, the interest defended by the respondent is incompatible with compliance
of the law that regulates and guarantees the fundamental right to data protection
personal. That interest requires for your satisfaction a treatment of data that
It clearly violates the RGPD and, as stated in Opinion 6/2014, “[...] the
data controller […] may pursue any interest, provided that it does not
be illegitimate.”
The illegality of the interest pursued by EQUIFAX is reinforced by the fact that the
data processing carried out by the FIJ not only violates the principle of limitation
of the purpose (article 5.1.b RGPD), but, as will be explained later,
we consider that it violates other precepts of the RGPD: the principle of accuracy of the
data (article 5.1.d); article 14 of the RGPD in relation to article 5.1.a) and the
data minimization principle (article 5.1.c).

Based on that circumstance, it would not be necessary to carry out the test of
weighing or weighting between the interest invoked by EQUIFAX and the impact that
the treatment supposes on the fundamental right of the administered ones, for the
simple reason that the first of the conditions for applying the
legal basis of article 6.1.f) RGPD following the system offered by the
Opinion 6/2014 of the GT29.

However, we proceed to make such weighting between the interest defended by EQUIFAX
and the rights and interests of those affected.

First of all, article 6.1.f) requires that the treatment be “necessary”, in the
sense in which the concept of necessity is interpreted by the European Court of
Human Rights (ECHR). Notwithstanding that the treatment of the data of the
claimants is "useful", "desirable" or "reasonable", as specified by the ECHR in its
Judgment of 3/25/1983 the term “necessary” does not have the flexibility that is implicit
in those expressions. What EQUIFAX qualifies as a legal interest pursued through
of the processing of personal data incorporated into the FIJ – knowing the debts and
claims of natural persons to give "security to commercial traffic",
"prevent delinquency" and "assess the financial solvency" of these people- can be
obtain through other instruments that do not involve such a resounding attack on the
fundamental right protected by the RGPD. You will have to go to the media

At this point we refer to the report of the Legal Office of the AEPD 372/2016
that, on the occasion of the assessment of a treatment of personal data obtained from
public sources with the purpose of analyzing the solvency of their holders, indicated that
“Necessity should not be confused with convenience. The judgment of the solvency
could be considered, in accordance with the terms of the consultation,
convenient, but in no case necessary [...]. Credit or solvency risk
debtor's economic risk is a risk that is by no means exclusive to a security company.
insurance, but proper to any commercial or financial relationship.” (The underline is
our)

Focused on weighing the conflicting interests and rights, we have to go
to the criterion repeatedly followed by the Constitutional Court on the
constitutionality of a restrictive measure of a fundamental right (SSTC
66/1995, of May 8, FJ 5; 55/1996, of March 28, FFJJ 6, 7, 8 and 9; 207/1996, of
December 16, FJ 4 e), and 37/1998, of February 17, FJ 8)

To check if a restrictive measure of a fundamental right passes the judgment
of proportionality, it will be necessary to verify that it meets the three requirements or
following conditions: if that measure is likely to achieve the objective
proposed (judgment of suitability); if, in addition, it is necessary, in the sense that it does not
there is another more moderate measure to achieve such purpose with the same
effectiveness (judgment of necessity); and, finally, if it is weighted or balanced,
for deriving from it more benefits or advantages for the general interest than harm
over other assets or values in conflict (judgment of proportionality in the
strict).

In the present case, it cannot be admitted that the judgment of necessity is met, therefore
indicated and because there are other alternatives to obtain the information on the
economic solvency.

Nor is the judgment of suitability fulfilled, since, for the treatment that
carried out by the FIJ could really satisfy the interests it invokes - linked to the
information on financial solvency and fraud prevention-, it would be
essential that the information on the alleged debts attributed to the
claimants was up to date -the principle of accuracy that the FIJ fails to comply with- and,
also, have data on those affected that fully identify them. In the wake of

pertinent notification through the publication of announcements or edicts.

And, finally and fundamentally, there is no balance between the interests that
EQUIFAX pursues through the FIJ and the damages suffered by the holders of the
data. To the absolute inexistence of an expectation of the owner of the data to which
produce a treatment of them, collected from an official newspaper, by a

28001 – Madrid

private company that prepares and operates a file with solvency information
negative, is added the obvious negative impact that this treatment produces in the
data owner.

In the case we are examining, the fundamental right that empowers its owner to
disposing of the personal data that concerns them must prevail over what
EQUIFAX considers your legitimate interest.

The evident convenience that it may represent for a certain sector of the
commercial activity to see the risk inherent in its activity diminished is not proportional
to the clear violation of the fundamental right recognized in the C.E. (article 18.4) and
in the Charter of fundamental rights of the E.U. (article 8) that is perpetrated with the
data processing carried out by the FIJ. Following the same criteria, it would be necessary to
allow in the future “à la carte” interference when other sectors of the activity
commercial they also considered it very convenient for their interests. with full
clarity has ruled on this issue the STS of 06/20/2020 (R. cassation
1074/2019), whose sixth Legal Basis says, regarding one of the
questions of appeal raised in the Order admitting the appeal, which
“The commercial interests of a company responsible for a data file have
to yield to the legitimate interest of the owner of the data to protect them”.

Nor is it admissible to justify this interference in the fundamental right in the
function that the claimed one attributes: that of being a necessary tool for
know the risk that borrowers may incur in their operations that
affects the correct functioning of the economic activity related to the
credit solvency.

On the other hand, the different legal norms that refer to the consultation of
solvency information systems to comply with the principle of credit
responsible -cited in full detail by the defendant in her pleadings brief-
always make a very clear precision: that the information systems on
solvency and the measures adopted must fully comply with the regulations of
Personal data protection.

As a complement to the above, another element to assess in this weighting but
not related to the fundamental right guaranteed in article 18.4 C.E., is the
relative to the “interests” of those affected by this treatment; interests (without the adjective
“legitimate”) that article 6.1 f) of the RGPD also takes into consideration in the
conflict with the legitimate interest of the data controller or third parties
to whom the data is communicated. Thus, it should be appreciated -following the report of the
Legal Office 372/2016- an interest in favor of the claimants in knowing and giving their
consent to the processing of your personal data
influence their future relationships with credit institutions.

In short, the conclusion of the weighing trial could in no case be
favorable to the prevalence of the interest that EQUIFAX intends to satisfy through the
FIJ.

This conclusion is not altered in light of the arguments that EQUIFAX has
put forward in his pleadings brief to the initial agreement in favor of the prevalence

149/184

of the legitimate interest invoked. On the contrary, the arguments advanced
–“evidence” in the terminology used- come to confirm the illegality of the
data processing carried out by the FIJ, since the circumstances it alleges
should be rejected for obvious reasons that derive from what has been argued so far.
moment. However, we proceed to analyze the arguments or "evidence" alleged
in favor of the prevalence of the “legitimate interest of Equifax, its user companies and
society itself” on the rights and interests of the data subjects:

a. The recognition that the LOPD made, through article 29.1, of the prevalence
of the legitimate interest that she invokes. It adds that the currently applicable regulations do not
has changed substantially with respect to the previous one, but "the legal bases and
principles applicable to treatment remain unchanged as a result of the
entry into force of the GDPR”.
b. The fact that the LOPDGDD, article 20, establishes a presumption iuris tantum
of prevalence of the legitimate interest of credit information systems. It states
that, since “the legitimate interest that justifies the treatment [of the information systems
credit information of article 20 LOPDGDD] is identical to that pursued by the FIJ” and
that “the impact on the rights and interests of the interested parties as a consequence
of the treatment of your data in the FIJ is [is] substantially similar to the one that generates
the processing of your data in credit information systems”, article 20
LOPDGDD constitutes an evident indication of the prevalence of the legitimate interest that the
FIJ aims to satisfy.
c. The reference to the jurisprudence of the CJEU, which specifies in the aforementioned STJUE of
11/24/2011.
d. The attitude of the AEPD, which, in his opinion, has been "until now recognizing the
legality of these systems without having carried out a requirement, warning or
any warning addressed to my principal, as has been analyzed in the
third allegation of this writing.” To which was added the knowledge that the AEPD had
had that ASEDIE's draft Code of Conduct included an examination of the
prevalence of the legitimate interest of the entities that manage these information systems
information without having made any statement contrary to such matter.

Well, all the elements, considerations or evidence -in the words of the
claimed- favorable to the prevalence of the legitimate interest that EQUIFAX seeks
satisfy through the FIJ must be rejected.

With regard to the first factor that he adduces, it is worth making this clarification:
As much as article 29.1 LOPD supposedly established a presumption iuris
tantum of prevalence of the legitimate interest defended in favor of the
information on capital solvency and credit characterized only, so that
here it is of interest, because of the source or origin from which they obtained the information, as a result of the
STJUE cited so many times, which declares the direct effect of article 7.f) of the Directive
95/46, it could not be ignored that these information systems on
patrimonial solvency referred to in article 29.1 LOPD were obliged to
comply with the principles that governed the processing of data in the LOPD, the principle
of quality of the data and specifically that of limitation of the purpose or that of
accuracy (articles 4.2. and 4.3 LOPD), with the consequences that this entailed
regarding the legality of the treatment carried out by EQUIFAX through the FIJ. Deny
this objective reality with the argument that "the legal bases and principles
applicable to the treatment remain unchanged as a result of the entry

The principles that govern the treatment of
the data and the legal bases of the treatment, but article 29.1 LOPD was neither
one thing or the other.

The claim to extend the presumption iuris must also be rejected.
tantum that the LOPDGDD has established in favor of information systems
credit of article 20 with information systems such as the FIJ. This, for the reason
fundamental that, in the system designed by article 20 LOPDGDD, it is the
creditor, who obviously maintains a relationship with the debtor, who communicates the
personal data to the file, so the principle of limitation of the
purpose and, from that point of view, the treatment necessary to satisfy that
interest is respectful of the purpose limitation principle.

Second, because these files are surrounded by guarantees to comply with the principle of
accuracy. In them, it is the creditor, in general, who communicates the debt to the
file. Nothing to do with the information collected from an advertisement published in a
official diary.

On the other hand, the holders of asset solvency files, for the purpose of
respect the principle of accuracy, articulate rigorous mechanisms of their own accord and
effective for updating the data and thus avoid incurring an infringement of the
data protection regulations. Thus, in this type of file, the associates who
who report an unpaid debt must periodically confirm the
information reported to the file. So the reported incidents are not
remain in these systems sine die, but their permanence is subject to the
confirmation to the system. When reiterating the information by the creditor, the latter must have
verify that the non-payment situation continues -which you can perfectly do already
that it is he who knows first-hand whether the debt has been extinguished or not- and
At the same time, if the creditor does not reiterate the communication of the debt, the system of
credit information, automatically proceeds to cancel that annotation. If
this were not enough, the legislator of the LOPDGDD attributes to the informant creditor the
obligation to guarantee the accuracy of the debt, without prejudice to the fact that the RGPD,
Article 26, grants the informant creditor the condition of co-responsible together with the
entity that maintains the credit information system.

Third, for the remaining guarantees that are established in favor of the holders of the
data: guarantees of transparency and limitation of the time during which the
information will be available. The inclusion of a debtor's data in one of these
systems provided for in article 20 LOPDGDD has been preceded by the information
about the adverse consequences that would derive for him from not attending the payment of
Debt. In addition, the LOPDGDD in article 20 has doubly reinforced the
guarantees in favor of the debtor regarding the system provided for in article 29.2 LOPD and
38 and following of the RLOPD: the maximum time of inclusion has been reduced to 5 years
from the expiration of the obligation (article 20.1.d, LOPDGDD) and the entity
responsible for the information system is obliged to keep the
data of the affected during the thirty days following the notification of the debt to the
system (article 20.1.c, LOPDGDD)

The remaining two factors cited by the respondent to support the prevalence of
interest that it defends are equally unacceptable and regarding them, we refer to
the considerations made in other sections of this motion for a resolution.

3. The principle of proactive responsibility obliges the data controller to
be in a position to demonstrate that the treatment carried out is covered
on the legal basis it invokes.

With regard to the analysis that the respondent should have carried out before the
effective application of the RGPD to verify the existence of a legitimate interest
prevailing under article 6.1.f) which, as it has been stating, constitutes
the legal basis for the processing of the data carried out through the FIJ,
is worthy of mention, due to its obvious importance in the assessment of the element
culpabilistic of the infraction, the affirmation that it has made that with the application
of the RGPD did not consider it necessary to carry out an analysis that effectively
prevailed against the right of the owners of the data the legitimate interest that
defend. It has stated in its pleadings brief to that effect that the
“cited evidence coupled with the fact that, in their opinion, the requirements
established by the GT29 in its Opinion 6/2014” sufficiently accredited the interest
legitimate whose prevalence it defends.

Thus, it affirms that it considered it unnecessary to carry out an analysis of the legitimate interest
specific to the FIJ since “[...] the regulations themselves when weighting the
interests applicable to the treatment regulated in article 20 of the LOPDGDD and
was sufficient to replace the adoption of this measure.”

It should be added that the document on the analysis of the prevailing legal interest
prepared in December 2019 that has provided both in the test phase and as an annex
to his brief of allegations to the initiation agreement, (LIA Judicial File, Legal Analysis,
December 2019), to which we have made reference in the Legal Basis
precedent and will be done in the following Legal Basis, shows its
full knowledge that the treatment carried out violated principles of
treatment provided for in the RGPD and that, therefore, it was not possible to invoke the application of the
Article 6.1.f) RGPD as the legal basis of the treatment.

4. The respondent states in her allegations to the proposed resolution that
contained in the proposal is sufficient to refute what was stated in his allegations
to the start agreement; allegations that he considers reproduced and supplemented with what
which now states:

That EQUIFAX has an "obvious legal basis, the concurrence of an interest
prevailing legitimate, for the treatment of data in the FIJ.” Thus, he says that “[...]
These information systems were expressly equipped with a
presumption of prevalence of the aforementioned legitimate interest”. (emphasis ours)

Later he adds:
“Evidently, article 29.1 of the LOPD did not regulate the basic principles or the
legal bases of the treatment, but determined that, based on principles and
legal bases identical to those contained in the RGPD, the processing of data
collected in it was lawful. In other words, either article 29.1 of the LOPD is

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

152/184

overreached with respect to the regime contained in the Directive, enabling nothing less
that a treatment that violated its articles 6 and 7 in the terms assumed by the
Motion for a Resolution, something that neither the Court nor the Institutions of the Union
Union (and even less so the AEPD itself) did not even insinuate at any time or,
principles and legal bases remaining immutable, this treatment is as
according to the RGPD as it was to the Directive. This fact is indubitable, however
try to force the argument in another direction.” (emphasis ours)

It states, on the other hand, that in its previous allegations it proved that, in the
present case, the triple judgment concurred - suitability, necessity and proportionality strictu
sensu- required by constitutional jurisprudence so that the treatment carried out
by the FIJ will be in accordance with the RGPD; weighing that, he affirms, is favorable to the
legitimate interest that justifies it. With regard to the triple judgment mentioned, it is limited to
make various considerations in relation to what is argued in the proposal of
resolution. Considerations that, for the most part, do not conform to the truth or do not
they respect the context in which they were made. We reproduce some of them:

“[...] the Resolution Proposal: [considers] that the legitimate interest underlying the
processing of the data in the FIJ is nothing more than a mere "convenience" for
"perpetrate" what is called "intromissions a la carte" in the rights of
stakeholders (the expressions used are from the Motion for a Resolution, not from me)
represented)."
“[...] in the opinion of the AEPD, the [CIRBE is] the only information system that contributes to
the purpose pursued by the treatment carried out by the FIJ.”

“[..] converting the AEPD the principle of reasonable expectation (derived nothing less
of the fact that these systems exist in our law and have been expressly
regulated by it since 1992 and that the debtor should reasonably expect
that your creditworthiness will be assessed before obtaining credit) in the “reasonable hope”
delinquent debtor that his debt is not known and the financing is granted, even
when this harms the principles of responsible credit enshrined in the
legislator".

Of what is alleged by the respondent in that brief in defense of the alleged non-existence
of the infringement of article 6.1. GDPR two relevant conclusions are drawn:
The first, that, in the entity's opinion, the legal basis for data processing
made by the FIJ during the validity of the LOPD and after the
STJUE of 11/24/2011 was based on a presumption of prevalence of interest
legitimate established in article 29.1 LOPD. Precept that, otherwise, no
contained no guarantee or safeguard in favor of the owners of the data. This
despite the fact that this interpretation of article 29.1 LOPD defended by EQUIFAX entered
in contradiction with the principle of purpose limitation set forth in article 4.2.
LOPD.
The second consequence is that, to the extent that the claim constructs the
basis of the data processing carried out by the FIJ during the validity of the
LOPD in a rule of domestic law, namely, in article 29.1 of the LOPD -because
It is on this article that he bases the dispensation to respect the obligation imposed
by article 4.2. LOPD- cannot continue to maintain that there has not been a
substantial change between the legal regime established by the LOPD and the regime
legal introduced by the RGPD.

The direct consequence of his allegation regarding the non-existence of infringement of the
article 6.1 RGPD is that it invalidates its own argument that the AEPD,
with the opening of this sanctioning file, has violated the principle of
legitimate trust.
In light of the alleged violation of the principle of legitimate expectations attributed to
the AEPD has been maintaining that, according to the doctrine of the Contentious Chamber
Administrative Court of the National High Court, given that it is not admissible
introduce a change of criteria in a sanctioning procedure and that in the
present case the change of criteria could not be covered by the existence of a change
regulation between the Directive and the RGPD since the principles and legal bases
of the RGPD are essentially those established by the Directive, we should proceed to the
archive of the file and also the element of the
guilt, which would also lead to the file of the procedure for absence
sanctioning liability
These assertions of the respondent, which are examined in the Foundations
Legal precedents, start from a premise exposed by that entity with
reiteration: that there has been no regulatory change between the Directive and the RGPD that
could support the change of position of the AEPD since the principles and bases
The legal provisions of the GDPR are almost identical to those established by the Directive
In light of the exposition that the respondent makes to deny the infringement of the principle
of legality that is imputed to him as well as what was stated to deny the infraction of the
principle of purpose limitation, it is obvious that the basis of his argument is not
the rules of the Directive (that is, the principles and legal bases contained in it)
establish) but the reference to a rule of domestic law, article 29.1 LOPD,
which is neither currently in force nor derives from the transposition of the Directive
95/46/CE, nor does it exist in the RGPD.
In short, as already noted in the motion for a resolution, the respondent alleges
that it is not possible to justify the change of criteria of the AEPD - materialized in the
sanctioning file that concerns us - in an alleged regulatory change every time
that said regulatory change has not entailed a change in the legal bases of the
treatment and the principles that govern said treatment, setting the terms of
the comparison in the Directive and the GDPR. And at the same time, in parallel, the
claimed argues as a basis for the treatment that she had been carrying out during the
LOPD regime article 29.1 LOPD, a provision that, as indicated in the
proposal, nor does it contain a legal basis for the treatment or a guiding principle of the
treatment provided for in Directive 95/46/EC and which, furthermore, is not a consequence of the
transposition of Directive 95/46/EC into Spanish law.

5. Of the preceding statement and the documentation in the file
regarding the claimants, it is proven that EQUIFAX has been treating the
personal data of those affected included in the FIJ infringing the principle of legality,
because the treatment was not based on any of the legal bases that relate
article 6.1 GDPR.

The behaviors in which the data processing carried out by the
that claimed in violation of article 6.1 RGPD, in relation to article 5.1.a) of the
same rule, consisted of collecting the data published in newsletters and
official newspapers and, also on occasions, on edictal boards or the electronic headquarters of
Public Law entities; in the storage of that information and in the
possible transfer of these data to third parties, associates or clients of EQUIFAX.

The infringement of article 6.1 RGPD is typified in article 83.5.a) RGPD that
establishes:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; [...]”

On the other hand, for prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD qualifies in its article 72.1.
as a very serious infringement “b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence
any of the conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

Of the infringement of the principle of accuracy

7th

1. Article 5.1.d) of the RGPD, regarding the principle of accuracy, provides that the data
personal object of treatment will be “accurate and, if necessary, updated; I know
will take all reasonable steps to remove or rectify without
delay personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which
are treated («accuracy»)”

Recital 39 adds that all reasonable steps must be taken to
ensure that personal data that is inaccurate is rectified or deleted

The principle of accuracy implies that the data controller who has
personal information will not use such information without taking steps that
ensure, with reasonable certainty, that the data is accurate and
updated. In turn, the obligation to guarantee the accuracy of the data must
considered in the context of the purpose of the treatment. The GDPR imposes on the
responsible for the treatment the obligation to keep the data updated because
it says that the data will be exact “and, if necessary, updated”; need that
is connected to the purpose of the treatment.

EQUIFAX has stated that the purpose of the treatment carried out through the
FIJ is linked to the “assessment of the solvency of those affected”. therefore only
if the data included in the file reflects the current situation, they will be suitable for the
intended purpose of assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The sources from which the FIJ draws are the official newspapers and gazettes. The
information contained therein, and accessed by the FIJ, is pertinent to
that the Public Administration can fulfill the purpose it seeks to satisfy and that it has
justified that personal data of the administered be made public. Without
However, this information is not adequate for the purpose of a file such as the
FIJ. The disparity and incompatibility between the purpose of the original treatment and the
pursued by the FIJ determines that the information that this file collects is
fragmentary - it has only part of the information related to the debt and in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

155/184

occasions only part of the identification data of the alleged debtors- and
it is also disconnected from the evolution of the debt.

The debt is linked to a natural person in an act of notification that sees the light
public at a specific time. The avatars that from that moment can
affect the existence of the debt and its link to the alleged debtor are
innumerable. Among them, to mention a few, the payment by the debtor or the execution
compulsory payment of the debt by the Administration, of which EQUIFAX will not have
notice if the notification of the acts of the execution procedure is carried out
personally and it is not necessary to go to the notification through the publication of
edicts.

In this way, the information collected by the FIJ remains without updating,
unalterable in the file for a maximum period of six years computed from the
date of publication, unless the affected party exercises the right of suppression or
rectification. In the present matter, with respect to the claimants, there are notes
of non-payment published in 2013, although the vast majority of the announcements are
published between 2016 and 2019.

The answer that EQUIFAX has given to the question formulated in the test phase
about the mechanisms for updating the information included in the FIJ is a
implied acknowledgment that you have no means of verifying its accuracy. So that
the information that the FIJ collects is updated, and thus be able to guarantee the
principle of accuracy, it would need to have the collaboration of the holders of the
data or the creditor Administration, which obviously does not happen.

It is enough to remember how the entities that maintain information systems
provided for in article 20 of the LOPDGDD act to comply with the
principle of accuracy in order to be able to appreciate the absurdity of maintaining in a
file up to six years debts that one day were published in an official newspaper and
which nothing more is known since that date. The mechanics of
internal functioning of such systems that those responsible have designed with the
purpose of complying with the principle of data accuracy.

A proof that the FIJ cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information it
offers is that more than 25% of the claimants, before going to the AEPD, had already
contributed to EQUIFAX documents that showed that the FIJ was
publishing inaccurate information associated with your data. In the file were
linking extinguished debts to your personal data. We refer to the
documents of the claimants identified with the numbers 19,22,27,30,
37,38,40,41,42,50,52,53,54,59,61,62,72,73,75,77,80,83 and 87.
 
The violation of the principle of accuracy incurred by the FIJ has another
manifestation, which concerns the identity of the presumed debtors. The
publications from which the FIJ collects information do not always allow the identification
unquestionably to the alleged debt holder. As evidenced by
documentation that is in the file of the presumed owners of the debts that are
registered in the FIJ are frequently identified not by the NIF, but by name and
two surnames combined with an address. It should be noted in particular that the great

prior to 2018 and that, as of 12/07/2018 (date of entry into force of the
LOPDGDD) in accordance with the provisions of the seventh Additional Provision of the
LOPDGDD does not include the address data in the notifications through
announcements and publications of administrative acts carried out by any
Public administration.

The seriousness of this fact is evident when the EQUIFAX associate has access
to information that does not unequivocally identify the person to whom it refers
your query and then tries to identify it "by approximation"; that is, once
does the search in the FIJ for the data that identifies the person he wants
contract with him, if the FIJ does not have that person's NIF registered, it will provide the
EQUIFAX associate the information available from persons who have name and
matching surnames for the associate, based on verifying if any of the
address coincides with that of the person you want to hire, you can determine if this
meets the required solvency conditions. Situation giving rise to, when
the supposed debtor exercises access before EQUIFAX -every time the claimed one does not
has its NIF included in the FIJ- requires, for identification purposes, the addresses
that he has had over the years as a way to determine whether or not he is the
debtor. This absolute indeterminacy of the person of the debtor, in other words,
inaccuracy of the data, has not been an obstacle so that, previously, the associate
of EQUIFAX has verified that in the FIJ there is one or several persons with name and
surname coinciding with that of the person intending to contract with him and, when in doubt as to whether it is or
not him to whom the FIJ refers, I granted him the initial presumption of insolvency. Situation
which is clearly reflected in the case of claimants 18, 26, 27, 32, 36 and 94.
 
Thus, the file owned by the defendant fails to comply with the principle of accuracy
also with regard to the identification of the debt holders. The conclusion
that we can extract is that it can hardly serve the legitimate interest that
wants to attend linked to "the prevention of fraud".

On the other hand, in view of the particular circumstances that determine that the
Administration is forced to notify an administrator by posting
of advertisements (suppositions of article 44 LPACAP), a rigorous application of the principle
of accuracy should lead to not accepting, without further verification, as a datum
exact information regarding the address that until the entry into force of the
LOPDGDD appeared published in the official newspaper or gazette. This, despite the fact that
the reason for notification by posting ads is not at all
cases where the address is wrong or the interested party is unknown. If you analyze the
information provided by EQUIFAX in the testing phase regarding notifications
practiced, of the total of those that were unsuccessful, just over 90% were
because the address was incorrect or the addressee was unknown. (Done
tested tenth)

2. The position maintained by the respondent both in its response to the evidence and
in the allegations to the initial agreement is, obviously the opposite.

In the first place, regarding the infringement of the principle of accuracy, the claimed
has stated in its allegations that the RGPD has not introduced modifications or
in the enunciation of the principle nor in its consequences, in comparison with what
established the Directive, therefore, understands that through the initial agreement the AEPD

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

157/184

has adopted a "new criterion" that violates the principles of legal certainty and
legitimate trust. On this matter we limit ourselves to making a reference to what
exposed in the corresponding Legal Basis IV of this resolution.

The respondent affirms that the FIJ fully respects the principle of accuracy. that the
published data enjoy the presumption of accuracy recognized by article 4.2.d)
of the LOPDGDD, so it is not responsible for the inaccuracies that
they could suffer. It states that it has made available to those affected the
mechanisms to correct or delete inaccurate or incomplete data, respecting in
In any case, the requirements set forth in the LOPDGDD and the RGPD, such as providing the
documentation that proves the inaccuracy of a data whose deletion is requested. By
For this, he understands that there is no reversal of the burden of proof when the
claimants who request the deletion of their data from the FIJ who provide the
supporting documents of the payment of the debt but only the fulfillment of
the requirements set forth in current regulations (article 14 LOPDGDD)

Regarding the presumption of accuracy contemplated in article 4.2.d) LOPDGDD, it is necessary to
indicate that article 4 begins by referring in paragraph 1 to the principle of accuracy
of article 5.1.d) RGPD, which says, among other things, that the data must be
updated when necessary for the purposes of the treatment. There are situations in
which it is absolutely necessary to check and even update
periodically the accuracy of the data due to the damage that could be caused to the
interested if the data were inaccurate.

So the starting point is a situation in which the respondent collects a
information that you know you cannot update, and this, despite being the update of the
information a requirement for the FIJ to fulfill its purpose. EQUIFAX knows
perfectly this fact and freely chooses to collect that information, so
She must assume the responsibility derived from the inaccuracy of the data she processes.
On the other hand, regarding article 4.2.d) LOPDGDD, the presumption invoked -if
applicable to the case, an extreme that is not shared- could operate exclusively
regarding the information that comes from the Public Bankruptcy Registry. In no case
of official newspapers and bulletins that do not have the status of public record.

Regarding the mechanisms that the respondent affirms that it makes available to the
affected to rectify or delete their data, it is enough to point out that it does nothing but
comply with an obligation imposed by the GDPR. Chapter III "Rights of the interested party"
regulates these rights in articles 16 to 19 and article 14 LOPDGDD provides that,
when necessary, the affected party provides supporting documentation of the inaccuracy.

In response to the question that was asked in the test phase about what was the
protocol it had had for the last six years to ensure that the data
personal information that was incorporated into the FIJ were duly updated, in all
time, EQUIFAX responded that the protocol is based primarily on the
“Limitation of the sources from which the FIJ file is nourished”, the information that is
obtained from the Official Gazettes published by the State, the Communities
Autonomous and Provincial Councils. Which, in his opinion, guarantees that all
the information that is collected is considered "official and authentic" according to the
Article 3.1 of Royal Decree 181/2008, of February 8, on the organization of the official gazette
State official newsletter. He considers that this is "a guarantee that there are no

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

158/184

doubts about the updating and veracity of the information included in the FIJ.” Y
adds that "the bulletins are downloaded the same day they are published, so the
FIJ information is updated daily with the information contained in the
Newsletters.”

With regard to the respondent's response, it should be noted that, indeed, the
Information published in the Notification Supplement and in the BOE is guaranteed
of “authenticity”, that is, the guarantee that it actually comes from the authority
who signs the act or provision.

The respondent's comment that "the FIJ information is updated regularly
on a daily basis with the information contained in the Bulletins” is absolutely true
if by updating we mean “enrich”. Indeed, the FIJ is getting richer every day
with the new information it collects from the newsletters; but that has nothing to do with
the updating or updating of the annotations for debts that already appear in the
file linked to natural persons.

The respondent has also referred in its response to the questions formulated in the
test phase to the "Automatic information capture processes: the download of
the bulletins and the subsequent registration of the data in the FIJ” and says that it has
implemented specific recording criteria “in order to ensure that holders
are unequivocally identified so that their inclusion in the FIJ proceeds”, from which
concludes without further ado that “These criteria guarantee that there is only data from holders
duly identified”.

There is no doubt that the information regarding the personal data contained
in the bulletins and newspapers is transferred to the FIJ with accuracy. But, as abundantly
the defendant knows, that is not the issue to which the violation of the principle
of accuracy so, in this sense, his statement that
“These criteria guarantee that there is only data on holders duly
identified”

The respondent referred in its response to a new measure implemented that, in its
opinion, would guarantee the accuracy and updating of the data: “4) Notification of
inclusion: this part has been made to the holders whose data has been collected
from May 25, 2018, a specific notification of its inclusion in the FIJ,
as a measure to guarantee the updating of the data. Said communications
allow those interested, in a free and simple way, to check if
effectively the data that have been published by the different official gazettes and
that have been collected by my client contain some error.” question to which
we will refer in another Legal Basis of the resolution.

3. In its arguments to the proposed resolution, EQUIFAX places the starting point
of his argument in the necessary clarification of "what is the purpose of the FIJ", since
“article 5.1.d) of the RGPD links “accuracy” with “the purposes for which they are processed”
the data". It goes on to state that the “purpose of the FIJ” is to “reflect the existence of
a debt as stated in the advertisement and at the time of its publication in the source
corresponding official”. (emphasis ours)

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

159/184

From the foregoing, he infers that the circumstance that the FIJ cannot show which is the
debt situation at the time of the query does not allow the information to be qualified
of inaccurate in the terms provided in article 5.1.d) RGPD. It is not inaccurate, says
claimed - because it correctly collects the information that is necessary for the
purpose sought by the FIJ, "to help Equifax customers to assess solvency".
For this reason, he clarifies, the information would be inaccurate if, "contrary to what the
file”, will not correctly reflect the information contained in the published announcement.
He conjectures that the AEPD, with the aim of qualifying as inaccurate the data contained
in the FIJ, has proceeded in the proposed resolution, incorrectly, to associate the
“evaluation of the solvency of those affected” with information about the “situation
current” at the time of the consultation of the debt of the people.”
It goes on to refer to the suitability of the information contained in the FIJ to assess the
solvency of a person; suitability that, it affirms exhaustively, is out of all
doubt as has been confirmed for twenty-five years by the “enormous number of
entities that have been resorting to the FIJ to assess solvency” He warns that a
suitability judgment requires a thorough knowledge of the subject matter and that to the extent
knows the AEPD is not an entity that carries out analyzes on a day-to-day basis
of solvency.
It states that the FIJ "covers an undeniable need of the creditor market and the
fight against late payments and fraud” and then states: “[...] it is clear that
the FIJ information constitutes a complement to the files referring to the
debts contracted with in the private sector [...]. It is obvious that "in an ideal world"
it would be preferable if the FIJ could be updated as completely as it is
with the credit information systems of article 20 of the LOPDGDD.
Unfortunately, this is not possible since the Administrations do not publish
information in this regard, without such circumstance being considered in any
case as an assumption of "inaccuracy" of the information, for the reasons already stated."
(emphasis ours)
It also argues, as it did in the pleadings brief on the initial agreement,
that article 4.2 d) LOPDGDD establishes a presumption of accuracy that cannot
be distorted “by the result of the AEPD investigation, not even by the
contribution of evidence by the interested party” and “contains an imperative mandate of
exemption from liability to the person who has collected the data under their
contents".
It indicates that this provision - 4.2.d) LOPDGDD- has to be connected with the
regulatory regulations of the BOE that "establishes a presumption of veracity and
authenticity of the information contained therein, which guarantees the principle of
accuracy” and concludes that “the accuracy of the information referred to in the notifications
incorporated into the FIJ [...] derives directly from said publication [in the BOE] and the
LOPDGDD”.
Finally, it invokes two more arguments: That until the repeal of the LOPD
EQUIFAX “was [...] protected by the express legal authorization contained in the
article 29.1 LOPD and the action of the AEPD by which documentation was required
accrediting the payment so that it proceeded to its suppression”. And regarding the accuracy of
identification data of the alleged debtors, states that "it proved during the
trial period that only proceeds to the treatment of those data regarding
of which it has sufficient means to guarantee the accuracy of the information
treated.”
It also states that, as a result of the entry into force of the LOPDGDD, it has
adopted measures so that only the data of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

160/184

interested parties of whom there are sufficient elements to guarantee their full
identification, which has been reflected in a decrease in the number of inclusions in
the file.
In view of what is claimed by the respondent, it seems sterile to discuss the new
concept of accuracy of the data intended to report on the solvency of the
affected. Even more so when the entity itself recognizes that "it would be preferable that the FIJ
could be updated as completely as it happens with the systems of
credit information of article 20 of the LOPDGDD.”
4. Article 5.2, in connection with 5.1.d) RGPD, shows that it is up to the
responsible for the treatment the burden of proving the accuracy of the data that are the subject
of treatment; For what is of interest here, EQUIFAX bears the burden of proving the
accuracy of the debts included in the FIJ associated with accurate personal data of
the presumed debtors.

The obligation imposed by article 5.2. RGPD implies that the person responsible for the
treatment must have, during all the time in which the treatment is maintained,
data processing, of mechanisms that guarantee that the information processed
-debts linked to personal data- is found at all times
updated.

The respondent completely lacks the means to fulfill this obligation. And before this
lack, intends to be recognized as a skillful instrument for compliance
of the obligation incumbent on her, which is nothing more than a requirement demanded by law
the owner of the data that exercises the rights granted by the RGPD. Ultimately, the
claimed seeks to be valued as a means of compliance with the obligation to
accuracy imposed by article 5.2 RGDP in relation to article 5.1.d), the
documentation that claimants must provide in order to prove the
inaccuracy of the data that concerns them when they exercise before it the right of
rectification (article 14 RGPD).

On the other hand, the respondent is perfectly aware that she does not have
means to keep updated the information processed in the FIJ. Proof of it is
the text that we reproduce, coming from document 8 of those that you sent in the
of evidence, called “LIA Judicial File. Legal Analysis. December 2019”, in which
point 7, “Operation of Equifax files with information obtained from
sources of public access”, a section is dedicated to the guarantees that the
implement in the future relating to the principle of accuracy:

“1.4. Principle of accuracy” “In compliance with this principle and given that the
edict publication only recognizes the existence of the obligation to satisfy the
owed, but there is no additional information available that would allow us to know
effectively if that amount is due at the time of notice of
inclusion, a possible solution to this problem would be the limitation of deadlines very
brief references to the aforementioned communications, and in the analyzed system this
requirement is fulfilled, by reducing the term to the publications that have occurred in the last
five months. However, this reduction does not allow to fully avoid the
risk derived from the treatment of this data, being able to see the qualification of a
interested negatively by the fact of incorporating an edictal notification
referring to a debt already satisfied in the same way that could be affected
favorably the subject to whom a notification had been made with a

28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

161/184

seniority of more than five months and had not proceeded to pay the amount
owed.” (emphasis ours)

5. In accordance with the foregoing and the documentation in the file, it is
considers that the defendant has violated the principle of accuracy provided for in article
5.1.c) GDPR.
The infringement of article 5.1.c) RGPD that is attributed to EQUIFAX is typified in the
article 83.5. RGPD that states: “Infringements of the following provisions are
will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000
Eur maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount:
b) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

Article 72 of the LOPDGDD qualifies as very serious - being the limitation period,
in this case, three years - the infractions that suppose a substantial violation
of the articles mentioned in article 83.5 RGPD and in particular:
“a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Of the infringement of the principle of data minimization

viii

The RGPD establishes in its article 5.1.c) that personal data will be “adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
treated (<<data minimization>>)”

Therefore, only the data that is adequate, pertinent and not
excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are obtained or processed. This implies, for one
part, that the categories of data selected for processing must be
necessary to achieve the objective of the processing operations and that the controller
of the treatment must strictly limit the collection of data to that information
that is directly related to the specific purpose pursued by the treatment.

On the other hand, the RGPD requires that the data be relevant, which implies that the data
treaties are suitable and proportional to the legitimate aim pursued. Also, that the
personal data that is adequate and relevant, but constitutes an interference
disproportionate to the fundamental rights and freedoms at stake, they must
be considered excessive.

Compliance with this principle by the respondent, as is the case with other
principles already examined, such as legality or accuracy, is conditioned by the
infringement of the principle of limitation of the purpose in which the entity incurs with the
collection of data from newspapers and official bulletins that pursue a
purpose incompatible with that of the FIJ.

As a result of the illicit nature of the subsequent processing of the collected data - that is, the one that
claimed is carried out through the FIJ- it is becoming clear that the person responsible for the
treatment is in a situation of practical impossibility of respecting the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

162/184

rest of the principles that, according to the RGPD, govern the treatment. Such is the degree of
irregularity that some of the actions with which EQUIFAX intends to comply with the
obligations imposed by respect for the principles that govern the treatment are
become, in practice, an additional violation of the regulations for the protection of
data.

As a first point, it should be noted that, as has been shown when examining
other principles, particularly that of accuracy, the data that EQUIFAX obtains from
through bulletins and official journals that feed the FIJ are not suitable for the
purpose pursued by the file, for which they violate the principle of minimization of
data. The fundamental reason is that they do not allow an update of the information
regarding the solvency of the debtor. It is added to the above that, while the
publication of the data does not include the address of the owner of the data, the claimed does not
is in a position to be able to comply with the information obligation provided for in the
article 14 GDPR.

On the other hand, it is necessary to refer to Additional Provision 7 of the LOPDGDD which,
under the heading “Identification of the interested parties in the notifications by means of
announcements and publications of administrative acts.” establishes:
"1. When it is necessary to publish an administrative act containing
personal data of the affected party, it will be identified by its name and
surnames, adding four random numerical figures of the national document of
identity, foreign identity number, passport or equivalent document.
When the publication refers to a plurality of affected these random figures
they should alternate.
When it comes to notification through advertisements, particularly in the
assumptions referred to in article 44 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, will be identified
to the affected party exclusively by means of the complete number of his national document
identity card, foreign identity number, passport or equivalent document.
When the affected party lacks any of the documents mentioned in the
two preceding paragraphs, the affected party will be identified only by name and
surnames. In no case should the name and surnames be published together
with the complete number of the national identity document, identity number of
foreigner, passport or equivalent document.

In accordance with the provision transcribed, in the publications and notifications by
means of announcements provided for in articles 45 and 44 LPACP will never be published
address of the interested parties, nor jointly the name and surnames and the number
complete identity document. In addition, in the case of notifications of
announcements of article 44 LPACAP, the identification will be made by the complete number of the
identity document, disregarding the reference to the name and surnames except
that the holder lacks this data, in which case the name and surnames will be included. And in
publications of administrative acts that contain personal data will be included
the name and surnames and four random figures of the identity document.

This legal provision seeks to minimize the impact on the right
fundamental to the data protection of the administrators derived from the publication
of your data in newspapers or official bulletins.

163/184

EQUIFAX responded to the question asked in the testing phase regarding the criteria
used by the FIJ to organize the personal data that is processed
in order that their owners are duly identified, (Made
proved sixth) in the following terms:

a) In the event that only the NIF/NIE is published: then “it is verified if on the date of
publication, the NIF/NIE in question is registered in the active information
of the FIJ (thus excluding the one that is blocked). Depending on the result
obtained, different actions are carried out:
a´) If the identifier is already included in the FIJ associated with a name and surname,
registers in the FIJ the new published information.
a´´) If that identifier is not included in the FIJ, the record recording is discarded.

b) In the event that the name and surnames and incomplete NIF/CIF are published:
discards the recording of the data in the FIJ file
c) Cases in which the name + surnames + address is published: Proceed
to the recording of the record in the FIJ file, associating both data.
d) Cases in which only name + surname appears published: In this
Of course, the recording of the data in the FIJ file is discarded.
(emphasis ours)

Thus, despite the limitations that they represent for the processing of the data, the
criteria established in the Seventh Additional Provision of the LOPDGDD, the claimed
based on the information that is active in the FIJ on the date of publication of the
information; combines both information and proceeds to record in its file the
new information published as long as the identifier - the only data that according to
the Seventh Additional Provision of the LOPDGDD can be made public- either
included in the FIJ associated with a given name and surname.

We believe that this behavior invalidates the measures provided by the legislator to
protect the right of the owners of the data that are published for reasons of
public interest in bulletins and official newspapers.

In the case at hand, it is proven that there are numerous claimants
that, after 12/07/2018, date of entry into force of the LOPDGDD,
they have annotations in the FIJ. Which means that, although the publication of the
information did not contain their names and surnames but only the NIF,
EQUIFAX, acting as explained, verified that this identifier was
active in his file and, in addition, associated with a name and surname, and proceeded to give
high score. In this sense, it is accredited that they were included in the FIJ, with
after 12/07/2018, annotations related to the following claimants that
in the aforementioned file they are identified by their name, two surnames and NIF: the
numbers 2,6,7,9,13,14,15,21,32,43,48,49,58,59,71,74,79,82,83 and 89.

3. In her brief of allegations to the proposed resolution, the respondent states
that the exposition made by the motion for a resolution in relation to the infraction
of the data minimization principle imputed to it does not allow it to discern its
connection with the aforementioned principle. It adds that “nowhere in the Proposal is
indicates that the collection of data referring to the name, surnames, document
identity, address and characteristics of the debt contracted are not adjusted to

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

164/184

the aforementioned purpose nor is any judgment or assessment of proportionality carried out on the
regard." It concludes that the aforementioned infraction seems to have been included in the resolution
with “a mere intention to increase, [...] in a completely artificial way the
reproach directed against” EQUIFAX.

It indicates that the reasoning of the AEPD in the proposed resolution leads to the fact that,
when it is considered that a certain treatment breaches the principle of
limitation of the purpose (which the defendant denies) "there would also be a breach of the
principle of minimization, given that the processing of more data than
those legally required in the opinion of the Agency. This argument, by definition
would be inadmissible, [...]”

Lastly, it adds that, as a consequence of the entry into force of the LOPDGDD,
“has put into practice measures aimed at making the processing of the data
adjusted to the principles of accuracy and minimization and that only the
treatment in the event that compliance with such principles is guaranteed, for
which fails to understand the effect that the entry into force of said provision
can generate in the alleged violation of the principle of minimization.”

4. Based on the foregoing and the documentation in the file, we estimate
that the conduct of the respondent violates the principle of minimization of data foreseen
in article 5.1.c) RGPD.

The infringement of article 5.1.c) RGPD is typified in article 83.5.a) RGPD that
establishes:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; [...]”

On the other hand, for prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD qualifies in its article 72.1.
as a very serious infraction "a) The treatment of personal data violating the
principles and guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

In such cases, the person in charge will adopt adequate measures to protect the rights,
liberties and legitimate interests of the interested party, including making public the
information;
c) the obtaining or communication is expressly established by the Law of the
Union or of the Member States that applies to the data controller and that
establish adequate measures to protect the legitimate interests of the interested party, or
d) when the personal data must remain confidential on the basis of the
basis of an obligation of professional secrecy governed by Union law or
of the Member States, including an obligation of secrecy of nature
statutory.”

Recital 39 also refers to the right of data subjects to be informed
of the processing of your data, in the following terms:
“[...]For natural persons it must be totally clear that they are collecting,
using, consulting or otherwise treating personal data that
concern, as well as the extent to which said data is or will be processed. The beginning
of transparency requires that all information and communication regarding the treatment of
such data is easily accessible and easy to understand, and that a language is used
simple and clear. This principle refers in particular to the information of the
interested parties about the identity of the person in charge of the treatment and the purposes of the same and
to the information added to guarantee a fair and transparent treatment with
regarding the natural persons affected and their right to obtain confirmation and
communication of personal data concerning them that are subject to
treatment. [...]”

From the date of effective application of the RGPD (05/25/2018) the claimed party was
obliged to inform, in the terms of article 14 RGPD, all interested parties
whose personal data were being processed through the FIJ in
that moment. This is because the new transparency regime introduced
by the RGPD affected all the treatments that were maintained on that date, with
regardless of the regime in force when the data was collected, and
establish a norm or the criterion of the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the
National audience.

Obligation, on the other hand, was well known to all those responsible for
treatments that during the two years prior to the effective application of the RGPD
were preparing the adaptation to the new legislation of the treatment of
personal data they made.

It seems obvious that EQUIFAX did not comply with the obligation imposed by article 14
RGPD to notify the holders of the data that on that date were recorded in the FIJ.

For this, it is enough to compare the figures provided: in 2018 the people whose data
were subject to treatment by the FIJ exceeded four million and, nevertheless, the
number of notifications made that year does not reach three hundred and forty thousand. In
In this sense, an infringement of article 14 RGPD is already appreciated in relation to the
article 5.1.a) GDPR.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that EQUIFAX is obliged to inform the
interested in the terms of article 14 RGPD each time you incorporate your FIJ
personal information.

In line with this obligation, we must reiterate what was already stated about the
violation of other provisions of the GDPR. In the behavior analyzed we start from
illicit processing of personal data, since data is collected that was
initially processed for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which
pursues further treatment, that is, the FIJ, which conditions, how could it be
otherwise, compliance with the obligations that the RGPD imposes on the
responsible for the treatment to the point that these are impossible
compliance if not in violation of other provisions of the GDPR.

As EQUIFAX has repeatedly recognized, the information that the FIJ collects
It basically comes from official newspapers and bulletins. It has already been indicated that, as a result
of the entry into force of the LOPDGDD and the application of Additional Provision 7,
The data of the domicile of the administrators whose personal data are
object of publication in accordance with articles 44 and 45 LPACAP.

It turns out, therefore, that having EQUIFAX the obligation to inform the interested parties
whose data is included in the file completely lacks the possibility of complying
with respect to new registrations such an obligation, to the extent that the advertisements
published will not provide you with the information of the address that allows you to inform you in the
terms indicated in article 14 RGPD. Circumstance that is obviously not
Obstacle for the infringement of article 14 RGPD to be appreciated, particularly with respect to
to the annotations that on the date of entry into force of the RGPD already appeared in the
FIJ, but to highlight, once again, the absolute irregularity of the FIJ.

2. EQUIFAX has stated in its allegations to the initial agreement that "it comes
making the holders whose data have been collected since May 25,
2018, a specific notification of its inclusion in the FIJ, as a measure to
ensure data updating. Such communications allow
interested parties, in a free and simple way, check if the data is actually
that have been published by the different official bulletins and that have been collected
by my represented contain some error.”

As has been pointed out, the notification that it announces will not be possible, at least with
the only information offered by the newspapers and bulletins in which the data is published.

With regard to this new measure that the defendant announces to us, we must clarify
that we are not facing a proactive action by the entity, as it has
declared, but before an obligation imposed by the RGPD. On the other hand, it is reiterated
already indicated about the impossibility of practicing that informative notification to the
interested in lacking the information of the address and that the attempt to link the number

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

168/184

identifier of an interested party that is published in an official gazette with the information
It is recorded in the FIJ, so the data of the address is of interest here, it constitutes its
time an infringement of the data minimization principle.

Lastly, the entity's repeated comment about the
non-existence of an obligation to inform the owner of the data being processed
as established in article 5 of the LOPD. The respondent has stated that there was
an express endorsement of the National High Court that it was not required the
compliance with such obligation because their actions are included in the regime of the
article 29.1 LOPD and has cited to this end the SSAN of 06/29/2001 (Rec.1012/1999);
11/29/2001 (Rec.531/2000) and 02/27/2008 (Rec. 358/2006) However, the aforementioned
judgments seem to show that the regime to which he refers is connected with the
prevailing criterion at that time that a treatment of data that had been
obtained from public sources defined by article 3.j LOPD was lawful
in accordance with article 6.2 LOPD. Therefore, we understand that after the publication of the
judgments so often cited of the CJEU and the T.S. there was no reason for EQUIFAX
does not comply with the obligation established in article 5 LOPD.

3. In its allegations to the proposed resolution, regarding this infraction, the
claimed analyzes three different scenarios.
(i) The regime prior to the entry into force of the LOPDGDD, in which, it affirms,
exempted from the obligation to inform the interested parties of the processing of their data
carried out in the FIJ as confirmed by a "repeated
jurisprudence” that determined that from the SAN of 02/27/2008 the AEPD does not
dictate any sanctioning resolution for non-compliance with the obligation to
notify.
(ii) The existing regime during the term of the LOPD, from the date on which it is
dictates the judgment of the CJEU of 24/11/2011. Considers that the situation was identical to the
above and that it was the proposed resolution that "creates ex novo" a line
argument that understands that the previous criterion was modified from the aforementioned
STJUE. In the opinion of the respondent, the proposal eliminates “the possibility of founding the
of the FIJ in the provision of article 29.1 LOPD”. Therefore, it requires that the
exclusion from the duty to inform did not derive from the nature of the sources from which
obtained the information, but from article 29.1, in relation to 29.4 and in relation to
article 5.5. LOPD.
(iii) The system after the effective application of the RGPD, in which EQUIFAX has
considered “necessary to comply with the duty to inform”. After which, add
that, “despite the fact that he could have considered that the causes that exonerated him from said
obligation under the LOPD that, do not forget, remained in force until the 7th of
December 2018, they continued to protect him.” This commitment assumed as a result of the
effective application of the RGPD has materialized in the "notification to all
interested in the inclusion of their data in the FIJ", which constitutes a "commitment
of the entity with the guarantee of the right to data protection”.
The respondent affirms that the proposal considers that "this duty of information is not
has complied with respect to the data included in the FIJ prior to entry into
force of the LOPDGDD, that is, when there was a rule that excluded the duty to
information." It also states that after the entry into force of the LOPDGDD,
could distinguish “two types of data”: (i) Those entered prior to the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

169/184

entry into force of the RGPD, regarding which it says that “[...] the principle of
minimization and the cited interpretation of article 11 excluded the possibility of obtaining
additional information with the sole protection of complying with the duty to inform”. A
purpose of article 11 RGPD indicates that it can be interpreted by analogy, in what
affects the processing of additional data to those required for compliance with the
purpose of the treatment, the provisions of that precept, according to which “[i]f the purposes for
which a controller processes personal data do not require or no longer require the
identification of an interested party by the person in charge, the latter will not be obliged to maintain,
obtain or process additional information with a view to identifying the interested party with the sole
purpose of complying with this Regulation. Therefore, he considers that it would be possible to conclude
that, if the purposes of the treatment do not justify the treatment of additional data,
could hide behind GDPR compliance to collect such data.
(ii) Those incorporated into the FIJ after said entry into force, with respect to the
that Equifax chose, compared to the other entities in the sector, to comply with the
Article 14, proceeding to notify all interested parties of the incorporation of their
data to the FIJ.

The entity concludes that it has fully complied with the duty of information regarding
all those treatments carried out since the entry into force of the RGPD, therefore,
"Under the previous regulations (LOPD) it was exempt from compliance with that obligation."
and after “the entry into force of the RGPD, it was applicable to these treatments what
provided in article 14.5 a) of the RGPD, as the information is impossible or requires
disproportionate efforts, something that the Proposal itself explicitly recognizes.”
 
The respondent affirms that the proposal considers that "this duty of information is not
has complied with respect to the data included in the FIJ prior to entry into
force of the LOPDGDD, that is, when there was a rule that excluded the duty to
information." However, what the proposal says is that once it entered into force
the RGPD, the obligation imposed by article 14 RGPD should be fulfilled in
relation to the data previously included in the FIJ, whose treatment is
kept. Forget the claim that the RGPD, once it is effectively applied,
is applicable in its entirety and that, therefore, EQUIFAX had the obligation from
that date of informing the owners of the data in the terms of article 14 RGPD
whose treatment continued to be carried out through the FIJ, even though the data was
included in the file under the validity of other regulations. It must be remembered,
furthermore, that the conduct referred to as constituting an infraction of the
The principle of data minimization is what the entity claims to carry out, as a result of the
entry into force of the LOPDGDD, since according to the additional provision
seventh, the announcements of notifications do not include the information of the address: a crossing of
data between the information that already works in the FIJ, in which, as inferred from what
manifested, the address information does appear, with which it is published in the advertisements
inserted in bulletins and official journals.

Therefore, contrary to what EQUIFAX alleges, it was not exempt from the obligation to
notify the holders of the data that were still in the FIJ on the date of application
of the GDPR. Nor can he be excused from fulfilling that obligation on the basis of
apply article 11 RGPD or with the pretext of avoiding breaching the principle of
minimization of data, since with respect to the data already included in the FIJ, it is not practiced
no data crossing. And the breach is patent. It suffices to compare the
number of people included in the FIJ on the date of application of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

170/184

RGPD and the number of notifications that in that year and in successive ones
EQUIFAX.

4. Article 14 RGPD imposes on the claimed party an obligation to inform the
interested parties when the processed data had not been collected from them, which is
consequence of the principle of transparency that governs data processing
according to article 5.1.a) RGPD.

 It is a proven fact that EQUIFAX did not notify the interested parties whose data
had been dealing through the FIJ as a result of the effective application of the RGPD, the
05/25/2018, this, despite the fact that the interested parties were never informed of the treatment
to which your personal data was submitted under an interpretation of the LOPD
that the National High Court had done before the judgments of the CJEU of
11/24/2011 and the T.S. of 02/25/2012.

As far as the complainants are concerned, it is found, as already indicated, that
there are numerous inclusions subsequent to the date of entry into force of the
LOPDGDD. In all cases, it is about interested parties of which there were inclusions
previous in the FIJ. However, not all of them appear in the FIJ, among the data that
concern them, the data of the address.

4. Based on the foregoing and the documentation in the file, we estimate
that the conduct of the respondent violates the obligation imposed by article 14
RGPD, in relation to article 5.1.a) RGPD.

The infringement of article 14 RGPD is typified in article 83.5 RGPD that
establishes:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) [...]
b) the rights of the interested parties pursuant to articles 12 to 22;”

For prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD qualifies in its article 72.1. as a violation
very serious “h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this organic law”.

The respondent revealed in her pleadings brief the non-existence
connection between the claims made by the claimants and the object of the
sanctioning procedure directed against it. In this sense, it emphasizes that the
claims made relate exclusively to the exercise of rights
that the RGPD recognizes in articles 16 to 22 and that furthermore that
The entity attended, in most of the cases, the request made by the
affected. For this reason, he considers that this extreme, the non-existent link between the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

171/184

claims made and the expressed object of the procedure, would force the file
of the procedure.

Apart from the fact that in some of the claims the claimants refer
expressly that the inclusion of their data in the FIJ (case of claimants 35,
39, 46 or 55) this allegation must be dismissed, since the facts revealed
manifest in the claims are closely linked to the object of the
process. In addition, from the examination of said claims, it turns out that the action
of the responsible entity transcends the claims presented.

The RGPD has established its own and specific regime regarding the
Procedures before the control authorities in matters of data protection. The
Chapter VIII of the RGPD is entitled "Remedies, responsibility and sanctions", and the
The first of the articles of said Chapter VIII, article 77, establishes the right to
file a claim with a supervisory authority. Art. 77.1: “Notwithstanding
any other administrative resource or judicial action, all interested parties shall have the right
to present a claim before a supervisory authority, in particular in the State
member in which he has his habitual residence, place of work or place of
alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of personal data that
concern violates these Regulations.” In turn the art. 79 RGPD establishes that
“[w]ithout prejudice to the available administrative or extrajudicial remedies, including the
right to file a claim with a supervisory authority under the
Article 77, every interested party shall have the right to effective judicial protection when
consider that your rights under this Regulation have been violated
as a consequence of processing your personal data.”

We see therefore that a "claim" of an individual can give rise to two types
of procedures, one of them related to infractions of the RGPD, with a
general, and another for violation of their rights.

In the LOPDGDD this distinction has been embodied in Title VIII, which regulates
jointly the procedures in case of possible violation of the regulations of
Data Protection. Thus, your art. 63.1, Legal Regime, includes (a) the procedures
in case of infringement of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD itself and (b) those derived from a
possible violation of the rights of the interested parties. The LOPDGDD does not foresee any
additional type of procedure in case of possible violation of the regulations of
data protection, so that all the functions and powers that the RGPD
granted to the control authorities in arts. 57 and 58 RGPD must be exercised at
through these procedures in case of possible violation of the regulations of
Data Protection. There are no others.

It follows, also taking into account art. 64 LOPDGDD, which
when the procedure is directed exclusively to the lack of attention to a request
of the rights articles 15 to 22 RGPD a claim will be necessary, but that
(art. 64.2 LOPDGDD) [w]hen the purpose of the procedure is to determine the
the possible existence of a violation of the provisions of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and in the present organic law, it will be initiated by means of an initial agreement
adopted on its own initiative or as a result of a claim. That is, both the
RGPD as the LOPDGDD consider that a claim from an affected party can be
the way or means of bringing to the knowledge of the control authority a possible

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

172/184

violation of data protection regulations, but in no case restricts the
action of the control authority to the specific and concrete complaint of those affected.
And this for many reasons, among which stands out, as may be the case in the
this proceeding, that from the confluence of several claims of people
individuals affected reveals an action by the person in charge who, with
general character (that is, not only in the specific cases presented by the
claimants) which shows that these specific cases are the reflection of a pattern
or common policy applied to all those affected persons who are in the same
case those interested.

To do otherwise would be inconsistent with the purpose and will of the Community legislator,
expressly embodied in the RGPD that the control authorities control and
enforce the RGPD, and with the provisions of the RGPD that they can dispute
I manifest "infractions" of the data protection regulations through
“claims” that may transcend the individual claims themselves
formulated.

Consequently, the AEPD has decided to analyze the repercussion of the treatments that
are carried out, with the result that the deficiencies noted with respect to the
data protection have a general scope, so that all are affected
the holders of the personal data registered in it, and not only the
claimants, which would result, as has been stated, that the infringement is not
produced exclusively with respect to these, but in general.

It cannot be said, therefore, that there is no link between the object of the
procedure and claims.

In any case, no rule prevents the body that exercises the power
sanctioning, when it determines the opening of a sanctioning procedure,
always ex officio (art. 63.1 law 39/2015, of October 1), determine its scope
according to the circumstances revealed, even if they do not fit
strictly to the statements and claims of the complainant. That is, the
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure is not constrained by the complaint
(the “claim”) filed by the individual. This is not the case in the case of
procedures processed at the request of the interested party, in which article 88.2 of the
LPACAP requires that the resolution be consistent with requests made by
East. Even in this case, the authority of the Administration to initiate
ex officio a new procedure.

This same article 88 of the LPACAP, referring to the content of the resolution, in its
Paragraph 1 establishes the obligation to decide all the issues raised by the
interested parties and those others that derive from the procedure, including questions
related not raised by the interested parties. This article expressly establishes
Next:

"1. The resolution that puts an end to the procedure will decide all the issues
raised by the interested parties and those others derived from it.
In the case of related issues that have not been raised by the
interested parties, the competent body may rule on them, putting it

In the sanctioning procedure, even the facts that are
reveal during their instruction, which will be determined in the
resolution proposal, and may motivate the modification of the imputations
contained in the agreement to initiate the procedure or its legal qualification.

In this sense, when referring to the specialties of the resolution in the

Article 29.5 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public (LRSP) provides:
“When the commission of an offense necessarily derives from the commission of another or
others, only the sanction corresponding to the most serious infraction should be imposed.
serious offense”.

In the opinion of this Agency, as stated in the preceding Grounds, the
conduct of EQUIFAX in relation to the treatment of data that it carries out through the
FIJ, constitutes an infringement of articles 5.1.b) RGPD; 6.1, in relation to the
article 5.1.a GDPR; 5.1.d) GDPR; 5.1.c) RGPD and 14 of the RGPD.

The assumption analyzed offers unusual profiles. Starting from an initial violation of the
RGPD, the violation of the principle of limitation of the purpose provided for in article
5.1.b) RGPD, the behaviors in which the remaining infractions of the
Regulations for which the entity is held responsible are presented as a
necessary consequence of the first, without a doubt the most serious infraction.

Although the five violations attributed to EQUIFAX are very serious violations with
according to the LOPDGDD and all of them are typified in article 83.5. of the GDPR, the
The most serious offense committed is the violation of the principle of limitation of
purpose to the extent that it has led, in this specific case, in light of the
particular characteristics of the facts analyzed, to which the claimed
incurs the remaining four GDPR violations for which it is held responsible.

Taking into account the connection between the five violations of the
GDPR committed by EQUIFAX in relation to the FIJ and the extraordinary uniqueness
of the case, in which the most serious infraction, the violation of the principle of limitation of
the purpose set forth in article 5.1.b), entails the commission of the remaining four
offences, this Agency considers that in the specific case at hand,
attending to the particularities that it has, there is a medial contest between the
violation of article 5.1.b) RGPD, on the one hand, and violations of articles
6.1, in relation to 5.1.a; 5.1.d), 5.1.c) and 14 of the GDPR.

Of the sanctions and corrective measures imposed on the claimed

XII

1. The powers that the RGPD attributes to the control authorities are detailed in the
article 58 whose paragraph 2 refers, in particular, to the so-called powers
“correctives”. The precept establishes:
“Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers
listed below:
 (...)
f) impose a temporary or definitive limitation of the treatment, including its prohibition;
g) order the rectification or deletion of personal data or the limitation of the
treatment in accordance with articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of such measures to
the recipients to whom personal data have been communicated in accordance with the
article 17, paragraph 2, and article 19;
(...)
i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each case
particular;
(...)”

2. The respondent expressed in her allegations to the initial agreement her total disagreement
with the corrective measures and the fines that were included in the agreement to open the
record indicating that the imposition of a sanction in the amount established in the aforementioned
agreement would imply that the company left the market “for the benefit of other
competing companies that handle the same information”. draws attention to
the fact that the AEPD has decided to “adopt the most serious measures
provided for in the data protection regulations” when the RGPD offers the
control authorities a wide range of corrective measures (article 58) and that the
article 83 RGPD expressly provides, in the event of a regulatory breach, the
possibility of not imposing an administrative fine and sanctioning with some other
corrective measures of article 58 RGPD.

In his arguments to the motion for a resolution, he once again stresses the character
disproportionate amount of the proposed administrative fines and requests that they be appraised
the following extenuating circumstances that reflect a qualified reduction of his culpability in
the treatment of your data in the FIJ:
Which has been implementing, since the approval of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD, different
measures aimed at further minimizing the impact that data processing
carried out by the FIJ could produce in the private sphere of the interested parties. That
has never received any sanction from this AEPD in relation to the treatment carried out
carried out by the IJF. That Equifax has repeatedly addressed any request or
request for information related to the FIJ and lack of negligence or fault,
as indicated in section 3 of this allegation (article 83.2 b) of the
GDPR).

Circumstances to Reject.

3. In the present case, it is considered convenient, taking into account the circumstances that
concur, impose the corrective measures described in the sections

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

175/184

f) and g) of article 58.2 RGPD. This, without prejudice to the administrative fines provided
in letter i) of the precept, in accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 RGPD.

As stated in Recital 129 of the RGPD, "In particular, any measure must be
adequate, necessary and proportionate with a view to guaranteeing compliance with the
this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each specific case...”

Regarding the reasons that justify the adoption of these measures, we must point out that,
As has been proven in the resolution, EQUIFAX incorporates into the FIJ file,
through which it pursues, primarily, a purpose linked to the evaluation of the
solvency of natural persons, information with personal data of
admins you get from notification ads and event posts
administrative documents that are published in official gazettes and journals for
fulfill a purpose related to the public interest. The purpose pursued by the FIJ is
different and incompatible with the one that justifies the treatment carried out by the
Public Administrations, so that any further processing of the data with
the purpose pursued by the FIJ violates the RGPD. The data processing that the FIJ
carried out violates the principle of limitation of the purpose (article 5.1.b, RGPD). Starting
from here, it incurs an infringement of the principle of legality (article 6.1 in relation to the
5.1.a). It is added to the foregoing that, since the information contained in the
FIJ to report on the solvency, the claimed one does not have mechanisms to
update and keep up to date that information or to unequivocally identify the
alleged debtors. To carry out this treatment, the FIJ violates other principles
of the RGPD that it is obliged to respect, such as the accuracy and minimization of
data (articles 5.1.d, and 5.1.c) and, the data controller is not in a position
(for not having the information regarding the address of all the holders whose
data are processed) to fulfill obligations that constitute a right
of those affected to guarantee the transparency of the treatment (article 14
GDPR).

These GDPR violations respond to the modus operandi of the FIJ and are not
Specific violations of current regulations related exclusively to the
claimants in this file.

The mechanics of the file's operation is incompatible with respect for the RGPD.
These are the reasons that advise adopting the only measures that can
guarantee compliance with the regulations governing the fundamental right that
This Agency must protect and restore all natural persons who are suffering from the
illicit processing of your personal data through the FIJ in the full disposal of the
fundamental right that the Constitution recognizes in article 18.4.

Therefore, in accordance with article 58.2 RGPD, it is agreed to adopt the following
corrective measures:

(Yo)

(iii)

Pursuant to section f) definitively prohibit EQUIFAX from
continue with the processing of personal data carried out through
of the FIJ, given that the treatment is incompatible with the
GDPR compliance.
Pursuant to its section g) order the person in charge of the FIJ to proceed to
the deletion of all personal data that are subject to treatment

28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

176/184

in the aforementioned file linked to alleged debts, in accordance with the
provided for in article 17.1.d) of the RGPD.
  

The corrective measure consisting of definitively prohibiting EQUIFAX from continuing
carrying out the data processing that it performs through the FIJ is provided
to the situation of non-compliance with current regulations and also necessary. Also
It is necessary to delete all the personal data of those affected because
being the treatment carried out illegal, only in this way can it be returned to the people
affected by such treatment in the enjoyment of their fundamental right.

4. Administrative fines.

In order to determine the amount of the administrative fines that it is appropriate to impose
for each of the GDPR violations for which EQUIFAX is held responsible,
it must be in accordance with the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD that establish,
respectively:
“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each

Determination of the modifying circumstances of the responsibility:

4.1. Infringement of article 5.1.b) RGPD:
The concurrence as aggravating factors of the following factors that
reveal a greater unlawfulness and/or culpability in the conduct of the defendant.

1.-The circumstance described in article 83.2.a) RGPD, which assesses the seriousness of the
infringement taking into account the "scope or purpose" of the treatment operation.
We are not dealing with an isolated offending conduct or the result of a specific irregularity.
It is a perfectly articulated modus operandi outside the law that
taking advantage of official publications that contain personal data seeks
obtain an economic benefit by providing a service to third parties related to the
information on the solvency of those affected. The scope of this operation
treatment transcends the affected claimants and extends to all persons
whose data had been included in official publications in the past or that may
be included in the future. We are dealing with a business structured on the
Failure to comply with the regulations that guarantee the fundamental right recognized in the
article 18.4 of the C.E. On the other hand, the data of those affected are called to
communicate to third parties, despite the fact that their treatment clearly violates the RGPD. The
The extent of harm that may result from this treatment is unpredictable.

or negligence of the infringement”. The defendant has not ignored that her conduct involves
a violation of the GDPR. We are facing a very serious lack of diligence

million affected.

asset solvency file has obvious adverse consequences for the
affected.
5.- The circumstance described in article 76.2.b) LOPDGDD in relation to the
