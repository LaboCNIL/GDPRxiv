dated April 26, 2021, made, in summary, the following allegations:

“Servdebt, on its website, and without prejudice to the information transmitted in the

the data can exercise their rights (***URL.2). It is verified that there is an overdraft
in the bank account (which is duly justified by the certificate

In its management actions, Servdebt, through the action of its collaborators,
established various contacts with debtors.

On July 23, 2019, we received a call from B.B.B., who indicated that the debt did not exist since
the Bank of Spain would issue a decision in this regard, it was requested that we
Submit all documentation in this regard. The truth is that he did not send us the
aforementioned documentation.

After months it was possible to contact the other debtor, C.C.C., who indicated
exactly the same relative to the decision of the Bank of Spain. It was not
Documentation sent.

On December 13, 2019, A.A.A. (the claimant) who indicated that he was the
responsible for dealing with the matter of his father and his brother. Since A.A.A. it is
a third party was asked to send us the respective authorization. But the referred
authorization was not sent.

On December 17, finally, the decision of the Bank of Spain was sent, by
e-mail. The aforementioned email was sent from the email address
***EMAIL.2 (according to Document No. 5 attached).

As can be verified, the email was signed by C.C.C. In addition, the content
of the email agrees with the telephone conversations previously held
with B.B.B. and with C.C.C., since A.A.A. no information was transmitted.

On December 26, the referred email was answered informing C.C.C. that
decision sent did not exonerate from the debt, which is why the contacts were

sequence, three emails were forwarded to this email address (on the 8th of
January 2020, March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020) according to Document
#6 attached.

To the emails of March 5 and April 7, 2020 they responded (in the same
address ***EMAIL.2) the company “***EMPRESA.1” and not A.A.A., the claimant –

Therefore, the person who sent us the email from the electronic address ***EMAIL.2 was
C.C.C. and the person who signed the responses was “***EMPRESA.1”. reason why it is
false what is alleged by the claimant that Servdebt "for 9 months they send him
emails claiming a debt that is not yours.
The first email was sent on December 26 in response to the email from
C.C.C. on December 17 and then three emails were sent, the last being
on April 7, that is, three and a half months later.

On the other hand, in the emails sent it was never mentioned that the debt was his, or
whatever, Servdebt never demanded payment, nor C.C.C. nor to the company “***EMPRESA.1”.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

Law 39/2015, of Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
(LPACAP) establishes in its article 89.1 that "the termination of the
procedure, with filing of the actions, without the need to formulate
of the proposed resolution, when in the instruction of the procedure it is stated
I declare that any of the following circumstances exist:

a) The non-existence of the facts that could constitute the infraction”.

III

The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of Article 6
of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the assumptions in which
that the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

7/8

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

IV

In the case at hand, after a detailed study of the documents
operating in this proceeding, and the claims of the respondent, we must
state that it is verified that the debt is in the name of the brother and the father of the
claimant, now deceased, that the claimant requested information about the debt and that
was submitted from the email address ***EMAIL.2 the Bank's decision
of Spain, on the debt.

It is clear that they have the same address, both postal and electronic.

Therefore, the file of this sanctioning procedure proceeds.
