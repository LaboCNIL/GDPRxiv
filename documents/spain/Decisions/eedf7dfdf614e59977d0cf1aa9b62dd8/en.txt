A.- In reference to the calls received:

Calls from phone numbers ***PHONE.5 and
***TELEPHONE.3 were made by its collaborating agent VOICEBOT for
conducting quality surveys and improving customer experience
customers. In this case, it would not be a communication for

carried out for the purpose of quality control in the provision of services.

Calls from numbers ***PHONE.4 and ***PHONE.5 were
made from VODAFONE due to the portability of the lines

claimant.

Said communications, based on promoting customer retention
who have informed their willingness to cancel the products and/or services
contracted, for which the client is sometimes offered an improvement in the
contractual conditions or products or services that may result from your
interest. In parallel, the initial communication allowed Vodafone to verify
that the portability request had actually been made by the party
claimant, ruling out any type of fraudulent or malicious actions
by third parties.

On the other hand, regarding the apparently high number of calls made
For this purpose, it is necessary to clarify that, usually, the services of
Vodafone retention affect a single customer interaction with this
purpose, for each portability request received. Although in the present

Likewise, the opposition indicated by the claimant through the claim
filed with Vodafone, and subsequent mediation, was not correctly

As certified by the claimant, he is registered in the Robinson List, since 04/02/12 in
the telephone calls channel and since 02/04/22 in the SMS/MMS channel, but not
However, as indicated in the complaint, because Vodafone sent him
constantly advertising text messages and calls, requested that they not return to
send you more commercial communications. To do this, he signed a contract with the company
Mediation agreement before the entity "AUTOCONTROL", on 07/21/22, in which the
operator and in which the operator promised not to make calls again or
SMS messages of an advertising nature to the claimant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the operator continued to send advertising SMS to the claimant,
on 09/20/22; 09/21/22; 09/25/22 and 09/28/22, as can be seen in the
documentation provided by the claimant.

But in addition, and apart from the above, when the claimant requests the portability of
his lines to another company on 10/08/22, he received up to 13 calls, on 10/11/22 and
one more call, on 10/13/22, according to him, to try to convince him not to
change company.

VODAFONE states, for its part, that regarding SMS sent with messages
advertising after signing the agreement, it was due to an error in their
customer relationship management (CRM) systems and that calls
telephone calls made were intended, apart from corroborating his desire to
portability, to encourage customer retention by informing them and offering them an improvement in
the contractual conditions, products or services that may result from its
interest.

Classification of the possible offense committed by sending communications

III.-1

commercial

The fact that the claimed entity proceeded to send communications
commercials to the claimant via SMS without having been requested or expressly
authorized may constitute a violation of the provisions of article 21 of the
LSSI, as it establishes the following:

"1. The sending of advertising or promotional communications is prohibited
by email or other equivalent electronic means of communication
that had not previously been requested or expressly authorized by
the recipients of these.

2. The provisions of the previous section shall not apply when there is a
prior contractual relationship, provided that the provider had obtained
lawful contact details of the recipient and will use them to send
commercial communications regarding products or services of your own
company that are similar to those that were initially the subject of
contracting with the client.

In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of
oppose the processing of your data for promotional purposes through a

28001 – Madrid

simple and free procedure, both at the time of data collection
as in each of the commercial communications that you direct.

When the communications have been sent by email,
said means must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an address
email or other valid electronic address where you can
exercise this right, being prohibited the sending of communications that
do not include that address.”

Proposal and graduation of the sanction

III.-2

The aforementioned infraction of article 21 of the LSSI, is classified as minor in the
art. 38.4.d) of said rule, which qualifies as such, "The sending of communications
commercial by e-mail or other means of electronic communication
equivalent when said shipments do not meet the requirements established in the
article 21 and does not constitute a serious infringement”.

After the evidence obtained, and without prejudice to what results from the investigation, the
considers that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the following
aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of the LSSI:

-

The existence of intentionality (section a).- since the complaining party had
their telephone numbers registered in the Robinson List, had disabled in
the preferences of the application of the responding party the communications
commercial, and the exclusion agreement adopted by the defendant through
intermediary entity Autocontrol, the claimant received
commercial communications to
text.

via courier

Pursuant to these criteria, it is deemed appropriate to impose an initial sanction of
10,000 euros, (ten thousand euros), for the violation of article 21 of the LSSI, when sending
commercial communications to the claimant without having been expressly authorized
for this by the recipient.

Classification of the possible infringement committed by the commercial calls made.

IV.-1

As has been verified, when the claimant requests the portability of his lines to
another company, received up to 13 calls from the entity VODAFONE, on 10/11/22 and
one more call, on 10/13/22, to confirm your desire to carry out the portability
of his telephone line but also to try to convince him not to change his
company with advantageous offers, and containing, therefore, an essentially
commercial or promotional of the products offered.

For its part, the entity confirms that these calls, based on promoting the
customer retention were, apart from corroborating their desire to port their lines, to
offer you an improvement in the contractual conditions, products or services that
could be of interest to him and thus get him not to leave the company.

In this sense, the sixth final provision of the law, law 11/2022, of June 28,
General of Telecommunications, indicates the following:

1. This law will enter into force the day after its publication in the
"Official State Gazette", except as provided in the following section.

2. The right of end users not to receive unwanted calls with
purposes of commercial communication contemplated in article 66.1.b) will enter into
into force within one year from the publication of this law in
the "Official State Gazette". Until then, the end users of the
publicly available interpersonal communications services based on
numbering may continue to exercise the right to oppose receiving
unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes that are made
through systems other than those established in article 66.1.a) and to be
informed of this right.

The publication of this standard took place on 06/29/22 and based on the first section of the
previous provision entered into force on 06/30/22, except as provided in section
second that will enter into force on 06/30/23, therefore, the end users of the
interpersonal communications services available to the public based on the
numbering may continue to exercise the right to oppose receiving calls not
desired for purposes of commercial communication that are carried out through systems
other than those established in article 66.1.a) and to be informed of this right
Until that date.

As in our case, the claimant received up to 13 calls, on 10/11/22 and one
one more call, on 10/13/22, the above is applicable.

Well then, recital 70) of the GDPR indicates that:

profiling insofar as it is related to such
direct marketing, whether in respect of initial or subsequent processing, and
at any time and at no cost. Said right must
communicate explicitly to the data subject and present itself clearly and to the
margin of any other information.

Well then, the fact that the respondent entity did not exclude the claimant from its
systems to receive commercial communications after you compromised
to this, through an agreement signed on 07/21/22, but having made calls with
commercial nature on October 11 and 13, 2022, apart from confirming the desire

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to
impose on the claimed entity, in an initial assessment, are considered concurrent in
the present case the following factors:

As aggravating circumstances:

-

The intentionality or negligence of the infringement, on the part of the entity,
(section b), assuming that it is an entity whose activity carries out
coupled with continuous processing of personal data of users. HE
considers it especially important to remember at this point, the SAN of 17
October 2007 (rec. 63/2006), where it is indicated that: “…the Supreme Court
has been understanding that imprudence exists whenever a duty is neglected
legal care, that is, when the offender does not behave with due diligence
callable. And in assessing the degree of diligence, consideration must be
especially the professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the

case now examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and
copious handling of personal data must insist on rigor and
exquisite care to comply with the legal precautions in this regard".
Therefore, if we abide by the jurisprudence of the TS, we could even consider
this section as a qualified aggravating circumstance, when verifying the lack of diligence
should in this case, with regard to the management of personal data.

It is also considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following aggravating criteria, established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

-

The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatment of
personal data, (section b), considering that in the activity that is
develops, the personal data of its clients are involved.
