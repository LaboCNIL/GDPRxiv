FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the GDPR grants to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, it is
competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

On June 14, 2022, he entered this Spanish Protection Agency
Data claim for the installation of a video surveillance system with cameras
capable of capturing the public thoroughfare.

Article 5.1 c) of the GDPR provides that personal data shall be "adequate,
pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed ("data minimization").

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems
installed comply with current legislation.

The cameras should be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding intimidating
neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as control transit areas
of the same without just cause.

On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install imaging devices
of public space, outside the cases allowed by the regulations, as this is
exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies.

The treatment of images through a video surveillance system, to be
In accordance with current regulations, it must meet the following requirements:

- Respect the principle of proportionality.

- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a qualified private security company
contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.

- The camcorders will not be able to capture images of the people who are
outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since
Image processing in public places can only be performed, unless
there is government authorization, by the Security Forces and Bodies. Neither
spaces owned by third parties may be captured or recorded without the consent of
their owners, or, where appropriate, the people who are in them.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection
of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or inside,
it may be necessary to guarantee the security purpose the recording of a
portion of the public road. That is, cameras and camcorders installed for the purpose of
security will not be able to obtain images of the public thoroughfare unless it is
essential for said purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of the
those and extraordinarily the minimum space for said
purpose. Therefore, the cameras could exceptionally capture the portion
minimally necessary for the intended security purpose.

- The duty to inform those affected provided for in articles 12 and
13 of the GDPR and 22.4 of the LOPDGDD.

Specifically, in the video-surveilled areas, at least one badge must be placed
informative located in a sufficiently visible place, both in open spaces and
closed, which will identify, at least, the existence of a treatment, the
identity of the person responsible and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in said
precepts. Likewise, the information must be kept available to those affected.

- The controller must keep a record of processing activities
carried out under his responsibility in which the information to which he makes
reference article 30.1 of the GDPR.

- Installed cameras cannot get images from third-party proprietary space
and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can they affect
the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the area. It is not allowed, for
therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of neighbors with the purpose of
to intimidate them or affect their private sphere without just cause.

- In no case will the use of surveillance practices be accepted beyond the environment
object of the installation and in particular, not being able to affect public spaces

guarded.

The claimed party, in its pleadings both to the start-up agreement and to
the proposed resolution, has stated that what is installed are cameras
simulated.

He has contributed several photographs of the devices, as well as their characteristics.

IV.

In the present case, it is necessary to analyze the presumed illegality of the installation of a
video surveillance system in ***ADDRESS.1, ***LOCATION.1, ***PROVINCE.1.

There is insufficient evidence of the existence of a video surveillance system
that, with the documentation provided by the defendant and the statements made
on the falsity of the cameras, by virtue of the principle of presumption of innocence,
The defendant cannot be penalized.

V

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
charge accrediting the facts that motivate the imputation or the intervention in the
of the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a specific and determined fact, which in any case obliges
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of the LPACAP, which establishes that:

"2. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the presumed
responsible will have the following rights:

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility until
proven otherwise."

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: "that the
sanction is based on acts or means proving the charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the accuser, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the

result of the tests carried out, freely assessed by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal.”
