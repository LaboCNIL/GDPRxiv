indicate that Techpump Solutions S.L., does not treat personal data of
minors.

We only process personal data, in a specific section of
the pages that are dedicated to "MEMBERS", and to access a
User and password. In order to access this section,
They collect basic contact information through a form. not applying in
our data collection forms, any sensitive data that may be
framed in Art. 9 of the GDPR.

We provide a screenshot of the member access area as well as
of the registration form, where you can check how to request a
email account and a credit card number, where
expressly states that, when proceeding with the payment, it would be certifying that the
user is, once again, of legal age according to their jurisdiction, which on the other
part is adjusted to banking regulations on payment services that
requires the cardholder to be of legal age.

We also do not do any DATA PROFILING, in relation to the data
that our clients can give us, in any case our cookies, as
As indicated in our cookie policy, what they do is an analysis of the

TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS S.L., has my advice as DPD, and
with a department formed and in charge of supervising that in all our

adult, such as the obligation to be over 18 years of age.

There is also an affirmative click, noting that the website is only
for adults, informing that to enter and use it it is mandatory to have
at least 18 years of age and the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you
find, all with the purpose of putting a barrier to the fact of
enter a website with adult content. At the time, it was decided
implement said measure as an access control measure or at least
notify through this measure that the content is for adults. We make
reference even in writing saying “you have to be over 18 to
see it" , on our websites, just as we warn that everything that appears on
the web pages are made by professionals (actors and actresses) and who

need to carry out a PIA or EIPD, in relation to the data that
we tried We thought it convenient that the information we stored not
justified having an obligation to carry out a DPIA. What was done, such
as indicated by the legislation on data protection, it was a risk analysis
in relation to privacy and data management and always in relation to the
obtaining, processing and conservation of data.

In relation to the RISK OF ACCESS BY MINORS on our pages
web: At the time, we saw that it could be a problem, but a problem that
should not be in our realm. The Civil Code was analyzed, and the control that
our entity could have on the acts of minors that were
connect to our website, reaching the conclusion that the measure to be taken
drastic and effective in Spain was to use the electronic DNI to access
web pages, but this a priori effective solution and possible to implement at
all the people who connect to our websites, it is impossible to
implement for various reasons: a) The people connecting are not
all located in Spain in countries that lack this system of
valid identification. b) In Spain (if we limit ourselves to people who access
from Spain) the possession and use of the DNI is mandatory from the age of 14. By
what was decided, how could it be otherwise, than in accordance with art. 1903
of the CC, in relation to the responsibility belongs to the people who have the
Custody.

We believed that we could not take a risk that we could not control
that the risk was assumable by implementing a control system by our
part where it is remembered that the pages were for adults and have
a banner indicating if the user is older or younger.

Just as minors cannot (by legal capacity) contract a service
of the internet, nor be responsible for what our limitation does, according to
our risk analysis remains at the moment when the parents have a
duty of vigilance and responsibility for what minors do. Art.
154 and 269 of the Civil Code, there is a Responsibility In vigilando being able to
implement in use applications aimed specifically at children and launchers
that prevent the minor from accessing other types of applications or any of the
parental control applications offered by the developers themselves
operating systems, telephone operators and other companies, such as control
device usage time, blocking access to applications, control of
time of use by application, control of activity in social networks, management
remote for parents and guardians and even GPS location.

As an alternative to parental control applications, there are other
Tools that allow you to prevent access to inappropriate content by
the configuration of DNS servers that will filter and not resolve those
requests that may direct the minor to this type of content. Therefore,
We understood at the time that the formula is for parents to apply a
PARENTAL CONTROL, just like the Agency itself, is an element that makes
that our risk of these events decreases.

Both from Anglo-Saxon countries and from non-English-speaking countries, and some from
they (the minority) are Spanish-speaking. It is evident that putting the texts in
English, who we were addressing was analyzed, the pros and cons were studied
in relation to the legislation, and the timely decision was made to do so in
this way. Taking into account that the most spoken language in the world, and more
in the digital world is English, at the time and in the analysis we did on
data protection team of Techpump Solutions S.L., was to think about the
principle of Transparency, included in the GDPR in its article 5, together with the
legality and loyalty in data processing. And at the time and seeing the
origin of our clients we decided for all these reasons, to put
both the legal notice and the privacy policy, as well as the terms and
conditions of use of the web pages in English. Using this language
delving into the matter, implied using an official language in the Union
Union since 1973, and given that the GDPR is the Regulation that governs the
right to data protection throughout the EU and even with the departure of the Kingdom
Kingdom, the language has been maintained as OFFICIAL in the EU, we maintained the
decision to use English.

Even though the company is based in Spain, and it is not an official language in
Spain the English, it will be necessary to determine what prevails more if the transparency and
loyalty in the rights of people or the fact that the company
is in Spain, and then we should put the texts in the languages
co-official in Spain, and should include some that are spoken in a valley
like Aranese (with all due respect to that language) or Bable since we are
in Asturias, without naming Catalan, Basque or Galician, all of them being
They are official languages in Spain.- Using a news item from the newspaper Información
of 20121 indicates: “English is the most widely taught language in the rest of the United States.
members of the EU, a trend that has been increasing in recent
years. In high school, the percentage of students learning English exceeds the
90% and in the case of Spain close to 100%. Far behind are the French,
Spanish, German and Russian. Only a minimal percentage (between 0 and 5%) study
other languages.

The report confirms a fact that Brussels sees as surprising: few countries
requires trainee language teachers to spend a period of
immersion abroad. Only 53.8% of language teachers state
have spent more than a month studying in a country where the language is spoken
language you teach. Spain leads the classification as 79.7% of the
Spanish teachers have spent more than a month studying the language they have
chosen to teach in a country where it is spoken, while only 11% of
Estonian teachers have done it.” Furthermore, and by way of example, the
TC, expresses the applicable legislation in the Institution in English with a link
within its web page to the legislation in that language, perhaps it is because it can
there are people who are affected by this language.

2 Therefore, indicating that the English language is "unintelligible" seems to me a
very serious statement, since it is not so. And reality doesn't have to be,
for certain people who living in Europe is applicable to them in
regarding their rights, simply by the principle of transparency the
language. Therefore, we believe that we have requested the consent of

our clients in a totally clear and intelligible way, with a
easy access (it appears clearly in legal texts), and except in two cases
that indeed the option appears pre-marked as indicated in the
written in a way that obviously we had not realized and that
is corrected immediately by putting it in Spanish, and also removing the

 6.- Of course, and having as reference the art. 58.2 of the GDPR, and in the
power that the Agency in its functions has to be able to require the measures
corrective, indicate that we have corrected our legal texts, and

maybe we have a banner that allows us to give information about the installation

clearly he is right in his arguments, and the only thing and before we
urge to comply with the legislation, and in order to be able to reduce the sanctions
As much as possible, we indicate that we have proceeded to correct this fact,
placing those banners where 3 The European Data Protection Regulation

September 2020 corresponds to the functions described in the statement
of the Inspectorate of the Data Protection Agency.

8.- Finally, indicate that in relation to the sanctions proposed by the
Agency, they seem excessive to us, not for the amounts that we know could
even be older, if not, because Techpump Solutions S.L., is a company
small, and therefore, we believe that even having made mistakes that
we recognize, and others that we do not agree with the criteria of the Agency, and
we indicate why they have been carried out, we have corrected them immediately
without the Agency having intervened requiring that rectification.
Pursuant to art. 58 of the GDPR, and within the powers of the Agency,
In order for the Data Controller to comply with
or cease certain behaviors of the latter, it should be noted that, in this case, and for
part of the company, every effort has been made to try to meet
strict with what the regulations impose on us as Responsible.

For all these reasons, we request that the Agency within its power of art. 58, 2
of the GDPR, and seeing everything done by the company as an attitude
proactive, can impose a collected sanction such as the
WARNING, a fact that would make it not so
affected in the payment of a high amount of money that could jeopardize
the continuity of it.

In addition, I think we should take into account the also favorable fact that
have never been penalized. We understand that it may be a request
reasonable, in a tight application of the principle of proportionality,
general principle of public law that supports the requirement that

any action of the public powers limiting or restricting rights
meets the criteria of necessity and adequacy for the purpose pursued. In a
stricter meaning, represents the existence of a due adequacy
between the seriousness of the act constituting the offense and the sanction applied
that can be contemplated in its normative aspect or in its application aspect
by the Administration or the Courts.

The principle of proportionality has been treated in jurisprudence as a
important mechanism of control before the Courts of the exercise of the
sanctioning power when the norm establishes for an infraction several
possible sanctions or indicates a quantitative margin for setting the
penalty imposed. In fact, both in the previous Law 30/1992 and in the
current Law 40/2015 includes such a principle as one of the informants of the
sanctioning power of the Administration in its normative aspect and
applicative. Regarding the discretion of the Administration in the
graduation of the sanction, it should be taken into account that, although the
Administration may use some discretion in grading
the sanction to accommodate it to the set of concurrent circumstances in the
infringement, it is no less true that the principle of proportionality of the
sanction is subject to judicial control.

The discretion granted to the Administration must be developed
weighing in any case the concurrent circumstances in order to achieve
the necessary and due proportionality between the alleged facts and the
responsibility required, given that any sanction must be determined in
consistency with the entity of the offense committed and according to a criterion of
proportionality considering the objective circumstances of the fact,
proportionality that constitutes a normative principle that is imposed as a
precept more to the Administration and that reduces the scope of its powers
sanctioning, since to the jurisdictional activity corresponds not only the
qualification to subsume the conduct in the legal type, but also to adapt the
sanction for the act committed, since in both cases the subject is the application
of legal evaluative criteria embodied in the written norm, as they are in
this sanctioning field, those of congruence and proportionality between the
infraction and the sanction, which must be taken into consideration for that
Agency, in view of the concurrent circumstances, described in the body
of this writing. For the above stated,

REQUEST 1.- The allegations in File No.

It is competent to resolve this Disciplinary Procedure, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency, in accordance with the provisions of art.
43.1, second paragraph, of the LSSI Law.

II.- Processing of personal data.

Article 4 of the GDPR, under the heading "Definitions", provides the following:

“1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in
by means of an identifier, such as a name, a number
identification, location data, an online identifier, or one or more
elements of physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,
economic, cultural or social of said person;

2) "processing": any operation or set of operations carried out on
about personal data or sets of personal data, either by means of
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structure-
tion, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction”.

7) "responsible for the treatment" or "responsible": the natural or legal person,
authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
purposes and means of processing; if the law of the Union or of the States
members determines the purposes and means of processing, the data controller

In this case, it is clear that the entity TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. is the
responsible for data processing referred to in the proven facts of the procedure

city.

The entity indicates, in its letter dated 07/04/22, responding to the requirement of
information derived from the test process, that there is no data processing
through the websites www.diverporno.com and www.soloporno.xxx.

This is an obvious contradiction with reality because, first of all, it is

personal information.

Secondly, because these pages can obtain personal data through
the "Contact" tab, where the email server is displayed, being able to
send a message to the address, san@techpump.com. They can also be collected
personal data through the "Webmasters" tab, through which you can
send a message to the email address: san@techpump.com or enter data

through the "Advertise Here" link, where the website redirects to a new
page, www.trfpump.com/, in which personal data such as the
name, email and subject.

And, thirdly, and most importantly, because as stated in the facts
proven, recognize that "IP is taken into account, without collecting the data, only
to be able to know from which country the user connects. The data is not collected, and
In addition, the order of videos is adapted by the country that has been connected”.

The company seems to assume that the use of the IP with a
certain purpose - to know the place of connection of the person who accesses the content of the
web page without registering and adapting the order of the videos by the country of connection-
It is not a processing of personal data, since "the data is not collected".

However, as stated in article 4.2) of the GDPR, data processing
Personal data includes any operation carried out on personal data such as the
collected, what happens in the case examined.

Regarding the IP, it is undisputed that we are dealing with data of a
personnel as it has been considered by the AEPD through its Reports
of his Legal Cabinet 327/2003 or of March 1, 2007 or widely by the
jurisprudence (for all, Judgment of the Supreme Court of 16/2014 of January 30
o October 3, 2014 o Judgment of the National Court of September 1
of 2011 or Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of October 19,
2016, case C-582/14).

On the websites: www.serviporno.com/, and www.porn300.com/es/: as evidenced by

location, gender, age, image and voice, as well as the last connection, the number

comments that can be made, show tastes and sexual habits.

Credit card data is also collected on the website www.cumlouder.com.

And all this without prejudice to the rest of the data collected, in the terms established in
the proven facts.

Finally, we must indicate that, however, the entity asserts in its writ of

You must not be of legal age to enter and use the website - “…the website is only for
adults, informing that to enter and use it it is mandatory to have at least
18 years of age”- and in the same sense in its privacy policy –“This website is

it cannot be affirmed that it does not process personal data of minors.

III.- On the lack of loyalty and transparency.

Article 5.1.a) of the GDPR provides that "Personal data will be: a) treated-
two in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, loyalty
and transparency»);».

Recital 38 of the GDPR on loyalty and transparency determines that:

“All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For the people
Physical data must be made completely clear that they are collecting, using, con-
revealing or otherwise processing personal data concerning them, as well
as the extent to which said data is or will be processed. The principle of
Transparency requires that all information and communication relating to treatment
of such data is readily accessible and easy to understand, and is used
simple and clear language. This principle refers in particular to information
information of the interested parties on the identity of the person responsible for the treatment and the
purposes of this and to the added information to guarantee a fair treatment and
transparent with respect to the natural persons affected and their right to
obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
nan that they are the object of treatment”.

Likewise, recital 60 of the GDPR states that.

“The principles of fair and transparent treatment require that the interested party be informed
informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The responsible-
The data controller must provide the interested party with all the complementary information
necessary to guarantee fair and transparent treatment, given
account of the specific circumstances and context in which the data is processed.
personal coughs”.

Article 12 of the GDPR establishes how the transparency of information is articulated
and the communication to the interested party. And articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR specify the information
specific information that must be provided to the interested party to guarantee loyalty and
transparency.

C / Jorge Juan 6
28001 - Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

67/122

The principle of transparency is not exhausted in the material concretion of supplying the information
formation of articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, under the terms of article 12 of the GDPR
and 11 of the LOPDGDD.
 
The principle of transparency established in article 5.1.a) of the GDPR is much more and has
ne entity in itself. Linked to the principle of loyalty, it implies effective knowledge
of the precise information on the part of the interested parties that redounds in the power of dis-
position and control that the interested parties have regarding the processing of their data
personal, in the terms provided in the Constitutional Court Judgment
292/2000, of November 30, 2000: "Luckily, without the guarantee that the
right to appropriate information by fulfilling certain requirements
legal requirements (art. 5 L.O.P.D.) would undoubtedly frustrate the right of the interested party
to control and dispose of your personal data, since it is clear that they would prevent you from exercising
other faculties that are integrated into the content of the fundamental right to which
we are referring to”.

In this sense, the Guidelines of the Article 29 Working Group on transparency
reference under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on November 29,
2017 and last revised and adopted on April 11, 2018 (WP 260) prevent
that “10. A fundamental consideration of the principle of transparency outlined in
these provisions is that the interested party must be able to determine in advance the scope
ce and the consequences derived from the treatment, and that you should not be surprised in
a later moment for the use that has been given to your personal data. It is, thus-
same, of an important aspect of the principle of loyalty under article 5, par-
Clause 1 of the GDPR and, indeed, it is related to recital 39…”.

It is useless to formally provide the information required in the articles
13 and 14 of the GDPR if this does not agree with the reality of the treatment established in the re-
record of processing activities or if the information is contradictory, obscure and
does not allow interested parties to really know what the treatment of their
personal information.

Regarding loyalty, CEPD Guidelines 4/2019 related to article 25 Protection
tion of data from the design and by default, adopted on October 20, 2020 dis-
they put that “69. Loyalty is a general principle that requires that personal data
are not treated in a manner that is unreasonably prejudicial, unlawfully discriminatory, unfairly
permissible or misleading for the interested party”. They continue to establish a manifestation of loyalty
will be that "The interested parties must have the maximum degree of autonomy possible
to determine the use made of your personal data, as well as the scope and
conditions of said use or treatment (…) The treatment must correspond to
the reasonable expectations of the interested parties (...) The data controller does not

Thus, we can observe a clear inconsistency between the content of the register of the
activities of the treatment of users (RAT) of the web pages referred to this
AEPD on 04/05/2021 and those sent on 07/04/22, the information provided through
of the privacy policy of the web pages and the test carried out.

In the first place, there is vagueness, a lack of specificity and transparency regarding
regarding the personal data processed and the information provided for this purpose to the
users, which obviously generates an obvious confusion that shows the lack of
transparency and loyalty.

In relation to the web pages www.diverporno.com and www.soloporno.xxx, although the
entity TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. asserts in its brief of 07/04/2022 that it does not

Thus, contrary to what was stated to the AEPD, in addition to the IP, the name

In addition, in the privacy policy itself it is indicated that "The data that we keep
are those included in the forms of the website such as contact information

information is received by TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS SL and is never sold,

Sometimes, we collect browsing data, such as IP or Wi-Fi data.

In the rest of the web pages, that is, www.serviporno.com, www.cumlouder.com and

To this we must add that credit card details are requested on the page
on the website www.cumlouder.com.

And also other data not indicated by the company and that they obtain after registering the

their preferences, tastes and sexual habits.

We can verify that many of the personal data processed by the company or
are mentioned in the privacy policy, which, on the contrary, cites others than the entity

In addition to the vagueness and lack of definition that the “etc.” that accompanies the allusion

again in the lack of loyalty and transparency.

In addition, we will indicate that article 30.1 of the GDPR provides, in terms of content

As we can verify, in addition to the fact that the purpose of the record does not coincide
of the treatment activities with what is stated in the privacy policy, there is
a great vagueness as to what the purpose of the treatment consists of, since the
"management" of the data provided in the forms in itself does not determine for what
personal data is processed, given that all treatment includes a management of
personal information.

In addition, in the transfer of personal data, both in the register of activities

expressly as a purpose, nor is the legal basis that would legitimize such
data processing independently. This action results in a lack of
loyalty and transparency of the person responsible for the treatment with respect to the interested parties.

On the other hand, the entity indicates, in its brief of 07/04/2022 in the test process,
regarding the web pages www.serviporno.com, www.cumlouder.com and www.-

In conclusion, the entity's actions lack loyalty and transparency,

do. Loyalty and transparency imply that the interested party is perfectly aware
aware that the processing of your personal data is taking place, with what
nes and in what way.

For this reason, and in accordance with the evidence presented, the aforementioned facts presuppose
a violation of the provisions of article 5.1.a), which gives rise to the application of the
corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

IV.- Violation

The facts exposed do not comply with the provisions of article 5.1.a) of the GDPR,
with the scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which means
the commission of an infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which under the
section "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines" provides
the following: “5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, according to
accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000.
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4%
of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting
for the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the consent
ment according to articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72.1.a) considers as an infraction "very
serious” for prescription purposes “1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years
the infractions that suppose a substantial infringement of the articles
mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

V.- On the limitation of the purpose.

Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data will be "collected
for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be further processed
manner incompatible with said purposes; according to article 89, paragraph 1, the
further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, fi-
scientific and historical research or statistical purposes shall not be considered incom-
compatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation")."

The purpose limitation principle requires that personal data be collected
both for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes.

Thus, the purposes must be perfectly identified so that the interested party
can determine if the treatment carried out by the person in charge is within such fi-

purposes.

In addition, and linked to transparency, the fact that the purposes are explicit means that the
affected understands what these are, in order to maintain real control over their
personal data and can effectively exercise their rights. To understand which
is the explicit purpose, this must be revealed to the interested party.

Without forgetting that the purposes have to be legitimate, that is, as permitted
by the legal system.

In this sense, Opinion 3/2013 of the Working Group of the Article
29, adopted on April 2, 2013, on purpose limitation.

From all this it can be inferred that personal data processing cannot be carried out
because they may be useful in the future to the data controller. They have to be
linked to the determined, explicit and legitimate current purposes of the same and
about their own treatments.

The entity TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. explicit in his writing

Given the criminal level that can exist using this type of web pages, as well
such as the use of them to try to post photographs and videos of other
people who are not professional actors/actresses, this company collaborates
actively with the bodies and security forces of the State, in the detection
tion of crimes related to child pornography and other crimes that may
be of that legal nature”.

Thus, this entity collects the data of the I.P. not only for the management of the data of the
users for the delivery of digital advertising (own purpose), but also with the fi-
purpose of supplying the P.I. to the State security forces and bodies (purpose
from a third party). These purposes are clearly different from each other.

In addition to the fact that they cannot process personal data for purposes that are not their own
but outside, in addition to the fact that said purpose is not included in the activity register.

purposes set forth in these instruments between themselves) and that is not even known

On the other hand, in the privacy policy, when referring to the recipients

we have to add the fact that at least one of the web pages, www.cum-

58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants the AEPD.

VI.- Violation.

The processing of personal data in accordance with an external purpose, not made explicit to the
interested and willing with the intention of using the data as long as
may be required in the future, fails to comply with the provisions of article 5.1.b) of the
GDPR, with the scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which
supposes the commission of an infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which
under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines"
provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000.

maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the preceding financial year

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72.1.a) considers as an infraction "very
serious” for prescription purposes

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU)

Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR establishes that:

"Personal data will be: e) maintained in a way that allows identification;
cation of the interested parties for no longer than necessary for the purposes
of the processing of personal data; personal data may be kept
be stored for longer periods as long as they are treated exclusively with
archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes, in accordance with article 89, paragraph 1, without prejudice
of the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures that impo-
defines this Regulation in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the
resado ("retention period limitation")".

Recital 39 refers to the fact that: "Personal data must be adequate, but
relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. It re-

vation", which implies that, in any case, personal data must be deleted
when these purposes have been fulfilled.

Adds recital 39 that: "To ensure that personal data is not con-
longer than necessary, the data controller must establish plans
zos for its suppression or periodic revision”.

From all this it can be inferred that the indefinite maintenance of
the personal data of a data subject.

However, the entity asserts in its letter of 07/04/22 responding to the request-
test carried out by the AEPD, and in relation to the data obtained from the
registered users, (www.serviporno.com/, and www.porn300.com/es/), that: “(…) In-

member of the web pages. They can request the annulment of consent when
desired simply by communicating it”.

Similarly, the privacy policy of the five web pages provides that "The

time you want to be a member.

We must mean that, although the legitimizing basis of the treatment is the consent
this does not cover the indefinite maintenance of the data collected

treatment transmits to the interested party that the treatment time "is indefinite" when

State security forces and bodies and purchases.

In conclusion, the action of the entity maintaining indefinitely the data
collected from users registered on the web pages (www.serviporno.-

application of the corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to
the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

For its part, article 12.1 of the aforementioned GDPR establishes, on the requirements that must be
comply with the information that the data controller must make available to
the interested parties when requesting their consent, the following:

"1. The person in charge of the treatment will take the appropriate measures to facilitate
to the interested party all the information indicated in articles 13 and 14, as well as
any communication pursuant to articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the
treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, with a
clear and simple language, in particular any information directed

means, including, if applicable, by electronic means. When requested by the

Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR detail the information that must be provided-
the interested party when the data is collected directly from the interested party (art. 13), or through
through other means, (art. 14). In any case, the obligation to inform people

data (if any) have been communicated to other recipients.

Regarding data processing based on the consent of the interested party, the
Article 7 of the GDPR indicates that the data controller must be able to determine
show that the interested party consented to the processing of their personal data. If he with-
sentiment is given in the context of a written statement that also refers to
other issues, it is required that the request for consent be clearly distinguished from
other matters and is presented in an intelligible form, easily accessible and using a
clear and simple language. It is also required to provide additional information
information to the interested party, among others, what will be the categories of data to be processed, the purposes
for which consent is sought and the right to withdraw consent
whenever.

Regarding the way to obtain the consent of the interested party for the treatment in
matter, recital 32 of the GDPR provides that it:

It must be given by a clear affirmative act that reflects a manifestation of
free, specific, informed and unequivocal will of the interested party to accept the
processing of personal data concerning you" and that "silence,
boxes already checked or inaction should not constitute consent.”
Likewise, consent is required to be granted “for all
processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When
the processing has multiple purposes, consent must be given for all
they". Finally, it establishes that, "if the consent of the interested party has to be
give as a result of a request by electronic means, the request must be clear,
concise and not unnecessarily disrupt the use of the service for which it is
lend”.

In the case at hand, when the processing of personal data is carried out through
through a website, the "Privacy Policy" of the page is the document, to
through which the owner of the website must inform its customers and users about the
management that it will carry out of the personal data that will be collected when browsing the site.

Therefore, before the user provides their personal data and gives their consent
to the treatment of these, a simple and direct access to the "Policy of
Privacy” of the web.

Regarding the way to obtain the consent of the interested party, the request must be
carried out through a clear and voluntary affirmative act, providing a box in
target, or a similar mechanism, where the user must mark or click in an ex-
explicit acceptance of the "Privacy Policy", through formulas such as: "_ I have read-

X.- Violation
 

 

The fact that the person in charge of the indicated web pages could obtain data
users' personal information without having previously obtained their consent for the
their treatment, through a clear and voluntary affirmative act, previously
informed in an intelligible manner, constitutes an infringement of article 6.1 of the
GDPR mentioned above, which implies the commission of an infraction classified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which under the heading "General conditions for the

c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter

of the treatment based on the consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to file a claim with a control authority;
e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or con-

the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f) the existence of automated decisions, including the elaboration of
profiles, referred to in article 22, sections 1 and 4, and, at least in
such cases, significant information about the applied logic, as well as
the significance and expected consequences of such processing for

3. When the controller plans the subsequent processing of data

about that other purpose and any additional information pertinent under paragraph

4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in

Therefore, another purpose is present, consisting of the treatment of the data of the
users to make purchases, that is, to maintain a contractual relationship with the
user, with a legal basis other than consent.

Also, the entity TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. and regarding the web pages

Well then, article 13.1.c) of the GDPR requires the data controller to make

consent prior to its withdrawal. Before giving consent, the interested party
will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it.

Thus, article 13.2.c) of the GDPR obliges the data controller to provide information
training on the revocation of consent when it is the legitimate legal basis
treatment provider: "when the treatment is based on article 6, section 1,
letter a), or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw the con-
feeling at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on
given in the consent prior to its withdrawal”.

Based on the proven facts, it is verified that the entity TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. No

This conduct is even more serious, when in the letter of 07/04/2022 it refers
before the trial process, the company asserts, regarding the web pages www.servi-
porno.com, www.cumlouder.com and www.porn300.com/es that “They can request the annul-
consent when desired simply by communicating it. Just like
indicated in the RAT”. However, being aware of the right of the interested party to
revoke consent, such information is not included in the submitted RAT nor is it reported to
interested parties in this regard in the privacy policy.

On the other hand, article 13.2.d) of the GDPR also obliges the data controller to
consent to provide information to interested parties on the right to file a
claim before a control authority, an issue that does not appear in any section
of the privacy policy.

In conclusion, a violation of article 13 of the GDPR is verified, by not supplying
all the information imposed by the RGPD, in the terms previously
previously expressed.

articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

XIII.- Regarding the provision of information to the interested party in English.

Article 12.1 of the GDPR provides that,

For its part, recital 58 of the GDPR establishes that

“The principle of transparency requires that all information addressed to the public or to the

The Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under

for the last time and adopted on April 11, 2018, indicate that,

10. A fundamental consideration of the principle of transparency outlined in
these provisions is that the interested party must be able to determine in advance

Thus, and in order for the interested party to hold and maintain the power of control over
your personal data, the information provided to you must be done in a
intelligible, clear and simple, in such a way that it is understandable to the average member
of the target audience.

That said, from the proven facts it is verified that the entity provided

Well then, we have to mean, on the one hand, that Spanish is the official language in the
Spanish State, as established in article 3 of the Spanish Constitution.

And, on the other, that the web pages are aimed at the Spanish market, which is evidenced by
manifested by the undoubted fact that the entire web page is in this
language and not in English.

It goes without saying, therefore, that the information should be provided in the language of the country to which

Of course, the privacy policy will be understood by everyone who
can read and understand English, but in no case will it be for the average member
of the target audience, that is, a Spaniard, as established in the Guidelines
mentioned. The privacy policy in English of these web pages is not intelligible
within the meaning of the GDPR.

In conclusion, the entity's actions by not providing accurate information to the
interested in non-official language in Spain until he was aware of the opening
ture of this sanctioning procedure supposes a violation of the RGPD.

The formal aspects related to the exercise of these rights are established in the articles
Articles 12 of the GDPR and 12 of the LOPDGDD.

Article 12 "Transparency of information, communication and modalities of
exercise of rights" of the GDPR establishes the following:

"1. The person in charge of the treatment will take the appropriate measures to facilitate
to the interested party all the information indicated in articles 13 and 14, as well as
any communication pursuant to articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the
treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, with a
clear and simple language, in particular any information directed
specifically a child. The information will be provided in writing or by other
means, including, if applicable, by electronic means. When requested by the
interested party, the information may be provided verbally provided that
prove the identity of the data subject by other means.

2. The data controller will provide the interested party with the exercise of their
rights under articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in the
article 11.2, the person in charge will not refuse to act at the request of the interested party
in order to exercise your rights under articles 15 to 22, unless
can demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the interested party.

3. The person responsible for the treatment will provide the interested party with information regarding
its actions on the basis of a request under articles 15 to
22, and, in any case, within one month from receipt of the
application. This period may be extended by another two months if necessary,

8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance
with article 92 in order to specify the information to be submitted to

For its part, article 12 “General provisions on the exercise of rights”
of the LOPDGDD, in its sections 2 and 4, adds the following:

"2. The person in charge of the treatment will be obliged to inform the affected party about the methods

"4. Proof of compliance with the duty to respond to the request to exercise

It also takes into account what is stated in Considering 59 et seq. of the
GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of these regulations, the data controller

of the GDPR); is obliged to respond to requests made no later than a

From the foregoing it can be deduced that the request for the exercise of rights made by the
interested party must be answered in any case, with the person responsible for the proof
ba of the fulfillment of this duty.

This obligation to act is not enforceable when the data controller
can demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the interested party (in cases
referred to in article 11.2 of the GDPR). In cases other than those provided for in this

article, in which the data controller has reasonable doubts regarding
with the identity of the applicant, may require additional information necessary to
confirm that identity.

In this regard, Recital 64 of the GDPR is expressed in the following terms:

“The data controller must use all reasonable measures to
verify the identity of the interested parties who request access, in particular in the
context of online services and online identifiers. The responsible

Article 12.6 of the GDPR refers to all requests for rights and admits the possibility of
possibility of requiring, in those cases, "additional information" necessary to
confirm the identity of the interested party. In particular, in relation to requests
of access in the context of online services, Recital 64 of the same Re-
regulation refers to the possibility that the person in charge uses all the "measures
reasonable” to verify the identity of the interested parties.

The rules that regulate the exercise of rights do not establish, therefore, the need

Consequently, in accordance with the evidence presented, the aforementioned facts

requirement to provide the DNI or passport in any case and prior to the

XVI.- Violation

The accredited facts breach the provisions of article 12.2 of the GDPR, with the
scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which implies the
commission of an offense classified in article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, which under the

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72 considers as a “very serious” infraction

f) when possible, the deadlines set for the suppression of the different
data categories;
g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organizational measures
security measures referred to in article 32, paragraph 1”.

Thus, keeping and maintaining the record of processing activities is a
obligation of the controller for the sake of proactive liability, and
which serves to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller in relation to
tion with the provisions of the GDPR. In this sense, recital 82 of the GDPR provides
states that "to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the person responsible for

In the first place, and regarding the record of processing activities sent to the
AEPD on 04/05/2021, encompassing all the web pages, it did not indicate who the

3. Person in charge of treatment”-.

Nor did it include the security measures that, in accordance with article 30.1.g) of the
GDPR, must be described in general in this instrument.

Second, and in relation to the registration of the activities of the treatment sent me-
by letter of 07/04/2022, regarding the obligation on the part of the person in charge

On the other hand, the absence of determination of the general description of the

activities of the treatment sent on 06/04/2022, neither in the purposes, nor in the data

Consequently, in accordance with the evidence presented, the aforementioned facts
imply a violation of the provisions of article 30.1 of the GDPR, since the

that of minors.

In the GDPR there are specific mentions in relation to minors in care of
the special protection that children deserve, as provided for in recital 38
of the GDPR: "Children deserve specific protection of their personal data,
who may be less aware of the risks, consequences, guarantees and rights

Article 8 of the GDPR refers to the conditions applicable to the consent of the child

in relation to information society services:

"1. Where Article 6(1)(a) applies in relation to the offer

2. The data controller will make reasonable efforts to verify in

3. Section 1 shall not affect the general provisions of Contract Law.
of the Member States, such as the rules relating to the validity, form-
tion or effects of contracts in relation to a child”.

Complete the previous provision of article 7 of the LOPDGDD that determines that:

"1. The processing of personal data of a minor only
may be based on your consent when you are over fourteen years of age.

The cases in which the law requires the attendance of the holders of
parental authority or guardianship for the celebration of the act or legal business in
whose context the consent for the treatment is obtained.

2. The treatment of the data of minors under fourteen years of age, based on the
consent, it will only be lawful if that of the holder of parental authority or tu-
fabric, to the extent determined by the holders of parental authority or guardianship.

Article 8 of the GDPR establishes in which cases it is applicable. let's examine
if in the case now examined we find ourselves in this situation.

First, it requires that the treatment be related to services of the society of the
information offered directly to a child.

Regarding what is understood by information society service, the Directive
goes (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 9, 2015
which establishes a procedure for information on regulatory matters
technical rules and regulations relating to the services of the information society, dis-
puts in its article 1.1.b) what is meant by service: "service": any service of the
information society, that is, any service normally provided in exchange for
a remuneration, remotely, electronically and at the individual request of a destination
service tarry. For the purposes of this definition, the following shall be understood as: i) «at a distance
cia", a service provided without the parties being present simultaneously, ii) "by
electronically" means a service sent from the source and received by the recipient by
through electronic processing equipment (including digital compression) and storage
data storage and that is transmitted, channeled and received entirely by wires, radio,

optical means or any other electromagnetic means, iii) "at the individual request of
a recipient of services' means a service provided by transmission of data to
individual request”.

After examining the web pages, they meet the expectations of being a service
of the information society.

Second, the services are required to be offered directly to a child. This
assumed not to be offered directly to a child if the provider of these services
makes it clear to users that it offers them only to people of legal age (18
years).

Well, although the entity warns on the banner of all its web pages that the
The website is for adults, stating that they do not process the data of minors and that
there is an obligation to be over 18 years old, the truth is that in the policy of
privacy of the web pages now examined, it is clearly stated that "This

XXI.- Privacy by design

Article 25 of the GDPR establishes that "Taking into account the state of the art, the
cost of the application and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as
as the risks of varying probability and severity involved in the treatment for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller applies
will be, both at the time of determining the means of treatment and at the time
of the processing itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as the
pseudonymization, designed to effectively apply the principles of protection
data minimization, such as data minimization, and integrate the necessary safeguards into the
treatment, in order to comply with the requirements of this Regulation and to protect the
rights of the interested parties”.

It is complemented by the provisions of recital 78 of the GDPR, which indicates that
“The protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with respect to the
processing of personal data requires the adoption of technical and organizational measures
appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.
glament. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the
controller must adopt internal policies and implement measures that
comply in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by definition.

fect. These measures could consist, among others, of minimizing the treatment
of personal data, pseudonymize personal data as soon as possible, transfer
parity to functions and the processing of personal data, allowing interested parties

public contracts”.

The principle of privacy by design is an example of the transition from reactivity to
the proactivity and risk approach imposed by the GDPR. Clear reflection of the res-
proactive responsibility, imposes that, from the most initial stages of planning
of a treatment must be considered this principle: the person responsible for the treatment
from the moment an eventual data treatment is designed and planned.
personal cough must determine all the elements that make up the treatment,
carried out through an exercise of analysis and detection of risks during
the entire cycle of data processing, with the first and last purpose of protecting
personal data and the rights and freedoms of the interested parties and not only when
treatment actually takes place. This is expressed in Guidelines 4/2019 of the
CEPD related to article 25 Protection of data from the design and by default, adopt-
held on October 20, 2020.

The aforementioned Guidelines indicate in this regard that “35. The "moment to determine"
the means of treatment» refers to the period of time in which the person responsible

this, as well as the mechanisms that will be used to carry out said treatment.

such as the risks, the state of the art and the cost of application, as well as the nature

pre-designed treatment goals”.

To do this, when designing the treatment, you must resort to the principles contained in the article
5 of the GDPR, which will serve to assess effective compliance with the GDPR. Thus, the
aforementioned Directives 4/2019 of the CEPD provide that “61. To make the PDDD effective,

principles are included in article 5 and recital 39 of the GDPR”.

The AEPD Guide to Privacy by Design provides that "Privacy must be

For this reason, privacy by design, an obligation of the data controller who

XXIII.- Regarding the Warning of content for adults and the "Policy of the Protection of the

Minor on the Internet”.

Opinion 2/2009 of the Working Group of Article 29 on the protection of
personal data of children (General Guidelines and special reference to the
schools) tells us that: "A child is a human being in the broadest sense of
word. For this reason, you must enjoy all the rights of the person, including
the right to the protection of personal data. Now the child is
in a particular situation that must be considered from two perspectives: static
and dynamic. From the static point of view, the child is a person who has not yet
reached physical and psychological maturity. From a dynamic point of view, it
He is in a process of physical and mental development that will make him an adult. The
rights of the child and their exercise - including the right to data protection - should
express themselves with both perspectives in mind.

Thus, the Article 29 Working Group highlights not only the importance of the
child for the inherent dignity of the child as "a human being in the broadest
sense of the word", but it shows the need for protection of this, also
from the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data, by the
situation of inferiority and risk in which he finds himself by not having reached full
maturity and being in the process of developing towards adulthood.

Recital 39 of the GDPR highlights that "Children deserve protection
specific to your personal data, as they may be less aware of the
risks, consequences, guarantees and rights concerning data processing
personal. Said specific protection should apply in particular to the use of
personal data of children for marketing or profiling purposes
personality or user, and to obtain personal data relating to children
when using services offered directly to a child”.

Regarding the risks, recital 75 of the GDPR exemplifies some of the
present in our society, without prejudice to many others who may at the same time
materialize, harm the rights and freedoms of natural persons. we will call
the attention in which it includes between the vulnerable people to the children, whose
processing of personal data constitutes a risk in itself.

Thus it provides that "The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
of variable severity and probability, may be due to the processing of data that
could cause physical, material or immaterial damages, in particular
in cases where the processing may give rise to problems of discrimination,
identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to reputation,
loss of confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, reversion not
of pseudonymization or any other economic or social harm
significant; in cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and
freedoms or are prevented from exercising control over your personal data; In the cases
in which the personal data processed reveal ethnic or racial origin, opinions
political, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, and treatment
of genetic data, data relating to health or data on sexual life, or the
criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures; in cases where
in which personal aspects are evaluated, in particular the analysis or prediction of
aspects related to work performance, economic situation, health,
preferences or personal interests, reliability or behavior, situation or
movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; in cases where
personal data of vulnerable people, in particular children, are processed; or in the
cases in which the processing involves a large amount of personal data and
affect a large number of stakeholders.

Not only the processing of personal data of a child as a vulnerable person is a
risk, but in the case of children, the risks that would affect any group
are amplified by their situation of vulnerability, so that the dangers per se are
older than if they affect an adult. This implies that, from the point of view of
risk, a fundamental pillar of the GDPR, it is necessary to enable technical and
organizational security measures to avoid the materialization of very high risk
causing an injury to their rights and freedoms, taking into consideration as
starting point that we find ourselves with the processing of personal data of
children.

Recital 76 supports it by understanding that "The probability and severity of the risk
for the rights and freedoms of the data subject must be determined with reference to the
nature, scope, context and purposes of data processing. The risk should
be weighted on the basis of an objective evaluation through which it is determined whether
data processing operations involve a risk or if the risk is high”.

The risks to which children are affected and their avoidance are based on the
best interests of the child, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on
the Rights of the Child (article 3) and subsequently confirmed by Convention 192
of the Council of Europe (article 6) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
EU (article 24, N.2).

In Opinion 2/2009 of the Working Group of Article 29 on the protection of
children's personal data, it is provided that "The justification for this principle is that
a person who has not yet reached physical and psychological maturity needs
more protection than other people. Its purpose is to improve the conditions of the child and
reinforce the right of the latter to develop his personality”.

Such provision is also contained in Spanish law. Thus, we can cite the Law
Organic 1/1996, of January 15, of Legal Protection of Minors, of modification
part of the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Law or Organic Law 8/2021,
of June 4, comprehensive protection for children and adolescents against violence.

Article 2 of Organic Law 1/1996 determines that "Every minor has the right to
that their best interest is valued and considered paramount in all
actions and decisions that concern you, both in the public and private spheres. In
the application of this law and other regulations that affect it, as well as in the
measures concerning minors adopted by institutions, public or
private companies, the Courts, or the legislative bodies, the best interests of the
themselves over any other legitimate interest that may arise”.

The same protection is projected in data protection regarding minors.
It is significant that art. 76.2 of the LOPDGDD considers as criteria of
graduation of sanctions the affectation of the rights of minors, which
shows that the Spanish legislator, following in the wake of the law
legal, refers to a vital importance in its protection, in the relevance and in the
sensitivity of minors.

In the case that we are examining, pornography is considered by our
legislator as a specific risk with respect to minors. Article 45 of the Law
Orgánica 8/2021 affirms that it is a risk "the access and consumption of pornography among the
underage population”. Especially in an interconnected world where
minors dive into the internet from ever younger ages.

This is understood in Opinion 02/2013 of the Working Group of Article 29 on
applications of smart devices, which in relation to children
establishes the following: «(...) 3.10 Children. Children are avid users of
applications, either on their own devices or on shared devices (with their
parents, siblings or in an educational institution), and there is clearly a large market
of various applications for them. But, at the same time, the children hardly
understand or know, if at all, the scope and sensitivity of
the data that applications can access, or the scope of the data
shared with third parties for advertising purposes.”

We will also cite the Agreement of the National Markets Commission and the
Jurisdiction of June 16, 2022 in relation to the complaint against a
pornography video sharing platform for the alleged breach of
the obligation to establish age verification mechanisms, in which
specifies the early age of access to these platforms, in the middle of the process of
development of minors: "It must be taken into account that in the Spanish case,
access to pornography on the internet is really worrying since more
50% of Spanish adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 usually watch regularly
pornography on the Internet, that the average age of initiation in the consumption of pornography is
14 years among male adolescents and 16 years in the case of women and
that, however, at least one in four men has started before the age of 13
and the earliest age of access is already anticipated at 8 years.

Pursuant to the aforementioned Agreement of the National Markets Commission and the
Competition, it describes the characteristics of pornography in
internet in relation to the risks to which minors are subjected:

“Among the main characteristics of Internet pornography is that the
It is easily accessible at any time and from anywhere. The
New technologies and the proliferation of devices for personal use have
allowed a practically immediate degree of accessibility to this type of
content by minors.

Another characteristic is that the supply of pornography is affordable, all
time that it is perceived as mostly free, although it is undeniable the
connection that pornography has with the advertising of services or articles
sexual, paid content (live, on request, by catalogue),
paid contacts, among others.

Related to the above, you can find various levels of
end-user interaction, from minimal anonymous interaction
(visualization of videos) to an intense interactivity of a face-to-face relationship
face from distance contact, in a new context of access to
prostitution (paid contacts), going through modalities of diverse
implication.

Another important aspect to highlight is that part of the sexual practices
that exhibits pornography on the internet shows the sexual relationship in a
stereotyped, the satisfaction of male sexual desire and the
representation of male sexual fantasies. They also include
high-risk practices such as unprotected sex or
those in which there is physical or verbal violence.

Access by minors to this type of internet pornography
especially concerned with the way in which the minor can come to understand
interpersonal relationships and sex.

Indeed, the representation of stereotyped sexual relations, give
foot to the sexual objectification of women, the exhibition of characters with
predefined physical attributes negatively impacts the self-esteem of the
minors (girls feel physically inferior and boys doubt their
virility) and the normalization of certain extreme practices alter the perception
of those on their acceptability.

The characteristics of Internet pornography described above favor and
facilitate that there is a high interest on the part of minors to access
pornographic content. In turn, the consequences of such access and
mass consumption can have an important influence on the formation of the
character of minors, whose protection must prevail”.

As we can see, and being fully applicable to the protection
procured by the GDPR, each of the characteristics defined in this Agreement
pose a clear risk to the psychological development of minors.

Without prejudice to the obligations that the legal system imposes on parents
with respect to minors, under the provisions of art. 154 of the Civil Code in
Regarding watching over them, educating them and providing them with an integral formation, this does not rob the
responsible for the treatment compliance with the obligations imposed by the
GDPR regarding minors and the risks of these involved in the treatment
of personal data that concerns them.

It should also be mentioned that the parental control applications made available on
the web pages by the company, as it has been verified, are obsolete and the
Most of the links lead to pages that don't exist, and even in the case of
one of the links, this leads to a store selling access packages to
adult content sites.

In this sense, CEPD Guidelines 4/2019 provide for the principle of
loyalty that "The data controllers should not transfer the risks of the
company to interested parties.

The risks to which minors are affected, inherent to their development, must be
be considered by data controllers, and not only by those who
direct services directly and specifically to children, but by all those who
carry out personal data processing aimed at other groups in which the
minors can interact or intervene (in an increasingly technological society) and
see their physical or psychological integrity at risk and their rights and
liberties.

When the service is aimed exclusively at adults, when the
responsible for the treatment limits its treatment to adults, with respect to
services that may pose a risk to minors, then also their
Efforts, derived from their obligations, must be aimed at guaranteeing that only
treat data of adults.

The latter is the case in which we find ourselves, in which the entity asserts
repeatedly in his allegations that the content of the websites is directed
exclusively to adults and that it is mandatory to be of legal age, despite what
established in their privacy policy regarding minors.

When designing a treatment, the data controller determines, among other things
questions, what are the categories of data subjects and the categories of data
personal concerned in the treatment in relation to the purpose pursued by the
same.

The entity decides that the categories of interested parties are limited to those of legal age,
Therefore, it is up to you to implement the technical and organizational measures
appropriate so that the treatment is carried out only with respect to interested parties
adults. This means that it also implements the technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures so that the data of minors are not processed.

In the case at hand, there is a certain risk that minors will access
directly and without limitations to such harmful content for them.

If we observe the limitations or precautions provided in the web pages, these are
clearly insufficient to limit access to minors, both directly through
the web pages (non-registered users) as to register on the web pages
(registered users).

While there are mechanisms in place to “declare” age, none exist to
verify it subsequently, nor any to verify it ab initio, which would constitute
an appropriate measure to avoid the materialization of high risks in the
rights and freedoms of minors who, as we have seen, are present. Amen
that the treatment conforms to what was decided by the person in charge of the treatment
(mandatory to be of legal age) and only data from the categories
of interested parties "of legal age".

In addition, the mechanism to declare the age does not work properly, because except
on one of the web pages, even clicking on the <<No>> option, if you click on
anywhere else on the page, the warning banner disappears and the

As stated in the facts proven when entering the websites for the first time,
a warning banner appears warning that the website
that you are trying to access contains pornographic material and asks for confirmation of

However, if you choose to leave the site, by clicking on the <<No>> option, the
webs return the user to the browser that is being used, but if you click on
anywhere else on the page, the warning banner disappears and the
access to web content.

In addition, Law 13/2022, of July 7, General Communication
Audiovisual, in which article 89 and, as regards what interests us for the purposes
illustrative and in force since July 9, 2022, in relation to the service of
exchange of videos, measures are established for the protection of users and
of minors in front of certain audiovisual content. It is established that “1.
The providers of the video exchange service through the platform, to
protect minors and the general public from audiovisual content
indicated in the previous article, will take the following measures: e) Establish and
operate age verification systems for users with respect to the
content that may harm the physical, mental or moral development of minors
that, in any case, prevent their access to the most
harmful, such as gratuitous violence or pornography” (emphasis added).

And it is that the entity provides a video exchange service through the
web pages, as stated in the terms of use or terms and conditions of the
entity, as registered users add and share videos with other users,
being obliged to establish and operate age verification systems as a measure
to protect minors. And this in the terms of the Agreement of the Commission
National Markets and Competition of 06/16/22.

Well, at this point, the data controller, as part of his
proactive responsibility must meet and demonstrate compliance with the provisions
www.aepd.es
C / Jorge Juan 6
28001 - Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

102/122

of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD, among which are the legitimacy for the
processing of personal data and the adoption of appropriate security measures
to avoid risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

Article 24 of the GDPR establishes that:

“taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as risks of varying probability and severity for
rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and
be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with this Regulation.
These measures will be reviewed and updated when necessary.

This precept does not limit the adoption of security measures to the subjects subject to the
treatment, but rather, focusing on the risk derived from the treatment considering
the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, imposes the adoption of the
precise technical and organizational measures to guarantee that the treatment is
compliant with the GDPR.

In attention to all of the above, the entity must adapt the treatment of your data
personal data to the GDPR, so you must take appropriate security measures
by means of which the age of the users, registered or not, who access the
the web pages of their property, guaranteeing that they are of legal age.

XXIV.- Measures

Article 58.2 of the GDPR establishes the corrective powers available to a
control authority. Section d) of the aforementioned precept establishes that it may consist
in "ordering the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period of time.

Likewise, it is appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) of the
GDPR and order TECHPUMP SOLUTIONS, S.L. that, within a month,

The text of the resolution establishes the facts that determine
the need to adapt to data protection regulations, from which it can be inferred
clearly what are the measures to adopt, notwithstanding that the type of
specific procedures, mechanisms or instruments to implement them

in accordance with the GDPR, which, in any case, will have to be assessed by the person in charge
of the treatment.

XXV.- Corrective powers of the AEPD

In the event that there is an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, among the pos-
corrective rights available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
As control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates:

"2 Each control authority will have all the following corrective powers in-

doubt that, in the case now examined, when the activity of the appellant
is of constant and abundant handling of personal data must
insist on the rigor and the exquisite care to adjust to the preventions
in this regard". Therefore, if we abide by the jurisprudence of the TS,
we could even consider this section as a qualified aggravating circumstance,
The lack of diligence should be verified in this case, with respect to the management
of personal data.

-

The categories of personal data affected by the infringement
(section g), since, at least among registered users, it affects
personal data relating to the sexual life or sexual orientation of a
person. The type of videos that are added and shared, those that are
viewed by other users (with the ability to "like" it) and
add them to those shown in the user's profile, the comments that are
poured in this regard reveal this personal data.

It is also considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following aggravating criteria, established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

-

-

The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatment of
personal data, (section b), considering that in the activity that is
develops on the websites the personal data of the users are involved
this.

The affectation of the rights of minors, (section f), since the
Treatments carried out and improperly projected and designed affect
minors in the terms contained in the privacy policy.

Considering the exposed factors, the valuation that reaches the fine, for the
Violation of article 25 of the GDPR, is 50,000 euros (fifty thousand euros).

XXVII.- About the "Cookies Policy" of the web:

a).- Regarding the installation of cookies in the terminal equipment prior to the consent:

Article 22.2 of the LSSI establishes that users must be provided with information
clear and complete information on the use of storage devices and
data recovery and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing.
This information must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. Therefore,
When the use of a cookie entails a treatment that enables the
identification of the user, those responsible for the treatment must ensure the
compliance with the requirements established by the regulations on the protection of
data.

However, it is necessary to point out that they are exempted from compliance with the
obligations established in article 22.2 of the LSSI those necessary cookies
for the intercommunication of terminals and the network and those that provide a service
expressly requested by the user.
