claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The claim is directed
against VOX ESPAÑA with NIF G86867108 (hereinafter, the claimed).

The reasons on which the claim is based are that an email has been sent without a blind copy
members of that political party.

claim to the claimed entity, requesting that within a month contribute to this
Agency information on the causes that have motivated the incidence that has originated the
claim and the measures taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring.

The respondent answered the request for information on October 10, 2019, stating
the next:

“The reason for sending certain internal information from VOX ESPAÑA to a small number
of affiliates in the town of Segovia, through communication via email without
blind copy of their addresses, it was due to an error on the part of the training staff
politician in charge of this task.
Logically, it was not the intention of VOX ESPAÑA to address the content of the statement with
open copy to the aforementioned email addresses, to which we must add the fact that
its content was devoid of any other type of information or personal circumstance
included that could affect any of the receptors
On the part of VOX ESPAÑA and at the time the error became known,
proceeded to review the protocol and technological systems for sending communications
electronic, verifying that it was correct and appropriate for these purposes - shipments do not
commercials aimed at militants/affiliates-, although the personnel in charge did not review before
of your shipment the correct placement of the addresses in the corresponding box; for the
that the responsible person was informed and the training already received was reiterated,
on certain aspects concerning the processing of personal data and
expressly influencing the protection of those who deserve greater rigor due to their
sensitive character, such as those concerning ideology.”

GDPR.

FOURTH: Once the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure has been notified, the
The respondent filed a pleadings brief in which, in summary, it stated that the
Delegate for data protection of the claimed party, by email dated 8
October 2019, informed the claimant that the facts denounced had been

adopt the security measures adjusted to the effect, to review the protocol of
sending communications, as well as training and awareness of staff

Similar; We must indicate that these are isolated cases to date, so
the one that concerns us now was an isolated event and without any intentionality,
without, on the other hand, any of the holders of the remaining addresses that appear
in the shipment in question has expressed a complaint, claim or even interest in
regarding such circumstance that occurred.”

FIFTH: On December 28, 2019, a resolution proposal was formulated,

the LOPDGDD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

SIXTH: Once the proposed resolution of this sanctioning procedure has been notified,
The respondent filed a pleadings brief stating the following:

“This party considers that the Proposed Resolution violates the PRINCIPLE OF
PROPORTIONALITY that governs the application of Administrative Law
sanctioning

Based on the facts and what was alleged in previous briefs, we consider that applying
the principles of proportionality the sanction should not go beyond the warning
indicated in article 58.2 b) of the RGPD that speaks of: “sanctioning all responsible
or person in charge of treatment with a warning when the treatment operations
have violated the provisions of this Regulation.

The application of administrative sanctions must be carried out based on the intention of the
offender and his degree of guilt, to the persistence or repetition over time of the
infraction, to the damage caused by the infringing conduct and to the recidivism in the
harmful attitudes.

As evidenced in the submitted documentation, the communication without a copy
hidden is due to human error, the VOX Political Party put technical measures to
avoid new errors in communications, communicated with those affected
explaining the situation and the measures, the affected and complainant accept the apologies and
measures adopted by the organization despite showing its disagreement with the
local organization.

The principle of proportionality of administrative sanctions is found
regulated in Art. 29, Law 40/2015, of October 1 and can be defined, according to the

Dictionary of legal Spanish of the RAE and the CGPJ as the "guarantee of legal
administrative penalty that must be understood as enshrined in article 25.1 of the
Spanish Constitution and requires that in the normative determination of the regime
sanctioning as well as in the imposition of the sanction by the Administration is kept
the due adequacy or correspondence between the seriousness of the offense committed and
the intensity of the sanction applied".

The foregoing must be connected with the provisions of article 28 of the
Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, which establishes
as one of the principles of the sanctioning power that of "Responsibility",
determining in this regard in its section 1 that: "They can only be sanctioned by
Acts constituting an administrative offense natural and legal persons, as well as
such as, when a Law recognizes their capacity to act, the affected groups, the
unions and entities without legal personality and independent estates or
self-employed, who are responsible for them by way of fraud or negligence”.

Likewise, the provisions of article 53.2 of Law 39/2015 must be taken into account,
of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public, establishes that: "In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section,
in the case of administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the
presumed responsible, will have the following rights: (...) b) To the presumption of not
existence of administrative responsibility until the contrary is proven.

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Protection Agency
of Data in this procedure the following are considered proven facts,

incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for

those that are processed ("data minimization");
