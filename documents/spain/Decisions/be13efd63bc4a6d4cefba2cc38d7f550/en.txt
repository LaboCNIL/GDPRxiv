The facts denounced are specified in the treatment of the data of

for sending emails through which jobs were offered

The preliminary investigations and actions carried out are related to the offers

candidates contacted the person who had placed the ad, they were asked for CVs, photos of
full body, Skype interview, etc. The events, which occurred between January and June
2018, they also appeared in the press.

In some of the messages (the sender addresses are ***EMAIL.1 and
***EMAIL.2), the person managing the offers used the name of the company
PAGE PERSONNEL SELECCION ESPAÑA, S.A., to which some of the
the candidates of said offers to denounce their sexist content, which
that motivated the representative of the company to file a complaint with the Police and the
facts were investigated in Court of Instruction No. 22 of Madrid, who
later it would be inhibited in favor of the Investigating Court No. 3 of A Coruña.

The RGPD in its article 5, Principles related to data processing

Article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in section 11, states that:
“11) «consent of the interested party»: any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that

that:

"1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)

owner of the same consented to the treatment and display reasonable diligence
essential to accredit this extreme, since not acting in this way the result would be
empty the content of the principle of legality.

emails from different accounts in which he was informed of job offers
allegedly carried out on behalf of the aforementioned company and in which they were asked

etc. These offers made between March and June 2018, also appeared
through advertisements on the internet, specifically on the page ***URL.1, on the social network
Facebook and published in different press media.

The messages sent by the person(s) who managed these offers
used the name of the company PAGE PERSONNEL, to whom they addressed
some candidates to denounce their content, a fact that would motivate the
complaint before the Police being investigated the facts before the Court of
Instruction No. 22 of Madrid, initiating preliminary proceedings, which would enable the
identification of the holder of the IP from which the ads were published on the page
web ***URL.1, resident in A Coruña.

Likewise, it is proven that the company's lawyer, whose name was
fraudulently used in the emails sent to the recipients, presented
complaint at the Salamanca-Madrid district police station, who in turn
addressed an official letter to the Dean of Courts and Instruction requesting an order
to Telefónica, pointing out that in light of the documentation provided and once
requested information from the managers of the website ***URL.1 about the
published announcements and that had been provided along with the complaint by the lawyer
of the company, included the IPs, date and time, from where they originated the
announcements, belonging to the operator Telefónica de España.

The claimant in extensions of the primary complaint was contributing
information on the existence of other accounts from which the
supposed selection process and that, as in the case of the emails sent, in a
certain moment the bidders were required to send photographs, it is insisted
in the sending of these, when it is possible to contact the candidates, it is required
have a video conference conversation and that the language used has sometimes
denotes sexist and demeaning content.

Information was also provided on the existence of the advertisements published
on the XXXXXXX website with content identical to that received by those affected
with references ***REFERENCE.1, ***REFERENCE.2, ***REFERENCE.3 as well as
of others although not offering but demanding employment of content equally
fraudulent together with the corresponding references and that were used by the
judicial police to request from the administrators of the aforementioned website the information
conducting timely investigations to clarify the facts.

From the Court of Instruction No. 22 of Madrid, an Order was issued so that
proceedings will be initiated and a Command will be dispatched in the form addressed to the operator of
telephony service provider on the internet in order to track and facilitate the
identity of the holders of the IPs that were related and from which the
the connections and who made the information available to the authorized agents
obtained.

Well, despite what was stated by the respondent in his writ of
allegations it is clear that in relation to the IP number IP.1, that the connections
existing ones were made from the fixed terminal with numbering ***TELÉFONO.1, to
name of the person claimed, domiciled at Rua ***ADDRESS.1, A CORUÑA, with DNI
….

And as for the IP ***IP.2 that the connections are made from the terminal
mobile, with numbering ***TELEPHONE.2, in the name of the claimed domiciled in the
Rua ***ADDRESS.1, A CORUÑA, with DNI…

The administrators of the web in mail addressed to the Judicial Police of the
Commissioner of the district of Salamanca pointed out that "in XXXXXXX it is not necessary
register to post an ad. It is enough to indicate an email to
post an ad. In addition, we do not verify the data entered by the
advertisers: we are simply a bulletin board and therefore we do not mediate.
In this sense, all the information we have revolves around the
own ads. Below we provide the required data. the indicated time
It is peninsular Spanish”.

  
It should be noted that although the advertisements provided by XXXXXXX coincide
with those received by each of the aforementioned persons, such as
stated in the proven facts, it is also true that the e-mail address that appears
in them, ***EMAIL.8 and ***EMAIL.9, does not coincide with those from which
emails were sent to those affected.

Therefore, although it is possible to establish in light of the documentation provided
in the file the existing link between the advertisements posted in the aforementioned
web page, ***URL.1 with the IP and terminal of the claimed party, it is also true that in
relation to the emails provided by the legal representation at the Police Station
sent to those affected related to the company, Ms. B.B.B., Ms. C.C.C. Y
Ms. D.D.D. from the email accounts that respond to the name of ***EMAIL.1”,
“***EMAIL.2”,
“***EMAIL.6”,
***EMAIL.7 it has not been possible to prove the processing of the data of those affected
materialized in the use of their email addresses to send them
e-mails offering clearly fraudulent management secretary positions and using
sexist and denigrating language by not determining the ownership of the email accounts
from which they were sent or their relationship with the claimed party, therefore
there is a lack of evidence necessary to attribute the violation of the
data protection regulations for illicitly carried out treatments.

 “***EMAIL.5” and

 “***EMAIL.3”,

 “***EMAIL.4”,

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: FILE D. A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an alleged violation of the
aarticle 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.
