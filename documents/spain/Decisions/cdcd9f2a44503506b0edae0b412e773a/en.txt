FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

Competence

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure
Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

Right to data protection

Article 4 of the GDPR, "Definitions", in its sections 1 and 2 states:

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

3/14

“1) «personal data»: any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable (“the data subject”); An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, data of
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of identity
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social of said person;

2) "processing": any operation or set of operations carried out on
personal data or sets of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;” (underlining is
our).

This procedure is initiated because Display published, on the website referred to in
the facts, an expert report in which the name and surname of the minor son of
age of C.C.C. to illustrate a piece of news related to the legal proceedings of the latter.

People have the power to dispose of their personal data, as well as
on its dissemination, resulting, without a doubt, deserving of protection the person
whose personal data is disseminated in violation of the legal system.

Thus, STC 292/2000, of November 30, provides that "the content of the right
Fundamental to data protection consists of a power of disposal and control
on personal data that empowers the person to decide which of those data
provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or which can this third party
collect, and which also allows the individual to know who owns that personal data
and for what, being able to oppose that possession or use. These powers of disposition and
control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the right
fundamental to data protection are legally specified in the power to
consent to the collection, obtaining and access to personal data, its subsequent
storage and treatment, as well as its use or possible uses, by a third party, be it the
state or an individual. And that right to consent to knowledge and treatment,
computerized or not, of personal data, requires as complements
essential, on the one hand, the ability to know at all times who has
these personal data and to what use you are submitting them, and, on the other hand, the power
oppose such possession and uses”.

In this sense, and regardless of the legal basis legitimizing the
treatment, all controllers must respect the principles of
treatment included in article 5 of the GDPR. We will highlight article 5.1.c) of the
GDPR which establishes that:

"1. Personal data will be

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");"

However, we are faced with a fundamental right that is not absolute,
since, if necessary, the Fundamental Right to Data Protection can
give in to the prevalence of other rights and freedoms also constitutionally
recognized and protected, such as, for example, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of
Information, weighing it on a case-by-case basis.

However, in the present case, as we will explain, it must be considered that the
treatment carried out by Display within the framework of freedom of information has
been excessive, as there was no prevailing public interest in informative dissemination of the
name and surname of the minor, information that, added to the fact that he is the son of
a person immersed in a highly mediated legal proceeding, clearly makes
identifiable to the minor. By weighing the conflicting interests and, taking into account
the concurrent circumstances of this case, that is, the situation of special
vulnerability when dealing with a minor and the intense affectation to the privacy of the
affected, the interest of the holder of the right to the protection of
their personal data and that they are not disclosed against the alleged public interest in their
diffusion.

II

Information right

In the struggle between the Fundamental Rights to Freedom of Information in
relation to the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data, even
when an equal degree of protection is recognized for both constitutional rights,
ordinarily the first is usually endowed with prevalence by our courts, after
assess and weigh all the elements at stake.

However, preponderance does not mean prevalence when, after all the
concurrent circumstances in a specific case, the limits set are exceeded
normatively and jurisprudentially.

In this sense, the Article 29 Working Group in its Opinion 06/2014 on the
concept of legitimate interest of the data controller under the
Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, when examining the legal basis of the legitimate interest of the
Article 7.1.f) of Directive 95/46/CE, fully transferable to the current art. 6.1.f) of
GDPR, includes the right to freedom of expression or information as one of the
cases in which the question of legitimate interest may arise, stating that "without
regardless of whether the interests of the data controller will ultimately prevail
term on the interests and rights of the interested parties when the
weighing test”.

IV.

Limits to the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information.

That said, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information is not
absolute. We can observe very clear limits established by the courts in the
civil sphere in relation to the Right to Honor, to Personal and Family Privacy and to

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/14

the Own Image, especially when it comes to minors, under the protection of the
established in article 20.4 of the E.C.

Thus, we will cite, for all, the STC 134/1999, of July 15 (recurso de amparo
209/1996) which provides that “6. Consequently, the legitimate interest of both
minors not to disclose data relating to their personal or family life, such as
happens here, seems to impose an insurmountable limit both to the freedom of
expression art. 20.1 a) E.C. de doña (...) as the fundamental right to communicate
freely truthful information art. 20.1 d) E.C. of the magazine «Soon», which is what
now matters, without the supposed veracity of what has been revealed exonerating the media
communication of responsibility for the interference in the private life of both
minors. In these cases, whether or not the information is true, no matter how inseparable
Be of the judgment on the initial framing of the message in the art. 20.1.d) E.C. to
purposes of determining whether it deserves constitutional protection, it is irrelevant
to establish whether or not there has been an injury to art. 18.1 C.E., since, if the information
transgresses one of its limits (art. 20.4 C.E.), its veracity does not excuse the violation of
another right or constitutional good (SSTC 171 and 172/1990, 197/1991 and 20/1992). As
it is also completely irrelevant that the disclosed data were already in the public domain,
Well, if on that occasion this Court already said that its revelation was its source
Whatever it was, it could be an intrusion into the injurious privacy of art. 18.1 E.C.
(STC 197/1991), it will not be so now to a lesser extent.” (underlining is ours).

We will add the STS, of its First Civil Chamber, 631/2004, of June 28 (rec.
4445/1998), which states that "The requirement to protect the
minors in cases such as the present in which a sensationalist purpose
determines an excessive treatment of a family misfortune of such seriousness
as that of the proceedings, all the more so since the public relevance of the matter is rather relative,
and that the freedom of information corresponds to the purpose of contributing to the
formation of public opinion on matters of general interest. The mention
repeated identification data of the minor, together with his classification as a boy
disobedient and conflictive and the reference to having killed his stepsister, constitutes
an evident excess of information, making identification unnecessary, as
It also occurs with the inclusion of the photograph of the same that appears in the report
although his eyes have been covered with a white stripe. Such form of publication is
totally negative for the moral integrity and formation of minors,
contravening the constitutional requirement of protection of youth and childhood
(art. 20.4), and detrimental to social rehabilitation (...).” (underlining is ours).

As we can see, a clear reference is made to the excessive treatment of
personal data of minors to provide the information,
considering them absolutely unnecessary due to the special protection of which
enjoy in accordance with article 20.4 of the C.E.

SAW

Balance between the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information and the Right

Fundamental to the Protection of Personal Data.

In the specific case examined, as we have indicated, Display published, on the site
website referred to in the facts, an expert report in which the name and surnames can be seen

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

of the minor son of C.C.C. to illustrate a notice regarding the procedure
court of this

Thus, it is not a question of giving prevalence to one fundamental right over another,
having to choose which one has more weight in a specific case. If not, rather
find a balance between the two to achieve the achievement of the purpose of the
first without distorting the second. The reconciliation of both rights is nothing
new, since the European legislator mandates such conciliation in article 85 of the
GDPR.

As we have seen previously, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of
Information is not unlimited, since the jurisprudential interpretation when confronting it
with other rights and freedoms does not allow the same in any case and with all breadth,
but, nevertheless, the prevalence that the courts usually endow it can be seen
limited by other fundamental rights that must also be respected. Thus
observe its limitation when it comes to personal data of minors.

Let us remember, for merely illustrative purposes, that Organic Law 1/1996, of 15
of January, of Legal Protection of the Minor, of partial modification of the Civil Code and
of the Civil Procedure Law, provides special protection for minors in
rights such as Honor, Personal and Family Privacy and Own Image,
prohibiting the dissemination of data or images referring to minors in the
media when it is contrary to their interest.

In this case, the situation of the minor must be considered and what the
dissemination of your name and surname, as well as the special protection that must be provided
the legal system that, without constraining the supply of information, must be done
compatible with the principle of data minimization due to the immediate affectation of the
personal data and the identification of the minor.

Precisely because the obvious informative public interest in the news is not denied,
In this specific case, it is not a question of diminishing the Fundamental Right to
Freedom of Information due to the prevalence of the Fundamental Right to Protection
of Personal Data, but to make them fully compatible so that
both are absolutely guaranteed. That is, there is no question of the
freedom of information from the media but the weighting with the
right to data protection based on proportionality and the need to
publish the specific personal data of the names and surnames of the minor.

The older we have to mean that, although the name and surname of the
parents of the minor affected by being immersed in a
highly mediated judicial procedure, our Constitutional Court affirms, for all
the aforementioned STC 134/1999, of July 15, that "Neither the disclosure of information by
said adoptive parents, which they themselves have recognized as false, nor their being
characters with public notoriety, nor the eventual knowledge and diffusion that this
alluded to information could have had in advance, nor that its source was one
of its protagonists, (...), justify such impairment of art. 18.1 C.E., since
The data disclosed does not only refer to the persons of the adoptive parents or of the
supposed biological mother of one of the minors, but to those events of life
of both minors that we have already described as belonging to their personal privacy and

familiar, and that legitimately should remain sheltered from the curiosity of others while
the aforementioned adopted minors cannot exercise their power of disposal over that
information, in exercise of their rights guaranteed in art. 18.1 E.C. (STC
197/1991).” (underlining is ours).

VII

Every person responsible for the treatment has conferred obligations in terms of
data protection, in the terms prescribed in the GDPR and in the LOPDGDD,
being able to highlight, in terms of what interests us, proactive responsibility,
article 5.2 of the GDPR, the assessment of risks and the implementation of measures
of adequate security. Obligations that are even more relevant when, as in
In the case we are examining, this one is especially sensitive.

Such obligations do not decline because we are before a data controller
that it is a means of communication.

If we combine the dissemination of the name and surname of the minor, which makes him or her
identifiable and can be recognized by third parties, with the fact of being the son of a
person immersed in a highly mediated legal proceeding, there is a very high risk
and very likely that you may suffer damage to your rights and freedoms.

It is tremendously significant that, in the case examined, Display has

VIII

Excess data processing

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to start the disciplinary procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that Display has processed data that was excessive as it was not
necessary for the purpose for which they were processed.

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to Display,
of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, which, if confirmed, could imply the commission of the
infringement typified in article 83.5, section a) of the GDPR, which under the rubric
"General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines" provides that:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount:

consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that "They constitute
offenses the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

Article 72. Offenses considered very serious.

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

Penalty for the infringement

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:

"Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are effective in each individual case,

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to
alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under
of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of

"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission
of the offence.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
violation, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) The affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party.”

In an initial assessment, the graduation criteria are considered concurrent
following:

- Aggravating factors:

- Article 83.2.b) of the GDPR: Intentional or negligent infringement: Yes
Although the Agency considers that there was no intentionality on the part of the means of
communication, the Agency concludes that it was negligent in failing to ensure that all
personal data of the images that he had attached to the news were
duly anonymized, especially because it deals with data of a minor,
where the care that must be taken is greater because it is a vulnerable person.

- Article 72.2.f) of the LOPDGDD: Affectation of the rights of minors,
since the name and surnames treated without having legitimizing cause for it belonged to a
younger.

The amount of the fine that would correspond, without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, is €50,000 (fifty thousand euros).

Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, by the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection,
