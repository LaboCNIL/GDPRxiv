open to the public, mainly booths, and/or individuals who advertise for the
obtaining previous appointments in exchange for different economic amounts and that, in order to
achieve greater profit, saturate the computer platform in such a way that they cause
that users find it very difficult to obtain a free appointment before the
administration and are forced to require their services.

By going to these places, users have been forced to provide their data
personal information, both in writing and by providing a copy of your documentation
identification, to the employees or people who offer this service so that, with
said data, they can book the appointment with the administration, since said
