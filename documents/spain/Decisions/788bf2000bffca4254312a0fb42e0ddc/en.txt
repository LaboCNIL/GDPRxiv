FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation-
General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), recognizes each Authori-
Control Authority, and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures processed by the
Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of the Regulations
to (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, on a subsidiary basis, by
the general rules on administrative procedures.”

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a personal data.
and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2 of the
GDPR defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the reported video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

The relevance in the processing of the data must occur both in the field of
collection of the data as well as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out on them.

For its part, article 22 of the LOPDGDD, whose rubric is "Treatments for
of video surveillance” establishes that:

"1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the purpose of

IV

In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a system
video surveillance, to be in accordance with current regulations, must meet the requirements
following sites:

- Respect the principle of proportionality.

- The video cameras will not be able to capture images of people who are
outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since
the treatment of images in public places can only be carried out, unless
Government authorization concurs, by the Security Forces and Bodies. Either
spaces owned by third parties may be captured or recorded without the consent of
their owners, or, where appropriate, of the people who are in them.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection
of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or inside,
it may be necessary to guarantee the security purpose the recording of a por-
tion of the public road. That is, cameras and video cameras installed for the purpose of
security will not be able to obtain images of public roads unless it is essential
possible for said purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to their location and
Extraordinarily, the minimum space for said purpose will also be collected. By
Therefore, the cameras could exceptionally capture the minimally necessary portion
ary for its intended security purpose.

13 of the RGPD and 22.4 of the LOPDGDD.

security or to the Courts and Tribunals that require it. They may not be used for another
finish.

- The contracting of an external video surveillance service or the installation of the cameras
ras by a third party does not exempt its owner from compliance with the RGPD.

- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a private security company that meets the requirements contemplated
two in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.

In relation to the above, to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the Agencia Es-
Data Protection panola offers through its website [https://www.aepd.es]
access to the legislation on the protection of personal data, including the
RGPD and the LOPDGDD (section “Reports and resolutions” / “regulations”), as well as
the Guide on the use of video cameras for security and other purposes, as well as the
Guide for compliance with the duty to inform (both available in the section
“Guides and tools”).

It is also of interest, in the event of carrying out low-risk data processing, the
facilitates free tool (in the “Guides and tools” section), which through
specific questions, allows to assess the situation of the person in charge with respect to the
treatment of personal data that it carries out, and where appropriate, generate various do-
documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with measures of
guideline security considered minimum.

In the cases in which the video surveillance system captures images in areas or ele-
common elements of a community of owners, in addition to the general requirements
the above, the following should be taken into account:

- The existence of an agreement of the Board of the Owners Community will be necessary.
in the terms established by Law 49/1960, of July 21, on hori-
zontal (henceforth, LPH).

- If cameras are to be installed in the community pool area, the
agreement of the Board of the Community of Owners must specifically authorize di-
many cameras.

- Images of public roads may not be captured except for a minimum strip of
the accesses to the property, nor images of adjoining land and houses or
from any other foreign space.

 - Access to images and recordings will be restricted to people
signed by the community.

 - In no case will they be accessible to the neighbors through a community television channel.

river. From what was observed in these images and what was revealed in the report of
the Labor Inspectorate, there is evidence that the video surveillance system
installed in the sentry boxes, regardless of not having been included (according to
with the aforementioned report) within the chambers subject to the agreed authorization
by the Community of Owners —in the Extraordinary General Meeting of November 19-
November 2019—in compliance with the LPH, it could be violating the principle of
data minimization.

 With regard to the proportionality of the measure, the cameras installed,
even if they do not have audio enabled, they would be capturing some areas that are
They are also enabled as a place of work, as a place of rest where the
workers belonging to the surveillance company can take breaks from the
worked. These cameras would be capturing, therefore, aspects belonging to the
private sphere of the people who work in them, something that is considered inappropriate
portioned by the level of intrusion into privacy that this entails.

On the other hand, although in this case it is not possible to determine clearly because
the photographs are not clearly observed, it is recalled that, according to the article
22.2 of the LOPDGDD can only be captured on public roads in the essential minimum
to guarantee the perimeter and the accesses to the urbanization. abounding in this
question, it is reported that the power to capture images on public roads is attributed
gives, in general, to the Security Forces and Bodies in accordance with the
provided in Organic Law 4/1997, which regulates the use of video cameras
by the Security Forces and Bodies in public places and their rules of de-
development.

part of the interested party can exercise the rights contained in articles 15 to
22 of the GDPR. All of this without prejudice to the fact that the person responsible maintains the rest
of the information available to those affected.

Lastly, it means that the Owners' Communities can agree on the installation
cameras oriented towards the pools in the manner established in the LPH, de-
said chambers being expressly authorized.

In another order of things, it is necessary to point out that article 5 of the RGPD, whose rubric
entitled Principles relating to treatment established in letter f) of its section
1 that personal data will be “processed in such a way as to guarantee security
adequate privacy, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures

written, article 32 of the same law provides that:

access to personal data can only process said data following instructions
of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of Union Law or
member states.”

In relation to adequate compliance with security measures in the field
of the treatments carried out by the video surveillance systems, the person in charge
will be obliged to adopt the necessary technical measures in order to guarantee the
security, confidentiality and unauthorized access to images. The fact that
the president of the Community of Owners has access to the visualization in di-
rectum of images from video surveillance cameras on devices for personal use
could pose a risk to the security and confidentiality of the data.

The employer cannot exercise this right unilaterally, but must
meet a number of requirements. The first of these is the duty to inform everyone

Other aspects that must be taken into account are proportionality and
