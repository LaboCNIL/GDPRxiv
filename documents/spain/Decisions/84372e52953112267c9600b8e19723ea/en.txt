notifying you of several unauthorized transfers made in your name, for
that your bank had to block both access to your bank account and
to your card.

As a result of what happened, he filed the corresponding complaint with the Police and
went to a store of the claimed party to request a new duplicate of his
SIM card and thus recover your line, but they did not provide you with information about who
requested the previous duplicate or through what means or where it was made.

On June 1, 2022, the complaining party provided a response from Telefónica
Mobiles to your claim, returning the XX.XX euros that the store charged you
Movistar for doubling your sim card in order to recover your line.

corresponding invoice, as well as a transcript of the conversation held (at
via chat) with the claimed party, on May 29, 2022, in which a
agent indicates, among others, the following: "For you to request a duplicate Sim
You must go to the store with your ID and pay the amount as you already did". The claimant
indicates that the previous duplicate was made without his consent and the agent adds that
"it must have been some Internet hacker" also indicating that "since
This means I can not check in which store the sim has been modified".

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, for

Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on July 4, 2022 as
It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On August 3, 2022, this Agency received a written response
indicating:

"Prior to the notification of the reference claim, specifically the

produced the change of ICC.

On 05/28/2022, there are requests to remove the restriction on the aforementioned
line, as well as the ICC duplicate requested by the client. In this way, they have
reinforced the different processes, which we will detail in the next point. In relation

with the facts described, this company reports that the facts denounced have already
have been treated and solved prior to the entry of the complaint before the
Agency. In this regard, we inform you that Telefónica has a procedure
consolidated and adequate verification of the identity of our clients that
has sufficient guarantees to identify the applicant for the duplicate of
SIM card before processing it. However, the above
Telefónica works continuously to improve the measures available to it with
the objective of avoiding identity theft in the different processes of
contracting and subsequent procedures requested by the holders of the services through
of the different channels available.

Regarding the amount that you have had to pay for the issuance of a
new SIM card, we inform you that the necessary instructions have been given
to return that amount. 4.

During 2020, the following specific measures have been implemented that
affect the operations of the channels: -Measures adopted in the telephone channel:
Referral to the face-to-face channel of those sensitive operations that recommend a
additional customer identification (for example, Registration, Mobile Portability and
SIM card duplicates). Additionally, the operations are referred to the online channel
modification of personal data such as email and contact telephone number, and a Back
Specialized office for requests for change of ownership and change of means of
contact for movistar.es credentials. -Measures adopted in the channel
face-to-face: Those sensitive operations that advise a
additional identification of the client, and for the purposes of guaranteeing compliance with that
operational, an additional penalty has been established for the entire face-to-face channel
for each procedure carried out and incorrectly documented by a
commercial.

In addition, the weekly publication of a report is being carried out in which
detail, store by store, certain sensitive operations to check if
performs the client identification correctly or not.

  Likewise, the "verification call" for authorized persons has been included, which
consists of making a prior control call to the line on which the
certain sensitive operations, so that the owner client can authorize or
not said operation before its execution. As reinforcement, and in support of the
previous initiatives, training reinforcements have been carried out for the entire sales network,
Doubt sessions, publication of infographics and operational reminders. In that
continuous review and improvement process, generally also in 2020
work has been done on the development of a customer authentication system via OTP
that serves to reinforce the level of identification of our clients. Said system is
is being progressively implemented in the different operations and in the different
channels depending on their criticality. Additionally and from the year 2021
We are working on the development of a digital Onboarding of our clients that

FOURTH: On October 26, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,
pursuant to the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP, for the alleged
infringement of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.
FIFTH: On November 4, 2022, Telefónica Móviles requests the extension
of the legal term granted to formulate allegations, being granted.

SIXTH: Notified the aforementioned start agreement in accordance with the rules established in
the LPACAP, the claimed party submitted a pleading in which, in summary,
manifests, firstly, "prior question of criminal prejudiciality, based on the fact that the
situation described by the complaining party is the consequence of a criminal act
who apparently, with the manifest desire to deceive Telefónica, impersonated
the identity of the claimant, with the ultimate goal of harming the end customer.

In addition, it points out that both the client and Telefónica are harmed in this type of
of situations. Telefónica suffers from it, among others, through the deception that is seen
subjected to our commercials by the impersonators, and in the same way the
client, since he, in addition to "removing the line" to gain control, in
a previous moment, these impersonators must also have the data
bank or financial accounts of the person affected by the fraud.

As the Agency already knows, the detection of this type of practice is done as soon as possible.
possible in the knowledge of the affected distributors so that they can take the necessary measures
appropriate and use extreme precautions.

However, it should be borne in mind that such commercials face action
of the supplanter who, after obtaining a series of personal data, uses
them to promptly process a particular management according to the procedures
established for this in Telefónica.

In order for a conduct to be reproached, it is required that it be typical, unlawful
and guilty, therefore, and once the facts have been analyzed, this party considers that the
principle of typicality is being violated given that the conduct carried out by
Telefónica is not subsumable in any of the precepts whose violation is accused.
We remind you that, in this case, the Agency considers that article 6.1 of the
GDPR (conditions in which the treatment will be considered lawful) and the
infringement typifies it in accordance with article 83.5 GDPR. However, the Agency does not
mention about which of the legitimizing bases that are collected in art. 6.1 would be the
necessary to carry out the treatment of the data of the claimant who has
originated this Agreement, so that it could be understood legitimate. This part
understands that the legal basis that legitimizes the processing of the personal data of the
claimant cannot be other than the performance of the contract, that is, the basis
legitimacy that contemplates section b) of the aforementioned article 6.1: "the treatment is
necessary for the performance of a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the
application at his request of pre-contractual measures”.

In this sense, the Agency has not considered that the treatment is
covered by our Privacy Policy as part of data processing

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/17

personal information that my client performs under the legitimizing basis of
execution of the contract.

Based on the foregoing, we understand that the imputation to my client of a
infringement of article 6.1 of the GDPR, since the processing of such data by
Telefónica is necessary to manage the contractual relationship with the claimant and,
therefore, Telefónica had a sufficient legal basis.

Finally, this party is interested in pointing out that the consideration of the facts that are the object of the
procedure as unlawful supposes the qualification of the same by the result of
the acts of deception, manipulation and illicit use of the data, carried out by the
possible bank fraudster who could have impersonated the claimant's identity,
not for the actions of my client.

Regarding the graduation criteria of the sanction, this part intends to express its
disagreement with the Agreement, when it provides as a circumstance to aggravate the
sanction the following: "The evident link between the business activity of the
claimed and the processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article
83.2.k, of the RGPD in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)”. As to
this aggravating circumstance raised by the Agency, as it has been exposed in the present
In writing, this party considers that there has not been a
illegitimate processing of the claimant's data, whenever their processing is
is legitimized by article 6.1 of the GDPR, I feel this is necessary for the
execution of a contract to which the interested party is a party.

Therefore, to the extent that this party does not consider that there has been a
illegitimate processing of the claimant's data, we cannot likewise consider
that the aggravating circumstance raised by the Agency in the Agreement concurs.

Likewise, it is interesting to highlight the mitigation considered by the Agency, when
indicates that: "The claimed party proceeded to solve the incident object of
claim effectively (art. 83.2 c)”, and we indicate this in the allegations
submitted to the information file of which the present sanction brings cause.

This claim was dealt with prior to the notification of the aforementioned
proceedings.

One of the actions taken by Telefónica before receiving the claim was the
refund made for an amount of €XX.XX for SIM card change.

Telefónica has proceeded to process the data of the claimant with the diligence
due, since the processing of the claimant's data has been carried out
with the sufficient legitimizing base and with the necessary security measures that are
materialize in the identification protocol followed by this part.

The doctrine of own acts already used by the Courts, in summary, accepts the
idea that words and gestures link us, that is, it establishes the
inadmissibility of acting against one's own acts done previously; forbids
that a person can go against his own behavior shown previously

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/17

to limit the rights of another, who had acted in that way moved by the
good faith of the first.

In this sense, it is interesting to highlight that the Agency's actions before a
file referring to facts substantially the same as those that are the object of
claim that concerns us, has been contradictory, as the
own Agency in the file with reference No. EXP202104446 dated 26
January 2022, in which it was filed on the understanding that there had already been
disciplinary proceedings in progress for the same facts, whose literal was the
following: "On this point, it should be noted that facts similar to those that are
object of claim have been investigated by this Agency and penalized in the
disciplinary procedure PS/00021/2021, processed against the claimed party, for
resolution dated 11/8/2021, so the start of a new
disciplinary procedure”. Consequently, the performance discrepancy
between one file and another would mean a clear violation of the doctrine
of their own acts and would create palpable legal uncertainty and, consequently,
would suppose the concurrence of the cause of annulment of the Agreement provided for in the
Article 48.1 of Law 39/2015 of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common for Public Administrations, hereinafter Law 39/2015. Telefónica has already
been penalized for the same facts that are taking place today in this proceeding,
the Agency imposed the sanction through the procedure with reference
PS/00021/2021, and as the Agency knows, currently, the
corresponding appeal before the Courts of Justice.

 The foregoing leads us to consider that initiating a new disciplinary procedure,
successively, without there being a pronouncement by the Courts of
Justice, and on the same facts, violates the non bis in idem principle. How is
Known, the non bis in idem principle prohibits penalizing the same act twice
illicit, since doing so would imply prosecuting and assessing from a legal point of view what
same. In the opinion of this party, this is what the Agency intends in the Agreement,
where it comes to punish "the same": the punishment falls on the same subject, for the
itself and to supposedly protect the same legal right. according to doctrine
consolidated Constitutional Court, the Spanish Constitution prohibits the
Imposition of more than one punishment for the same crime.

For all of the foregoing, I request the Agency, that, considering presenting on time and
form, this brief of allegations, please admit it, and prior to the formalities
opportune, by virtue of: i. The non-existence of responsibility is declared on the part of
Telefónica for the presumed infringements charged against it in this proceeding,
ordering the filing of this disciplinary file. ii. Subsidiarily and for
In the event that this disciplinary file is not filed, the
suspend this procedure and require the claimant to contribute in
what point is the complaint filed, as well as the content of the criminal procedure
that, if applicable, is underway, in order to determine if there is
criminal prejudice. iii. Lastly, if none of the
previous claims, that the penalty initially proposed by virtue of the
art. 83 of the GDPR”.

SEVENTH: On November 22, 2022, the instructor of the procedure agreed
perform the following tests: 1. They are considered reproduced for probative purposes the

claim filed by D. A.A.A. and its documentation, the documents obtained
and generated during the phase of admission to processing of the claim. 2.Also, it
considered reproduced for evidentiary purposes, the allegations to the agreement to start the
referenced sanctioning procedure, presented by TELEFÓNICA MÓVILES
ESPAÑA, S.A.U., and the accompanying documentation.

EIGHTH: On January 24, 2023, the proposed resolution was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
sanctions the defendant, for a violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in the
Article 83.5 of the GDPR, with a fine of 70,000 euros.

EIGHTH: Notified of the resolution proposal, on February 1, 2023, requested
Extension of term to formulate allegations, being granted.

The claimed party submitted a written statement confirming those made to the
Initiation Agreement, requesting that this procedure be suspended and that the
claimant in order to provide at what point is the complaint filed, as well as the
content of the criminal procedure that, if applicable, is underway, in order to
to determine if there is criminal prejudiciality, propose a declaration of non-existence of
responsibility on the part of the defendant for the presumed infringement that is imputed to him in
this procedure, and that a Resolution be issued in due course ordering the filing of the
present disciplinary file to the referenced margin, and secondarily, minore
the initially proposed sanction of art. 83 of the GDPR.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the documentation
in the file, the following have been accredited:

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

Criminal prejudice

Beforehand, it is necessary to resolve the allegation presented by Telefónica, based on
to the existence of a criminal prejudiciality.

It manifests itself on these facts that are currently being the subject of a
criminal investigation. Considers that, therefore, in application of the principle of
criminal prejudiciality included in article 10 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary,
The matter should not be resolved through administrative channels as long as it is not resolved
through criminal proceedings. This, he manifests, given that the facts declared proven will link
to the Agency regarding a possible disciplinary procedure, in accordance with the provisions
in article 77.4 of Law 39/2015.

It should be noted that art. 77.4 of the LPACAP, states that: "In the
procedures of a sanctioning nature, the facts declared proven by
Firm criminal judicial resolutions will bind the Public Administrations
regarding the sanctioning procedures that substantiate”. However, there is
It should be noted that there is no triple identity necessary to apply article 77 of the
LPACAP, (of subject, fact and foundation), between the administrative infraction that
assesses and the possible criminal infraction or infractions that could be derived from the
presumed Preliminary Proceedings carried out by a court. This, because the
offending subject it is obvious that it would not be the same -with respect to the infractions of the
LOPDGDD, the person responsible is Telefónica, while the criminal person responsible for a
eventual crime of usurpation of personality or fraud would be the third that would have been
impersonated the claimant. Nor would the legal basis be the same:
while the legal right protected by the LOPDGDD is the fundamental right to
protection of personal data, the legal right that is protected in criminal types

28001 – Madrid

9/17

whose commission would investigate, if necessary, the Investigating Court would be the state
civil, property, etc.

In this sense, the Judgment of the National Court of
04/27/2012 (rec. 78/2010), in whose second Legal Basis the Court
pronounces in the following terms regarding the allegation of the appellant that the AEPD
has infringed article 7 of R.D. 1398/1993 (rule that was in force until the
entry into force of the LPACAP): "In this sense, Art. 7 of Royal Decree
1398/1993, of August 4, on the procedure for the exercise of power
disciplinary action, only provides for the suspension of the administrative procedure
when the effective and real existence of a criminal proceeding is verified, if
considers that identity of subject, fact and legal basis concurs between the
administrative offense and the criminal offense that may correspond.

However, and for the concurrence of a criminal prejudicial action, it is required that this
directly conditions the decision to be taken or that is essential
to resolve, presuppositions that do not concur in the examined case, in which there is
a separation between the facts for which it is sanctioned in the resolution now
appealed and those that the appellant invokes as possible criminal offences. So, and even
have been initiated, in the present case, and due to the facts now in dispute,
also criminal proceedings against the distribution company, the truth is that both the
sanctioning conduct as well as the protected legal right are different in one way and another
(contentious-administrative and criminal). In criminal matters, the protected legal right is
a possible documentary falsification and fraud, and in the administrative sphere, on the other hand, the
power of disposal of your personal data by its owner, so that such
Respondent's objection must be rejected.

In consideration of the foregoing, the issue raised by
Telephone and should be rejected.

II

Breached Obligation

In advance, it is necessary to point out that article 4.1 of the GDPR defines:
“personal data” as “any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable (“the data subject”); An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, data of
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of identity
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

Issuing a duplicate SIM card entails data processing
personal data of its owner since any person will be considered an identifiable natural person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
an identifier (article 4.1) of the GDPR).

Therefore, the SIM card identifies a telephone number and this number in turn,
identifies its owner. In this sense, the CJEU Judgment in case C -
101/2001 (Lindqvist) of 6.11.2003, paragraph 24, Rec. 2003 p. I-12971: "The concept of
"personal data" using Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46
includes, according to the definition in Article 2(a) of said
www.aepd.es
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/17

Directive "all information about an identified or identifiable natural person". This
concept includes, without a doubt, the name of a person next to his telephone number or
to other information relating to their working conditions or hobbies”.

In short, both the data processed to issue a duplicate SIM card and the
SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) that uniquely identifies
to the subscriber in the network, are personal data, and their treatment must be
subject
to data protection regulations.

Well then, the defendant is accused of committing an offense for violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR, "Legacy of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.
application to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions”.

In turn, article 6.1 of the LOPDGDD, indicates, on the treatment of data
based on the consent of the affected party that: “1. In accordance with
provided in article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is understood by
consent of the affected any manifestation of free, specific,
informed and unequivocal by which he accepts, either by means of a declaration or
a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him (…)”.

Classification of the infringement of article 6 of the GDPR

IV.

11/17

  The violation of article 6 for which the party claimed in the
This resolution is typified in article 83 of the GDPR which, under the
heading “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines”.
"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The LOPDGD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

In this case, it is proven that Telefónica Móviles provided a duplicate of
the SIM card of the complaining party to a third party, without their consent and without verifying
the identity of said third party, which has accessed information contained in the
mobile phone, such as bank details, passwords, email address
email and other personal data associated with the terminal. Thus, the defendant, not
verified the personality of the person who requested the duplicate SIM card, did not take the
necessary precautions so that these events do not occur.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, the
diligence used by the defendant to identify the person who requested
a duplicate SIM card.

In its response, the Respondent acknowledges that the fraudulent duplication occurred
in a physical establishment, but does not provide any evidence of how the
applicant's identity.

Well then, the result was that the defendant issued the SIM card to a third party who did not
he was the owner of the line.

In the explanation provided by the claimed party, it does not indicate which could have
been the specific cause that led to the issuance of the duplicate, beyond
some generic explanations. In any case, Telefónica Móviles has not been able to
certify that for this case the procedure implemented by it was followed
itself, since, if it had done so, the denial of the
duplicate SIM card.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, the
diligence used by the defendant to identify the person who requested
a duplicate SIM card.

Telefónica cites in its defense a series of resolutions issued by the AEPD,
stating that EXP20210446 was filed on the understanding that
there was already a disciplinary file in progress for the same events and that Telefónica
www.aepd.es
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

12/17

has already been sanctioned for the same events that are taking place today in this
procedure, the Agency imposed the sanction through the procedure with reference
PS/00021/2021 and therefore violates the non bis idem principle.

In this regard, it should be noted that said procedures were intended to
analyze the procedures followed to manage SIM change requests
by Telefónica, identifying the vulnerabilities that may exist in the
operating procedures implemented, to detect the causes for which
may be producing these cases, as well as finding points of non-compliance,
improvement or adjustment, to determine responsibilities, reduce risks and raise the
security in the processing of the personal data of the affected persons.

The disciplinary procedure PS/00021/2021, processed against the claimed party, was
accused him of the violation of article 5.1f), he is not charged with fraud, nor the treatment of
data without legitimacy but a lack of guarantees of the security measures that
produces a transfer of data to a third party.

In this disciplinary proceeding, the sanction is imposed because
Telefónica provided a duplicate of the complaining party's SIM card to a third party,
without your consent and without verifying the identity of said third party, and for this reason
imputes article 6.1 of the GDPR.

Regarding the responsibility of Telefónica, it should be noted that, in general
Telefónica processes the data of its customers under the provisions of article 6.1 b)
of the GDPR, as it is considered a necessary treatment for the execution of a contract
in which the interested party is a party or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual In other cases, it bases the legality of the treatment on the bases
provided for in article 6.1.a), c), e) and f) of the GDPR.

On the other hand, to complete the scam, it is necessary for a third party to "impersonate the
identity” of the owner of the data, to receive the duplicate of the SIM card. Which
entails a priori, a treatment outside the principle of legality since a third party is
processing data, since it has access to them, without any legal basis, in addition to the
violation of other principles such as confidentiality.

For this reason, this is a process where the diligence provided by the
operators is essential to avoid this type of scam and violation of the GDPR.
Diligence that translates into the establishment of adequate measures to guarantee
that appropriate security measures are implemented and maintained to protect
effectively maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data
personnel for which they are responsible, or of those who are in charge of
another responsible.

The Constitutional Court indicated in its Judgment 94/1998, of May 4, that we
We are faced with a fundamental right to data protection by which
guarantees the person control over their data, any personal data, and
about their use and destination, to avoid illegal traffic of the same or harmful to the
dignity and rights of those affected; In this way, the right to protection of
data is configured as a faculty of the citizen to oppose that

its obtaining.

For its part, in Judgment 292/2000, of November 30, it considers it as a
autonomous and independent right that consists of a power of disposition and
control over personal data that empowers the person to decide which of those
data to provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or which can this
third party to collect, and which also allows the individual to know who owns that data
personal and for what, being able to oppose that possession or use.

Regarding the conduct of Telefónica, it is considered that it responds to the title of guilt.
As a repository of personal data on a large scale, therefore, accustomed
or dedicated specifically to the management of the personal data of the
customers, you must be especially diligent and careful in your treatment. That is to say,
From the point of view of guilt, we are facing a winnable error, since, with the
application of appropriate technical and organizational measures, these impersonations
of identity could have been avoided.
 
It is recital 74 of the GDPR that says: "The
responsibility of the data controller for any data processing
personal data made by himself or on his own. In particular, the controller must
be obliged to apply timely and effective measures and must be able to demonstrate the
compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the
effectiveness of the measures. Such measures should take into account the nature,
scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons. Likewise, recital 79 says: The protection
of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties, as well as the responsibility of the
controllers and processors, also with regard to the
supervision by the control authorities and the measures adopted by
they require a clear attribution of responsibilities under this
Regulations, including cases in which a controller determines the purposes and
means of processing jointly with other controllers, or in which the
treatment is carried out on behalf of a person in charge”.

Based on the available evidence, it is estimated that the conduct
of the claimed party violates article 6.1 of the RGPD being constitutive of the
infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

"(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, either in this Regulation or under other Union law
or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."
