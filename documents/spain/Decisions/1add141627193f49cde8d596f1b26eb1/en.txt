FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

In relation to the arguments presented to the resolution proposal, the
THE CITY HALL insists again on the fact that there was no lack of diligence
for its part in the resolution of the security breach, but rather that this was due to the
albur that the public employees filed a claim with the AEPD instead of

security occurred. Thus, it considers that this negligent action of the employees
which caused a late action by the City Council.
However, the claimant did not act in his capacity as a public employee linked
by a statutory relationship to the City Council and, therefore, obliged to communicate the
incidence within the framework of its statutory duties, but acted as an interested party,
affected by the security breach, having all the legitimacy to
claim directly from the AEPD, as permitted by law.

The CITY COUNCIL is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation of the
Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, article 32 GDPR and article 33 GDPR.

III

Article 5.1.f) RGPD states that:

"1. The personal data will be:
(…)

f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and
confidentiality”).”

The aforementioned infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD could lead to the commission of the
offenses typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the heading "Conditions
rules for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of EUR 20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infringements" establishes that:

“The acts and behaviors referred to in the regulations constitute infractions.
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as the
that are contrary to this organic law.

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, article 72 “Infringements considered
very serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the
infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the articles
mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

Given that it has been shown throughout the instruction of the procedure, that the
data of 126 public employees have been unduly exposed, due to the
publication of the Minutes of the Governing Board dated 10/21/2020 in the BOP, data
that should not be accessible to third parties by virtue of the provisions of article 70
of Law 7/1995 of April 2, regulating the Bases of Local Regime, in relation
with article 18 of Law 40/2015 of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public, the infringement of the aforementioned article 5.1.f) of the RGPD is accredited.

4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to guarantee that
any person acting under the authority of the person in charge or the person in charge and
has access to personal data can only process said data following
instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Right of
the Union or the Member States.

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD could lead to the commission of the infractions
typified in article 83.4 of the RGPD that under the heading "General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,

global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infringements" establishes that
“The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 73 “Infringements considered serious”
of the LOPDGDD indicates:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

are appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk
of the treatment, in the terms required by article 32.1 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.
(…)

The fact that the personal data of public employees were published in the
BOP without having previously proceeded to its anonymization, indicates that the
City Council did not have the appropriate organizational and technical measures, so
that the infringement of the aforementioned article 32 of the RGPD is considered to have been committed. The
The City Council affirms that the security breach occurred as a result of an error
human. Well, appropriate organizational and technical security measures have
to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk considering, at all points,
all the risks present in the processing of personal data. So the mistake
