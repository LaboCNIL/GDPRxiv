that a qualified certificate is issued.
The information referred to in the first paragraph will be verified by the
trusted service provider either directly or through
of a third party in accordance with national law:
a) in the presence of the natural person or an authorized representative of
the legal person, or
b) remotely, using means of electronic identification, for
which the presence of the natural person or of a
authorized representative of the legal entity prior to the
issuance of the qualified certificate, and that they meet the requirements
established with article 8 with respect to security levels
“substantial” or “high”, or
c) by means of a certificate of a qualified electronic signature or
a qualified electronic seal issued in accordance with letter a) or
b), or
d) using other widely recognized identification methods
that provide equivalent security in terms of reliability
to physical presence. Equivalent security will be confirmed by a
conformity assessment body.

Likewise, it is based on the provision contained in section 2 of the
Article 7 of Law 6/2020, of November 11, regulating certain
aspects of electronic trust services, which by regulating the
Verification of the identity and other circumstances of applicants for a
qualified certificate, provides the following:

On the other hand, as antecedents of said regulation, it manifests itself in

«6. By Order of the person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
and Digital Transformation will determine the conditions and requirements
techniques applicable to identity verification and, if applicable, other
specific attributes of the person requesting a certificate
qualified, through other methods of identification that provide a
security equivalent in terms of reliability to physical presence.”

This text corresponds to the one contained in article 7.2. of
text of the "Draft Bill on certain aspects of services
electronic trust" that was reported by this Agency on February 7
of 2018 (Report 283/2017), with the only difference being the elevation of the range
of the provision that should be approved:

“By resolution of the Secretary of State for the Society of the
Information and the Digital Agenda will determine the conditions and
requirements applicable to verification of identity and, if applicable, other
specific attributes of the person requesting a certificate

However, the final text of Law 6/2020, following the
precedent of Royal Decree Law 11/2020, proceeds to identify some of the
means through which such identification may be made, when referring to
expressly to the videoconference or video-identification, thus converting

regarding the training of the operator in charge of verifying the

The need to respect, in any case, the regulations on protection

referring to the regulations in force at the time of its approval, indicating in
its Recital 11 that “This Regulation must be applied in such a way that

will be in accordance with the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC” and
containing numerous references to this regulation throughout its

personal data protection:

1. The processing of personal data required by providers

reference to its observance in the preamble, as well as an article
specific, proposing the following wording:

Article XX. Personal data protection:

“The processing of personal data of natural persons
will be carried out strictly subject to the provisions of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council, of April 27, 2016,
on the protection of natural persons with regard to
treatment of your personal data and the free circulation of these
data and in the rest of the regulations on data protection
personal”.

However, the mere inclusion of said precept is not considered
sufficient for the purpose of adequately guaranteeing the fundamental right to
the protection of personal data, taking into account the principle of
proactive liability introduced by the General Protection Regulation
of data (GDPR) and the constitutional doctrine regarding the limitations of the
fundamental right to data protection, as analyzed below.
continuation.

II

At the present time, in terms of data protection
personal concerns, the regulations to which the preliminary project must comply
submitted for consultation is Regulation (EU) 2016/679, already cited (GDPR) and the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD).

In this regard, it must be taken into account that the RGPD has meant a
paradigm shift when addressing the regulation of the right to protection of
personal data, which is based on the principle of “accountability”
or "proactive responsibility" as the AEPD has repeatedly pointed out
(Report 17/2019, among many others) and is included in the Explanatory Memorandum
of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD): “the greatest
novelty presented by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is the evolution of a
model based, fundamentally, on the control of compliance with another that
rests on the principle of active responsibility, which requires prior
assessment by the person in charge or by the person in charge of the treatment of the risk that
could generate the processing of personal data for, from
of said assessment, adopt the appropriate measures”. Inside this new
system, it is the data controller who, through the instruments
regulated in the RGPD itself, such as the registration of treatment activities, the
risk analysis or data protection impact assessment

                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

personal, must guarantee the protection of said right through the
compliance with all the principles contained in article 5.1 of the RGPD,
adequately documenting all the decisions it adopts for the purpose of
be able to prove it.

Likewise, based on said principle of proactive responsibility,
essentially addressed to the data controller, and in order to reinforce the
protection of those affected, the RGPD has introduced new obligations
required not only to the person in charge, but in certain cases, also to the
in charge of the treatment, who may be sanctioned in case of
non-compliance with them.
 

Therefore, being the main recipients of the obligations
collected in the RGPD those responsible and in charge, however, their
observance implies the need to adopt certain behaviors by
part of the national legislator, in order to guarantee compliance with the GDPR
and, ultimately, the adoption of sufficient guarantees for the protection of the
fundamental right, especially when it comes to data processing
legitimized personal as a result of the fulfillment of obligations
legal or for the fulfillment of a mission of public interest or the exercise of
public powers.

In this regard, it should be remembered, as indicated in our
Report 283/2017, that the processing of personal data necessary to
verify the identity and circumstances of the certificate applicants
will be legitimized by article 6.1 c) of the General Regulations of
Data Protection, which enables treatment based on a legal obligation
imposed by domestic or European Union law.

In these cases, the RGPD contains specific provisions to the
respect, starting with those provided for in its own article 6, paragraphs 2 and
3:

2. Member States may maintain or introduce provisions
more specific in order to adapt the application of the rules of the
this Regulation with respect to the treatment in compliance with the
section 1, letters c) and e), establishing more precise requirements
specific treatment and other measures that guarantee a
lawful and equitable treatment, including other situations
specific treatment under chapter IX.
3. The basis of the treatment indicated in section 1, letters c) and e),
must be established by:

a) Union law, or
b) the law of the Member States that applies to the
responsible for the treatment.

The purpose of the treatment must be determined on said basis.

e), will be necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the
responsible for the treatment. Said legal basis may contain
specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of the
this Regulation, among others: the general conditions that govern the
legality of the treatment by the person in charge; object data types
of treatment; affected stakeholders; the entities to which
may communicate personal data and the purposes of such communication; the
purpose limitation; the terms of conservation of the data, as well
such as operations and treatment procedures, including
measures to ensure fair and lawful treatment, such as
relating to other specific situations of treatment under the
chapter IX. The law of the Union or of the Member States shall comply
an objective of public interest and will be proportional to the legitimate purpose
pursued.

Likewise, article 4, after defining in section 7 the
“responsible for the treatment” or “responsible” as “the natural person or
legal entity, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others,
determine the purposes and means of the treatment” adds that “if the Law of the
Union or of the Member States determines the purposes and means of the treatment,
the data controller or the specific criteria for their appointment
may be established by the Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

On the other hand, article 35 regulates the impact assessment related to the
data protection (EIPD), noting that "When it is likely that a type
of treatment, in particular if it uses new technologies, by its nature,
scope, context or purposes, entails a high risk for the rights and freedoms
of natural persons, the person in charge of the treatment will carry out, before the
processing, an assessment of the impact of processing operations on
the protection of personal data. A single evaluation may address a
series of similar processing operations involving high risks
Similar". However, said precept provides that the EIPD has been carried out
previously by the legislator in section 10:

10. When the treatment in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1,
letters c) or e), has its legal basis in the Law of the Union or in the
Law of the Member State that applies to the person responsible for the
treatment, such Law regulates the specific operation of treatment or
set of operations in question, and a
impact assessment relating to data protection as part of
an overall impact assessment in the context of the adoption of
said legal basis, sections 1 to 7 will not apply except if
Member States consider it necessary to carry out such an assessment
prior to treatment activities.

On the other hand, it should also be taken into account that, in the event that
the obligation is imposed by a rule of domestic law, the same
must have the status of law, as required by article 53.1 of the Constitution, as
as expressly stated in article 8.1 of the LOPDGDD, adding that
“will be able to determine the general conditions of the treatment and the types of
data object of the same, as well as the transfers that proceed as
consequence of the fulfillment of the legal obligation. This rule may
also impose special conditions to the treatment, such as the
adoption of additional security measures or others established in the
Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) 2016/679” and the
constitutional doctrine collected, fundamentally, in the judgments
292/2000 of November 30 and 76/2019 of May 22, according to which the
Limits to the fundamental right to the protection of personal data must be
be established by a standard with the force of law, prior weighting by the
legislator of the interests in conflict according to the principle of
proportionality, defining each and every one of the material budgets
of the limiting measure by means of precise rules, which make the
concerned the imposition of such limitation and its consequences, and establishing
adequate guarantees, being the law itself the one that will have to contain the
adequate guarantees against the collection of personal data that you authorize.
The Constitutional Court (TC) has been clear that the forecast of the
adequate guarantees cannot be deferred to a time after the
legal regulation of the processing of personal data in question. The
Adequate guarantees must be incorporated into the legal regulation of the
treatment, either directly or by express referral and perfectly
limited to external sources that have the appropriate regulatory status. Only
that understanding is compatible with the double requirement that stems from the
article 53.1 EC (...). It is evident that, if the rule included a reference to
the integration of the law with the adequate guarantees established in rules of
lower rank than the law, it would be considered as a delegalization that
sacrifices the reserve of law ex article 53.1 CE, and, for this reason alone, it should
be declared unconstitutional and invalid. (...). It is, in short, about “guarantees
adequate technical, organizational and procedural nature, which prevent
risks of different probability and severity and mitigate their effects, since only
In this way, respect for the essential content of the right itself can be ensured.
fundamental". Nor does it serve for this reason that for the establishment of said
adequate and specific guarantees the law refers to the RGPD itself or to the
LOPDGDD.
 

In addition, said law must respect in all cases the principle of
proportionality, as recalled by the ruling of the Constitutional Court
14/2003, of January 28:

In other words, in accordance with a settled doctrine of this
Court, the constitutionality of any restrictive measure of
fundamental rights is determined by the strict observance
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

of the principle of proportionality. For the purposes that matter here, enough
to remember that, in order to check whether a restrictive measure of a
fundamental right exceeds the judgment of proportionality, it is necessary
verify if it meets the following three requirements or conditions: if the
measure is capable of achieving the proposed objective (judgment of
suitability); if, in addition, it is necessary, in the sense that there is no other
more moderate measure to achieve such purpose with equal
effectiveness (judgment of necessity); and, finally, if it is weighted or
balanced, because more benefits or advantages are derived from it for the
general interest that harms other goods or values in conflict
(judgment of proportionality in the strict sense; SSTC 66/1995, of 8
May [RTC 1995, 66], F. 5; 55/1996, of March 28 [RTC 1996, 55]
, FF. 7, 8 and 9; 270/1996, of December 16 [RTC 1996, 270], F. 4.e;
37/1998, of February 17 [RTC 1998, 37], F. 8; 186/2000, of 10 of
July [RTC 2000, 186], F. 6).”

The same doctrine maintains the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU). Thus, if art. 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights
recognizes the right of every person to the protection of personal data
personnel that concern him, art. 52.1 recognizes that this right is not
unlimited and allows the limitation of the exercise of those rights and freedoms
recognized by the Charter, a limitation that must be established by law and
respect their essential content.

Well, the STJUE of October 6, 2020, in the accumulated cases
C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, La Quadrature du Net and others, (not available
still to this date in Spanish), in section 175, recalls that:

With regard to the justification for such interference, the requirement,
established in Article 52(1) of the Charter, that any limitation on the
exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that
the legal basis which permits that interference with those rights must
itself defines the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right
concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 July 2020, Facebook
Ireland and Schrems, C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph 175 and the
case-law cited).

Likewise, section 65 of the Judgment (STJUE) of the same date 6
October 2020 (C-623/17), Privacy International v. Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and others, citing, as above, the
Schrems 2 sentence, says:

It should be added that the requirement that any limitation on the exercise of
fundamental rights should be established by law implies that the
legal basis that allows the interference in said rights must define it
                                                                                                                                                             www.aepd.es

try (judgment of July 16, 2020, Facebook Ireland and Schrems,
C-311/18, EU:C:2020:559, paragraph 175 and cited case law).

In short, section 175 of the STJUE of July 16, 2020, C-
311/2020, Schrems 2, says: It should be added, on this last aspect, that the
requirement that any limitation on the exercise of rights
must be established by law implies that the legal basis that
allows interference in said rights, it must itself define the scope of
the limitation of the exercise of the right in question [opinion 1/15 (Agreement
EU-Canada PNR), dated July 26, 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph 139 and
case law cited].

It is therefore the same law that establishes the interference in the right
the fundamental one that has to determine the conditions and guarantees, that is, the
scope and limitation, which must be observed in said treatments,

And in said STJUE of July 16, 2020, Schrems 2, it is added (and

subsequently reiterates in the aforementioned judgments of October 6, 2020):

176 Finally, to meet the proportionality requirement under the
which exceptions to the protection of personal data and the
limitations of that protection must not exceed what is strictly
necessary, the controversial legislation that entails the interference must
establish clear and precise rules governing the scope and
application of the measure in question and impose certain requirements
minimum, so that the persons whose data have been transferred
have sufficient guarantees to protect
effective your personal data against the risks of abuse. In
particular, said regulations must indicate in what circumstances and with
Under what requirements can a measure be adopted that provides for the
processing of such data, thus guaranteeing that the interference is limited to
what is strictly necessary. The need to have such guarantees
is of particular importance when the personal data is subjected to
automated processing [see, in this regard, opinion 1/15
(EU-Canada PNR Agreement), July 26, 2017, EU:C:2017:592,
sections 140 and 141 and cited case law).

The STJUE of October 6, 2020, in case C-623/17, adds the

mention of special categories of data:

at stake the protection of that particular category of data

Analyzing the articulated text from the perspective of protection

of personal data, it is interesting to highlight the following:

In the first place, the legality of the treatment of the character data
personnel will require the existence of a legal basis that legitimizes the
treatment, taking into account that the RGPD, unlike what
occurred in the previous regulations, has placed all the legal bases standing
of equality, so that consent is collected as one of the six
causes of legitimation for the treatment without showing greater or lesser
importance than the rest regulating, even, assumptions in which the
The consent of the affected party should not constitute the legal basis of the treatment.
As the AEPD has been pointing out since its report 65/2017, the RGPD has
displaced the "principle of consent" as the central axis of the right to
data protection, so "it can no longer be said that there is
exceptions to consent, but, since consent is one of the
possible legitimate bases of the treatment will not proceed to collect it in the
assumptions in which the treatment is covered by any of the
the remaining causes causes included in article 6.1 of the general regulation
of data protection”.

In the present case, the legal basis that legitimizes the treatment, as
As stated above, it is the one provided for in letter c) of article 6.

treatment, in accordance with article 9.2. of the RGPD and article 9 of the LOPDGDD.
For these purposes, the order refers to its article 9.8. to the "comparison

biometrics aimed at the unique identification of the person. To this
In this regard, there is no legal norm that protects said treatment by the
existence of an essential public interest, with the requirements and guarantees
mentioned above, said treatment could only be based on what
provided for in letter a) of article 9.2. of the RGPD: “the interested party gave his
explicit consent for the processing of said personal data with
one or more of the specified purposes, except when Union Law or
of the Member States establishes that the prohibition mentioned in the
section 1 cannot be raised by the interested party”, not finding the
treatment of said biometric data between the cases in which the article
9.1 of the LOPDGDD provides that the sole consent of the affected party does not
suffice to lift the ban on data processing. However, the
consent must comply, in any case, with the requirements contained in
the RGPD itself, which defines consent in its article 4.11 as "all
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which
the interested party accepts, either by means of a declaration or a clear action
affirmative, the treatment of personal data that concerns you”,
requiring, in addition, in this case, as indicated in article 9.2.a) that the
itself be explicit. Also, special consideration should be given, as
as indicated in our report 36/2020, that consent must be
free, pointing out Recital 42 of the RGPD that "Consent must not
be considered freely provided when the interested party does not enjoy true or
free choice or you cannot withhold or withdraw your consent without prejudice
any", for which reason, in any case, other forms of
identification through the use of other technologies, which do not require the
processing of biometric data, in order to guarantee freedom of choice

likewise, guarantee other alternative forms of identification that do not
entail such reinforced interference in the fundamental right to
protection of personal data that implies the recording and conservation
your image and your biometric data. And, in the event that it is intended

the appropriate guarantees, in accordance with article 9.2.g) of the RGPD: “the

2. The data controller will be responsible for compliance with
the provisions of section 1 and capable of demonstrating it ("responsibility

For these purposes, it must be included, within the information to which
refers to article 9 of the order, in its section 1 ("The
applicant, in a clear and understandable manner, of the terms and
conditions of the process of remote identification by video, as well as of
the applicable safety recommendations”) that provided for in the
personal data protection regulations, in the terms indicated
in article 13 of the RGPD, being able to provide said information “by
layers”, under article 11 of the LOPDGDD.

Likewise, special attention must be paid to the principles of limitation
of the purpose and minimization of data as manifestations of the principle
of proportionality, analyzing whether the data to be processed are strictly the
necessary for the intended purpose and if there are no other alternatives
Less burdensome personal data processing for the affected party. TO
these effects, it must be assumed that the order develops article 7.2 of the Law
6/2020, as expressly stated in its article 1, which refers to other
identification methods other than physical presence, among which he cites the
videoconference or video-identification but without excluding others, while the
order is limited exclusively to them, so the first thing that
should be assessed is whether there are also no other alternative means,
that may even be less invasive, such as through
remote verification of the information contained in the certificate itself
of the DNI or identification by a trusted third party.

On the other hand, within the modalities of remote identification by
video, article 3 of the order states that "The process of remote identification
by video can be carried out in an assisted manner, with the synchronous mediation of a
operator, or unassisted, without the need for online interaction between a
operator and the applicant, with subsequent review by an operator. Therefore, it
admits a non-assisted modality, much more invasive and that will
necessarily require the recording of the images (as
generally established in article 11 of the order), which would require
a specific assessment regarding, in the first place, the need for said
treatment from the point of view of its proportionality, and in the case
that it is deemed necessary, the adoption of reinforced guarantees
from the point of view of personal data protection.

Decision 2016/1250 of the European Commission referring to transfers to
United States (Privacy Shield).

Regarding the requirements for verifying the identity of the
applicant and the identity document, section 4 establishes the measures
mandatory that must be implemented to detect a possible manipulation of
the video image, of the identity document or of the applicant, among which
there is an obligation to have the affected person with a mobile device
(the risks that this implies for their rights and interests must be assessed)
carry out said treatment compulsorily through a mobile device,
adopting the appropriate guarantees) in which a code must be entered
unique, and the provider must verify "that the mobile device to which it is
sends the code is in the possession of the user” adding that “The
supervisory body may make a platform available to providers
technological verification of the association of the user with the device
mobile".

The aforementioned precept raises a series of questions from the
of view of the protection of personal data, in addition to the outlined
regarding the incidence of having to compulsorily carry out the
treatment through a mobile device, which would require including the
vulnerabilities introduced by the mobile in risk management and EIPD
timely: on the one hand, as the platform is optional, it must be valued and
analyze how else this obligation can be fulfilled
of verification, in order to propose the appropriate guarantees. And on the other,

For these purposes, it should be noted that data processing
that may be currently being carried out for the
Non-face-to-face identification of people require, in accordance with the principle
of proactive responsibility, that the respective managers have
adopted and documented all the necessary measures to guarantee the
compliance with the personal data protection regulations, through the
timely risk analysis, EIPD, etc., identifying the legal bases that
legitimize the treatment and adopting all the necessary guarantees in accordance
with the principle of data protection by default and from the design, being,
therefore, any breach of said regulations of its exclusive
responsibility.

However, at the moment in which one proceeds by a norm
law to regulate said treatments, they will be obliged to
apply this rule, so it will be necessary to determine previously
that it is in accordance with data protection regulations
personal. This is especially relevant if, as in the present case,
more invasive treatments are protected, such as the identification of
unassisted, and specific treatment obligations are established,
as the obligation to record in full and in any case the process of
identification or, very especially, when affecting special categories of
data, the obligation to carry out a biometric comparison, as
provides for article 9.8.

For all these reasons, as pointed out at the beginning of this report,
considers it essential to carry out a detailed analysis and
detailed description of the implications that the approval of the standard has for
the rights and freedoms of those affected, in the terms provided in the
RGPD and that have been pointed out throughout this report, of the
as completely as possible within the urgency with which it has been
requested, taking into account that said analysis is of special relevance since
that this order does not attend exclusively to the temporary situation
derived from the Covid-19 pandemic, but rather intends to regulate these
identification processes permanently, to eliminate, in words
of its MAIN “the competitive disadvantage -derived from this regulatory loophole- of
trust service providers established in Spain with respect to
providers established in other EU Member States”.

This analysis will allow to correctly identify all the measures
and guarantees that must be adopted and, especially, those measures
contemplated in the order that, not having a mere technical nature but
regulate treatments that may interfere with the right
fundamental to the protection of personal data, would require a
