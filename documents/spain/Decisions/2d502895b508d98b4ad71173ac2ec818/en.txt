FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The exposed facts can suppose on the part of Vodafone, of the commission
of an infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that establishes the assumptions that allow
consider the processing of personal data lawful.

Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the

assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

                 "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

The infraction for which the claimed entity is held responsible is
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for

the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The respondent party acknowledges the facts that are the subject of this
claim, in its brief of allegations to this Agency dated July 4, 2021,
stating that due to an error the claimant's Client ID was assigned to
another Vodafone client, causing the data of the Interested Party to appear
associated with the record of this third party.

It is confirmed in the answer given by Vodafone on February 24, 2021 to the

claimant:

We inform you that the personal data relating to your person
that appear in the Vodafone systems are the following: 2. Contracted services:
Vodafone ONO phone numbers: ***PHONE.1, ***PHONE.2, ***PHONE.3,
***PHONE.4, ***PHONE.5, Fiber Service and T.V. ***FIBRE AND TV, the

claimant does not recognize any of those numbers and states that he has never
formalized that contract to which they refer.

It must be taken into account that the documentation in the file
offers evidence that the party complained against violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, whenever
that processed the personal data of the complaining party without legitimacy, given that their
personal data appeared in the file of another client when associating him to the account of the
client *** FIBER AND TV.

The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations
it is therefore evident. Diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the data controller be in a position
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

According to the evidence currently available
procedural, and without prejudice to what results from the investigation of the procedure, it is estimated
that the conduct of the complained party could violate article 6.1 of the RGPD
being able to constitute the infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
Regulation 2016/679.

IV

The determination of the sanction to be imposed in this case requires

respectively, provide the following:

"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

"two. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of

such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that

tions and corrective measures”:

(EU) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria
established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

may also be taken into account:

3. It will be possible, complementary or alternatively, the adoption, when appropriate,
of the remaining corrective measures referred to in article 83.2 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to
impose on the claimed entity as responsible for an infraction typified in the
article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in this case:

As aggravating factors:

-

 -

The intentionality or negligence of the infringement (article 83.2.b, RGPD). Given
that the personal data of the claimant appeared in the file of another client of
Vodafone.

The evident link between the business activity of the respondent and the
processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the
RGPD in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)

It is appropriate to graduate the sanctions to be imposed on the claimed party and set them in the amount

of €50,000 for the infringement of article 83.5 a) RGPD and 72.1b) of the LOPDGDD.

Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, by the Director of the
