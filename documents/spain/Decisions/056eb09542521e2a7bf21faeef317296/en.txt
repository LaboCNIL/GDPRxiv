Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following:

of Privacy but it has been verified that it has recently proceeded to its
update.
Despite this, it should be noted that the sanction of warning for the
personal data that was collected without adequately informing customers, which
which is constitutive of an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD. However, it will be a
sanction of warning without the need to adopt measures by the defendant,

Thus, the exposed facts constitute, on the part of the defendant, a
infringement of the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD.
This infraction is sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with article 58.2.b)
of the RGPD, when collecting through said form basic data of the users and

personal data, since there is no record of the commission of any previous infraction in
matter of data protection.

In view of the foregoing, the following is issued

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
