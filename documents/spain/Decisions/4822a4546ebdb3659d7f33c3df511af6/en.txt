hereafter) to proceed with his expulsion from the national territory when he went to dependencies
municipal authorities after being summoned by the RIBAFORADA CITY COUNCIL (the defendant) with the
purpose of carrying out registration procedures.

The DP in "considerations" indicates that in actions, the "city council has informed of
that agents of the local Immigration Brigade of the Tudela Police Station verbally requested
collaboration to the consistory to investigate and clarify the crimes in which he was possibly involved
the interested party involved. The council understands that it acted in good faith, in order to comply with
with the duty of cooperation between public administrations in the interest of the general interest.

“In view of the information sent: The City Council has been informed of
RIBAFORADA and the General Immigration and Borders Commissioner (CGEF) of the irregularity of
the action taken in the present case, in which the interested party was summoned to
municipal councils under the fictitious pretext of taking steps to register them, despite the fact that the
intended purpose was his detention for his expulsion, given the irregular situation, as he did not have
residence permit.” "Likewise, it has been communicated to said governing bodies that the

"That by the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is sanctioned with
warning to RIBAFORADA CITY COUNCIL, for an infraction of article 5.1.a) of the
RGPD, in accordance with article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.”

There are no allegations of claimed.

PROVEN FACTS

1) This procedure originates from the transfer of actions of the Ombudsman
for the AEPD to analyze whether personal data have been used and processed for the detention
tion of the claimant by the Police on public roads, near the Town Hall claimed, the ma-
morning of 05/06/2019.

As documentation sent by the DP, there is the written summons to the claimant,
made with a computer by the claimed party, and sent to the claimant, dated 05/03/2019. In the
literal figure:” you are hereby summoned to a meeting at the town hall offices on Monday 6
May at 11:00 in the morning to deal with an issue of their registration.”, with the seal of the
City Hall, without having, according to the statement of the respondent, because he was not given,
exit number,

2) According to the defendant's statement, the summons was delivered by a
municipal worker at the address of the letter, on the same day 05/03/2019, signed by another person,
not the claimant. There is no evidence that the claimant had a request related to
some registration issue.

3) As stated by the respondent in his allegations to the initial agreement, the personal data
affected were provided by the police officers who attended the
City Hall on 05/03/2019 requesting that the summons be made, since the claimant had a
extradition order. The City Council does not deny the collaboration stating that "without it being
does not need to make any query on your part”, “nor data processing of the register”, because “the
Police, "had all the information." The Police in evidence stated that the claimant “was
was identified and located”, “his address”, “being watched”, “with results
unsuccessful", and the Police "suggests the City Council its collaboration in verifying whether the
foreign citizen continues to actually reside in the municipality or not, continuing not
However, the police officers with the surveillance devices referred to above for the purpose of
its location”.

4) There is no evidence that the request for collaboration from the Police to the requested party is documented by
written, declaring the claimed that it was verbally by the agents who visited the
City hall.

5) According to the test carried out, in the claimed Town Hall the details of the
claimant, as certified "in the Municipal Population Register", and its computer application,
with registration date, ***DATE.2, with address “***ADDRESS.1” (literal order and capital letters like this
ready). The letter that is sent to the claimed person so that he can go through the process of
registration, has the same address, although in a different order and format, “***ADDRESS.1”, and
According to the defendant, these are data that were provided by the Police when requesting their
collaboration. The City Council associates a procedure with these received data so that it can go to
complete it and quote the claimant by sending the letter, exercising their decision on
how to use that received data.

6) In evidence, the respondent stated that “if we have to address the neighbors, we consult the
address that appears in the register, because it is the most up-to-date one. Other times it
uses the general maintenance database.” Apart from that of the register, it is not proven that
another address appears for the claimant at the headquarters of the claimant.

7) According to the Police, the claimant was being investigated before his arrest on 05/06/2019,
by an administrative resolution of expulsion of 08/05/2015, confirmed by the Court on
***DATE.1, and having a police record, they tried to locate and arrest him.

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority,
and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

The content of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposition
position and control over personal data that empowers the person to decide which of those
data to provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or which data may be collected by that third party,
and that also allows the individual to know who owns that personal data and for what, being able to
object to such possession or use. These powers of disposal and control over personal data
which constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection is con-
legally believe in the power to consent to the collection, obtaining and access to data
personal data, their subsequent storage and treatment, as well as their possible use or uses, by a
third party, be it the State or an individual.

The purpose for which the City Council has the data of the interested party in the Municipal Register
It is generally the one provided for in the regulations. Additionally, he obtained data
provided by the police, even if they were the same, are used to write a document,
deciding to use that same data for a purpose, the claimant's subpoena, that actually
did not exist, in order to facilitate the detention of the claimant.

In the present case, the participation by the respondent in sending the
summons letter made to the claimant, nor that possibly the
arrest of the claimant, but if personal data have been used for said citation
ownership of the claimant.

In the first place, according to the version of the claimant, that the data is provided by the
police, the respondent sends a letter to the claimant, facilitating the summons of the claimant. For
this, uses the same data, apparently they are not those of the Municipal Register, since they are the
same, but in another format, but the address is the same, and for practical purposes, it is intended that
With these data, he decides to send a summons letter, exercising his powers.

This is done without writing that motivates the aforementioned collaboration, then without a legal reason that

support the legality of the collaboration, by way of fact.

On the other hand, said statement that the data was given to him by the police is not discredited by the
action of the police, which states that they had been monitoring the claimant for some time
watching, without success. In fact, in the summons letter, it is not delivered at the address to the
claimant, but to another person who was there. On the other hand, of the eventual queries,
use or access to the Municipal Register of inhabitants there are no reviews or indications.

It would be convenient, therefore, to define where the data for sending comes from, or to conclude

rationally where these data do not come from or come from.

It is clearly seen in terms of the shipping address associated with the name and surname of the
claimant, that the formats and literals of the Municipal Register and of the citation letter are dis-
reds. The padrón managed by the claimed, the data of the summons letter with an address
(Personal data of the claimant, although in format, very different from those that appear in the register).
One refers to a fully capitalized format, in the entire street name, and the data

the citizens. In this case, the exact data of the register is not the one contained in the file.

death given by the Police, not the one on the register. In addition, the claimant did not know of another address in
City Hall.

Notwithstanding the indication that the respondent has collaborated in the agreement to facilitate

burden of proof, which corresponds to the administration that accuses proving the facts, is not co-
disputed for not unquestionably proving that the registry registry database had been used.
called for the sending of the aforementioned letter. However, if it is proven that other data is used,
same address, different format, which according to the person claimed, are the ones used, deciding,
through the powers conferred by the city council, use these data, to process
a summons, therefore this treatment consisting of sending this letter with these data is the
treatment of the data carried out by the claimed party.

In this case, the personal data have been processed for a purpose for which there was no
more legitimacy than the verbal one, without accrediting the legal motivation that served for the
legitimate treatment of that data and that citation.

This constitutes the infringement of article 5.1.a) of the RGD

1. The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, loyalty and

transparency");

For the processing of personal data to be legal, you must identify specific reasons
for processing. This is called a "lawful basis" for treatment, and there are six options

this case that there was a legal obligation to cooperate when there is no document that motivates
or induce such cooperation. If the exercise of competences were exercised because one thinks
what must be done or feels pressured, there would be no real reason for the action. The
disloyalty in the treatment must be seen as an aspect of the treatment of the data, in this
case, collaborate in a subpoena for which there was no ongoing procedure, proving the
exercise in the treatment of data for a purpose that is not the one that foresees the treatment of the data.

data would have been collected. The RGPD identifies it in its article 5.1.b) “Data
will be: collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes.”

The purpose of the treatment must be specific, legitimate and express, in this case defined
by law in matters of register management, and not stating that there was a procedure to
completed by the person claimed in that area, it is estimated that the citation with their data
personal, even if they were provided by the agents, is a treatment of data not
lawful in which there is also a lack of loyalty. Loyalty means you should only handle the
personal data in a way that people can expect its reasonable use, some
common expectations, and not to use them in a way or deviate, or that have adverse effects
unjust about them. The person in charge must stop and think not only about how he can use
personal data, but also whether to do so. It is proven that the aforementioned is violated
