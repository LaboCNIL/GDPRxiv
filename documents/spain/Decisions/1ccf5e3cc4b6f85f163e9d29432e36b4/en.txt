legal authorization, and then has provided information related to it.

The claimant states:

“On September 14, the Local Police of ***LOCALIDAD.1 posted on Twitter a photo of
a dog lost in the floods that they had picked up and that was in the de-
Zoonosis municipal brawls. Can you help us find its owner with a retweet?

That same day a citizen was interested in adopting the dog, I replied to said citizen's tweet.
dadano telling him to ask about him because in zoonoses he was at risk of being euthanized.

The local police of ***LOCALIDAD.1 answered me saying that there was a Protection Law
Animal that recognized the sacrifice 0, to which I responded by showing that said
Law to date has no regulatory development.

 

At that moment the official page of Zoonosis appeared
  of the townhall
(Department of Sports and Health) telling me that I was wrong, to which I replied di-
saying that he had requested the information from the city council itself through its Trans-
appearance.

Two days later, the person who manages the Twitter of ***TWITTER.1, ***LOCALIDAD.1 co-
began to make personal attacks on me, to the point of accessing my file

about the adoption and saying that it had gotten into my registry and that the dog was not va-
sister-in-law.

I warned him that these data were personal, that I did not give him permission to disseminate them and that
They were also outdated since my dog is vaccinated but I did not go to the vet.

putting back the data that had been improperly accessed. I requested

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority,
and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

Defines article 4.1 of the RGPD:

II

“personal data”: any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (“the
interested"); an identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
example a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier,
line or one or more elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychic,
economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The current regulations on the protection of personal data contained in the
RGPD maintains the principle that all data processing needs to be supported by a database
law that legitimizes it. In this case, there is authorization to process data from the
claimed associated with the legal obligations that are imposed by the possession of animals
of company

The claimed infringement of article 5.1 is imputed. f), which states:

1. The personal data will be:

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss,
accidental destruction or damage, through the application of technical or organizational measures
appropriate ("integrity and confidentiality").

This infraction is specified in article 5 of the LOPDGDD, which states:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all persons
that intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality to which
Article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 refers.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the

duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.”

The claimant's statement on Twitter that "if I wanted it with my name, you look for the experiences
teeth" was associated with his previous statements that he had adopted a dog there, with the
background of animal sacrifices, without it being deduced that because it is consulted
eventually by the employee authorized to do so, the aforementioned data must be exposed.

Those statements, if any, would not allow the open use resulting from the query, de-
keeping the data in the strict scope in which they were collected for the purpose of the
file that stores them.

The data of the people included in databases on companion animals related to
their holder with the data of the animal, in this case, with no other apparent source for their con-

final, to later attribute the date on which a dog from municipal dependencies was taken along
to the statement that the animal was not vaccinated.

Notwithstanding, the respondent stated that there is evidence that the animal was vaccinated in
2019, denying the veracity of the information and that therefore some database had been consulted
of data with content of personal data, thus denying that its manifestation
contains strict references to information on personal data from
file or treatment carried out.

Regarding penalties, the Constitutional Court, in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26/04, has
established as one of the basic pillars for the interpretation of administrative law
punisher that the basic principles and guarantees present in the field of criminal law
are applicable, with certain nuances, in the exercise of any sanctioning power of the
Public administration.

In any case, it corresponds to the AEPD that imputes the infraction, with the evidentiary means
obtained during the procedure, through evidence that must be sufficient and with a value
decisive in the case of tipping the balance beyond all reasonable doubt to prove that
the actions and behaviors imputed in the defendant concur. In the present case without
However, it is unknown if the staff who attended the social network at that time accessed
databases and to which databases, as well as the data that the claimant could
appear in it. The mere statement that he took a dog in 2016 that is not
vaccinated, is not decisive to accredit access to the database, when in addition the
claimed denies, stating that it was. There are doubts about the incrimination of the
claimed in the effective use of the claimant's data because there is no direct evidence,
the acquittal of the defendant proceeds based on the principle "in dubio pro-indicted" as it is not fulfilled in
all the objective elements that make up the offending conduct.
