FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality”. The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
 (…)
  f) Treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational (<<integrity and confidentiality>>)”

Recital 39 of the GDPR says about this:
“All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For the people
physical data must be made absolutely clear that they are being collected, used, consulted
or treating in another way personal data that concerns them, as well as the extent
in which said data is or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that all
information and communication regarding the processing of said data is easily
accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language is used. Saying
principle refers in particular to the information of the interested parties on the identity
of the person in charge of the treatment and the purposes of the same and to the information added to
ensure fair and transparent treatment with respect to natural persons
affected and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the data
personal data that concern them that are subject to treatment. natural persons
must be aware of the risks, standards, safeguards and rights
regarding the processing of personal data as well as the way to assert their
rights in relation to treatment. In particular, the specific purposes of the
processing of personal data must be explicit and legitimate, and must
be determined at the time of collection. Personal data must be
adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are
treated. This requires, in particular, ensuring that their use is limited to a strict minimum.
conservation period. Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing
treatment could not reasonably be achieved by other means. To ensure that
personal data is not kept longer than necessary, the person responsible for the
treatment must establish deadlines for its suppression or periodic review. must
take all reasonable steps to ensure that they are rectified or deleted
personal data that is inaccurate. Personal data must be treated in a
way that guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of the data
including to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data and
of the equipment used in the treatment. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD is typified in the article
83 of the aforementioned legal text. Under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines”, says:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

7/14

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), for prescription purposes, qualifies as very serious
(article 72.1.) “the infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the
articles mentioned in it and, in particular, the following: a) The treatment of
personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in article 5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

VODAFONE is attributed in this sanctioning file a

violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

 
The documentation in the administrative file offers evidence

that VODAFONE violated the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

According to the documentation in the file, it is proven that
VODAFONE sent to a third party (B.B.B.) documentation that included data
personal information of the claimant: name and two surnames; NIF; mobile phone number and
postal address.

In this regard, we refer, on the one hand, to the documents provided by the
claimant: the copy of the envelope with the VODAFONE logo on which it appeared
as recipient the name, surnames and address of the third party and a copy of a contract
in the name of the claimant -"copy for the client"- that incorporated their data
personal. On the other hand, what was stated by the claimant in her complaint before the OMIC
-that an unknown person had contacted her by telephone to
inform you that I had received in an envelope addressed to your attention documents from the
affected-. Explanation that fully coincides with the annotations from
the VODAFONE systems that the defendant provided to the AEPD in the course of the
prior investigation.

The annotations provided by VODAFONE are an internal document that
judgment of the entity explains what happened. From the examination of such annotations it is evident
that a third party called the operator on 06/06/2018. According to the annotation: “Client indicates
An unknown person called him. That a letter arrived with your information
VF staff. ***PHONE.2 -Client with document (number of the client of the
person who has received your data) L A letter has arrived with the data of another
person

“THE CUSTOMER'S PHONE PHONE THAT HAS ARRIVED DOCUMENTATION OF

ANOTHER PERSON – ***PHONE.3 [for internal use only]”

It is also evident from the notes of VODAFONE that the claimant

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/14

(holder of NIF ***NIF.1) contacted the operator's service by telephone on
06/12/2018 and explained, not only that another client had received an envelope with their data
but also added that she had received an envelope containing
his name but containing documents relating to the person who in turn had
received hers: “***NIF.1 I speak with the tit, she says that she has received an envelope in which
His name appeared, but the details of another client appeared inside the envelope. the other
The client has also received an envelope with the client's data ***NIF.1”

It seems obvious, then, that both parties, the claimant and the third party who received
their documents, they had to access the information contained in the envelope
received from VODAFONE in his name, but which concerned the other person, since only
thus they were able to learn that the documentation they had received from the entity
claimed was not his.

Proved that VODAFONE violated the principles of integrity and
confidentiality in relation to the personal data of the claimant - taking into account
that he sent documents with personal data of the affected party to a third party and that the
third party had to access those data as the only means to contact her or
identify it before the claimed entity- it has to be assessed if the fault of the
claimed or if he omitted the due diligence, taking into account the circumstances of the
case, essential for the behavior analyzed to be subsumable in the type
violator of article 83.5. of the GDPR.

Our sanctioning law governs the principle of culpability, which prevents
impose sanctions based on the strict liability of the alleged offender. The
presence of the element of guilt in the broad sense, as a condition for
sanctioning responsibility arises, has been recognized by the Court
Constitutional Court, among others, in its STC 76/1999, in which it states that the sanctions
administrative participate in the same nature as criminal ones, being one of the
manifestations of the ius puniendi of the State and that, as a requirement derived from the
principles of legal certainty and criminal legality enshrined in articles 9.3 and
25.1 of the C.E., its existence is essential to impose it.

Law 40/2015 on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector provides in the article

28, under the heading “Responsibility”:

"1. They may only be sanctioned for acts constituting an infraction.
natural and legal persons administratively, as well as, when a Law
recognize capacity to act, affected groups, unions and entities without
legal personality and independent or autonomous estates, which result
responsible for them by way of fraud or negligence.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The respondent has stated in its pleadings to the initial agreement that
we are facing a mere human error in which intentionality or fraud has not intervened
for his part, reason for which, in his opinion, the filing of the proceedings would proceed.

Let us remember in this regard that according to article 5.2 of the RGPD (principle of
proactive liability) the respondent entity should have provided the
pertinent documentation that accredits that it had implemented the technical measures and
organizational structures that guaranteed the adequate level of security against the loss of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/14

data or unauthorized treatment. However, VODAFONE has contributed nothing in
such sense limiting itself to affirming that we are facing a “mere human error”.

In compliance with the obligations that the RGPD imposes on the person responsible for the
treatment, it must display the minimum diligence required by the circumstances
of the case adopting the pertinent technical and organizational measures. Illustrative is the
SAN of 04/29/2020 -which, although it was issued in a matter of fraudulent hiring and
under the previous regulations, it is perfectly extrapolated to the one that concerns us- whose
Sixth Legal Basis says: "The question is not to clarify whether the appellant dealt with the
personal data of the complainant without her consent, such as whether she used or
failure to exercise reasonable diligence in trying to identify the person with whom
He signed the contract." (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Regarding the element of culpability in the administrative procedure
sanctioning party it seems appropriate to refer to the SAN of 05/30/2015 (Rec. 163/2014)
that connects the "reproachability" to a legal person of a certain conduct
with the circumstance that it “had or had not provided effective protection to the
legal good protected by the norm”. The Second Legal Basis of the aforementioned
Sentence says:

<<However, the mode of attribution of responsibility to people
legal does not correspond to the forms of fraudulent or reckless guilt that
They are attributable to human behavior. So, in the case of violations
committed by legal persons, although the element of
guilt, it is necessarily applied differently from the way it is applied with respect to
to natural persons. According to STC 246/1999 "(...) this construction, different from the
imputability of the authorship of the infraction to the legal person arises from the
nature of legal fiction to which these subjects respond. missing in them
volitional element in the strict sense, but not the ability to break the rules to the
that they are subjected. Capacity for infringement and, therefore, direct blame that
derives from the legal right protected by the norm that is violated and the need for
said protection is really effective and for the risk that, consequently, must
assume the legal entity that is subject to compliance with said rule”>> (The
underlined is from the AEPD)

In short, the conduct of VODAFONE, materialized in the infringement of the
principles of integrity and confidentiality regarding the personal data of the
claimant –name, two surnames, NIF, mobile phone and address–, since he sent the
the claimant's contract that contained her personal data to a third party without having
accredited that he had implanted when the facts occurred the measures
technical and organizational measures necessary to guarantee the security and confidentiality of
the data of its clients in order to prevent events such as those that concern us,
violates article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, action subsumable in the sanctioning type of the
article 83.5 of the RGPD.

 

IV

Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", establishes in point 2:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers

10/14

corrections listed below:

(…)
i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of
each particular case;”

In order to determine the administrative fine that is appropriate to impose,
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that
point out:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to

alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under
of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the

treatment;

  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put

remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
measure;

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question in
related to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms of

certification approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly,
through the infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/14

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.
b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of

personal information.

c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the commission

of the offence.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the

infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) Affectation of the rights of minors.
g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Submission by the person in charge or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between them and any interested party.”

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the
fine to be imposed on VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U., as responsible for an infraction
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is necessary to make two clarifications. The
First, that article 83.2 RGPD requires the control authority to guarantee that the
sanction to be imposed is in each case "effective, proportionate and dissuasive" and, the
second, that the amount of the sanction provided for in the RGPD for infractions
referred to in article 83.5 has as its maximum limit the greater of these two
amounts: 20,000,000 euros or 4% of the total global annual turnover of the
previous financial year. During the 2017 financial year, the turnover of
VODAFONE amounted to 4,978 million euros, so 4% of this amount
amounts to 199,120,000 euros.

As indicated in the agreement to initiate the file, the concurrence
of the following factors that affect the unlawfulness and culpability of the
action of VODAFONE and therefore in determining the amount of the penalty:
-The merely local scope of the data processing carried out by the claimed party.
-The people affected by the conduct of VODAFONE that allegedly violates the
GDPR have been two.
-The damage caused to those affected by the processing of their data is not very
significant.
-VODAFONE's lack of diligence can be described as slight. The facts are not due
to the inaccuracy of the data contained in the entity's files. In this sense the
requested provided this Agency with the three addresses that appear in its files associated with
the claimant -none of which coincides with the address of the third party to whom the
document of the claimant with her personal data - and also explained what was the

origin of each of them.
- The obvious link between the business activity of VODAFONE and the
processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD
in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)
