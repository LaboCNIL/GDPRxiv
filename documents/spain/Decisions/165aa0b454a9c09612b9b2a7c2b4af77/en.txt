FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

II

The claimed facts are specified in the treatment of the data of the
claimant by the claimed without his consent, or any other cause
legitimating said treatment, by sending emails to your
personal account.

Said treatment could constitute a violation of article 6, Lawfulness

of the treatment, of the RGPD that establishes that:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

personal for one or more specific purposes;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/14

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

In article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in section 11, it states that:

“11) «consent of the interested party»: any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him”.

Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected party,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), indicates
that:

"1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal by which he accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that
concern.

2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent
of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to state
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the affected party consenting to the
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship”.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/14

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the principles
basic for the treatment, including the conditions for the consent in accordance with
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of
€20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount.

On the other hand, the LOPDGDD for prescription purposes states in its article 72:

“Infringements considered very serious:

1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
particularly the following:

(…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

(…)”

III

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed violated article 6 of the RGPD, since it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so,
materialized in the referral to your email address communications with
origin in “vodafone@corp.vodafone.es” and whose subject is “you already have your
Electronic bill".

Likewise, after the evidence obtained, it is clear that initially the
claimant denounced the processing of their data after a request for
suppression. The claimant provided a response from the respondent, within the framework of a
claim before SESIAD, in which they stated that the claimant ceased to be a client
of the company (does not maintain any active service in Vodafone, nor amounts
pending payment) and the last invoice issued in your name was dated May 15
2017. However, the claimant continued to receive invoice notices in the
last months of 2018, 2019 and 2020, exactly the same as those claimed by this
instead of dates September 8, 28 and October 28, 2020.

In sanctioning procedure PS/00278/2019, the defendant acknowledged said
error, claiming that it was due to a computer error in their systems, the email
The claimant's e-mail remained "hooked" and continued to appear in the file of
sending informative communications regarding electronic invoices issued by
Vodafone, but stated that the error had already been solved and due to these facts
sanctioned the defendant. It is stated that the date of signing the Resolution by the
director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency was on January 13, 2020 and
the date of notification to the party of the claimed, took place on January 16,
2020.

On March 11, 2020, the claimant filed a new claim against the
claimed since he had received a notice of
availability of electronic invoice from the claimed company, which
constitutes a recurrence of the facts sanctioned in the procedure
sanction PS/00186/20, processed by this Agency against the party claimed.

Based on the foregoing, the sanctioning procedure was opened by this Agency
PS/00186/2020, and the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, issued the
August 31, 2020, resolution of said procedure, being its notification on
same day, same month and year, for infraction of article 6.1. of the RGPD typified in the
article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned RGPD.

Well, the claimant has stated again that he continues to receive emails

electronic, despite resolutions PS/00278/2019 and PS/00186/2020.

It is clear that the claimant has received again on September 8, 28 and 28
October 2020 in your email address a notice of availability of

domicile) (article 83.2 g)

again to send you commercial communications.

The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal data, (section b).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the
RGPD allows to set a penalty of 200,000 euros (two hundred thousand euros), considered
