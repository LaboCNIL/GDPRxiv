that is, it copies all the data, of the entire generic list, independently, in
another place, to be able to separate the contacts by lists
individualized and to be able to do manual searches of the contacts that have
requested that informative communications not be sent to them. It is a very
laborious, costly and excessive, which the Trade Union Section carries out in order to comply with
the rights of suppression of the interested party, but that escapes on many occasions to the
control of the USO Trade Union Section itself.

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the legalization of the
processing of personal data:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the treatment of his personal data for one or
various specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party
or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;
d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person
physical;
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest
or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the

require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment carried out by
public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

IV

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, there are indications about the processing of the personal data of the party
claimant without any legal basis that legitimizes it, considering that it requested the
the party claimed the deletion of their personal data.

This obligation to delete personal data entails the impossibility of
any further processing of such data. Despite this, the defendant
used the e-mail address of the complaining party to send him some
informative emails about their activities, which are outlined in the Antecedent
First.

The FAC-USO entity itself has admitted the aforementioned circumstance.

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the provisions of article 6 of the RGPD, typified in the
section 5.a) of article 83 of the RGPD, which under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a
company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover
of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the consent to
tenor of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that "They constitute
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/12

infractions the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

“Article 72. Infractions considered very serious.
1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are considered
very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a violation
substance of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:
(…)
b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of legality of the
treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

v

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the criteria established by the
articles 83.2 of the RGPD and 76 of the LOPDGDD.

In accordance with the precepts indicated, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in the present case it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate
the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria:

In an initial evaluation, the criterion of
next graduation:

. Article 83.2.b) of the RGPD: "b) the intention or negligence in the infringement".

The negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction, considering that the
claimed party did not take into account the right of suppression exercised, and neither
the subsequent warnings that were made by the claimant.
These circumstances reveal the negligent action of the party
claimed.

In this regard, what was declared in the Judgment of the High Court is taken into account.
National of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006) that, based on the fact that they are entities
whose activity involves continuous data processing, indicates that "... the
The Supreme Court has understood that there is imprudence whenever
disregards a legal duty of care, that is, when the offender fails to
behave with due diligence.”

It is an entity that performs personal data processing in a
systematic and continuous in the workplace and that extreme care must be taken in the
compliance with its data protection obligations.

This Agency understands that diligence must be deduced from facts
conclusive, duly accredited and directly related
with the elements that make up the infraction, in such a way that it can be deduced
that it has occurred despite all the means provided by the
responsible to avoid it. In this case, the action of the party complained against
www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

8/12

has this character.

It is also considered that the following circumstance concurs as a mitigating circumstance:

. Article 83.2.a) of the RGPD: “a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the
infringement, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the operation
of treatment in question as well as the number of interested parties affected and the
level of damages they have suffered.

The infringement affects only the claimed party.

Considering the exposed factors, the initial valuation that reaches the fine, for the
violation of article 6 of the RGPD, is 3,000 euros (three thousand euros).

SAW

If the infraction is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of
appropriate measures to adjust their actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the
which each control authority may “order the person in charge or in charge of the
treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a
specified period…”. The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is warned that not meeting the requirements of this organization may be
considered as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD,
typified as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the
opening of a subsequent sanctioning administrative proceeding.

Spanish Data Protection,
