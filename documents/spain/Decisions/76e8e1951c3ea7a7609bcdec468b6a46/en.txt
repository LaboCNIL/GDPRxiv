III

In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a
video surveillance system, to be in accordance with current regulations, must comply with
the following requirements:

- Respect the principle of proportionality.

- When the system is connected to an alarm center, you can only
be installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.

- The video cameras will not be able to capture images of the people who

video surveillance, since the processing of images in public places can only be
carried out, unless there is government authorization, by the Forces and Corps of
Security. Nor can spaces owned by third parties be captured or recorded without
the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the persons who are
find.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection
of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or inside,
it may be necessary to guarantee the security purpose the recording of a
portion of public road. That is, cameras and video cameras installed for the purpose of
security will not be able to obtain images of public roads unless it is
essential for said purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of

with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without just cause.

- In no case will the use of surveillance practices be admitted beyond the
environment object of the installation and in particular, not being able to affect the spaces
surrounding public, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the
guarded space.

In summary and to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection offers through its website [https://www.aepd.es] access to

the legislation on the protection of personal data, including the RGPD and the
LOPDGDD (section “Reports and resolutions” / “regulations”), as well as the Guide
on the use of video cameras for security and other purposes, as well as the Guide
for compliance with the duty to inform (both available in the section “Guides
and tools”).

It is also of interest, in the event of carrying out low-risk data processing, the
facilitates free tool (in the “Guides and tools” section), which, through
specific questions, allows to assess the situation of the person in charge with respect to the
treatment of personal data that it carries out, and where appropriate, generate various
documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with measures
guidelines considered minimum.

IV

In the present case, the claim is based on the presumed unlawfulness of the installation by
part of the claim of a video surveillance system, consisting of six cameras
installed in STREET ***ADDRESS.1***LOCATION.1, two of which could
capture images of public areas disproportionately.

As proof of these statements, the claimant provided the evidence
indicated in the “Facts” section of this agreement.

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, is established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among
they have the power to issue a warning -article 58.2.b)-, the
power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD -
article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the controller or processor
that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period -article 58. 2
d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the RGPD, the aforementioned Regulation
provides in its article 58.2 b) the possibility of directing a warning, in relation to
with what is stated in Considering 148: "In the event of a minor infraction, or if the fine
likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden on a
natural person, instead of sanctioning by means of a fine, a
warning. However, special attention must be paid to the nature,
gravity and duration of the infringement, its intentional nature, the measures taken
to mitigate the damages and losses suffered, to the degree of responsibility or to any
pertinent previous infraction, to the way in which the control authority has had
knowledge of the infraction, compliance with measures ordered against the
responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of conduct and any other
aggravating or mitigating circumstance.

v

When deciding to impose an administrative fine and its amount, in each case
individual will take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors indicated
in art. 83.2 of the RGPD, as well as any other that may be applicable to the
circumstances of the case.

The infractions are typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; […]”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, those indicated in paragraph
above are considered very serious and prescribe after three years, in accordance with article
72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

[…] b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions
of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

c) Failure to comply with the requirements of Article 7 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 for the validity of consent […]”

Article 22 section 2 of the LOPDGDD provides:

“Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that it is
essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.

However, it will be possible to capture public roads to the extent that it is
essential to guarantee the security of strategic goods or installations or of
infrastructures linked to transport, without in any case implying the
capturing images of the interior of a private home”.

Examined the file as a whole, although it is true that at the time of the start
of this sanctioning procedure the cameras installed in the company of the
claimed captured images outside their property, during the period of
allegations, the respondent has stated that he has proceeded to relocate the
cameras to his private space, providing two photographs of what the cameras capture.

apparently the entrance to his establishment, and several parked vehicles,
prospects. It is verified that it has reduced the field of vision.

SAW

In accordance with the foregoing, having examined the modifications of the installed system, the
itself is considered adjusted to the right, capturing the cameras the least
essential for its work of protecting the company.

Full collaboration with this body is taken into account when carrying out the
precise corrections to avoid affecting the right of third parties, being the necessary ones
to preserve the security of the property.

The parties are reminded of the importance of the rights at stake and must avoid
instrumentalize institutions in matters beyond their competence,
having to adjust the relationships between them to the minimum requirements of the
good neighbor rules

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, once the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, and taking into account
account that the relocation of the cameras has occurred during the processing of the
present procedure, it is maintained to direct a warning, since during a
time the cameras overrecorded areas outside his property, although it was not
require complementary measures to have been adopted.
