Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and

based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Don A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant), dated October 23
2019, filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against Doña B.B.B.. The reasons on which the claim is based
are that Doña B.B.B., in her Tweeter profile ***PERFIL.1, has publicly revealed
personal data of third parties. In the concrete in the following tweet, published
on ***DATE.1 at 4:32 p.m.: ***TWEET.1. He understands that this violates the Law of

In the tweet, and in two others posted by two other featured members
of the party, the first name of the marriage that has leased a dwelling is indicated.

SECOND: Prior to the acceptance of this claim for processing,
transferred to Doña B.B.B., in accordance with the provisions of article 65.4 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

The legal representative of Doña B.B.B. presented arguments indicating, in short,

thesis, the following:

<<That your client is not among the responsible subjects
included in article 70 of the LOPDGDD, not being, therefore, necessary to have
a DPD.

It is clear that the facts denounced are not related to the
treatment of data in any way and, therefore, the Law is not applicable in the pre-
feel case.

It is for all these reasons that, as a PRELIMINARY QUESTION, request the FILE immediately

of the present case

The examination of the complaint concludes in the following extremes:
a) Regarding the complainant:

The complainant is not any of the persons whose name and/or surname mentioned

b) Regarding personal data:

Mrs. B.B.B. on his twitter he mentions the data with names and surnames of several
people, in no case the simple mention of the name and surname of a person, in
a social network automatically constitutes an infringement of the Organic Law.

I REQUEST THIS AGENCY, to have this written RESOLUTION as submitted

Based on the exposed allegations, please resolve the immediate FILE of the ex-

THIRD: When analyzing the allegations, it was found that in other tweets of
people who make up the dome of PODEMOS had also commented on the matter

D.D.D.: ***TWEET.2 - ***DATE.1 at 12:32 pm; picks up the same news, say-

Telling the owner: “You XXX…”

E.E.E.: ***TWEET.3 - ***DATE.1 at 12:24 pm, writing. “you XXX…”

As you can see, these tweets are prior to the one published by Mrs. B.-

B.B., which was published at 4:32 p.m. on ***DATE.1

FIFTH: On January 21, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency

SEVENTH: Having notified the aforementioned start-up agreement, PODEMOS submitted a written

And consequently, when the initial resolution says that "The representative
of the claimed party presented allegations”, it is understood that the claimed party who has
presented allegations has been Mrs. B.B.B.

that it is a “communication from several members of the political party”, affirmation

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), recognizes each
Control Authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

In the first place, we will indicate that the sanctioning procedure always begins

Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations, either by their own initiative,
va or as a consequence of a superior order, at the reasoned request of other organs or
by complaint (article 58 of Law 39/2015).

The art. 62.1 of Law 39/2015 defines “complaint” as “the act by which any
Any person, in compliance or not with a legal obligation, informs
an administrative body the existence of a certain fact that could justify

Nor is it necessary to act “on behalf” of the person whose personal data
are revealed, so no power of representation of any of this is necessary, there is
who does not act on his behalf, but as a mere whistleblower.

In this case, a person has informed the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection, as the competent body for the processing of procedures
sanctions that violate data protection regulations, some facts
that, in their opinion, do not comply with said regulations.

Secondly, regarding the mention of names and surnames, if we go
to the definition of “treatment” contained in article 4.2) RGPD: “treatment

or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not,
such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or

pressure or destruction.

There is treatment from the moment it is communicated by transmission, or

spreads, one (several) personal data(s).

When publishing a tweet there is a diffusion of “personal data” that according to the article

ass 4.1) RGPD is defined as:

“personal data”: any information about an identified natural person or

whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by

location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity

apartment, and that it is also leased, and that it is in a situation of conflict with the
tenants (and with a particular tenant association).

Likewise, it also reveals other personal data, such as the income that
have been paying for that house -economic data- and the increase in rent that,

The Judgment of the CJEU of November 6, 2003, Lindqvist, paragraphs 19 and
24-27, deals with a case that is essentially similar to the present one. Said sentence with

the conduct that consists of referring, on a web page, to various
persons and to identify them by name or by other means, such as their number

constitutes a "whole or partially automated processing of personal data"
les' within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 95/46.

(…)

24. The concept of "personal data" used in Article 3(1) of
Directive 95/46 covers, according to the definition in Article
2, letter a), of said Directive «any information about an identifiable natural person

each or identifiable”. This concept undoubtedly includes the name of a person
next to your telephone number or other information related to your conditions of
work or hobbies.

25. As for the concept of "processing" of such data used in the article
3, paragraph 1, of Directive 95/46, this includes, according to the definition
tion of Article 2, letter b), of said Directive, "any operation or set
of operations, carried out or not through automated procedures, and applying
each to personal data”. This last provision lists several examples of
such operations, which include communication by transmission, broadcasting,
sion or any other way that facilitates access to the data. It follows from this
that the conduct that consists in referring, on a web page, to data
treatment of this nature should be considered.

26. It remains to be determined whether such treatment is “partially or fully auto-
nuanced”. In this regard, it should be noted that disseminating information in a
website implies, in accordance with the technical and computer procedures
that are currently applied, publish said page on a server, as well as perform
perform the necessary operations to make it accessible to people who
are connected to the Internet. These operations are carried out, at least in part,
in an automated way.

fully or partially automated storage of personal data" within the meaning of
Article 3, paragraph 1, of Directive 95/46.

IV

As for what is the canon of interpretation existing in Spanish law
regarding the weighting between the exercise of freedom of expression or information
(art. 22 EC) and the processing of personal data art. 18.4 CE), it is worth citing the sentence
of the constitutional court STC 58/2018, of June 14, on the right to oblivion di-
gital regarding certain people for news that appeared in the newspaper EL PAIS:

The public relevance of the information is determined both by the subject matter and
object of the same, as by reason of the public or private condition of the person.
sound to which it concerns. As we have said repeatedly, the authorities and
public officials, as well as public figures or those dedicated to activities
companies that carry public notoriety «voluntarily accept the risk that
their subjective rights of personality are affected by criticism, opinion-
adverse disclosures or disclosures and, therefore, the right to information reaches, in
relationship with them, their maximum level of legitimizing efficacy, insofar as their
life and moral conduct participate in the general interest with a greater intensity
than that of those private persons who, without a vocation for public projection,
are circumstantially involved in matters of public importance,
which must, therefore, recognize a higher level of privacy.
which prevents granting general importance to facts or behaviors that the

November 12, FJ 2). In this sense, it has been said that, in the case of people

had, but it can be considered disproportionate the transmission of those
facts that, within the news, affect the honor or privacy of the person
concerned and that are revealed as "manifestly unnecessary and irrelevant
for the public interest of information» (SSTC 105/1990, of June 6, FJ 8, and
121/2002, of May 20, FJ 5).

In the present case, an analysis of the weighting between the right to freedom
freedom of expression and the right to protection of a person's personal data,
but from the facts that result from the case we are before a fact that in itself does not
would be newsworthy (there are evictions every day in many unfortunate cities-
mind, and this is not a special case).

A processing of personal data of a private person has been carried out, and
that therefore, according to the cited constitutional doctrine, it would not be protected
given for the freedom of information, in this case of expression, all the content of a
news (it is reiterated, in any case, that we do not consider that we are facing a
newsworthy), but it would be preponderant the defense of the rights and interests
legitimate to the protection of personal data of said private person, because
it should be considered that the disclosure not only of the name and surname of said person
vada, but also in conjunction with the other personal data mentioned,
such as the fact of owning a flat, that said flat is leased, what
is the rental income paid by the tenants, as well as the conflict situation
or the amount that was intended at the time to raise the rent, are susceptible to
produce damage that must prevail over the freedom of expression of the defendant.

It is necessary to determine who is responsible for the offense committed. In
In this sense, it must be taken into consideration that the personal data of the owner

the accounts of three people who belong to the PODEMOS political party and occupy
relevant positions, Doña B.B.B., Don D.D.D. and Doña E.E.E.. The three tweets were published

sanctioning acts (for example AP/00012/2014 and PS/00700/2015).

That damage has occurred results from the known circumstances of the
case. In addition, by revealing the name and surname of a certain person, it is
that another person with the exact same name has suffered damages in his or her
business, since she owns a rural house, and as a result of the revelation of the name and
last name of the person with the same name as her who is involved in the
of the lease to which the data controller wanted to refer
of the published tweets, has suffered threats, cancellations of reservations
etc. There is no analysis by the controller of the possibility of
that said interests and legitimate rights prevail over the legitimate interest that
may claim for the processing of personal data.

Lastly, we must not fail to highlight the very character of those who carry out
zan the treatment of the data. Contrary to what it may seem, their freedom of expression
pressure is limited, like everyone else's, by the constitutional rights of third parties

protection of your personal data. Well, it has not existed, as has already been mentioned.

2017, (R. 114/16), for the correct approach to the issues raised in the
present appeal, it should be underlined that the Constitutional Court, in the judgment
39/2016, of March 3, recalling what was already reasoned in judgment 292/2000,
declares that: "[...] the right to data protection is not unlimited, and although the
Constitution does not expressly impose specific limits, nor does it refer to the powers
public for its determination as it has done with other fundamental rights, not
there is no doubt that they are to be found in the other fundamental rights and
constitutionally protected legal assets, as required by the principle of
unity of the Constitution [...]". Based on the foregoing, and in view of the approach
of the parties, the issue raised in this proceeding is circumscribed to the
weighing trial of rights and interests in confrontation. To this end, it is considered
necessary, in the first place, to define the object and content of the rights
at stake, just as this Chamber has done in previous
occasions in which the same legal controversy has arisen.

Following the STC just cited, it must be stated that the fundamental right

to the protection of data enshrined in article 18.4 of the Spanish Constitution, to
difference from the right to privacy of art. 18.1 CE, with whom he shares the goal
to offer effective constitutional protection of private personal and family life,
excluding the knowledge of others and the interference of third parties against your
will, seeks to guarantee that person a power of control over their data
personal, on its use and destination, with the purpose of preventing its illicit and harmful traffic
for the dignity and rights of the affected. The right to data protection has,
therefore, a broader object than that of the right to privacy, since the right
fundamental to data protection extends its guarantee not only to privacy in its
dimension constitutionally protected by art. 18.1 CE, but to the sphere of
personal assets that belong to the sphere of private life,
inseparably linked to respect for personal dignity, such as the right to honour,
and to the full exercise of the rights of the person. The fundamental right to
Data protection extends the constitutional guarantee to those data that
are relevant or have an impact on the exercise of any rights of the
person, whether or not they are constitutional rights and whether or not they are related to honor,
ideology, personal and family intimacy to any other constitutionally
protected. In this way, the object of the fundamental right to data protection
It is not reduced only to the intimate data of the person, but to any type of data

their rights, whether fundamental or not -such as those that identify or allow the
identification of the person, being able to serve for the preparation of their ideological profile,
racial, sexual, economic or of any other nature, or that serve any other
utility that in certain circumstances constitutes a threat to the individual
because its object is not only individual privacy, already protected by art. 18.1 EC,
but personal data. Consequently, it also reaches those
public personal data that, by virtue of being public, being accessible to the
knowledge of anyone, do not escape the power of disposition of the affected party because
This is guaranteed by your right to data protection. As regards the right to
freedom of expression, in light of the doctrine of the Constitutional Court (SSTC
23/2010, of April 27, and 9/2007, of January 15) enshrined in article 20 of the
Constitution, includes, along with the mere expression of thoughts, beliefs,
ideas, opinions and value judgments, criticism of the conduct of another, even when the
itself is bland and can annoy, worry or upset the person it addresses, since
this is required by pluralism, tolerance and a spirit of openness, without which
there is a democratic society.

Freedom of expression is broader than freedom of information as it does not

that when such freedoms are exercised by information professionals through

protection reaches its maximum level (STC 165/1987, of October 27). Definitely,
the recognition of freedom of expression guarantees the development of a

inherent to the principle of democratic legitimacy. In this sense, it deserves special
constitutional protection the dissemination of ideas that collaborate in the formation of the
public opinion and make it easier for citizens to freely form their opinions and
participate responsibly in public affairs. However, just like
happens with the other fundamental rights, the exercise of the right to freedom
expression is subject to constitutional limits that the Constitutional Court has
progressively outlined. Thus, it does not cover the presence of phrases and expressions
libelous, outrageous and offensive unrelated to the ideas or opinions expressed
expose and, therefore, unnecessary for this purpose, nor does it protect the disclosure of
facts that are but simple rumours, inventions or insinuations devoid of
foundation, nor does it give shelter to snares or insults, since it does not recognize a
pretended right to insult. Along with this, the expansive trend of freedom of
expression also finds its limit in respect for the normative content
guaranteed by other fundamental rights, whose affectation is not necessary
for the constitutional realization of the right. Delimitation that can only be done
through the proper weighting of the conflicting constitutional values, among
which highlights the guarantee of the existence of public opinion, indissolubly
coupled with political pluralism, it should be remembered that, as recognized by the
paragraph 4 of art. 20 CE, all the freedoms recognized in the precept have their
limit on the right to honor, privacy, self-image and protection of the
youth and childhood, which fulfill a "limiting function" in relation to these
freedoms. Therefore, the protection of these other rights is weakened
constitutional rights recognized by article 20.4 CE against the freedoms of expression
and information, when exercised in connection with matters that are of interest
general, by the matters to which they refer and by the people who intervene in them
and contribute, consequently, to the formation of public opinion, as occurs
when they affect public persons, who exercise public functions or are
involved in matters of public relevance, thus forced to bear a certain
risk that their subjective rights of personality will be affected by
opinions or information of general interest (SSTC 107/1988, of June 8,
20/2002, of January 28, 160/2003, of September 15, 151/2004, of September 20
September, and 9/2007, January 15).>>

In the case analyzed, it is being judged whether it is necessary to include the data
of the landlord in the tweets published by three members of the party
claimed politician. As indicated, there is a collision between the right of
information/freedom of expression, and the right to protection of personal data
of the landlord of the dwelling, who also has the same name as another person
who has been harmed with the information. By weighing the interests of the
lessor, we must determine that your right to the protection of your rights prevails.

situation of the family that could not pay the rent and their circumstances.

The infraction attributed to PODEMOS is typified in article
83.5 a) of the RGPD, which considers that the infringement of “the basic principles for the
treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5,
6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83 of the
aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 maximum or,

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the RGPD, the aforementioned Regulation
has in its art. 58.2 b) the possibility of sanctioning with a warning, in relation
with what is stated in Considering 148:
