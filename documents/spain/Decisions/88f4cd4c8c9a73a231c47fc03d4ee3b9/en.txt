control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to re-
solve this procedure.

II

Before going into the substance of the matter, remember that in the Initiation Agreement of the pre-
present procedure it was mentioned that, in the case of not making any allegation to the
itself, this could be considered a “resolution proposal”.

Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP) -provision of which
the party claimed was informed in the agreement to open the proceeding- established
that if allegations are not made within the stipulated period on the content of the agreement,
initiation document, when it contains a precise statement about the response
imputed responsibility, may be considered a resolution proposal. In the present
In this case, the agreement to initiate the sanctioning file determined the facts in which
that the imputation was specified, the infraction of the RGPD attributed to the claimed one and the
sanction that could be imposed. Therefore, taking into consideration that the claimant
mada has not formulated allegations to the agreement of beginning of the file and in attention to
established in article 64.2.f) of the LPACAP, the aforementioned initial agreement is considered
in the present case proposed resolution.

In the present case, the claim dated 08/03/21 is examined by me-
gave from which the following fact is transferred:

“The claimant, a neighbor of the adjoining house, observes that there are cameras
focusing on the public road and not strictly on the main entrance and garage of the property
existing in CALLE *** ADDRESS.1 of MADRID...” (folio nº 1).

The facts denounced could imply an affectation to the content of art. 5.1 c)
RGPD (regulation currently in force) that provides: “personal data will be:

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed (“data minimization”) (…)”.

Likewise, in the case of false cameras, they must be oriented
to a private area, avoiding intimidation of neighboring neighbors who are unaware
know whether or not they process personal data.

IV

In accordance with the "evidence" available in this proceeding,
sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the claimed party is the owner of a
property that has a video-surveillance camera system, which is
capturing pedestrian traffic zone without just cause.

The main evidence provided by the claimant makes it possible to verify the facts
that are the subject of a claim, observing at first glance the poor orientation
affecting the nearby pedestrian area (evidence document No. 1).

The known facts are therefore constitutive of an infraction, attributable to
the claimed party, for violation of the content of art. 5.1 c) GDPR, previously
aforementioned.

section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, treating-
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of

amount:

a)

the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

When motivating the sanction, the following is taken into account:

-the nature of the infraction by having a video-surveillance system that is
oriented towards public area without just cause, treating data of natural persons
identifiable or identifiable in an undetermined number (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

-the intentionality or negligence of the infringement, (art. 83.2 b) RGPD), since with the
video-surveillance system is intimidating nearby neighbors, without just cause
tified any, highlighting the bad orientation a priori of the installation of the device
(s).

The evidence provided is considered sufficient to initially prove the
infraction object of imputation, when verifying the bad orientation of the same (s), as well
as the absence of response despite the requirements of this body
on concrete and precise questions; Also taking into account the absence of
prior sanctions in this regard.

For all these reasons, it is agreed to impose a sanction amounting to €1,500 (one thousand qui-
hundred euros), by having a camera system that excessively records the area of
third parties, being able to affect the public area, without attending to any requirement, sanction
located in the lower scale of this type of infractions and according to the nature of the
facts described in relation to a natural person.

Among the corrective powers contemplated in article 58 of the RGPD, in its section 2
d) it is established that each control authority may “order the person in charge or
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions
of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within
a specified period…”. The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and after assessing the graduation criteria
tion of the sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE ***EMPRESA.1, with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction of the
Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of €1,500
