FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority
of control, and according to what is established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure.

II

The RGPD indicates 5.1.a) of the RGPD that “Personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,

loyalty and transparency»);

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which

are processed ("data minimization");

If there is no legitimate basis for data processing, a
illicit data processing. The various legitimate bases are contained in article 6, which
entitled "Legality of the treatment", and that indicates:

cases, or in some, or to internal office work, as well as to be taken into account
other important issues such as the development of a protocol or internal regulations that
take into account the complete information on the purpose of the system insofar as
is related to that public security, as well as information to employees, content
denying their access rights, among other issues.

It follows that due to the lack of some content in the service part of the claim,
***POSITION.1 judged, and under its own will, decided to correlate the content
of the images to verify if the visit that accompanied the employee could relate-
with the provision of the entrusted service or with union matters, since the part
of service of the claimant did not contain any mention to that end.

work activity of the claimant with the treatment of images carried out by the entity that

claimant the interference in his right to privacy that he also holds in the development
of their professional work, to know if their data is collected and for what purposes and destination, and about
which there were no rational expectations of different uses.

Article 4.7 of the RGPD indicates: “responsible for the treatment” or “responsible”: the
natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, alone or together with
others, determine the purposes and means of the treatment; if the law of the Union or of the
Member States determines the purposes and means of processing, the data controller

In this case, the ***POSITION.1 above, acts in the performance of his duties and
as a representative of the City Council; therefore, the City Council is responsible for the
treatment as a legal person, and this regardless of whether the person-***POST.1-
It is not the one that currently holds that condition.

The Judgment of the Plenary of the TC 292/2000, of 11/30, indicates that “the fundamental right

I quote and harmful to the dignity and rights of the affected.” He adds that "this power of disposition
about the personal data itself nothing is worth if the affected party does not know what data is the
owned by third parties, who owns them, and for what purpose".

In this case, considering that the images that are treated with the video system
surveillance are aimed at the purpose of security and internal surveillance of the building's headquarters, not
of labor control and without connection with the performance of the work activity, have been used
for the verification related to the issue of the development of the service of the claiming agent-
te, violating the provisions of article 5.1.a) of the RGPD.

  Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for treatment, including the conditions for consent under the articles
5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83
of the aforementioned Regulation, with administrative fines of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
from a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of business

Article 83.7 of the RGPD indicates:
“Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under the
Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether it can,
and to what extent, imposing administrative fines on authorities and public bodies is
established in that Member State.
