Based on the evidence available in this proceeding
disciplinary action, it is considered that the claimed party has proceeded to install a system
of video-surveillance without having the informed consent of the group of
owners of the property.

The GDPR defines the "data controller" (art. 4 section 7) of data as the
natural or legal person, service, body or similar entity that determines the purposes
and means of treatment. In other words, it is the person who must inform about the purpose of the treatment.
procedure and the means chosen for it, being in the present case the Community of
owners (claimed).

The installation of video surveillance cameras in communities of owners
requires the informed consent of the group of neighbors, and must be
aware of the presence of a video surveillance system that controls in their
case the entry of the property, and the aforementioned agreement must be embodied in the
corresponding <Order of the day> and duly approved in the exposed terms.

According to the GDPR, consent shall be understood as "the expression of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which a person accepts, through a clear
affirmative action, the processing of your personal data” (art. 4 point 11).

The defendant's allegations are in contradiction because initially
provides documentation of the celebration of the Extraordinary Meeting dated 07/19/22, while
that in response to the proposal of this body states that due to a
"transcription error" it was held on 07/19/21.

Article 19.3 of the LPH (Law 49/1960) provides that the record "should be closed

with the signatures of the president and the secretary...".

Without going into the strict formalities that the drafting of the Minutes must comply with
of a Board of owners, from the point of view of data protection, it is not
provide any documentation that proves the real and effective notification to the set of
owners (as) informing them of the installation of the system, its purpose or
way, where appropriate, to exercise your rights within the framework of the current GDPR.

Nor is it provided despite the time elapsed since the celebration of the
itself, if we stick to the second allegations, copy of the Act duly
signed by the group of owners (as) of the property, which supports
documented an "informed consent" on the installation of the system in
question.

Therefore, neither the initial allegations nor the documentary presented were in-
confirms that the defendant had adopted the necessary measures so that the system
installed conforms to the requirements determined in the exposed regulations, considering
stating the claimant's account of the facts in accordance with what is stated in his claim,
that is, the surprise installation of a video-surveillance system without the
informed about it, obtaining their express consent or the opportunity to
speak out about it.

The known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the party
claimed from article 6 section 1 letter e) GDPR, previously mentioned.

IV.

The art. 83.5 GDPR provides the following: "Violations of the following provisions
These will be penalized, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20
000 000 EUR maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount
to a maximum of 4% of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
previous year, opting for the one with the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment including the conditions for the

consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9 (…)”.

Article 83 GDPR section 2 contemplates within the "General conditions for

criteria for its imposition, evaluating in the present case the letters a) and b).

In the present case, it is taken into account that it is a Community of owners
rios, assessing the lack of information to the property owners about the pre-
absence of the system and the null initial collaboration of the defendant despite being known
ceding the existence of the claim, to finally impose a penalty of
€1,000, a sanction located on the lower scale for this type of conduct, considering
conduct described as gross negligence.

V

The text of the resolution establishes which have been the infractions committed and
the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
data, from which it is clearly inferred what are the measures to adopt, without prejudice
that the type of procedures, mechanisms or concrete instruments for
implement them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is responsible for the
treatment who fully knows its organization and has to decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the
LOPDGDD.
