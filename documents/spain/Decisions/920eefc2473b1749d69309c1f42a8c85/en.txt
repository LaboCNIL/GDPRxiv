FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to re-
solve this procedure.

II

Before addressing the merits of the matter and in relation to the complaint made by the complaint,
ciated that the claimant also has an illegal camera system, it is re-
rope that must file the corresponding Complaint before this body, providing
irrefutable proof of what was stated (eg photography, absence of poster, etc.).

Once admitted for processing, it will follow the same procedural channel.

than the one made with the current claim.

Article 62 Law 39/2015 (October 1) provides: "A complaint is understood to be the
act by which any person, in compliance or not with a legal obligation, puts
knowledge of an administrative body the existence of a certain fact
that could justify the ex officio initiation of an administrative procedure.

In any case, the fact that both parties have “irrespective” camera systems
gular” does not legitimize for any the treatment of data carried out outside the cases
permitted by law.

Likewise, the mere presence of the camera does not determine that it captures beyond
than necessary, for which it is necessary to know what is being recorded with the
same.

In the present case, the claim dated 07/09/20 is examined by me-
gave from which the following is transferred as fact:

“For more than a month in the house located just in front of
our property, specifically in the property with cadastral reference ***REFERENCE-
CIA.1, located at ***ADDRESS.1, a camera has been placed in its part
superior, oriented to the public thoroughfare and to our building (...)”.

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems installed
felled comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with all
the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of video surveillance cameras on the street corresponds solely and exclusively to
to the State Security Forces and Bodies in the performance of functions

personal character.

The art. 22 section 4 of LO 3/2018, December 5 provides the following:

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing a computerized device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment
to, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative positive a connection code or internet address to this information”.

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding

The installation of surveillance cameras that record part of the public thoroughfare should limit
only what is strictly necessary, always respecting the principle of proportionality.
This means that its placement must be proportional to the purpose pursued, in this case

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
must be oriented towards private space, since it is considered that this type of
devices can affect the privacy of third parties, who are intimidated by the
herself in the belief of being the object of permanent recording.

On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install devices for obtaining

images of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

IV

In accordance with the evidence available in this proceeding
sanctioning party, it is considered that the defendant has a device oriented
into public and/or private space of a third party without just cause.

The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: The personal data will be:

“adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed (“data minimization”)”.

It should be noted that the device installed on the facade of the house captures
the entire width of the public transit area (since it is no more than 4 meters wide)
width), obtaining images of the vehicles that transit, as well as the data of
everyone who is in the width of the road.

It must be taken into account that regardless of the security of the dwelling,
da, with the same affects the rights of third parties that are permanently
recorded in their daily work due to the narrow width of the road, therefore the
installation of the same is not suitable for the intended purpose.

The installation of this type of device is restricted, and must be

ity or even interior chambers).

So that in the weighting of conflicting interests it is considered appropriate
ted to protect the right to data protection of the neighbors across the street, since
otherwise these would be permanently controlled in their inputs/outputs
of the dwelling in question.

The right of the plaintiff covers the tranquility of his private life,
a better placement of the system in question being enough for there to be a balance
between the rights of both parties, not being controlled by the same in its que-
everyday doings.

The fact that the installation was carried out by a third party “NetworkBurgoSat
S.L” does not exempt the responsibility of the owner of the system, without prejudice to the actions
that in his case could make the complaint against the installation company.

Building security can be achieved by restricting the field of vision
of the cameras or performing a reinstallation of the system, with a greater number
of cameras or even with interior cameras, weighting the rest of the rights in
conflicts and the proportionality of the measure taking into account the characteristics of
the area to install.

The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the defendant, for
Violation of the content of article 5.1 c) RGPD.
