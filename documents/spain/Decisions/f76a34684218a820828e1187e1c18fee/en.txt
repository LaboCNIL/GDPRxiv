In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a

 The image is a personal data

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the RGPD defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

The images generated by a camera or video camera system are data from
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to the protection regulations
of data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the reported video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

III

 alleged infringement

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the legalization of the
treatment of personal data.

Regarding the treatment for video surveillance purposes, article 22 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out the processing of images through camera systems or video cameras
in order to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as their
installations.

Article 12.1 of the RGPD indicates that whoever carries out data processing
personal, such as capturing images through a system of
video surveillance, you must provide the interested parties with the information indicated in the
articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD.

In order for the duty of information provided for in article 12 of the RGPD to be
complies in a concise and understandable manner for the affected party, the aforementioned article 22 of the
LOPDGDD foresees in relation to video surveillance a system of "information by
layers".

In this sense, the first layer must refer, at least, to the existence of the
treatment (video surveillance), the identity of the person in charge, the possibility of exercising the
rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD and where to obtain more
information on the processing of personal data.

Second layer information should be readily available in one place
accessible to the affected party, whether it is an information sheet at a reception, cashier, etc...,
placed in a visible public space or in a web address, and must refer to the
rest of the elements of article 13 of the RGPD.

It is not necessary to specify the precise location of the video surveillance equipment.

This duty of information shall be understood to be fulfilled by placing a
informative device in a sufficiently visible place, and at least, in the accesses
to the monitored areas, whether indoors or outdoors. In case the space
video-surveillance has several accesses, it must have said identification badge
video-monitored area in each of them.

This information must be provided in advance -considering 39 of the RGPD-. The
The goal is to make the context of the surveillance clear.

The processing of personal data is subject to the rest of the principles of the
treatment contained in article 5 of the RGPD. We will highlight the principle of
minimization of data contained in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD that provides that the

personal data will be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
for the purposes for which they are processed”.

This means that in a specific treatment only the data can be processed.
timely personal, that come to the case and that are strictly necessary
to fulfill the purpose for which they are processed. The treatment must be adjusted and
proportional to the purpose to which it is directed. The relevance in the treatment of
data must occur both at the time of data collection and in the
subsequent treatment of the same.

In accordance with the above, the processing of excessive data must be restricted or
proceed to their removal.

The application of the principle of data minimization in the field of video surveillance
entails that images cannot be captured from public roads, since the
treatment of images in public places, unless authorized
governmental, can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Bodies.

On some occasions, for the protection of private spaces, where
installed cameras on facades or inside, it may be necessary to ensure the
security purpose the recording of a portion of the public highway.

That is, cameras and video cameras installed for security purposes may not
obtain images of public roads unless it is essential for that purpose, or
it is impossible to avoid it due to their location. And in that case
extraordinary, the cameras will only be able to capture the minimum portion necessary to
preserve the safety of people and property, as well as its facilities.

In no case will the use of surveillance practices beyond the environment be allowed.

surrounding buildings, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the space
guarded.

Installed cameras cannot get images from third-party proprietary space
and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can they affect
the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the area.

It is not allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of
neighbors with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without cause
justified.

Nor can images be captured or recorded in spaces owned by third parties.
without the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the people who
find.

Likewise, it is disproportionate to capture images in private spaces, such
such as changing rooms, lockers or worker rest areas.
