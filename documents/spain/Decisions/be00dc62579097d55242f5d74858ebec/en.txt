In the present case, in accordance with what is stated in the proven fact
First, the claimants filed two separate claim briefs on 11/20/2018
before the AEPD, directed against the defendant and related to the procedure of
control of absences of the teaching staff of ***IES.1 of ***LOCALIDAD.1 through

The Director of the educational center sent, at the request of the DPD of CONEDE, the
documentation containing the development of the procedure and the measures that had been
adopted to carry out the implementation of the access and control system time-
river by fingerprint.

The DPD of CONEDE has provided the answers offered to the claimants
about the decision adopted, in response to the requirement of the AEPD, although it is
It is true that in the aforementioned document it was recognized that although the interested parties had been

mentioned concept and that in the future when personal data were to be processed
proceeded in this way.

It also indicated that the claim had been forwarded to the Directorate
General for Teaching Staff and Human Resources Management, which is listed as responsible
of the treatment activity “Control of presence inside the administrative offices
administrations, educational centers and services dependent on the Ministry of Education
management for the management of compliance with working hours and schedules” and that the General Secretary
Technical Council of the Ministry had already ruled on this matter, holding
that presence control was an important element of the principle of transparency
that should preside over the public performance and a guarantee of equality that should exist
among public employees.

First of all, reference must be made to the issue raised by the DPO
of the claimed in his letter of 11/18/2019 in relation to the person responsible for the treatment-
ment, since in addition to what is indicated in the previous paragraph, in the aforementioned writing
stated that: "... now, given that the treatment that gives rise to the opening
of the sanctioning procedure before the Ministry has been decided in terms of
its ends and means by the management of the educational center ... it is to said management that

In addition, in the Personal Data Protection Guide for

In this sense, the Ministry of Education of the Junta de Andalucía has created

In relation to the other issues raised in the present case, there would have been

with reference both to the legal bases that cover said type of control of
access, as well as the basic information referred to in article 13 of the
GDPR.

In the case examined, the installation of a control system based on the
collection and treatment of the fingerprint of the employees, implies the treatment of

This means that in the present case, in accordance with article 9.1 of the
RGPD, the specific regime provided for the special categories of
data provided for in article 9 of the RGPD.

In this sense, recital 51 of the RGPD highlights the nature

restrictive with which the treatment of this data can be admitted:

“(51) ... Such personal data should not be processed, unless it is allowed
their treatment in specific situations contemplated in this Regulation,

fundamental liberties.

In accordance with these considerations, the treatment of biometric data re-
will want, in addition to the concurrence of one of the legal bases established in the
article 6 of the RGPD, any of the exceptions provided in article 9.2 of the RGPD.

The analysis of the legal basis of legitimacy to carry out this treatment comes
of article 6 of the RGPD, regarding the legality of the treatment, which in its section 1, letter

In the Spanish legal system, article 20 of the Consolidated Text of the Statute of

However, in relation to the foregoing and the need to inform
tion to the interested parties, it should be noted in relation to the biometric data that the
themselves are closely linked to a person, since they can use a
certain unique property of an individual for identification or authentication.

According to Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies,”
Biometric data irrevocably changes the relationship between the body and identity.
since they make the features of the human body readable by
machines and are subject to further use.”

In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that different types of
treatments by pointing out that "Biometric data can be processed and stored in
different ways. Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is al-
macerated and treated raw, which allows the source from which it comes to be recognized without
special knowledge; for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a
fingerprint or voice recording. Other times, raw biometric information
captured is treated in such a way that only certain characteristics or traits are extracted and
they are saved as a biometric template.”

The processing of this data is expressly permitted by the RGPD when
where the employer has a legal basis, which is usually the contract itself
of work. In this regard, the STS of July 2, 2007 (Rec. 5017/2003), which has en-

However, the following should be noted:

1. The worker must be informed about these treatments in the terms

of article 13 of the RGPD.

2. The principles of limitation of the purpose, necessity, pro-

proportionality and data minimization.

3. Use of biometric templates: Biometric data must be stored
as biometric templates whenever possible. The template must be extracted from
a way that is specific to the biometric system in question and not used
by other controllers of similar systems in order to ensure that
a person can only be identified in biometric systems that have
a legal basis for this operation.
