SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant, the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out actions for its clarification, under the powers of
investigation granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the RGPD. A) Yes,
On 01/08/19, an information request was addressed to the entity VODAFONE.

Regarding this requirement, the Electronic Notifications Support Service and
Electronic Address Enabled, certifies that it was notified on 01/08/19. However, to
date 04/08/19, the claimed entity had NOT yet sent to this Agency, any
type of information about the matter.

THIRD: On 04/09/19, the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the claimed entity, by virtue of
the powers established in article 58.2 of the RGPD and in articles 47, 64.2 and
68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), for the infringement of the
article 6 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5. of the RGPD and considered very serious
in 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, arguing essentially that: “the claimant

company, when it becomes aware of this complaint, on 11/08/18, proceeds to
deactivate all services provided on behalf of the claimant, but still
keeping alive the debt generated by the consumption of said services. For other
part, in the copies of the contracts provided by the company VODAFONE, in its
written response to the Ministry of Health of the CACM, it is observed that, the
name and ID of the claimant appears in the customer data, but all lack
signature in the "client signature" area.

FOURTH: Once the initiation agreement has been notified, the entity claimed, by means of a letter of
dated 04/30/19, made, in summary, the following allegations:

information request E/0001/2019 were submitted to the Agency on the same
April 8, 2019, in the Registry. A copy of the same is attached as Doc. 1.

Vodafone is aware that these allegations and the explanation of what happened are
submitted after the deadline. This happened like this, as a consequence of the great
number of requests that it has been receiving since the entry into force of the RGPD.
After receiving said request, Vodafone re-analyzed the claim and,
Firstly, it confirmed that the services had been terminated since the
November 2018 (as had already been reported to the Ministry of
Health of the Autonomous Community of Castilla La Mancha), and also requested the
cancellation of the debt that had been left pending. This resolution was
communicated to Mrs. A.A.A. by letter attached as Doc. 2, dated 4
April 2019.
Once the Agency has been informed that the claim was
resolved completely (canceled the debt and duly informed the claimant
thereof), in accordance with the documentation provided in the request for
information, the hiring made in the name of the claimant had the appearance
of a dear and also correct hiring and that my client displayed the
due diligence, that is, that which may be required in contracting processes
carried out through remote means, as in the case at hand, where the
hiring was made through a call received in our call center,
Unison.
Specifically, the registration of the lines occurred through a request received by
call and were activated on 04/26/18, resulting deactivated
subsequently after the claim in the month of November 2018. Attached are
as Doc. 3, copy of the contract that is not signed because it is generated
automatically by the tool when a distance contract is made to
through teleshopping, in compliance with current regulations. Also attached is
as Doc. 4, the recordings that we have where the
recapitulation of the contracts made, the first of them, audible from
of minute 18:30 on the acquisition of the terminal and the second, where the
financing of the terminal, audible from minute 9. In it you can
check that the person provides the details of the contract. Also, there is
of the delivery notes of the terminals, Docs. 5-6.
Finally, there were bills with consumption, as can be seen from the
invoices that are attached as Doc. 7. Attached as Doc. 8, a report in which
It can be verified that there are even interactions where supposedly Mrs.
A.A.A. demanded the billing of the services, not denying in any case said
hiring but quite the opposite, reaffirming it, which turns out to be a
one more clue that made him think that the hiring made in his name was
completely correct.
It is evident that my client was also the victim of a deception by a
impersonator, not being able to be attributed any intentionality in the facts or
nor lack of diligence because my client requested the celebration of a
contract, made a recording to confirm the hiring and financing of the
terminal, has the signed delivery notes as proof of delivery of the terminals
and also has invoices with consumption and interactions in the systems about
from service. For this reason, it understands that it has adopted the measures that may be in its
hand to avoid situations of fraud and that the hiring has the appearance of
correct.

In relation to these facts, my client wants to reiterate the lack of
infringing intent that governs the acts carried out by Vodafone in the
file that concerns us.
In this sense, it is relevant to highlight the repeal of article 130 of Law 30/1992,
of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the
Common Administrative Procedure. Its substitution by article 28.1 of the Law
40/2015 of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector eliminates the mention of
the "simple non-observance" making the rule "nullum poena sine culpa" prevail.
The foregoing comes only to highlight the lack of room for the
responsibility without fault, principle that governs or must govern in the administrative field
sanctioning, because to the extent that it is a manifestation of "ius puniendi" of the State,
It is inadmissible in our legal system a liability regime
no fault
In this sense, it indicates Judgment of the Constitutional Court number 219/1988, and this
for being inadmissible a system of strict liability or without fault as
it also comes to point out Judgment 246/1991. I cannot be penalized
represented for infraction of article 6.1. of the LOPD, without reference to the
subjective element of the type, not proving fraud, guilt, or negligence.
Additionally, taking into account the special nature of penalizing law
that determines the impossibility of imposing sanctions without taking into account the will
of the acting subject or the factors that may have determined the breach of a
legal obligation, maintains the inadmissibility of the imposition of any sanction.
Thus, the Supreme Court indicates in the Judgment of December 21, 1998
(RJ1998/10226) (Appeal 9074/1991), January 27, 1996 (RJ 1996\926)
(Appeal 640/1992) and January 20, 1997 (RJ 1997\257) (Appeal of
Appeal 2689/1992)." It also indicates the TS of July 20, 1990, Ar. 6163,
Well, as can be seen, in the behavior described there is no
intentionality, neither by way of intent, nor by way of guilt. Therefore, do not
If there is any guilt, it is totally inadmissible to impose a sanction
any to my client, as long as one of the essential requirements of the
Sanctioning Administrative Law.
For all these reasons, he understands that what is appropriate is for the AEPD to agree on the dismissal
of this file and the filing of the proceedings since the facts have been
produced without any intention on the part of my client and it seems that
due to some kind of error. Subsidiarily and in the event that despite the
explanations previously provided, the Agency understands that my client is
deserving of a sanction for the commission of an infringement of art. 6.1. of the GDPR,
the amount of said sanction must be moderate, imposing its minimum amount,
taking into account the following circumstances set forth in art. 83.2 of the GDPR:
It is requested, therefore, to agree: The dismissal of the file, with the consequent
record of proceedings. Subsidiarily with respect to what is intended in number
1, impose on my represented the sanctions for minor infractions in their degree
minimum. Subsidiarily regarding what is intended in number 2, impose on my
represented the sanctions for serious infractions in their minimum degree”.

the entity.
 : On 06/05/19, the sanctioning resolution proposal is notified
SIXTH
 
consisting in that by the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data is sanctioned to the entity claimed for infringement of art 6.1 of the RGPD,
classified as very serious for prescription purposes, in article 72.1.b) of
LOPDGDD, with a fine of 120,000 euros, in accordance with the provisions of the
article 83.5 of the aforementioned RGPD, arguing that:
“In the first place, this Agency required the entity claimed to report on the
facts denounced, on 01/08/19, granting a period of one month for it, but
it is not until 04/08/19 (3 months later), when the entity sends the information
required, therefore, it has not been possible to take into consideration said information when
have submitted it after the deadline.
However, it has been found that the claimant was not a client of the company
and that, according to complaints filed with the Civil Guard and the Ministry of Health
of the CCM, in April 2018 he was the object of a fraud in the usurpation of his data
personal when using them to register 4 telephone lines and the purchase of 2
mobile terminals in the company VODAFONE.
VODAFONE was officially aware of the fraud complaint on 11/05/18 through
of the Ministry of Health of the CCM, although the claimant indicates that months
He had previously contacted the company to report the events.
Well, VODAFONE in its response dated 09/11/18, to the Ministry of
Health of the CCM, recognizes the fraud, by indicating that it cancels the lines discharged
in the name of the claimant, but continues to carry out an irregular treatment of the data
personal by keeping alive the debt of 583.99 euros in his name, since he is followed
claiming.
VODAFONE continues to carry out irregular processing of the personal data of the
claimant, at least until 04/04/19 (5 months later), when, as
As a result of receiving the request from this Agency, proceeds to send a letter of
acknowledgment of fraud and cancellation of debt to the claimant. However, it has not
It has been proven that the company has canceled and deleted the personal data
of their databases yet.
As regards the recordings presented by the company in the
allegations, indicate that said recordings are NOT hiring recordings and/or
portability of services or verification of data, which should have been carried out in
the month of April/May 2018, but they are the recordings of the purchase of the
mobile terminals, made, as can be seen in them, in July 2018. Indicate
In addition, in said recordings there are errors in the indicated digits of the DNI and
of the telephone number, which are not taken into account by the representative of the
company.
In short, while the entity complained against has not demonstrated due diligence
when regularizing the existing fraudulent situation, as required by article 6 of the
RGPD, the existence of an infringement of the RGPD can be declared, in said article,
which sufficiently motivates the present sanctioning procedure”.
