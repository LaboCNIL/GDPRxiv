rare” requesting your credit card information, which you do not provide. Also

existed, that the order in question had been canceled and, subsequently, before his
request for access to the account to delete the bank details, they asked again for the
identification with your ID and credit card. When sending him the data, they replied that
they needed more credit card details, which he objected to. Request to be

Exchange of messages on Twitter from May 27 to June 8
of 2019 in which the claimant states that an order has been made that he
has not applied, that he is worried because the last digits of the card
match yours, that you wanted to access your account and couldn't, and
that the phone to recover the password is not yours. The claimed in
At first, he answers that the email provided does not correspond to
no account and they ask for an order number that you had made in the
past. The claimant provides them with the order number #GJPYLGSVC of
dated 01/06/2018 and the respondent replies that he is aware that the request is not
requested has been canceled without costs and that you will receive the amount charged
incorrectly. The complainant insists that he wishes to remove his data from the
application, for which you want to access it. To do this, the respondent
asks you to perform "a verification that we have sent to your email". The
claimant reproduces the mail in which they request a copy of the DNI and a copy of
the credit card associated with the account that shows your name and the 6
first digits and last 4 digits. The claimant indicates that he sent the photo,
but the claimed insists that the attached images cannot be

information “in order to enable your profile”. The claimant refuses to provide
this data due to distrust in the security of the application, since
in February he had asked to delete the account and they had told him that
they would, but months later you get a message that an order was placed
from the account you had requested to delete. He states that he only wanted
access the application to remove your credit card number and that
you want to delete that account, along with all your personal data. Finally,
the respondent insists that he needs to verify his identity “to proceed with the
refund of the amount paid and then we can cancel the account”. The
Claimant answers that they had first told him that there was no account
with your email, after an order has been blocked with your account (the one that
had said it did not exist), they later told him that the money had been
returned and now they asked for more information to return the amount that was already

Regarding the decision adopted regarding this claim: first
First, the respondent states that “the claimant, having consented to the

Privacy Policy, you accept that the obligation belongs to the user

Regarding the exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
RGPD: the claimed party affirms that when requesting personal data from the claimant
such as your ID or bank details to be able to access your account again,
it can be verified that the RGPD has been correctly complied with,
“by freezing all your personal information in our databases, a
was once requested by the claimant. Such freezing does not mean deletion
total, since according to art 17.3.e) this could produce a situation
of inequality” between the claimed and the claimant.
Regarding the causes of the incident: the respondent points out as possible
external cause unauthorized access to the user's email,
victim of a hack.
Regarding the measures adopted to avoid similar incidents: the
claimed lists the freezing and pseudonymization of the data of the
claimant, in accordance with the aforementioned art. 17.3.e); the cancellation of the order
allegedly fraudulent, despite the fact that this could be due to a possible
hacking not attributable to the claimed; and that they proceeded to signal and block the
complete profile of the user, in order to avoid possible fraud that could
affect you.

On 09/26/2019, in accordance with article 65 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection agreed to admit the claim for processing
filed by the claimant against the respondent.

THIRD: In view of the facts outlined above, the Subdirectorate General
of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary actions of
investigation to clarify the facts in question, by virtue of the
investigative powers granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section
second, of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD).

As a result of the research actions carried out, it is found that the
responsible for the treatment is the claimed.

Likewise, on February 12 and March 4, 2020, an inspection was carried out
face-to-face at the defendant's headquarters, in which the following information was obtained, among others:
information, as can be deduced from the report of previous actions dated

The respondent stated that, at the end of 2018, a measure of
security in its application that consisted in that, whenever a user
authenticate from a new device, a verification code is sent to the
mobile phone that was entered during the registration process. This process
was already used during the registration process to verify that the number of
phone entered was in the possession of the user.
The respondent stated that, after the completion of each order, it is verified
automatically if the operation matches any pattern of attempted
fraud and, if so, an alert appears so that an employee of the
investigated block the account manually and someone from the department of
fraud request more information from the user via email with the

see in the screenshot example provided during the inspection.
The respondent stated that the data of the accounts whose users have
requested deletion or that have been blocked due to suspected fraud
are kept for the periods established for accounting reasons,
operational, fiscal and prescription of crimes and infractions of the
money laundering prevention regulations.
The respondent stated that, of the credit cards, they are only stored in
its information systems the first 6 and the last four digits; the
The rest of the credit card data has only been known by the
user and their payment gateway service provider.
The respondent stated that the claimant requested the cancellation of his account
user but did not confirm that cancellation; and that the account was blocked when
the respondent was aware that this account could be subject to
fraud, and subsequently the user account was deleted.
The user account with which the order was supposedly placed on the 27th of
May 2019 has the date of creation in the information systems
of the claimed on June 1, 2018, and as erasure date the 10 of
September 2019. This follows the screenshots taken
during the inspection in the database and on the platform of
administration of the investigated on the order KI17LG1HM and the data of the
customer ***ID.4, associated with that order.
At the time of the inspection, the customer data ***ID.4,
associated with the order placed on May 27, 2019, were marked
as “FRAUD DELETED” and had been pseudonymized, without appearing the
name or surname of the client in the administration platform, which
is clear from the screenshot of the customer data ***ID.4 in the
claimed administration platform.
In the document filed on behalf of the respondent, dated in
the AEPD on July 17, 2020 and entry registration number 025445/2020,
the following is declared: That after the deletion of the data, to demonstrate the
traceability of the protocol carried out, a new profile was created ad hoc without
personal information; for this reason, the date of creation provided coincides with
the date of account deletion.

FOURTH: On September 1, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimant, with
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,
LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article
83.5.a) of the GDPR.

FIFTH: Having been notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the respondent submitted a written
allegations dated September 30, 2020 in which, in summary, it stated
that “the events that occurred in relation to the account of the complaining user coincide
fully with the usual behavior pattern of cybercriminals who use
data traded on the black market in Eastern European countries such as
Ukraine to impersonate the identity of its victims and make fraudulent purchases.

In this specific case, we will see that the cyberattack is carried out from Ukraine and that
takes advantage of the negligent action of the claimant, by repeatedly using the same
key in different services that were affected by a security breach that
exposed his credentials.

After the different hypotheses analyzed in the investigation, my client has arrived
to the conclusion that these credentials were used by the claimant and
subsequently by the attacker in successive Glovo accounts.

“The website haveibeenpwned.com offers a free service that allows anyone to
user to check if his email address appears on these lists, and therefore
So, if your keys have been compromised and you need to change them immediately. Yes
we introduce the address ***EMAIL.1 in this database, it is verified that the
The claimant's credentials have been exposed in five security breaches and
two attempts or indications of attack”.

“This means that the email address and passwords of the
claimant have been exposed in five security breaches or disclosures of
data from different servers:
● Three security breaches prior to opening the Glovo account.
● A list of exposed data discovered prior to opening the account
in Glovo.
● A list of rich data discovered after the opening of the
account in Glovo, but with data that was older. We attach
as DOCUMENT ONE the report on these security breaches”.

The respondent also alleges that “The investigation also showed that the
The claimant had another Glovo account opened with the address ***EMAIL.2, address
delivery and credit card (matching initial and final digits). Using the
same resource, it is verified that this direction was exposed in nine breaches of
security".

“Cyber attacks based on lists of credentials acquired on the black market
exploit the negligence of users who use the same passwords in
the different online services they hire.

This would justify the fact that the claimant's credentials appeared on lists
enriched. Rich lists include data that has been verified and that
have been completed with the contributions of other cybercriminals who have
successfully exploited.

The end result is that the data of the claimant initially exposed in these
lists were limited to the email address and password, and, in the
latest versions of 2019 the claimant data had been enriched with
much more data, including:

1. Geographic location
2. Employment data
3. Phone numbers

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/37

4. Profiles on social networks
5. Credit cards”

“This makes it an exponent of scant diligence in the management and custody of its
credentials, as your history of keys exposed in security breaches is
starts in 2008 and runs through 2019, and the success of identity theft confirms
that during all this time the claimant has not changed the access codes
repeatedly engaged.

In the Terms and Conditions that regulate the service, available at
https://glovoapp.com/es/legal/terms, Glovo warns users of its
responsibility with respect to the choice of your passwords and when using the app of
Glovo the user expressly accepts these obligations:

“Clause 17. - Users are fully responsible for the access and correct
use of your profile and other contents of the Platform subject to legality
in force, whether national or international of the Country from which you use the Platform,
as well as the principles of good faith, morality, good customs and public order.
And specifically, it acquires the commitment to diligently observe these
General Conditions of Use.

Users are responsible for correctly consigning usernames and
individual, non-transferable and sufficiently complex passwords, as well as not
use the same username and password as on other platforms, all with
the purpose of protecting your account from fraudulent use by third parties unrelated to the
platform. (...)”

The defendant in his allegations raises four possible lines of investigation:

“The change of the CRM application destined to collect all the actions and
customer transactions prevents my client from having the logs with the details
of the operations carried out in 2018, so the investigation has focused on
verify or refute the four working hypotheses that we will develop in the following
points, showing that Glovo's performance has been diligent in the four
scenarios.

1. First hypothesis. - The cyber attacker used the credentials of the claimant,
unlocked and restored the old account.

2. Second hypothesis. - The claimant never verified his mobile phone number and the
double factor authentication was left unactivated. It is possible that an account
inactive for a few months (dormant account), go into a sleep mode
semilock and do not react to the delete command.

3. Third hypothesis. - The cyber attacker created a new account using the address
e-mail and credit card data of the claimant, obtained in
the black market

4. Fourth hypothesis. - The claimant opened a new account after deletion
from the previous one.”

8/37

Regarding the first hypothesis (that the cyber attacker used the credentials of the
claimant and restored the old account), the respondent lists in his pleadings
a series of requirements that should have been met and concludes that the respondent made the
deletion and blocking of the claimant's data correctly and that he communicated
suppression to the claimant, for which he provides as DOCUMENT 2 the capture of the
screen extracted from the backup, in which this confirmation appears.

In this Document 2, a table is attached in which you can see, among other things, the

The claimed party indicates that in order to have made the fraudulent order, the cybercriminal
you should have gotten admin permissions and done all the steps
described and having circumvented all the obstacles established to prevent it.

It also points out that it would be absolutely disproportionate to mount such an attack
powerful to make a tiny order.

For all these reasons, the respondent concludes that this first hypothesis must be rejected.

The respondent also points out the possibility that the confusion generated by the
duplication of accounts of the claimant and the exercise of the right of deletion limited to
one of them made the other remain operational and that was the one that the attacker
used to impersonate the claimant's identity.

Regarding the second hypothesis (the claimant never verified his telephone number
mobile and the double authentication factor was left unactivated. An account may
to be inactive for a few months (dormant account), go into a sleep mode
semi-blocking and does not react to the deletion order), the respondent alleges that "a
account not verified and without the double factor activated matches a pattern of attempt of
fraud and therefore the account is blocked. This lock would be different from the post lock
deletion, since in fraud attempts the blocked data remains in the database
main data because they must be consulted by the anti-fraud team to prevent
new fraud attempts.

However, this hypothesis does not fit with the fact that my client verified and
confirmed in February 2018 that the account had been successfully deleted.”

“In any case, the blocking derived from a suspicion of fraud, justifies that the
data are kept in the main database, since they serve to verify new
fraud attempts coming from the same email account, the same
mobile or the same final figures of the credit card.

My client understands that the maintenance of data suspected of having
participated in a fraud attempt is a correct and necessary purpose to protect
to the client itself, which would justify its conservation in the main database after the
claimant's deletion request.

Regarding the third hypothesis (the cyber attacker created a new account using the
email address and credit card details of the claimant,
obtained on the black market), the respondent alleges that "The AEPD found, in the
course of the inspection at Glovo, and considers it a proven fact that the
Fraudulent order was made with an account that had been created on June 1,
2018. This is repeated several times in the agreement to start the sanctioning procedure
and in the records of the inspection.

This information is very important, because it shows that the account with which the
fraudulent order was not the same one that the claimant created. IT'S AN ACCOUNT
DIFFERENT.

The first account had the ID ***ID.1 and the second had the ID ***ID.3.

In addition, the first account used a MASTERCARD card and the second a card
VISA.

Let us remember that the proven facts begin in February 2018, when the
complainant requests the deletion of his account and the deletion of his data.

However, the checks carried out by the AEPD show that the account
used to place the fraudulent order was created FOUR MONTHS LATER
that the claimant requested the cancellation of his account and Glovo proceeded to
delete and block the data.

We understand that it was the cybercriminal who opened that account in June 2018 with
the data that it had obtained in the lists of e-mail addresses that were
they sell on the internet and on the black market.

This would certify that the deletion of the account and the blocking of the data was carried out
correctly, otherwise the cybercriminal would not have been able to use the
same email address.

The respondent indicates that, for this hypothesis to be feasible, there should have been
met the following requirements:

The respondent also alleges that it is notorious and widely known that, in the
deep internet black market, credit card data can be acquired
that have been exposed and that lists of accounts can be purchased with credit cards
credit not canceled after a security breach. And that the defendant defends that the
cyber attacker obtained the credit card data associated with the address of
claimant's mail on one of these lists.

To do this, it highlights two facts:

1. The claimant suffered a security breach in their Dropbox account, where
could keep your credit card details.

2. The claimant's details were on the enriched list that was discovered in
2019, but contained data from a higher age, which had been
enriched with contributions from other cybercriminals.

The defendant points out that Ukraine is also a country historically related to
phishing, so the ease of accessing credit card data is very
higher than that of other countries. And that, for all these reasons, he considers that the most probable option
It is possible that the cybercriminal used the claimant's credit card details
to place the fraudulent order, since the other options are much less
probable.

The respondent also points out that the charge related to the fraudulent order never reached
be made, since it was Glovo that detected a suspicious pattern and blocked the payment,
Therefore, no damage was caused to the claimant at any time.

Finally, the respondent indicates that, according to the evidence contained in the
procedure, obtained during the inspection at the Glovo offices, and provided
by the claimant and the respondent, the chronology of the events is as follows:

And it alleges that “This chronology fits perfectly with the proven facts and
demonstrates that my client acted diligently and without violating the regulations of
Data Protection.

The simple possibility that the events occurred in this way and not
As the Agency maintains, but does not prove, it allows my client to benefit from the
principle of presumption of administrative innocence and adopts as a hypothesis more
plausible that relating to the creation of a new account by the attacker, which in
at no time has it been contradicted by the Agency.”

Regarding the fourth hypothesis (the claimant opened a new account after the
deletion of the previous one), the respondent indicates that this hypothesis would not be unreasonable,
since, in addition to the Glovo ***EMAIL.1 account, the claimant had the
account ***EMAIL.2, of which he had forgotten its existence, or at least only exercised the
right of suppression in relation to one of them.

"For this reason, and despite the fact that the system logs do not keep the data from June
2018 to check the IP address from which the opening of this
new account, it is perfectly feasible that the claimant opened a new account
on June 1, 2018 and then forget that he had opened it.

This hypothesis would fully fit with the initial deletion of the data and the subsequent
identity theft by the cybercriminal, since the data of the
second account opened by the claimant would not have been deleted.

Remember that the IDs of the two accounts were different and the credit cards
also.

The chronology of events relating to this hypothesis would be as follows:

This timeline also fits the proven facts and shows that my
represented acted diligently and without infringing data protection regulations.

Also in this hypothesis, the simple possibility that the events occurred
in this way and not as the Agency maintains, but does not credit, allows my
represented to benefit from the principle of presumption of administrative innocence and adopts
The most plausible hypothesis is the one related to the creation of a new account by
of the claimant, which has never been contradicted by the Agency”.

The respondent also alleges that he has carried out the following improvement actions since
2018:

"1. Change of the CRM software with which the relationship with customers is managed,
passed from the application ***COMPANY.1 to ***COMPANY.2.

2. Maintenance and improvement of the platform that prevents fraud and blocking actions.

3. Maintenance and improvement of the double authentication factor, eliminating the risk related

4. Pseudonymization of data blocked on suspicion of fraud.

5. Application of verification measures for users with two accounts as a result of the
case ***CASE.1, which also reached the AEPD.”

The respondent also points out that "in each of the working hypotheses considered
Glovo acted in accordance with the law and that in no case did it maintain the data of the claim.
remain accessible to persons other than those authorized to access the data
locked in the datawarehouse.

Different firms of recognized prestige have issued, prior to the closing of
each of the funding rounds, status reports on compliance
company regulations (Due Diligence). My client has punctually complied
the recommendations contained in said reports in order to ensure the protection
tion of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties.

In none of these reports has it been indicated that Glovo has measures of
insufficient security in relation to the user authentication process”.

Finally, the respondent indicates that "he considers the application of
of the aggravating criteria that have been taken into account at the time of graduating the
sanction.

1. In relation to the continuing nature of the infringement, my client has accredited-
that the chronology of the events maintained by the AEPD does not correspond to the
reality and that no infringement has occurred.

2. In relation to the number of users, this is wrong, since the figure is very
lower and for the purposes of this procedure should be taken into account only the
active accounts. If it were true that my client processes the data of more than 7 million
active customers, it would be a great success to have had a single incident of these
characteristics, since by simple statistical probability, human errors or
computer systems show much higher incident figures”.

And that "he understands that it has been duly demonstrated that Glovo has acted in
at all times in good faith, using your best commitment, and never compromising
jeopardize the rights and freedoms of the interested parties. There is, therefore, no clear “intention”
tionality” in failing to comply with current regulations since, my client made all
the necessary and due actions for compliance with the regulations and has adjusted
prudently his acting to the law”.

Then request:

- That the allegations to the agreement to open proceedings be considered filed.
sanctioning procedure and Procedure PS/00225/2020 is archived.

- That the aggravating criteria mentioned in said agreement are not applied.

- That the initially proposed penalty be reduced by 25% for having acted

- That a reduction of 25% be applied for prompt payment, being applied on an
both reductions are mulative.

SIXTH: On February 12, 2021, the instructor of the procedure agreed to the
opening of a period of practice tests, considering incorporated the
claim filed by the claimant and his documentation, the documents
obtained and generated by the Inspection Services before the claimed party, the Report
of previous inspection actions that are part of file E/10306/2019,
as well as the allegations to the initiation agreement PS/00225/2020 presented by the

And that “all information provided to this Agency by this

All of this based on the fact that in his brief of allegations dated 09/30/2020, number of
entry record O00007128e2000003988, GLOVOAPP23, SL alleges on page 5
that: “The investigation carried out by my client concludes that Glovo carried out the
deletion and blocking of the claimant's data correctly and that he communicated
deletion to the claimant. The screenshot is provided as DOCUMENT 2
extracted from the backup, in which this confirmation appears”. And that in the
Document 2 that accompanies these allegations, in the first four rows it contains
an id***ID.4 query and the timeline of the query, showing that the query
id***ID.4 was associated with the email address ***EMAIL.1.

On April 12, 2021, the respondent filed a response brief before this
Agency, in which it stated that “the specific additional information required by
this Agency regarding specifically the query with ID***ID.4 associated with the
email address ***EMAIL.1 is not stored in the database
data of my represented”.

It points out that “the query with ID ***ID.4 is a reference number created by
internal and organizational effects by the previous customer service provider
client (*** COMPANY.1) that collaborated with Glovoapp23, S.L. in the moment in which
the user ***EMAIL.1 made the aforementioned query on February 1, 2018, as
As can be deduced from DOCUMENT No. 2 provided by this party in its brief of
dated September 30, 2020. Each reference number was intended to
identify the queries or incidents sent by the users of my represented and
that should be attended by that provider.

The complainant indicates that "a change was made to the CRM software with which
managed the relationship with its clients in order to increase security and
reliability of data deletion and blocking processes. In this sense, as
this party indicated in the FOURTH allegation of the aforementioned pleadings brief dated
September 30, 2020, said CRM change prevented you from having the additional data
about the query with ID ***ID.4 dated February 1, 2018, so this
party cannot provide additional data beyond the information on this
query that this party has already presented in the framework of this procedure.

My client wishes to emphasize that this is due to the fact that the previous supplier of the
customer service (*** COMPANY.1) had defined a period of
conservation of the data of the users that it treated in the name and on behalf of its
customers (in this case, Glovoapp23, S.L.) within a maximum period of 90 days from
from the end of the contractual relationship, a period that has already elapsed”.

The respondent also recalls that "he has already provided this Agency with the information
had about the query with ID ***ID.4 made by the user ***EMAIL.1, such as
It is stated in his pleadings brief dated September 30, 2020 and that
understands this information as complete as it is made up of, among other elements:
reference ID number, contact method, query creation date, type of
query, subject, description and content of the query, conversations held
between the customer service agent and the user, timeline of the
consultation and identification of the user ***EMAIL.1 as the user who made the
query".

28001 – Madrid

And it states that "it does not have in its databases additional information to the
regarding the query with ID ***ID.4 made by the user ***EMAIL.1 that already
provided both in the inspection process initiated by this Agency in the month of
February 2020, as in the different writings presented to this Agency
including the one dated September 30, 2020”.

SEVENTH: On 05/21/2021, the requested resolution is notified to the respondent
in which it is proposed that, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data proceed to the FILE of this procedure against the entity, GLO-
VOAPP23, S.L. with CIF: B66362906, for alleged violation of article 6.1 of the
GDPR.

EIGHTH: After notification of the resolution proposal, the respondent has not pre-
laid down any type of allegation to the motion for a resolution.

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

FACTS

FIRST: on June 15, 2019, the AEPD received a document in which the

confirmation of receipt of your request. However, on May 27, 2019

been made by him. contacted the company via email
email and they replied "in a strange language, with strange characters" requesting
your credit card details, which you do not provide them. He also contacted through
Twitter and initially told him that his email account did not exist, that the order in
question had been canceled and, later, in response to his request for access to the
account to delete the bank data, they asked again for identification with your DNI
and credit card. When sending the data, they replied that they needed more data
of his credit card, to which he objected. Request that your data be deleted
"Definitely from their Database, which they have already breached once."

SECOND: the claimant has provided:

-

Exchange of emails dated February 1, 2018 in which

Once processed, all your data will be deleted and you will not be able to return to
access the details of the balloons you have made”. The claimant responds
with the confirmation of the cancellation and it is answered that “Your message nº (***ID.4) was

that the phone to recover the password is not yours. The claimed in

no account and they ask for an order number that you had made in the
past. The claimant provides them with the order number #GJPYLGSVC of
dated 01/06/2018 and the respondent replies that he is aware that the request is not
requested has been canceled without costs and that you will receive the amount charged
incorrectly. The complainant insists that he wishes to remove his data from the
application, for which you want to access it. To do this, the respondent
asks you to perform "a verification that we have sent to your email". The
claimant reproduces the mail in which they request a copy of the DNI and a copy of
the credit card associated with the account that shows your name and the 6
first digits and last 4 digits. The claimant indicates that he sent the photo,
but the claimed insists that the attached images cannot be

information “in order to enable your profile”. The claimant refuses to provide
this data due to distrust in the security of the application, since
in February he had asked to delete the account and they had told him that
they would, but months later you get a message that an order was placed
from the account you had requested to delete. He states that he only wanted
access the application to remove your credit card number and that
you want to delete that account, along with all your personal data. Finally,
the respondent insists that he needs to verify his identity “to provide the
refund of the amount paid and then we can cancel the account”. The
Claimant answers that they had first told him that there was no account

had said it did not exist), they later told him that the money had been
returned and now they asked for more information to return the amount that was already
was returned, that it was clear that something was wrong or that the
claimed and that he was going to file a complaint with this Agency.

THIRD: in response to the requirements of this Agency, as well as during the
on-site inspection carried out and in his pleadings brief, the respondent has
stated that:

  - The respondent acted with due diligence since the claimant received a
response to your email confirming receipt of your
application, which demonstrates that the claimant's application is carefully treated and
keep you informed about the status of your application.

- Regarding the measures adopted to avoid similar incidents: the claimed
lists the freezing and pseudonymization of the claimant's data, in accordance
with the aforementioned art. 17.3.e); the cancellation of the allegedly fraudulent order, despite
that this could be due to a possible hacking not attributable to the person claimed; and what do I know
proceeded to point out and block the user's entire profile, in order to prevent
possible fraud that could affect you. As improvement actions since 2018, the
claimed lists:

1. Change of the CRM software with which the relationship with customers is managed, for
from the application ***COMPANY.1 to ***COMPANY.2.

2. Maintenance and improvement of the platform that prevents fraud and blocking actions.
quea attempts that respond to a suspicious pattern.

3. Maintenance and improvement of the double authentication factor, eliminating the risk related
tive to inactive accounts whose mobile phone was not verified and the double factor was not
was activated.

4. Pseudonymization of data blocked on suspicion of fraud.

5. Application of verification measures for users with two accounts as a result of the
case ***CASE.1, which also reached the AEPD.”

- At the end of 2018, a security measure was included in its application that
was that whenever a user authenticates from a new device,
sends a verification code to the mobile phone that you had entered during the
Discharge process. This process was already used during the registration process to verify
that the phone number entered was in the possession of the user.

- After the completion of each order, it is automatically verified if the operation
corresponds to some pattern of attempted fraud and, if so, appears
an alert for an employee of the respondent to block the account manually and
someone from the fraud department requests more information from the user via email
email in order to lift the blocking of the account. while the lockdown lasts
of the account, if the user tries to access his account, a message of

notice directing you to contact customer service; this message is seen in the
example of screenshot provided during the inspection.

- The user account with which the order was supposedly placed on May 27,
2019 has the date of creation in the information systems of the claimed person on 1
June 2018, and the erasure date is September 10, 2019. This is
shows the screenshots taken during the inspection in the database
data and in the administration platform of the person investigated on the request
KI17LG1HM and customer data ***ID.4, associated with that order.

- The events that occurred in relation to the claimant user's account coincide
fully with the usual behavior pattern of cybercriminals who use
data traded on the black market in Eastern European countries such as
Ukraine to impersonate the identity of its victims and make fraudulent purchases.
In this specific case, we will see that the cyberattack is carried out from Ukraine and that
takes advantage of the negligent action of the claimant, by repeatedly using the same
key in different services that were affected by a security breach that
exposed his credentials.

- The website haveibeenpwned.com offers a free service that allows anyone to
user to check if his email address appears on these lists, and therefore
So, if your keys have been compromised and you need to change them immediately. Yes
we introduce the address ***EMAIL.1 in this database, it is verified that the
The claimant's credentials have been exposed in five security breaches and
two attempts or indications of attack.

- The investigation also showed that the claimant had opened another account in
Glovo with the address ***EMAIL.2, delivery address and credit card (digits
matching initials and endings).

- The data of the claimant initially exposed in these lists was limited to the
email address and password, and, in the latest versions of
2019 the claimant's data had been enriched with much more data, which
include:
1. Geographic location
2. Employment data
3. Phone numbers
4. Profiles on social networks
5. Credit cards”

- The claimant is an exponent of scant diligence in the management and custody of his
credentials, as your history of keys exposed in security breaches is
starts in 2008 and runs through 2019, and the success of identity theft confirms
that during all this time the claimant has not changed the access codes
repeatedly engaged. In the Terms and Conditions that regulate the
service, available at https://glovoapp.com/es/legal/terms, Glovo warns users
users of their responsibility with respect to the choice of their passwords and when using
the Glovo app the user expressly accepts these obligations: “Clause 17. -
Users are fully responsible for the access and correct use of their profile and
other contents of the Platform subject to current legislation, whether national or

Users are responsible for correctly consigning usernames and
individual, non-transferable and sufficiently complex passwords, as well as not
use the same username and password as on other platforms, all with
the purpose of protecting your account from fraudulent use by third parties unrelated to the
platform. (...)”

- The change of the CRM application destined to collect all the actions and
customer transactions prevents the claimant from having the logs with the details of
operations carried out in 2018.

- The claimed party deleted and blocked the claimant's data in an
correct and communicated the deletion to the claimant, for which it provides as

- The change of the CRM application destined to collect all the actions and
customer transactions prevents the claimant from having the logs with the details of the
operations carried out in 2018, so his investigation has focused on verifying
or refute the four working hypotheses that it develops in its pleadings.

- A first hypothesis: that the cyber attacker used the credentials of the claimant,
unlocked and restored the old account. Indicates the claimed that to have made
the fraudulent request, the cybercriminal should have obtained permissions from
administrator and performed the following steps described and have circumvented all the
obstacles set up to prevent it:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

25/37

It also points out that it would be absolutely disproportionate to mount such an attack
powerful to make a tiny order. For all these reasons, the respondent concludes that
This first hypothesis must be rejected.

- A second hypothesis: the claimant never verified his mobile phone number and the
double factor authentication was left unactivated. Indicates the respondent that it is possible that
an account that remains inactive for a few months (dormant account), move to a
semi-lock mode and does not react to the delete command). The defendant alleges
that “an account not verified and without the double factor activated coincides with a pattern of
attempted fraud and therefore the account is blocked. This lock would be different from the
post-deletion blocking, since in fraud attempts the blocked data remains
in the main database because they must be consulted by the anti-fraud team
to prevent further fraud attempts. However, this hypothesis does not fit with the
fact that my client verified and confirmed in February 2018 that the account
had been correctly suppressed.

- A third hypothesis: the cyber attacker created a new account using the address
e-mail and credit card data of the claimant, obtained in
the black market The respondent alleges that “The AEPD verified, during the course of the
inspection at Glovo, and considers it a proven fact, that the fraudulent order
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

26/37

was made with an account that had been created on June 1, 2018. This is repeated
several times in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure and in the minutes of the
inspection. This information is very important, because it shows that the account with which
the fraudulent order was placed was not the same as the one created by the claimant. IS A
DIFFERENT ACCOUNT.

The first account had the ID ***ID.1 and the second had the ID ***ID.3.

In addition, the first account used a MASTERCARD card and the second a card
VISA.

Let us remember that the proven facts begin in February 2018, when the
complainant requests the deletion of his account and the deletion of his data.

However, the checks carried out by the AEPD show that the account
used to place the fraudulent order was created FOUR MONTHS LATER
that the claimant requested the cancellation of his account and Glovo proceeded to
delete and block the data.

We understand that it was the cybercriminal who opened that account in June 2018 with
the data that it had obtained in the lists of e-mail addresses that were
they sell on the internet and on the black market.

This would certify that the deletion of the account and the blocking of the data was carried out
correctly, otherwise the cybercriminal would not have been able to use the
same email address.

The respondent indicates that, for this hypothesis to be feasible, there should have been
met the following requirements:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

27/37

The respondent also alleges that it is notorious and widely known that, in the
deep internet black market, credit card data can be acquired
that have been exposed and that lists of accounts can be purchased with credit cards
credit not canceled after a security breach. And that the defendant defends that the
cyber attacker obtained the credit card data associated with the address of
claimant's mail on one of these lists.

To do this, it highlights two facts:

1. The claimant suffered a security breach in their Dropbox account, where
could keep your credit card details.

2. The claimant's details were on the enriched list that was discovered in
2019, but contained data from a higher age, which had been
enriched with contributions from other cybercriminals.

The defendant points out that Ukraine is also a country historically related to
phishing, so the ease of accessing credit card data is very
higher than that of other countries. And that, for all these reasons, he considers that the most probable option
It is possible that the cybercriminal used the claimant's credit card details
to place the fraudulent order, since the other options are much less
probable.

The respondent also points out that the charge related to the fraudulent order never reached
be made, since it was Glovo that detected a suspicious pattern and blocked the payment,
Therefore, no damage was caused to the claimant at any time.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

28/37

Finally, the respondent indicates that, according to the evidence contained in the
procedure, obtained during the inspection at the Glovo offices, and provided
by the claimant and the respondent, the chronology of the events is as follows:

And it alleges that “This chronology fits perfectly with the proven facts and
demonstrates that my client acted diligently and without violating the regulations of
Data Protection.

The simple possibility that the events occurred in this way and not
As the Agency maintains, but does not prove, it allows my client to benefit from the
principle of presumption of administrative innocence and adopts as a hypothesis more
plausible that relating to the creation of a new account by the attacker, which in
at no time has it been contradicted by the Agency.”

- A fourth hypothesis: the claimant opened a new account after the deletion
from the previous one. The defendant indicates that this hypothesis would not be unreasonable, since,
In addition to the Glovo account ***EMAIL.1, the claimant had the account
***EMAIL.2, of which he had forgotten its existence, or at least only exercised the
right of suppression in relation to one of them.

"For this reason, and despite the fact that the system logs do not keep the data from June
2018 to check the IP address from which the opening of this
new account, it is perfectly feasible that the claimant opened a new account
on June 1, 2018 and then forget that he had opened it.

This hypothesis would fully fit with the initial deletion of the data and the subsequent
identity theft by the cybercriminal, since the data of the
second account opened by the claimant would not have been deleted.

Remember that the IDs of the two accounts were different and the credit cards
also.

The chronology of events relating to this hypothesis would be as follows:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

29/37

This timeline also fits the proven facts and shows that my
represented acted diligently and without infringing data protection regulations.

Also in this hypothesis, the simple possibility that the events occurred
in this way and not as the Agency maintains, but does not credit, allows my
represented to benefit from the principle of presumption of administrative innocence and adopts
The most plausible hypothesis is the one related to the creation of a new account by
of the claimant, which has never been contradicted by the Agency”.

- In each of the working hypotheses considered by the respondent, they acted with
subject to the law and in no case kept the data of the claimant accessible to
persons other than those authorized to access the data blocked in the
datawarehouse.

Different firms of recognized prestige have issued, prior to the closing of
each of the funding rounds, status reports on compliance
company regulations (Due Diligence). The respondent has punctually complied with the
recommendations contained in said reports in order to ensure the protection
of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties.

In none of these reports has it been indicated that the respondent has
Insufficient security measures in relation to the authentication process of the
users.

- In relation to the continuous nature of the infringement, it has been proven that the cro-
nology of the facts maintained by the AEPD does not correspond to reality and that
no violation has occurred.

- In relation to the number of users, this is wrong, since the figure is very in-
lower and for the purposes of this procedure should be taken into account only the
active accounts. If it were true that it treats the data of more than 7 million customers
assets, it would be a great success to have had a single incident of these characteristics, since
that by simple statistical probability, human or computer errors throw ci-
far higher incident rates.

- He has acted at all times in good faith, using his best commitment, and without
never endanger the rights and freedoms of the interested parties. There does not exist, then,
a clear "intention" in failing to comply with current regulations since it carried out all
the necessary and due actions for compliance with the regulations and has adjusted
prudently his action to the law.

- The Glovo user account associated with the email address
***EMAIL.1, from which the fraudulent order was made, corresponds to ID ***ID.4.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

30/37

- The query with ID ***ID.4 is a reference number created for the purpose
internal and organizational by the previous customer service provider
(*** COMPANY.1) that collaborated with Glovoapp23, S.L. at the moment the
user ***EMAIL.1 made the aforementioned query on February 1, 2018, as
it follows from DOCUMENT No. 2 provided in his letter dated 30
September 2020. Each reference number was intended to identify the
queries or incidents sent by the users of the claimed and that had to be
serviced by that provider.

- A change was made in the CRM software used to manage the relationship with its
customers in order to increase the security and reliability of the processes of
deletion and blocking of data. In this sense, said CRM change prevented him from having
the additional data about the query with ID ***ID.4 dated February 1,
2018. This is because the previous customer service provider
(*** COMPANY.1) had defined a retention period for the data of the
users that it dealt with in the name and on behalf of its clients (in this case,
Glovoapp23, S.L.) within a maximum period of 90 days from the end of the
of the contractual relationship, a term that has already passed.

- You have already provided this Agency with the information you had on the query with ID
***ID.4 made by the user ***EMAIL.1, as stated in his writing of
allegations dated September 30, 2020 and that he understands this information as
complete as it is composed, among other elements, of: reference ID number, route of
contact, query creation date, query type, subject, description and
content of the query, conversations held between the service agent
customer and user service, query chronology and user identification
***EMAIL.1 as the user who made the query”.

FOURTH: the respondent is a large company in its business and development sector
of the business activity it performs requires continuous data processing

claimed had confirmed that said request was being processed. Nevertheless,

In this regard, article 17 of the RGPD "Right of suppression ("the right to be forgotten)"
establishes that:

"1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain, without undue delay, from the person responsible for the

In the present case, if the request for deletion has not been duly processed
of the account would be treating the personal data of the claimant without having
law that legitimizes such treatment.

In this sense, article 5 of the RGPD "Principles related to treatment" establishes
that:

"1. The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
("legality, loyalty and transparency");
b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; according to

archive in the public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or
statistics shall not be considered incompatible with the initial purposes ("limitation
of the purpose»); (…)

2. The controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”)”.

And article 6 of the RGPD "Legality of the treatment" provides:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

In the present case, the claimant had a Glovo user account associated with
your email ***EMAIL.1. According to DOCUMENT 2 that accompanies the letter
of allegations of the respondent, dated February 1, 2018, at 7:39 p.m. on
claimant requested the claimed to delete this account, by querying ID

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

33/37

***ID.4. The respondent, through his provider ***COMPANY.1 would have responded to
7:40 p.m. “Hello A.A.A.! Goodbyes are always hard, we don't want you
go! :( , although we would like to know the reason why you have decided to leave, we
your opinion matters! If you've already thought it through and want to delete your account, reply
to this email confirming the cancellation and we will process your request as soon as possible
possible. Remember that once processed, all your data will be deleted and you will not be able to
go back to access the details of the”. At 7:44 p.m. the claimant would have answered
"I confirm the deletion, thanks Greetings." To this message, the claimant would not have
received subsequent response. However, the message “solved in ***ID.4” appears at
7:49 p.m. on the systems of ***COMPANY.1. It should be noted that it was not possible to obtain
the identification number of the user account associated with the query ID ***ID.4,
given that, as stated by the defendant in his allegations, the previous provider of
customer service of the complainant (*** COMPANY.1) had defined a
period of conservation of the data of the users that it treated in the name and by
account of its clients (in this case, the claimed one) for a maximum period of 90 days
counted from the end of the contractual relationship, a period that has already elapsed.
Nor has it been possible to determine the date of creation of this account.

On May 19, 2019, an order #GJPYLGSVC, with ID: ***ID.6, was placed from the
customer account ID ***ID.4, associated with email ***EMAIL.1. the claimant
communicated with the claimant, who canceled the order in question without generating expense
any for the claimant and proceeded to mark that account as fraudulent. According to
consists of the facts outlined, this account ID ***ID.4 was created on June 1,
2018 and deleted on September 10, 2019.

In addition to having an account associated with ***EMAIL.1, the claimant had a
account associated with your email ***EMAIL.2, with ID ***ID.1, linked to your
Facebook account. According to DOCUMENT 2 that accompanies the letter of
allegations of the claimed, on February 1, 2018 at 7:46 p.m. the claimant
requested the deletion of this account. The claimed, through its provider
***COMPANY.1, replied at 7:48 p.m. “Hello A.A.A.! goodbyes are always
tough, we don't want you to go! :( , although we would like to know the reason why
You have decided to leave, your opinion matters to us! If you have thought about it well and want
delete your account, reply to this email confirming the cancellation and we will manage your
request as soon as possible. Remember that once processed, all your
data will be deleted and you will not be able to access the details of the ". The claimant, to
at 7:48 p.m., he replied with the following message: “I confirm the deletion of the account,
a greeting". At 7:52 p.m., the respondent replied: “Hello A.A.A.! there is no turning back
back :( We confirm that we have removed your user account from our database
data. As we mentioned, you will no longer be able to access your profile or the details of your
previous orders. The cancellation of the sending of the newsletter to your email will be done
Effective in approximately 48 business hours. If you have any other query
in this regard, do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this same email.”

Although it is appreciated that in the query with ID ***ID.5, in which the deletion is requested
of the account ID ***ID.1 associated with the email ***EMAIL.2, once confirmed
the deletion by the claimant is answered confirming that it has occurred
that deletion of the claimed database, this is not the case in the query with
ID ***ID.4, in which the complainant requested the deletion of their user account
associated with the email ***EMAIL.1. In the latter, in DOCUMENT 2 that

is attached to the brief of allegations dated September 30, 2020, only
you can see a message that says “solved in ***ID.4”, without further details. therefore not
It has been proven in the file that such deletion would have been carried out
correctly or that it had not been done.

Analyzing the hypotheses raised by the defendant, it has not been proven either
that any of these hypotheses had actually occurred.

It is plausible that a cyber attacker would have obtained and used the credentials of the
claimant, since if the account had not been properly deleted, the system would
would have recognized and could have agreed and placed the order in question. Alleges the
claimed that "if the respondent's account had not been disabled, the attempted
access of the cybercriminal would have been neutralized by the double factor, since there was no
The cybercriminal received the SMS with the access code”. And he adds that “the
investigation has found indications that the claimant may not have verified the number
mobile, so the double factor was not activated. This would be compatible with the scarce
diligence of the claimant in matters of computer security”. In DOCUMENT 3
that accompanies your pleadings brief, the verification log is provided in which
it can be seen that the mobile device of the account used to
place the fraudulent order on May 27, 2019 at 11:14pm CEST. It is
i.e. the mobile device was verified after the creation of the account ID
***ID.4 and prior to placing the order not requested by the claimant. So,
it would not appear that the double factor had prevented access to the account.

It seems less plausible (although not impossible) that the claimant would never have
verified your mobile phone number and that the two-factor authentication had
remained without activating (second hypothesis) and that even so the account could have
used to place the fraudulent order. The pleadings explain that it is
It is possible that an account that remains inactive for a few months (dormant account),
go into a semi-lockdown mode and do not react to the delete command. Nevertheless,
in the allegations it is also explained that an unverified account and without the double
activated factor coincides with a pattern of attempted fraud and therefore the
bill. That is, if the claimant's account had not been properly deleted
and this had not activated the double authentication factor, the system would still
had been flagged as a pattern of attempted fraud and the account would have been blocked.

On the other hand, it is also plausible that a cyber attacker would have created a new
account using email address and credit card details
of the claimant obtained on the black market (third hypothesis). This is the hypothesis
defended by the defendant for the following reasons:

- The account from which the fraudulent order was made has a creation date of 1
June 2018.

- There is a first account with ID ***ID.1, with a MASTERCARD, and a
second account with ID ***ID.3, with a VISA card.

- There are no obstacles to creating a new account because the email address
The claimant's email had been suppressed and there was no
account duplication.

- The cyber criminal used his own mobile to install the application and the new
bill. Received the SMS on it and the account was verified. This check is
credited and occurred on May 27, 2019 at 11:14 pm CEST, according to
the system log. We attach as DOCUMENT THREE the verification log. By

mobile number on the account did not match yours.

- Being a new account, the cybercriminal put the address that he considered
timely for delivery

- The cybercriminal obtained the data of the card associated with the email address

In this regard, it should be noted that the first account with ID ***ID.1 is associated with the
email address ***EMAIL.2. Therefore, it has nothing to do with the account.

The second account, with ID ***ID.3, has not been established as belonging to the
claimant nor what email address it was associated with. The
account that has been established as associated with the email address
***EMAIL.1 and from which the fraudulent order was made is the account ID

Nor has it been proven that the cybercriminal who allegedly carried out the
fraudulent order would have used his own mobile and he would have verified the account in

from which the fraudulent order was placed was created on June 1, 2018.

Finally, it is also plausible that the claimant opened a new account
after the suppression of the previous one (fourth hypothesis). The respondent alleges that “this
hypothesis would fit fully with the initial deletion of the data and the subsequent
identity theft by the cybercriminal, since the data of the
second account opened by the claimant would not have been eliminated.” In any

duly created previously or there would have been duplication of accounts and this does not
The defendant allows it, according to the allegations presented by him.

For all of the above, it has not been possible to duly prove in the file that the
deletion requested by the claimant had not been properly addressed and
had continued to process the claimant's personal data without a valid basis
law that legitimizes such treatment.

The foregoing must be connected with the validity of our Administrative Law
sanctioning the principle of presumption of innocence recognized in article 24.2 of
the Spanish Constitution, so that the exercise of the sanctioning power of the
State, in its various manifestations, is conditioned to the game of evidence and to
a contradictory procedure in which their own positions can be defended.
The principle of presumption of innocence prevents imputing an administrative offense
when proof of charge has not been obtained and verified that accredits the
facts that motivate the imputation or the intervention in the same of the presumed
offender.

In the present case, there is no evidence that the deletion of your account,
requested by the claimant, had not been attended to correctly and had
continued to process the claimant's personal data without a legal basis
that would legitimize such treatment, ignoring the applicable regulations.

The Constitutional Court (SSTC 131/2003 and 242/2005, for all) has ruled
in that sense by indicating that one of the requirements inherent in the right to
presumption of innocence is that the sanction is based on acts or evidence
charge or incriminating the imputed conduct and that falls on the
Public administration acting the evidentiary burden of the commission of the illicit
administrative and the participation in it of the accused.

For its part, article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime
of the Public Sector establishes as one of the principles of the sanctioning power the
of "Responsibility" and determines in this regard that:

“Only those that constitute an administrative infraction may be sanctioned
natural and legal persons, as well as, when a Law recognizes their capacity to
to act, the affected groups, the unions and entities without legal personality and the
independent or autonomous estates, which are responsible for them
title of fraud or guilt”.

Likewise, the provisions of article 53.2 of Law 39/2015 must be taken into account,
of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public, which establishes that:

In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible, will have the following rights: (...)

b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is not proven”.
