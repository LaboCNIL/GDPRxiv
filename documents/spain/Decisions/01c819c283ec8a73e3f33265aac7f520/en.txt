that it is a legal practice (it can be) but what I tell them is why not

THIRD: On 07/21/22, the claimed party sends this Agency a written

Metering devices will be in any case for the account of the lessee.

In compliance with the provisions of the LAU and the contract itself
lease, Enfoka urged the lessee on numerous occasions to
modify the ownership of the electricity supply in their name, all of them without
success. For this reason, last February an e-mail was sent informing that
ownership would be changed. (E-mail is attached as Annex II)

After making said change, Enfoka reiterates to the lessee the
need to proceed with the change of supplies due to legal imperative, one of
the cases in which the LOPD establishes a legal basis. (Attached chain of
e-mails with the lessee as Annex III)

Next, we proceed to answer the following points:

After crossing the previously detailed e-mails, the
lessee that according to LAU the supplies have to find
name of the tenants as established in the LAU and in the
leasing contract.

For its part, the LOPD establishes that consent will not be required
of those affected for the transfer of data derived from an imperative

We declare that we have not received from the lessee any

exchanged with the lessee, the latter does not refer to the fact that
delete or block your data or show opposition to the treatment.

3. Report on the causes that have motivated the incidence that has originated the
claim.

The lease agreement is signed with the lessee on May 24, 2021 and
becomes effective on June 1, 2021. (Annex I)

On numerous occasions we asked the lessee to change the
ownership of the supply in his name, explaining the reasons why the
supply contract must be in his name. As a consequence of the
refusal of the lessee to carry out said change of ownership, see you
forced to do it ourselves to comply with the LAU.

In compliance with the provisions of Law 29/1994, of November 24, on
Urban leases in its article 20.3, therefore, in compliance with a
legal obligation, we communicate the data of the lessee to the company Runup
Business, S.L. (Qlip), with whom we have a signed contract by which
are in charge of carrying out the necessary procedures in relation to the changes of
supplies.

4. Report on the measures taken to prevent the occurrence of
similar incidents, implementation dates and controls carried out to
check its effectiveness.

As an additional measure, upon signing the lease, the
tenants sign 2 documents informing that they will proceed to
communicate your data with the exclusive purpose of carrying out the processing
of the change of ownership of the supply. This measure is done knowingly
that we rely on the execution of the contract and the fulfillment of a
legal obligation for data processing.

We have an internal security document that describes the measures
of
proactive responsibility, both technical and organizational, standards,
procedures, rules and standards aimed at guaranteeing the safety of the
treatment.

The Internal Safety Document specifically includes a procedure
to carry out verification actions, periodic controls and audits of
security to verify the level of regulatory compliance in terms of
Data Protection.

FOURTH: On 08/09/22, the HOLALUZ entity sends this Agency a letter of
response to the request made, in which the following is indicated:

"That, according to the CLIDOM database, the Claimant is registered in the
company with the CUPS1 of electricity number ***NUMBER.1 corresponding
to the address C/ ***ADDRESS.1 from 02/26/22 to 03/31/22.

Said registration was carried out by the commercial channel Run Up Business
SL with which CLIDOM maintains a contractual relationship resulting from
application of the clause just transcribed. That the contract is attached
signed between the parties as DOCUMENT NUMBER ONE.

The sales representatives are empowered to subcontract to any other
people or companies to provide the services. In the present case it consists
that the collaborating company was Enfoka Sistemas Globales, S.L.

Due to the fact that the Collaborator pretended the veracity of the contracting object of
this consultation, this party could not detect, until the Complainant did not
has revealed it, that said contract had been carried out without the
consent of the same.

In fact, for this part it was impossible to suspect this circumstance, since,
at all times, apparently, the requirements of
contracting established by CLIDOM.

Specifically, the contractual conditions were sent by email
of the electricity supply contract, since CLIDOM considers it essential
that all its clients are fully informed about the conditions
particular and general contracts signed with this party.

In said email, customers are asked to validate and, therefore, accept the
contract entered into with this party and that is how it occurred in this case.

That, after receiving this Claim, CLIDOM contacted the
commercial channel for the collection of information on July 13.
We attach the email sent as DOCUMENT NUMBER TWO.

That, the responses obtained by email are attached as
DOCUMENT NUMBER THREE AND FOUR.

In this sense, first of all, it is stated that it is the client herself who
validates the electricity supply contract with my client and, therefore, that
she herself knew the contract; and, secondly, what is real estate
Enfoka Global Systems, S.L. who collects the Complainant's data, with
who have formalized a collaboration agreement and the corresponding
data transfer contract.

THIRD.- ON THE MEASURES ADOPTED TO PREVENT THE
PRODUCE SIMILAR INCIDENTS

That CLIDOM randomly performs a subsequent review of the quality of
calls and registrations made by new collaborators, through a

C / Jorge Juan, 6

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/19

review protocol for a certain percentage of discharges consisting of
that the company's internal customer service agents call by
phone to a significant percentage of the new customers contributed by the
commercial channels with which a contract of
collaboration the previous month.

Through these calls, CLIDOM makes sure that customers
have effectively given their consent to make the change of
supplier or supply registration.

FOURTH.- ON THE RIGHT TO SUPPRESSION

That the data that appears in the CLIDOM database, being the same
incorporated by the Collaborator, are the following: (...)

Therefore, it should be reiterated that the introduction of the Client's personal data
was made by a third party who breached contractual obligations
established, and therefore, being the same person responsible for any damage
arising from non-compliance.

Thus, the Sixteenth clause of the Collaboration Contract signed between
CLIDOM and the Collaborator regarding Responsibility establishes:
“16.1. Each party will be responsible for any damages that may be caused
to the other when there is fraud or gross negligence and when the action or omission
causing the damage has occurred repeatedly, that is proven and
demonstrable, that produces considerable and quantifiable damage, that causes
serious harm."

In this regard, we must bring up the obligations that derive from the
article 28 GDPR. Specifically, it regulates the need to "Treat the data of
according to the instructions of the data controller.

For this reason, CLIDOM acts and has instructed its agents so that the
contracts are in accordance with data protection regulations and, more
specifically, that the treatment is lawful, having to mediate the requirements of the
article 6 GDPR, that this necessarily includes the consent of the
customer for the processing of their personal data.

FIFTH: On 09/11/22, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Protection of Data, an agreement is issued to admit the processing of the claim
presented, in accordance with article 65 of the LPDGDD Law, when assessing possible
rational indications of a violation of the rules in the field of competences
of the Spanish Data Protection Agency

III.- On the possible use of the claimant's personal data without the
legitimation necessary for it.

consequences for the data subjects of the planned further processing; the A
existence of adequate guarantees, which may include encryption or
pseudonymization.

For its part, article 20 of Law 29/1994, of November 24, on Leasing
Urban, establishes, on general expenses and individual services, what
following:

1. The parties may agree that the general expenses for the adequate
maintenance of the property, its services, taxes, charges and responsibilities
that are not susceptible to individualization and that correspond to the dwelling
leased or its accessories, are at the expense of the lessee.

In buildings under the horizontal property regime, such expenses will be those that
correspond to the leased property based on their participation fee.

In buildings that are not under the horizontal property regime, such
Expenses will be those that have been assigned to the leased property based on its
surface.

For its validity, this agreement must be in writing and determine the amount
of said expenses to the date of the contract. The agreement that refers to taxes
It will not affect the Administration.

The expenses of real estate management and formalization of the contract will be borne by
of the lessor, when the latter is a legal person.

2. During the first five years of the contract, or during the seven
first years if the landlord was a legal entity, the sum that the
lessee has to pay for the concept referred to in section
above, with the exception of taxes, may only be increased, by agreement
of the parties, annually, and never in a percentage greater than double that
in which the rent can be increased in accordance with the provisions of section 1
of article 18.

3. The expenses for services that the leased property has that are
individualized by means of metering devices will in any case be for the account of the
tenant.

4. The payment of the expenses referred to in this article will be accredited in the
manner provided in article 17.4.

Well, according to the information and documentation presented
by the parties, from the time the claimant signs the rental contract for the home on
05/24/21, he was paying the electricity consumption bills that the property had
contracted with the company IBERDROLA, until ***DATE.1, nine months
After signing the contract, the ENFOKA real estate agency that manages the rentals, without
authorization from the tenant signs a new supply contract on behalf of the tenant
of electricity with the company HOLALUZ, through the company, Runup Business, S.L.
(Qlip), to which it provides, as customer data, the data of the tenant (name,

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

12/19

surname, NIF, telephone number, postal address and checking account number
where to upload the receipts), but as an email address where to send the
invoices, the contract and other communications, the email of the
real estate agency, (***EMAIL.1), thus making it impossible to have direct access to any type of
information from the tenant regarding the supply of light.

In addition to all this, the electricity supply contract with HOLALUZ is
signed by B.B.B. NIF: ***NIF.2, on behalf of the tenant, without the knowledge and without the
its prior consent.

In conclusion, the tenant (the claimant in this case) had been complying, since
who signed the rental contract on 05/24/21 with the provisions of said contract, which in
its fifth section specifies that, "The expenses will be borne by the Lessee
related to the consumption of electricity, water and telephone, as well as any other service of
communications or television contracted by the Lessee" and also with the stipulations
in article 20.3 of the LAU, that is: "The expenses for services available to the
leased farm that are individualized by means of metering devices will be in all
case of the lessee's account", until, without prior notice, without communication and without
consent of the tenant, the real estate company decides to change the electric company, the
***DATE.1, providing the personal data of the claimant to the new
trading company (HOLALUZ), thus producing serious economic damage,
Well, according to the complaint, the new invoices that must be paid to the new company
exceeds double what was paid for the same consumption to IBERDROLA.

The question does not lie in the fact that the real estate agency used the personal data of the
claimant based on a “legal or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
sign a contract”, as he alleges, but later used the personal data of the
tenant to change electric company without their prior knowledge, that is, without
have communicated a transfer of data from one recipient to another, which even
meant serious economic damage to her and of course, without her consent
Well, the new electricity supply contract was even signed in his name.

In this sense, recital (61) of the GDPR indicates, regarding the obligations of the
responsible for the processing of personal data, which:

"(...) If the personal data can be legitimately communicated to another
addressee, the interested party must be informed at the time the
communicated to the addressee for the first time (…)”.

And, on the other hand, it is true that the LAU imposes the obligation that the lessee
pay for supplies of water, electricity, gas, etc., for which it would only be necessary to treat the
data of the claimant's bank account where the receipts can be domiciled, but in
In no case does the LAU impose an obligation to modify the ownership of the contract
supply, an issue that was carried out using the personal data of the tenant without her
consent.

Sanction proposal

13/19

The fact that the claiming party made use of the personal data of
the claimant without her knowledge and above all without her consent, to sign a
new electricity supply contract with another company, signing said
contract in his name, may constitute an infringement of article 6.1.) of the
GDPR, when processing personal data without the necessary legitimacy
for it.

prescription, "The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation”.

a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the offender fails to
behave with the required diligence. And in the assessment of the degree of diligence
the professionalism or not of the subject must be specially considered, and it is not possible to

is of constant and abundant handling of personal data must
insist on the rigor and the exquisite care to adjust to the preventions
laws about it."
