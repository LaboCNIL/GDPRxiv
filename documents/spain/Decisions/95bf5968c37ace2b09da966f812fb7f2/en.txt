FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), recognizes each
Control Authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is
competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

II

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the RGPD defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
natural persons) carried out through the video surveillance system
reported is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

III

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow it to be considered lawful

the processing of personal data.

For its part, article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, regarding the principles of
treatment, provides that the personal data will be “adequate, pertinent and
limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”).” This article enshrines the principle of minimization of

data in the processing of personal data. Assume that such treatment is
adjusted and proportional to the purpose to which it is directed, and the
treatment of excessive data or proceed to the deletion of the same.

The relevance in the treatment of the data must occur both in the
of the collection of the data as well as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out of the data.
themselves.

On the other hand, in accordance with the provisions of article 22 of the LOPDGDD,
referring specifically to the "Processing for video surveillance purposes", the
processing of images in public places can only be carried out -if applicable and
prior compliance with the legally enforceable requirements-, by the Forces and
Security Bodies, unless the exception established in the aforementioned
Article 22 of the LOPDGDD for individuals or legal entities, public or private,
respecting the conditions required in said article.

On some occasions, the protection of private spaces is only possible if
the cameras are located in spaces such as facades. Sometimes it also turns out
necessary to capture the accesses, doors or entrances, so that, although the camera is
is inside the building, it is impossible not to record a minimum and
essential of the public road, which is inevitably captured.

For this exception on the protection of private spaces to be
applicable, there shall be no alternative installation possibility. In these cases,
The person responsible for the treatment carried out through cameras will adapt the use of the
installation, so that the impact on the rights of third parties (passers-by) is
minimum possible. In no case will the use of surveillance practices beyond
of the environment object of the installation, not being able to affect public spaces
surrounding buildings, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the space
guarded.

IV

In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a
video surveillance system, to be in accordance with current regulations, must comply with
the following requirements:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/14

- Respect the principle of proportionality.

- When the system is connected to an alarm center, you can only
be installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.

- The video cameras will not be able to capture images of the people who
are outside the private space where the security system is installed.
video surveillance, since the processing of images in public places can only be
carried out, unless there is government authorization, by the Forces and Corps of
Security. Nor can spaces owned by third parties be captured or recorded without
the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the persons who are
find.

This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the
protection of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or in
inside, it may be necessary to ensure the purpose of security recording
of a portion of the public highway. That is, cameras and camcorders installed with
security purposes may not obtain images of public roads unless it is
essential for said purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of
those and, extraordinarily, the minimum space for said
purpose. Therefore, the cameras could exceptionally capture the portion
minimally necessary for the intended security purpose.

- The duty to inform those affected provided for in the
articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD, resulting from application -by not contradicting the
provisions of the aforementioned Regulation-, the manner provided for in article 3 of the
Instruction 1/2006, of November 8, of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, on the Processing of Personal Data for Surveillance Purposes through
Camera or Video Camera Systems.

Specifically, it must be placed in the video-monitored areas, at least one
informative badge located in a sufficiently visible place, both in spaces
open and closed, in which at least the existence of a
treatment, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights
provided for in these provisions. Likewise, it must be kept available to the
affected the information referred to in the aforementioned RGPD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/14

- The person in charge must keep a record of treatment activities
carried out under its responsibility, including the information to which it makes
reference article 30.1 of the RGPD.

- The installed cameras cannot obtain images from private space of
third party and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can
affect the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the area. No this
allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of neighbors
with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without just cause.

- In no case will the use of surveillance practices be admitted beyond the
environment object of the installation and in particular, not being able to affect the spaces
surrounding public, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the
guarded space.

In relation to the foregoing, to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection offers through its website
[https://www.aepd.es] access to data protection legislation
including the RGPD and the LOPDGDD (section “Reports and resolutions” /
“normative”), as well as the Guide on the use of video cameras for security and other
purposes, as well as the Guide for compliance with the duty to inform (both
available in the “Guides and tools” section).

It is also of interest, in case of carrying out data processing of low
risk, the free tool Facilita (in the “Guides and tools” section), which
through specific questions, it allows to assess the situation of the person in charge
regarding the processing of personal data that it carries out, and where appropriate, generate
various documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with
indicative security measures considered minimal.

v

The claim is based on the alleged illegality of the installation by the
claimed from a video surveillance system, made up of several security cameras
different models, located on the perimeter of the hotel, located at ***ADDRESS.1 AND

7/14

***ADDRESS.2, which could capture images of public areas safely
disproportionate

In the images provided by the reported entity, it can be seen that
even if one of the cameras has a privacy mask, it should be extended
the same to capture exclusively your property and proportional space in your case
of public roads, since they record too much public space.

Based on the foregoing, this Agency considers that there are indications of the
existence of video surveillance cameras installed on the perimeter of the
hotel facilities, located at ***ADDRESS.1 AND ***ADDRESS.2 that
capture images of the public highway in excess, as can be deduced from the
images of the recording provided by the claimed entity.

specified -article 58. 2 d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in the
Article 58.2 d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of
administrative fine.

7th

-The damage caused to those affected by the processing of their data does not become

significant.

  

-As mitigating circumstances to assess in order to graduate the
sanction, taking into account the limited collection space, the absence of benefits

IX

If the infraction is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose the person in charge the
adoption of appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the aforementioned regulations
in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD,
according to which each control authority may "order the person in charge or in charge
