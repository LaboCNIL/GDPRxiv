we tend to the end, because there is no vandalism, and this control of knowing our
entrances and exits of the farm, makes us think that it is for a bad purpose because of its
part, because we know that it shows people our entrances and exits of the building.
Well, this gentleman is the owner of a house with 2 dwellings, one of them is the one that
I have rented, and from a place that is to use and enjoy it. for which there is no
Community of owners. And without further ado, he has placed this camera that I enclose photo-

“[…] Reasons why a security camera is placed in the portal of said
building.

- On the second floor of said building there are some tenants of the company […]
(before). These gentlemen were evicted for non-payment in April 2019 by the
Court […]. In May of the same year the property was leased to me again by a man who
He claims to be the administrator of a company called […] (later), which is my surprise
who send me a message on my mobile and it turns out that they are the same tenants who already
had been evicted a month earlier mocking me and making fun of me
they were back in the house, changing the name of the company. All this for
course, it was communicated at that time to my lawyer and the court.

- In August 2019, in our holiday stay, on the first floor of the
property; one night early in the morning one of the
people who are rented on the second floor (very aggressive and pushy). In that
moment my wife and I had an attack of anxiety and fear. These
events occurred on 08/07/2019 01:50 AM and 08/08/2019 05:30 AM, which
were testified in an appearance procedure before the Civil Guard and attested
No. […], which is communicated to the Court […].

- The most important reason why I have thought about putting a security camera is
that of fully protecting my family and myself in case at any time it coincides
in the doorway or on the stairs of the building so that the worst would not happen.

- Upon my arrival in Madrid I went to the AEPD to find out if I could proceed with the
installation of a security camera at the entrance of the building (where the
camera currently). After exposing the location of the camera and the range of
the same, the response from this body was affirmative, informing me of
that I had to put all my personal data: responsible, exercise their rights
data protection before and information on the processing of personal data;
as stated in the posters that were provided to me in the same AEPD and posts
visible in the portal of the building, where they are currently warning of
said camera, which was installed in August 2019 without coming into operation until
on 09/21/2019.

- It is absolutely not in my interest to save images of who enters or leaves the building,
only ensure the complete safety of my family [...]. nor have I shown any type of
image or personal data of these gentlemen. Therefore, the images
provided by the camera are absolutely and daily deleted.

[…]”

Yo

The Director of the Spanish Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the GDPR and
in the art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.

limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”).”

On the other hand, the commission of another infraction for violation of the
article 13 of the RGPD, which establishes that:

"1. When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the

The aforementioned infractions are typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which
provides the following:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, both infractions are
considered very serious and prescribed after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the
LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. […]

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the processing of their data
personal in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law. […]”

III

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the cases in which the use of data may be considered lawful.
treatment of personal data, foreseeing within them —article 6.1.e)— the
that refers to the legality "the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of
a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers
conferred on the data controller”.

In the specific field of data processing for video surveillance purposes, the
Article 22.1 of the LOPDGDD provides that "people may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the
purpose of preserving the safety of persons and goods, as well as their
installations” dedicating the rest of the sections of this article to the
specificities to which this data processing must be submitted.

In this sense, and with regard to the specific case that is the subject of this
sanctioning procedure, it can be affirmed, taking into account the statements
made by the defendant about the purpose pursued with the camera of
video surveillance installed on the portal of the property of which he is the owner and in which
maintains a dwelling for personal use, that said treatment responds to the
objective of guaranteeing the safety of people (the person claimed and the
members of his family) in the face of the problematic relations maintained with the
tenants residing in the rented dwelling within the property owned by the
reclaimed. We would therefore be faced with a case in which the data controller
performs a mission in the public interest.

Now, to consider the concurrence of the public interest, this must be
proportionate with respect to the purpose pursued, since its exercise is
susceptible to affecting the physical image as personal data and therefore supposes a
interference in the field of fundamental human rights. What
Consequently, therefore, it will be necessary to balance the mission of
public interest to ensure the safety of persons carried out by the
responsible for the treatment and the rights of the tenants, which in the present
Of course, their privacy and freedom of movement may be affected because the

area captured by the camera affects the common area that serves as access to both
households.

In order to carry out this weighting and assess the proportionality of the
measure, it is necessary to take into account the ruling of the Constitutional Court
207/1996, in which the High Court determines that “in order to verify whether a measure
restrictive of a fundamental right exceeds the judgment of proportionality, it is
necessary to verify if it meets the following three requirements or conditions: if such
measure is capable of achieving the proposed objective (judgment of suitability); Yes,
moreover, it is necessary, in the sense that there is no other more moderate measure to
the achievement of such purpose with equal efficiency (judgment of necessity); and finally if
it is weighted or balanced, because more benefits or advantages are derived from it
for the general interest that damages other goods or values in conflict (judgment
of proportionality in the strict sense).

Applying, therefore, this judgment of proportionality to the specific case, it proceeds
point out the following:

● The installation of a video surveillance system can be considered an ideal means
to achieve in order to guarantee the safety of the person claimed and his family, for
how much it is capable of fulfilling both a preventive objective and proving
documented the occurrence of certain events that involve an attack on said
security.

● The treatment can be considered to comply with the principle of minimization of
data and is moderate with respect to the area captured by the camera since it is
limited to areas only to areas common to both houses where they can
coincide the claimed and the tenants, without affecting in any way the area
exclusive use and enjoyment of these.

● It can also be considered that the treatment complies with the principle of
minimization of data and is moderate in relation to the term of conservation of
the images, because the aforementioned term, in accordance with what was stated by the
claimed, it is only 1 day.

● However, given that the purpose alleged by the respondent is
ensure the safety of you and your family members during the
time in which any of them makes use of their home in the property and therefore
both can coincide spatially and temporally with the tenants (without there being
alleged at any time the need to preserve the security of the
property) the processing of data would be excessive when those circumstances
they do not take place, since they would exceed the purpose to which they respond.

In conclusion, it cannot be said that it is proportionate that the system of
installed video surveillance is operational at all times because the purpose
pursued by the person responsible is not reached when the person claimed or any member of
your family is not making use of the dwelling in the property; in this
circumstance, it could not be concluded that the mission of public interest prevails over the
fundamental rights of those affected.

11/14

In accordance, therefore, with the foregoing, the video surveillance system, to the extent
which was operational all the time (it was disconnected on February 2),
violated the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD.

IV

With regard to the duty of information provided for in article 12 of the RGPD (with
the content provided in the subsequent article 13, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD
determines that

“[…] shall be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device in
sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility to exercise the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information.

In any case, the person in charge of the treatment must keep available to the
affected the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation.

According to the report and the photographic images provided by the report of the
Commander of the Acctal Post. of the Civil Guard of ***LOCALIDAD.1, the system
of video surveillance has two informative posters that comply with the provisions
in the precept transcribed above because it identifies the existence of the
treatment and offers information about the person in charge, the possibility and direction to
Where to go to exercise the rights set forth in articles 15 to 22 of the
RGPD, as well as an email address and a telephone number where to request more
information.

Regarding the possible breach of this duty at the time of filing
the claim, it is noted that the respondent declares that, even when the cameras are
installed in August 2019, the video surveillance system did not come into operation
until September 21. Therefore, since it has not been proven that the
camera will be in operation at the time of filing the claim
(the complainant indicates that the person in charge has shown images of his tickets and
exits from the building, but does not provide any indication in this regard), it is not possible to determine that
there had been on that date an effective treatment of data and, therefore, a
omission of the duty of information.

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
themselves of the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a concrete and determined fact, which obliges in any case to
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), which
establishes that:

"two. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible will have the following rights:

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is proven.”

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
of April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the
sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.”

v

However, the provisions of article 83.5, sections a) and b), of the RGPD, its art.
58.2 b) establishes the possibility of sanctioning with a warning, in relation to what
stated in Recital 148:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

In the present case, when deciding the sanction to be imposed, they have taken into account
count the following items,

 That the controller is a natural person.

 That there is no recidivism or reiteration due to the lack of evidence of the commission of
previous offenses.

● That he has shown collaboration in this organization within the present
sanctioning procedure

For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is
warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.

On the other hand, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD,
according to which each control authority may "order the person in charge or in charge
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a
specified period [...]”, the person in charge must adapt the operation of the system
video surveillance installed so that it is only operational when he or
any member of your family make use of the housing they have in the property
where it is installed.

Regarding this issue, the respondent has stated in his brief filed on the day
February 15, having proceeded to disconnect the camera, so it is considered that
the adequacy measure has been adopted and must be maintained while he or some
member of your family do not use the dwelling.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE C.C.C., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction of article 5.1.c),
typified in article 83.5 of the aforementioned rule, a sanction of
WARNING.

SECOND: ORDER, under the provisions of article 58.2.d) of the RGPD,
that the video surveillance system is only operational when he or someone
member of your family make use of the dwelling they have in the property where
that one is installed.

THIRD: NOTIFY this resolution to C.C.C. and inform the claimant.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month from
