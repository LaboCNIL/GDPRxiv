Article 72.i) of the LOPDGDD, with a sanction of warning>>.

FIFTH: On 10/19/2020, the allegations were received regarding the proposal for
resolution in the following terms:

In the first place, a violation of the principle of typicity is alleged based on the fact that the
imputed facts do not constitute an infringement of the RGPD as it is mandatory to
publication of listings.

In this sense, it should be noted that the alleged facts are described as
infringement in articles 32.1.b) and 5.1.f) of the RGPD and typified in articles 83.4 and
83.5 of the RGPD, respectively, as described in the fundamentals of the
this resolution. Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

Secondly, it is alleged a violation of the principle of presumption of innocence with
based on the fact that the imputed facts are not proven.

In this sense, it means that the imputed facts are accredited not only by
the own manifestations of the person in charge of the treatment and of the person in charge of the
CEIP, but they are documented as proven in the document requested by the
Inspection of this AEPD and sent to it on 02/21/2020, with identification number
check-in registration 008501/2020. This document expressly contains the data
published figures of family income, family members, economic score and
social score. Consequently, this AEPD in its investigative actions
has undermined the aforementioned principle. Therefore, the claim must be rejected.

Third, the application of the “in dubio pro reo” principle is alleged.

sedeagpd.gob.es

8/17

In this regard, the facts imputed have been unquestionably accredited by
which does not proceed to apply such a legal principle. Consequently, the claim must
be rejected.

Fourth, it is alleged that they have not been established in a reasoned manner in the Proposal for
Resolution of the proven facts and their legal qualification, which has generated
helplessness.

In this sense, it should be noted that in the Motion for a Resolution the same
proven facts that in this resolution, as well as its legal qualification that
they are reproduced in the FOURTH section of the antecedents of this Resolution. In
Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

Fifth, it is alleged that the Instructor has taken as evidence against the "list
of dining aids”, and does not contain the data referred to in this
process.

In this sense, point out again that the published list is included in the
file at the request of the Data Inspection of this AEPD dated 02/21/2020 and
entry registration number 008501/2020, and it expressly includes the
family income data, family members, economic score and score
community of 439 students. Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

Sixth, it is alleged that a security breach has not occurred every time
that the data was not published in a place of permanent consultation "as could be
the case of an official newspaper” (sic).

In this regard, it should be noted that it is proven that the list of dining aids was
published on the website "***PLATAFORMA.1" whose responsible is the public body
now investigated giving access to the analyzed data to third parties without it being
relevant the form of its publication but that third parties have had access to the
themselves. Therefore, the claim must be rejected.

Seventh, a list of regulations issued by the investigated is provided, and that
it is stated that the technical and organizational measures have already been implemented for the purpose
of not violating the regulations on data protection and given that in the
Community there are 1634 public centers it is absolutely impossible to control
information and documents published in the centers.

In this sense, it should be noted that the measures included in the
regulations indicated, since they only state the measures to be taken without this
implies its proper implementation in the information systems of the investigated.
Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

Eighth, it is alleged that the criteria established in
to article 83.2 of the RGPD when assessing responsibility.

In this sense, to point out, as stated at the beginning of the aforementioned article 83.2 of the
RGPD, these criteria will be applied in administrative fines. In the present case

the penalty is a warning, so its application is not appropriate. In
Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

In the ninth and last place, AEPD files from the years 2018 and
2019 in which similar incidents have been filed, having resolved diligently
and minimized the consequences of the reported breach.

In this sense, it should be noted that in the indicated cases the implantation of
during the previous investigations of all those necessary corrective measures

made statements in this regard without reliable evidence of their
effective implementation in the information systems for which the organization is responsible.

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals

From the facts described and accredited, it is clear that the Department of Education, Culture
and Sport did not have implanted in the web "***PLATAFORMA.1" of which it is
responsible, appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of
security appropriate to the risk, since it is accredited by the documentation
in the file and the own allegations of the person in charge of the CEIP that
omitted its duty to previously guarantee that the content of the information that is

normative regulation transcribed above, having allowed the inclusion in the aforementioned website
