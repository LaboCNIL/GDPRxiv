Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and with
based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On January 14, 2020, the Subdirectorate General for Nationality
and Civil Status (hereinafter, SGNEC) attached to the General Directorate of Registries and
of Notaries (currently the General Directorate of Legal Security and Public Faith, in
hereinafter, DGSJFP) currently organically and functionally dependent on the
General Secretariat for the Innovation and Quality of the Public Service of Justice (in
hereinafter, SGICSPJ) of the Ministry of Justice, notifies this Spanish Agency of
Data Protection (hereinafter, AEPD) a data security breach
(hereinafter, security breach) after having knowledge through a
email by a citizen of a notification of granting of the
Spanish nationality corresponding to another person (treatment related to the
application ***APPLICATION.1).

BACKGROUND

Date of the events: ***DATE.1

Date of detection of the security breach: ***DATE.2

Security bankruptcy notification date: 01/14/2020

INVESTIGATED ENTITIES
General Directorate of Legal Security and Public Faith of the Ministry of Justice with
NIF S2813610I and DIR3 E00131304, and with address at Plaza de Jacinto Benavente 3,
28012 Madrid (organically and functionally attached to the SGICSPJ with NIF S2813610I and
DIR3 E05077001 as data controller).

RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION ACTIONS

1. Regarding the facts:

 Around 2:30 p.m. on ***DATE.2, the SGNEC stated that it had
received telephone communication in relation to the receipt of an email
electronically by a citizen of a notification of granting of the
Spanish nationality by residence corresponding to another applicant. In that
moment, the SGNEC contacted the DTSPD by telephone to find out the
nature of the problem and the number of notifications potentially
affected by the security breach, and it was decided to stop the
automated notifications until the cause of the incident is known and resolved.
No copy of the citizen's email is provided.







The SGNEC informs that on January 13, 2020 it received from the DTSPD
base report of the security bankruptcy notification that was communicated
to the AEPD on January 14, 2020. From the aforementioned report, the SGNEC
states that the incident reaches 34 cases and subsequently incorporated
another 2 more, up to 36, of the 23,394 nationality resolutions resolved
until that moment. There is no record of the intervention of the Protection Delegate of
Data in accordance with article 39 of the RGPD.

The SGNEC declares to have attached said report to the AEPD in its notification
security bankruptcy, and points out the following:

“The problem had its origin in a modification in the generation process
of resolutions granting nationality by residence that had been
made in the application ***APPLICATION.1, for processing files of
nationality by residence, on ***DATE.1”.

The SGNEC informs that the detected failure originated when attaching the certificate
of birth of the nationality applicant to the resolution document of
grant of nationality. The high number of resolutions generated from

concurrently is the consequence of a reinforcement plan that punctually
implies a scenario of high request concurrency. Also, the SGNEC
adds that said reinforcement plan has involved the participation of a number
much higher number of processing personnel than initially planned in the design of the
app.



The SGNEC points out that the personal data affected in the data breach
security would correspond to the NIE (Foreigner Identification Number),
name, surnames, place and date of birth, address at the time of
submit the application, the nationality grant itself and a copy of the
birth certificate (in which date and place data appear again
of birth and names and surnames of the parents).

The SGNEC reports that it has registered two other incidents of

security of personal data, on dates 06/28/2019 and 10/31/2019,
also with incorrect notifications due to recipient error when communicating
nationality concessions, with 11 and 70 people affected respectively
and already solved. The SGNEC states that the incident that occurred on 06/28/2019
derived from the process of sending telematic notifications for an incident in
the application database, while that of 10/31/2019 consisted of
an incorrect management of exceptions in the case of saturation of different
systems with which the application interacts, including the signature holder of the
Ministry of Justice.

The Data Inspection records that, on 09/05/2018, the

AEPD issued a sanctioning procedure resolution, of reference
AP/00049/2018, in which the now
investigated to the General Directorate of Registries and Notaries
dependent on the Undersecretary of Justice (now DGSJFP, dependent on the
SGICSPJ). Specifically, in the aforementioned sanctioning file it was accredited
that “The Information Technology and Communications Division of the
Ministry of Justice informed that the service did not contemplate the concurrence and
he made a mistake when composing the birth certificate. The volume and page that
appear on the certificate are correct and correspond to the details of your
birth registration, but the content with the digitized image is the
of another request, that of marriage”. (the underlining is from the AEPD).

2. Regarding the measures prior to the security breach event:



The SGNEC is currently identified in the RAT (Registry of
treatment activities) of the Ministry of Justice as responsible for the
processing of data in the management of applications for Spanish nationality.
The SGNEC provides an internal working document to update the RAT in
that DTSPD is specified as co-controller now
Analyzed as of January 2020.







The SGNEC states that it has carried out an EIPD (impact assessment
on data protection) in June 2019, which contains an analysis of
risks associated with the data processing it manages.

The SGNEC has a report on actions derived from the EIPD in the
management of applications for Spanish nationality, which aims to minimize
the potential risks analyzed through the implementation of various
corrective actions until they are reduced to residual risks that have resulted
be high level.

The DTSPD, as co-controller of the treatment (according to the RAT
provided and in force since January 2020), has a procedure on
the quality of the software projects of the Ministry of Justice throughout
throughout its life cycle, which serves as the basis for its construction and development in the
defining the phases that govern the analysis and design of the solution, as well as
the tests that must be carried out in the different environments (development,
integration, quality and pre-production), until its final implementation in the
production environment, and active monitoring after it is put into production.

3. Regarding the measures after the event of the security breach:

3.1. Of a corrective nature (reactive to correct the security breach):



The SGNEC states that, once the incident was known, on ***DATE.2 at
2:30 p.m., the signing and notification process was blocked
automated of the concessions of Spanish nationality in the application
involved (***APPLICATION.1).

 On Tuesday, January 14, 2020, the security breach was notified to the

AEPD.







The SGNEC states that on Wednesday, January 15, 2020 at 3:50 p.m.
hours, the Citizen Folder is removed from the notifications
electronic documents of the concessions of Spanish nationality issued with
erroneous content when referring to another nationality applicant.

The SGNEC provides evidence that on Thursday, January 16, 2020,
electronically signed 72 trades communicating the security breach
both to the addressees of the resolutions and to the people who
received wrongly, the acknowledgments of receipt were completed,
enveloping and delivery notes for mailing to interested parties.

The SGNEC states that on January 21, 2020 the exit was registered
from the General Registry of the Ministry of Justice the list of
administrative notifications together with the envelopes, acknowledgments of receipt and
delivery notes for processing communications to interested parties.





The SGNEC informs that the signature process will be enabled again on the 23rd
January 2020 at 3:40 p.m., but not the notification process
of the concessions of Spanish nationality that continued
blocked as of February 26, 2020.

The SGNEC states that as of Friday, January 24, 2020 at
9:00 a.m. notifications of granting of
nationality manually after verifying that the document
to notify is correct.

3.2. Of a preventive nature (proactive to prevent the bankruptcy of
security):







The DTSPD claims to have designed in the application ***APPLICATION.1
a more robust measure that checks the content of documents
granting of Spanish nationality prior to notification,
in such a way that no document can be notified
corresponding in contents with the processed file. The SGNEC
reports that a prior quality control protocol has been established (not
details it) to ensure that the document to be notified is correct,
making the notification manually and supervised.

The DTSPD states that the new version is in the testing phase
of the application that incorporates in the notification process the reading and
verification of the content of the document to be communicated
prior to notification. The SGNEC conveys that the new version of the
application is (as of February 26, 2020) undergoing controls
of quality (functional tests, performance tests and tests of
concurrence).

The DTSPD reports having detected the origin of the security breach
in an inappropriate handling of temporary files when performing the annexation of
the birth certificate to the decision granting nationality.
Additionally, the SGNEC highlights that work is being done on the
implementation of an automatic process that goes through the forms of the
application and that allows an additional quality control to be carried out
made in the application options, in such a way as to guarantee
that the resolutions granting Spanish nationality are
notified correctly.

 As of the date of this agreement, the Data Inspection of the AEPD
has not been informed of the progress and guarantees established/implemented
in the new app/version of grant notifications
nationality, as well as the tests in the new version of November
2019 carried out, risk analysis, impact assessment on
rights and freedoms of the data subjects and whether the incident has been resolved.

THIRD: On July 9, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimant, for the
alleged infringement of Article 32 of the RGPD, Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, Article 25 of the
RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

FOURTH: On October 7, 2020, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing in the following terms:

<<That the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency sanction
the General Secretariat for the Innovation and Quality of the Public Service of Justice, with
NIF S2813610I, by:

1.

two.

3.

Infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD
with a penalty of warning.
Violation of articles 25, 32 and 33 of the RGPD in relation to the article
5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) of the RGPD with sanction of
warning.
Infringement of article 34 of the RGPD in relation to article 5.1.f) of the RGPD,
typified in article 83.4.a) of the RGPD, with a penalty of warning.

4. And require the SGICSPJ to provide this AEPD with a summary of the final result
of the action plan, already started in February 2020, which applies
more robust security measures in data processing in the
application ***APPLICATION.1 for which it is responsible in terms of protection
of data through the SGNEC>>.

FIFTH: On 10/23/2020, the respondent presents allegations to the proposal of
resolution in the following terms:

In the first place, the respondent considers that there was no breach of integrity, since
which, as defined by the National Security Scheme (ENS), integrity is
that “property or characteristic that the information asset has not
been altered in an unauthorized manner”, so it is not applicable to this
case.

In this regard, it should be noted that the new principle of integrity, previously called
security, collected in article 5.1. f) of the RGPD, brings cause of the provisions of the
Article 1 of the aforementioned regulation (object of the RGPD) regarding the processing of data
personal in a broad sense and with temporal projection regardless of the
specific data that are subject to treatment, and not only with respect to specific data
and static over time for a given treatment. Consequently, the
claim must be rejected.

Secondly, regarding the dimension of confidentiality of the data processed, the
investigated indicates that it was limited to 36 direct people and another 36 indirectly,
so it was produced to a finite and determined number of persons, and not to a
number of indeterminate persons, as indicated in article 25.2 of the RGPD.

In this sense, it means that the indeterminacy referred to in the article
25.2 of the RGPD refers to the principle of design by default under which the
technical and organizational measures applied shall in particular ensure that, by default,
personal data is not accessible to an indeterminate number of people

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/17

physical, and not the number of people affected by the breach. Consequently, the
claim must be rejected.

Thirdly, it provides a set of measures taken that are reactive and
proactive, from which a diligent conduct emerges in order to minimize the
impact of the breach and prevent similar situations from recurring in the future. In this
sense provides a documentary on new quality actions in the code, tests
functions that especially contemplate the concurrence of requests and composition
of documents to be notified, review of the life cycle, training of the
development and regular monitoring plan of the code quality plan.

Fourth, the respondent provides a documentary on the bidding for a file
of hiring for the adequacy of the treatments carried out in the unit to the
ENS, starting its execution in September 2020, reinforcing the policies of
security by both the personnel assigned to the DTSPD and its main
service providers acting as data processors. To this end,
provides specifications of technical prescriptions that govern said contract.

In fifth place, the investigated party provides notification to the AEPD of the breaches of
security dates 06/28/2019 and 10/31/2019.

Lastly, the respondent reports on the new scenario of co-responsibility in
the treatments as indicated in article 26 of the RGPD by the DTSPD.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and the documentation
in the file, the following have been accredited:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: On January 14, 2020, the Subdirectorate General for Nationality
and Civil Status (hereinafter, SGNEC) attached to the General Directorate of Registries and
of Notaries (currently the General Directorate of Legal Security and Public Faith, in
hereinafter, DGSJFP) currently organically and functionally dependent on the
General Secretariat for the Innovation and Quality of the Public Service of Justice (in
hereinafter, SGICSPJ) of the Ministry of Justice, notifies this Spanish Agency of
Data Protection (hereinafter, AEPD) a data security breach
dates dated 11/22/2019 after becoming aware through an email
electronically by a citizen of a notification of granting of the
Spanish nationality corresponding to another person (treatment related to the
application ***APPLICATION.1).

SECOND: The notified security breach reaches 34 affected and
later they incorporated another 2 more, up to 36, all of them related to resolutions
of nationality improperly notified to third parties. The security breach
It was communicated to the interested parties on 01/16/2020.

THIRD: The security breach had its technical origin in a modification in the
process of generating resolutions granting nationality by residence
that had been made in the application ***APPLICATION.1, for processing
nationality files by residence, on ***DATE.1.

FOURTH: The fault detected originated when attaching the birth certificate of the
nationality applicant to the nationality granting resolution document
as a consequence of the high number of resolutions generated in an
concurrent.

FIFTH: The personal data affected in the security breach would correspond
to the NIE (Foreigner Identification Number), name, surnames, place and date of
birth, address at the time of submitting the application, the granting of
nationality and a copy of the birth certificate (in which the data appears again)
date and place of birth and name and surname of the parents).

SIXTH: It is stated that the SGNEC, organically dependent on the SGICSPJ, has
registered two other personal data security incidents, on dates
06/28/2019 and 10/31/2019, also with incorrect notifications due to error
recipients when communicating concessions of nationality, with 11 and 70 people
affected respectively and already solved. These security breaches were
duly notified to the AEPD but there is no evidence that they were communicated to the
affected.

SEVENTH: It is recorded, on 09/05/2018, the AEPD issued a procedural resolution
sanctioning reference AP/00049/2018, in which it was sanctioned for the same
facts to those now investigated to the General Directorate of Registries and
Notaries dependent on the Undersecretary of Justice (now DGSJFP, dependent on
of the SGICSPJ). Specifically, in the aforementioned sanctioning file it was accredited and
thus it is stated in the proven facts that "The Information Technology Division
and Communications of the Ministry of Justice reported that the service did not contemplate the
concurrence and made a mistake when composing the birth certificate.

EIGHTH: Regarding the treatments carried out by the SGNEC, there is evidence of
carried out a DPIA (data protection impact assessment) in June
of 2019, which contains a risk analysis (RA) associated with data processing
which manages. However, there is no update of the AR and EIDP in the
modifications of the treatments carried out on 11/22/2019 that gave rise to the
security breach of that date. However, in arguments the proposal of
resolution provides the appropriate update to the RGPD, LOPDGDD and ENS of the
treatments carried out by the investigated as well as the implantation of the
corrective measures both active and proactive to avoid repetition in the future
of similar events.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the General Regulation for the Protection of
Data (hereinafter RGPD) recognizes each control authority, and according to what
established in articles 47 and 48 of the Organic Law on Data Protection and
Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

Definitions:
Article 4.12 of the RGPD, “violation of the security of personal data”: any
breach of security resulting in accidental destruction, loss, or alteration
or illicit of personal data transmitted, conserved or treated in another way, or the
unauthorized communication or access to said data.
Article 4.7 of the RGPD, “responsible for the treatment” or “responsible”: the person
physical or legal entity, public authority, service or other body that, alone or together with
others, determine the purposes and means of the treatment; if the law of the Union or of the
Member States determines the purposes and means of processing, the data controller
treatment or the specific criteria for their appointment may be established by the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

III

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 4.7 of the RGPD and in the RD
453/2020, of March 10, which develops the basic organic structure of the
Ministry of Justice, article 3.1, corresponds to the SGICSPJ the direction, impulse and
management of the ministerial powers related to civil status and nationality, to
through the DGSJFP (art 7.1.b) of the aforementioned RD) that processes and resolves the files
Nationality.

Consequently, currently the SGICSPJ is responsible for the processing
of personal data in all the actions carried out by the different
organic units attached to it relating to marital status and nationality, whenever
that, as stated in article 4.7 of the aforementioned RGPD, is the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
purposes and means of the treatment, in coherence with the provisions of article 3 of the aforementioned RD
453/2020 by which the SGICSPJ is responsible for the "direction, promotion and management of the
ministerial powers relating to marital status and nationality…”.

It should be noted that although the General Secretariat for Innovation and Quality of the
Public Service of Justice was not responsible for data processing now
analyzed at the time of the security breach(es) (from dates
06/28/2019, 10/31/2019 and 11/22/2019), it is true that with the current basic structure of the
The Ministry of Justice is responsible for carrying out the mandatory regularizations in the
data processing for which it is responsible and promote with due diligence
its adaptation to the RGPD.

IV

Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, Principles related to treatment, states the following:
"1. The personal data will be:
(…)
f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

In the present case, the security breach must be qualified as integrity and
confidentiality as a consequence, in the first place, of the lack of security
adequate and appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity), and secondly
place for unauthorized access to personal data by third parties outside

(confidentiality), both principles regulated in the same article 5.1.f) of the RGPD
above transcribed.

Article 25 of the RGPD establishes the following:

v

“Data protection by design and by default

1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of the application and the nature,
scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as the risks of different probability and
seriousness that the treatment entails for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical data, the data controller will apply, both at the time of determining the
means of treatment as well as at the time of the treatment itself, technical measures and
appropriate organizational arrangements, such as pseudonymization, designed to apply
enforce data protection principles, such as data minimization, and
integrate the necessary guarantees in the treatment, in order to meet the requirements of the
this Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.

2. The data controller will apply the technical and organizational measures
with a view to guaranteeing that, by default, they are only processed
the personal data that is necessary for each of the specific purposes of the
treatment. This obligation will apply to the amount of personal data collected, to
the extension of its treatment, its conservation period and its accessibility. Such
measures shall in particular ensure that, by default, personal data is not
accessible, without the intervention of the person, to an indeterminate number of people
physical.

3. An approved certification mechanism may be used under Article 42
as an element that proves compliance with the obligations established in the
sections 1 and 2 of this article”.
In this sense, and regarding the allegation that the security breach that
gave rise to sanctioning procedure AP/00049/2018 (resolved on 09/05/2018) was
corresponds to “completely different data processing”, it should be noted that
the origin of the analyzed gaps has a common cause in the lack of foresight since
the design of the concurrency factor in the processes of both applications
(***APPLICATION.2 and ***APPLICATION.1).

Article 32 of the RGPD establishes the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:

 a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
  b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

 c) the ability to restore the availability and access to the personal data of

quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

  d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of

the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular account shall be taken of
takes into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.

Article 34.1 of the RGPD establishes the following:

"1. When it is likely that the personal data breach
entails a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
responsible for the treatment will communicate it to the interested party without undue delay.”

Regarding article 32, it is clear that the data controller did not apply the
appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security
appropriate to risk; risk that was not even evaluated in the update of the new
version of the application ***APPLICATION.1.

Regarding article 34, it should be noted that the actions carried out
It follows that the SGICSPJ, through the SGNEC, notified this AEPD of the breach of
security of personal data dated *** DATE.1 and communicated it to the interested parties
on 01/16/2020. However, the investigated also affirms that there were two breaches of
security similar and previous to the one now investigated. It appears in the allegations to the
resolution proposal that the gaps of dates 06/26/2019 and 10/31/2019 were
notified to this AEPD (art 33 RGPD) but there is no evidence that they have been communicated to
the interested parties (art 34 RGPD), although in the first it is stated in the notification that
communicated to the interested parties but it does not appear to have been carried out and, in the second, it is stated that
The interested parties were notified by telephone but it is not recorded as having been carried out.

SAW

Article 24 of the RGPD, responsibility of the person in charge of the treatment, indicates the
Next:
 
"1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment,
as well as the risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the
processing is in accordance with this Regulation. These measures will be reviewed and
will update when necessary.
2. When they are provided in relation to treatment activities, between
the measures mentioned in paragraph 1 shall include the application, by the
responsible for the treatment, of the appropriate data protection policies” (…).

7th

From the facts described, it is clear that the SGICSPJ, as responsible for the
treatments now analyzed and through their organs hierarchically
dependents, did not apply the appropriate technical and organizational measures to
guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, since it is accredited
that outside third parties had access to information reserved to the interested party (applicant
of Spanish nationality) as a consequence of the malfunction in the start-up
production of the new version of the application ***APPLICATION.1 that manages the
DGSJFP through the SGNEC, both hierarchically dependent on the SGICSPJ.

12/17

The risks in the treatment contemplated in the new version of the application
***APPLICATION.1 should have been taken into account and evaluated by the person in charge of the
treatment (SGICSPJ) through the mandatory risk analysis and, where appropriate,
impact assessment and, based on it, have established the measures
technical and organizational that would have prevented the loss of control of the data
of applicants for Spanish nationality as a result of the
reiterated and already known lack of anticipation of concurrent processes in the treatment
of data from the different applications (APLIACIÓN.1 and APLIACIÓN.2).
 
It must be insisted that the level of risk and the impact were already known with
in advance, since there is a sanction file in this AEPD for acts
similar (AP/00049/2018 and resolution date on 09/05/2018) and, in addition, the SGNEC
indicates that similar events were recorded on dates prior to the security breach
dated 11/22/2019, specifically on dates 06/28/2019 and 10/31/2019.

It is also stated in the aforementioned prior sanctioning procedure that the current DTSPD
informed the SGNEC that "the service did not contemplate the concurrence and was wrong to
compose the birth certificate…” and yet a year later it was repeated
on three other occasions faithfully the incident for the same cause.

The consequence of this absence in the control of data processing from the
design and by default (art 25 RGPD) and the implementation of security measures
appropriate (art 32 RGPD) to the risk of the new version of the application
***APPLICATION.1 causing the date gap ***DATE.1, was the loss of
integrity and confidentiality of personal data, violating the two principles
collected in article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

Article 83.4 of the RGPD provides the following:

viii

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and of the person in charge pursuant to articles 8, 11, 25 a
39, 42 and 43;”

the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

In the present case, article 5.1.f) of the RGPD is again violated, this
once referred to the principle of confidentiality, for which the classification
that indicates article 83.5 of the RGPD transcribed above.

For its part, article 71 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements" determines what
following: Violations constitute the acts and conducts referred to in the
sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that

It establishes article 73 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements considered
serious”, the following: “1. Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the

(…)

d) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that result

(…)

t) The processing of personal data without having carried out the evaluation of the
impact of processing operations on the protection of personal data in
assumptions in which it is required. (…)”. This section, in relation to the
changes made on ***DATE.1 in the application ***APPLICATION.1.

It establishes article 74 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements considered
minor”, the following: “They are considered minor and the remaining ones will expire after a year.

paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the

data security that entails a high risk for the rights and freedoms of users
affected, as required by article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
unless the provisions of article 73 s) of this organic law are applicable”.

From all of the above, the following can be concluded:

Regarding the classification of infractions of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD
 
- Violation of the principle of confidentiality (art 5.1.f) RGPD), is considered
very serious infraction for purposes of prescription (three years) as indicated in article
72.1.a) of the LOPGDD, punishable by a warning as provided in article 77.2
of the LOPDGDD.
 
Regarding the classification of infractions of article 83.4.a) of the RGPD

- Lack of diligence in implementing data protection by design
(art 25 RGPD in relation to article 5.1.f) of the RGPD), the absence,
violation lack of due diligence in the application of security measures
according to the risk (art 32 RGPD in relation to article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD), are considered serious infractions for prescription purposes (two years)
as stated in article 73.d), f), g) and t), of the LOPGDD and punishable with
warning according to article 77.2 of the LOPDGDD.
 
- The lack of communication to the interested parties of the security breach date
06/28/2020 and dated 10/31/2019 (article 34 of the RGPD in relation to article
5.1.f) of the RGPD) considered minor infringement for prescription purposes (one year)
as stated in article 74.ñ) of the LOPGDD and punishable with a warning
according to article 77.2 of the LOPDGDD.

Consequently, the violation of both principles (integrity and confidentiality)
they constitute the element of culpability that requires the imposition of a sanction.

It must be insisted that the absence of consideration of the risk already known and
previously sanctioned by this AEPD in the aforementioned sanctioning procedure
(AP/00049/2018) and after both security breaches prior to the current date
06/28/2019 and 10/31/2019, has again led to improper access by third parties
unrelated to the personal data of the interested party and repeatedly affecting the
