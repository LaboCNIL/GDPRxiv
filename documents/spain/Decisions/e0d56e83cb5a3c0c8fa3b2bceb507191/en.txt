to the extent that the interested party already has the information.”

The aforementioned infractions are typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law. […]”

III

Article 22 of the LOPDGDD, regarding "Processing for video surveillance purposes"
establishes in its section 1 that: “The natural or legal persons, public or private,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

may carry out image processing through camera systems or
video cameras in order to preserve the safety of people and property,
as well as its facilities. This treatment, which is legitimized in the cause of
fulfillment of a mission public interest public interest included in the article
6.1.e) of the RGPD, you must comply with the principles set forth in article 5 of the
mentioned European standard.

One of these principles is data minimization (article 5.1.c), which establishes the
the need for the data processed to be the minimum necessary to carry out
carry out the purpose pursued by the person in charge. In this way, the cameras
installed may only capture images of public thoroughfares to the extent that they are
essential and will avoid affecting the legal sphere of third-party rights
people without just cause, so it will not be possible to obtain images of spaces
public or areas of private use of third parties without the concurrence of the aforementioned
just cause.

On the other hand, individuals who use this type of device are responsible
that these comply with current legislation, and must comply, when the property
is under the regime of community of owners, with the requirements
established in Law 49/1960, of July 21, on horizontal property (LPH). A) Yes,
The installation of a video surveillance system by an individual will require
authorization of the board of the community of owners both when its
location in a common area as when, even installed in an area of use
exclusive, is oriented to surrounding common areas and captures —respecting in any case
the principle of data minimization—tangentially common areas.

As regards the joint assessment of factual elements in the
sanctioning procedure, it is necessary to point out in advance that, according to
with article 77.5 of the LPACAP, “Documents formalized by officials
to which the condition of authority is recognized and in which, observing the
corresponding legal requirements, the facts verified by those
they will test them unless the contrary is proven”. Therefore, not having
presented the claimed no evidence to the contrary, must be fully understood
proven, for the purposes of this proceeding, the facts found and
documented by the agents of the Guàrdia Urbana de Figueres in their complaint report
of September 17, 2019.

Taking into account the foregoing, the proven facts show that the
claimed has installed a video surveillance system - alleging reasons of
related to the tourist accommodation business that it runs— in areas
of the building, such as the portal and the landings of the floors. the system like this
installed violates the principle of data minimization because the cameras in
operation capture areas that exceed those that would be covered by the
mentioned end of security. The fact that some real estate of the building
are dedicated to tourist rental does not legitimize the capture of common areas,
unless by agreement of the board of the community of owners the
installation of a video surveillance system for the purpose of guaranteeing the security of the
building.

The RGPD establishes as another of its fundamental principles that of transparency in
relationship with stakeholders. As one of its manifestations, article 13 of the
RGPD —in compliance with the duty of information contained in the preceding article
12 of the same legal text - regulates the information that must be provided when
personal data is obtained from the interested party, a situation that occurs in the
assumptions in which images are captured by a video surveillance system. In this
sense, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD establishes that "The duty of information
provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be deemed fulfilled
by placing an informative device in a sufficiently visible place
identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the identity of the person in charge and the
possibility of exercising the rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679. A code of identification may also be included in the informative device.
connection or internet address to this information”.

Regarding this issue, the facts proven in this proceeding also
allow to prove that the claimed, as responsible for the treatment carried out
through a video surveillance system, has breached the aforementioned duty to
information, as there is no information poster informing those affected that
data processing of your image is being carried out, the identity of the
responsible or the possibility of exercising their rights in this regard.

v

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, is established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among
they have the power to sanction with a warning -article 58.2 b)-, the
power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD
-article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the controller or processor
that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period -article 58. 2
d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

SAW

administrative fine and its amount in each individual case will be taken into account
aggravating and mitigating factors that are listed in the aforementioned article, as well as
any other that may be applicable to the circumstances of the case.

In order to set the sanction to be imposed on the defendant, it is considered as concurrent the
aggravating circumstance of intentionality or negligence in the infringement (article
83.2.b) of the RGPD), since the claimed party has not shown the minimum diligence
required to the owner of a business in compliance with the applicable regulations in
matter of data protection.

the infringement of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD and one thousand euros (€1,000.00) for the infringement of the
article 13 of the RGPD, resulting in a total of three thousand euros (€3,000.00).

On the other hand, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD,
according to which each control authority may "order the person in charge or in charge
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a
specified period […]”, the person in charge must prove, within a period of (1) month, the
following ends:

Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
