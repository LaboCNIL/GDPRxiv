FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

II

         Article 58 of the RGPD, “Powers of Attorney”, says:

                 “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers
corrections listed below:

(…)

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

(...)

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period.

(…)

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular

(…)”

III

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "lawfulness, loyalty and
www.aepd.es

transparency". The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:

a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the

interested party (<<legality, loyalty and transparency>>);”

          Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

The infraction for which the claimed entity is held responsible is
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

IV

The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. The
personal data of the claimant were incorporated into the information systems of
the company, without having proven that it had legitimately contracted,
had your consent for the collection and subsequent processing of your data.
personal data, or there is any other cause that makes the treatment lawful
effected.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
person who contracted on behalf of the claimant.

Well, it follows that the claimant received an email from the claimed in the

which indicate that you have successfully purchased a mobile terminal that you do not recognize.

In this regard, we must point out that contracting is electronic and the
claimed does not provide evidence that proves the contracting of the line ***TELÉFONO.1.

On the other hand, as a result of the transfer of the claim, they send a letter to the
claimant informing him that his data have not been communicated to files of
capital solvency and credit, but requesting the payment of the amount owed.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

7/13

Precisely, required to the requested documents of realization of the
contracting the number ***TELÉFONO.1 and its corresponding signature, states that the
contracting was done online so it does not have a signature.

Although the company states that the contract where all the data appears
claimant, he has the appearance of loyal, truthful and lawful to
Vodafone.

It is important to highlight that, by examining the contract, it is verified that there are
the personal data of the claimant, his bank details, and the mail "***EMAIL.1",
which, according to the claimant, belongs to his daughter, but the claimed daughter does not contribute
evidence or any indication of the origin of the contract (session IP) or
confirmation or electronic signature of the contract (SMS confirmation or e-mail
email with one-time key, confirmation call, etc.). For that reason, not
The origin of the claimant's data cannot be established, nor the acceptance of the
treatment of these.

However, and this is essential, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy to

the processing of the claimant's data.

In short, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
one that shows that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one
claimed to hold

Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of the fundamental right
of protection of personal data requires that it be accredited that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. Failure to act in this way -and this Agency, who is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.
