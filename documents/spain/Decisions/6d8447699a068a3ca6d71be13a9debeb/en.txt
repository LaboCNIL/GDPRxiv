“I am not the owner of the real estate that is detailed, nor of the cameras. these
properties are in the name of my family, my father and my mother, Mr. B.B.B. Y
C.C.C.. The cameras you refer to are not video recording cameras. they are video
gatekeepers that my family placed so that my mother can see my father when he approaches with the
tillage tractor to open the gate, since the land mostly to be
come are owned by my family.

Yes, there are two stickers that indicate that there is a camera, but over time they
they have deteriorated and yes it is reasonable to place them again, and it will be done. I offer the
possibility of entering the house to check the installation, see what they are
video intercoms that turn on and are seen on television monitors, with technology
old and there is no recorder installed.

They are on when agricultural work is being done for aid, given
that from the house, the living room is oriented in the opposite direction. It has been
understood that no one is disturbed, no one can say that images have been used,
we must add to all this, that they are in contact with the Burgos company “Pablo
Pérez”, to place, in the future and all under the corresponding regulations, cameras
of vigilance, given that since I am a councilor of the municipality of the Bureba neighbourhoods,
I have had many threats, an attempt to run over them, they also tried to attack my parents
run over in this area, and no videos could be provided because it is not recorded.”
