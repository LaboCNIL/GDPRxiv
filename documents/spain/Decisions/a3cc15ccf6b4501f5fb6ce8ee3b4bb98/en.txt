FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD, recognizes to each Authority of
Control, and according to the provisions of articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and solve this procedure.

II

The facts made known to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
motivated the initiation of this sanctioning procedure for assuming a possible
violation of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD that indicates that personal data will be
“adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed (“minimization of data”)”, and article 13 of the same legal text,
provision that the information that must be provided to the interested party at the time of
collection of your data.

These infractions are typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) the rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22; […].”

III

In the present case, it is appropriate to analyze the presumed illegality of the installation of a
video surveillance system consisting of two cameras placed on the facade of the
property located at C/ ***DIRIMIENTO.1, - ***LOCATION.1.

The proven facts show the existence of some cameras installed
in front of the property, which, according to the allegations made by the
claimed in its response to the agreement to initiate this procedure, were of
simulated nature with a dissuasive purpose and that, according to the photograph
sent in response to the documentary evidence requested (and in respect of which the
requested date was that of its effective taking), were withdrawn.

As regards the possibility of installing a video surveillance system with the
purpose of guaranteeing the security of the dwelling and of the private space of the
claimed, it means, in the first place, that individuals who use this type of
devices are responsible for ensuring that they comply with current legislation, and must
comply, when the property is under the regime of community of
owners, with the requirements established in Law 49/1960, of July 21, on
horizontal property (LPH). Thus, the installation of a video surveillance system by a
particular will require, for the treatment to be legitimate, authorization from the board of
community of owners both when its location is projected in an area
common as when, even installed in an area of private use, it is oriented to areas
surrounding commons and captures —respecting in any case the principle of minimization
of data established in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD - tangentially areas
common.

Regarding the collection of public roads, article 22 of the LOPDGDD, relative to
processing for video surveillance purposes, provides that, in order to guarantee the
security of persons and goods, images of public thoroughfares may be captured "in the
to the extent that it is essential", in accordance with the principle
mentioned data minimization. It is reported that, regarding the recruitment and
images on the road it is reported that the power to capture images on public roads is
attributed, in general, to the Security Forces and Bodies in accordance with
with the provisions of Organic Law 4/1997, which regulates the use of
video cameras by the Security Forces and Bodies in public places and their
development regulations and that, in any case, the possibility of capturing a portion
essential of the same for security reasons would correspond, for the
characteristics of the building in question, to the community of owners.

On the other hand, with regard to compliance with the duty of information contained in the
article 12 of the RGPD, article 13 of the same legal text provides the information that
must be provided when the personal data is obtained from the interested party,
situation that occurs in cases of image capture by a system of
video surveillance. In this sense, article 22.4 of the LOPGDD establishes that "The
duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
understood fulfilled by placing an informative device instead
sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information."

In another order of things, it is pointed out that it is possible to use a system of
video surveillance that focuses on land covered by a right of way always
that the person in charge has legitimacy to do so and respects the principle of
data minimization.

Notwithstanding what is stated in the preceding paragraphs, taking into account the allegations of the
claimed, in this case the cameras that were installed were of a
simulated responding to a dissuasive purpose and were also withdrawn.

It is worth remembering, in relation to this type of device, the recent Judgment
of the Supreme Court, Civil Chamber (STS 3505/2019, 11/07/19) which states that
"That fake security cameras also represent an illegitimate intrusion into
intimacy since those affected do not have to endure "uncertainty
permanent” on whether or not the device is operational.”

The plaintiff's right to the tranquility of his private life also includes
that of not having to endure permanent uncertainty as to whether the camera
oriented towards his farm is operational or not, since his external appearance prevents him from
verify it and, on the other hand, the defendant would always have the possibility of substituting the
non-operative chamber for another operative.

For the same reasons, the installation of the camera facing the garden of the
plaintiff cannot be considered an exercise of a ius usus inocui in the field
of neighborhood relations, because far from being innocuous, it objectively disturbed, and
without necessity, the life of the plaintiff.”

This type of conduct may have repercussions in other spheres of law,
affect the privacy of third parties, so it is recommended that they be
exclusively oriented towards your particular property. The deterrent function of
this type of device is limited, therefore, by the proportionality of the
measure, which is fulfilled by avoiding intimidating third parties and being oriented towards the
main strategic points of the house (eg orientation towards
street, adjoining windows, etc.).

IV

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
themselves of the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a concrete and determined fact, which obliges in any case to
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), which
establishes that:

"two. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible will have the following rights:

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is proven.”

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
of April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the

sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.”

v

Based on the foregoing, it cannot be concluded that the withdrawn devices subject to
the claim were endowed with the capacity to obtain or record an image
any, so that by not being able to determine the existence of an effective treatment
of data it is not possible to speak of infringing conduct within the framework of the regulations
data protection regulator, which is why we proceed to the File of the
present procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure as there is no
accredited administrative infraction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to B.B.B. with NIE ***NIE.1 and inform
A.A.A.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month from
counting from the day following the notification of this resolution or directly
contentious-administrative appeal before the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the
National Court, in accordance with the provisions of article 25 and section 5 of
the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the
Contentious-administrative jurisdiction, within a period of two months from the
day following the notification of this act, as provided in article 46.1 of the
aforementioned Law.
