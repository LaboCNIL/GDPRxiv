particular case;"

Article 83.5.b) of the RGPD establishes that:
 “The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

users who fill in the form included in the website
https://www.cerrajerosmadridd24horas.com/ without providing them, prior to their
collected, all information on data protection provided for in article 13
of the aforementioned GDPR.

According to the evidence currently available
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
investigation, the exposed facts could constitute, on the part of the claimed, a
infringement of the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD.

This infraction could be sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with the
article 58.2.b) of the RGPD, when collecting through said form basic data of the
users and consider that the administrative fine that could fall in accordance with the
provided in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a disproportionate burden for the
claimed, whose main activity is not directly linked to data processing
personal, since there is no record of the commission of any previous infraction in terms of
Data Protection.

Likewise, if the existence of an infraction is confirmed, in accordance with the provisions
in the aforementioned article 58.2.d) of the RGPD, in the resolution the claimed party may be ordered,
as responsible for the treatment, the adequacy of the information offered to users
whose personal data is collected from them to the requirements contemplated in the
article 13 of the RGPD, as well as the provision of supporting evidence of the
compliance with what is required.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the graduation criteria
of the sanctions whose existence has been proven,
