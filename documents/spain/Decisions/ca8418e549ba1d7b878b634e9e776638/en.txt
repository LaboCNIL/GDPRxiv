Yo

control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law

Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The formal procedures
ted by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a sub-
sidiario, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

In the present case, the claim dated 10/19/21 is examined by me-
gave from which the following is transferred as the main fact:

“presence of a video-surveillance camera in common areas without having the

due authorization from the Board of Owners” (folio No. 1).

When installing security cameras in neighboring communities, it is necessary
that the Community of Neighbors has the favorable vote of 3/5 of the total
ownership of the owners who in turn represent 3/5 of the share quotas.
cipation as developed in article 17 of the Horizontal Property Law (LPH).

You must have the corresponding Act of the Community of owners
where such agreement is reflected where they have been informed of the installation of the
camera system to the group of community members, as well as at least the purpose
and/or responsible for the processing of your personal data.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the cameras can only capture images of the common areas
communes, not being able to focus on public roads, nor affect adjoining homes, putting
in any case losing the rights at stake.

Video surveillance systems involve the processing of personal data.
In accordance with article 1.2 of the RGPD, the regulations in question are intended to
object of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in
In particular, your right to the protection of personal data.

In the Statement of Reasons of the LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) it is dis-
states the following “Together with these assumptions are collected others, such as video-surveillance
lance (...) in which the legality of the treatment comes from the existence of a public interest
public, under the terms established in article 6.1 e) of EU Regulation 2016/679”

The facts described above imply an affectation to article 6 RGPD apart from
Statute 1st letter e) “…compliance with a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise

Likewise, it is transferred that the system has been installed with a sign without being filled
in its essential aspects, by not indicating the "responsible" or the way to exercise the
rights regulated in articles 12-22 RGPD.

Article 22 section 4 of the LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) provides:

  “The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing a computerized device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment
to, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this information
tion” (*bold belongs to this Agency).

In accordance with the extensive evidence available in this pro-
sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the claimed party has installed a system
of cameras without a priori having informed the group of community members of the Building in
question, putting up an informative poster that is not filled in its aspects
essential.

The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the content of article 6 RGPD, previously cited,
as well as article 13 RGPD.

Article 13 GDPR provides:

“When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the person in charge
of treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide you with all the information
tion indicated below:

a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, of his or her representative.

presenter;

b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where appropriate;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended and the legal basis

IV

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: “Infringements of the following provisions
will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20
EUR 000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount.
to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount:

a)

b)

the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
the rights of the interested parties pursuant to articles 12 to 22 (…)”.

In this case, when motivating the sanction, the following is taken into account:

-the nature of the infringement, as it is affecting the right of third parties who have
been intimidated by them, having installed themselves in an entrance/exit area
of the property (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

-The intentionality or negligence of the conduct, due to the lack of a proper information poster.
fully formed, indicating the data controller (art. 83.2
b) GDPR).

According to the above, it is considered correct to agree on a sanction encrypted in the
amount of €600 (six hundred euros), for the alleged infringement of art. 6.1 e) GDPR, and
another sanction encrypted in the amount of €200 for the infringement of article 13 RGPD, upon
lack the installed poster of the information on the person in charge of the treatment and the
way to exercise the rights regulated in articles 12-22 RGPD, being the su-
amount of both infractions: €800 (eight hundred euros), according to
a community of owners.

v

Among the corrective powers contemplated in article 58 of the RGPD, in its section 2
d) it is established that each control authority may “order the person in charge or
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions
of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within
a specified period…”. The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and after assessing the graduation criteria
tion of the sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE C.P. ***COMUNIDAD.1, with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction
of article 6.1 e) of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of
€600.

SECOND: IMPOSE C.P. ***COMUNIDAD.1, with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction
of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of €200.

THIRD: ORDER the claimed entity- C.P. ***COMMUNITY.1 so that in
Within ONE MONTH from the notification of this administrative act proceed to the
regularization of the system in question, proceeding to provide supporting documentation
tive of such extreme to this organism.

FOURTH: NOTIFY this resolution to the entity C.P. ***COMMUNITY.1.
