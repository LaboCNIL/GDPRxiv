FOURTH: On 05/06/22, this Agency received a written response to the
request made at the time to the claimed entity, in which the following is indicated:

1.- Due to the stoppage of activities, especially in the subsector of
tourist accommodation a stoppage of activity due to the cessation of activity. With the
reactivation, this company has proceeded to modernize the management platform
of tourist accommodation and product of this company and to adapt their
products of Royal Decree 933/2021. For this purpose, a beta version was introduced in
development in some clients to carry out the beta-tester, without it being a
exploitation platform yet. This company detected that some customer
exploited, because they couldn't test otherwise due to the
little computer knowledge.

In the trial version, the information of the extensions was visible in
the URL window, but only a computer technician, very knowledgeable
advanced would be able to decipher its content and access the code. The
The test phase lasted one month and the improvements detected were incorporated into the
platform, which was incorporated at the exploitation level to all the teeth
blocking any information in the URL window that might offer
some kind of information about the system.

From the text of the complaint presented, it describes that an "id-
numerical", and that therefore "it is possible to access an arbitrary reservation
only changing the id-numeric by a previous one”.

This id-numeric could perfectly be a hash generated by an algorithm
and not an auto-incremented number, as described by the complainant computer scientist.
If you have tested it to find out that it is an autoincrementing number, that is,
who has accessed the data of another client, trying different options
numerical, means in our opinion that he has committed a crime of the
described in art. 197.2 of the Penal Code.

Increasingly we find ourselves with righteous assumptions in terms of
informatics and data protection, which "ARE FORCED TO INTERPOSE
COMPLAINTS”, and based on spurious interests, as in this case.

2º.- The beta test version of our product took a month to be
tested by some clients and then passed to the exploitation version, which
was installed as the final version and no longer provides any information on the
url.

3.- We understand that there has been no access to the data of our
clients, apart from the illegal and criminally punishable access that the
complainant when testing that the number that appears in the url is an auto number
incremental. We do not know if you have tried one or more numbers
previous registrations, which can be found in the procedure of
criminal investigation to be initiated.

4.- The data that is collected in a customer registration when you purchase a
tourist accommodation are merely identifying and mandatory that

citizen security and, as well as the adaptation that has been made in our
product to comply with the provisions of Royal Decree 933/2021. Therefore, the
Information is collected with the consent of the interested party and by legal obligation,
as legal bases of treatment.

5º.- We believe that the complainant, who in turn has committed the crime of
art.197,2, has not proceeded to use or alter the data to which it has had access
for his computer manipulation, for which he would have aggravated his crime, and for
both the unauthorized access to the data by the complainant, has not
had any consequence.

6.- At the time of knowing the facts through this file, it had already been
launched the operating version of our computer system and
therefore we have not had to make further modifications to the
platform.

7.- Attached as document number 1, the risk report of the
company, which describes the security measures adopted in
the processing of personal data.

8.- The Records of Treatment Activities are attached as annexes 2 and 3
as Responsible and as Treatment Manager.

9.- The security breach has not been communicated to anyone affected, given that
have reviewed the access logs, and the only access has been the one made by
the complainant computer scientist having carried out the test to find out that the
number that appears in the URL is not a hash but an auto number
incremental, therefore, there have not been affected.

10.- The security violation has not been communicated since it has not
there was such a gap. The trial version was not installed for use
as an exploitation version with real data, as we have previously
repeated, and therefore no breach could have been recorded (apart from
illegal and criminally reprehensible accesses made by the complainant).

11.- No new substantial updates of our
platform, since we do not know that the Administration is going to impose
new control requests to the tourism/hotel sector and our software
It is currently adapted to the new Royal Decree that comes into force in April.

12.- The last statement that we want to make is to specify again that the
only illegal action that has been carried out here, and that is criminally punishable
as indicated in art. 197.2 of our Penal Code, is access to information
from third parties without the consent of the computer scientist submitting the
complaint, and that is fully proven by the documentation that he himself
presents (as much as he tries to blur sensitive information). Ha
accessed third-party data without consent, you have entered the code
source of the platform and also informs the
Administration, in proof of your honesty and good citizenship. not only us

of his commission.

SIXTH: On 10/26/22, by the Board of Directors of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, a sanctioning procedure is initiated against the claimed entity, at
appreciate reasonable indications of violation of the provisions of articles: 5.1.f of the
GDPR, for the processing of personal data without adequate security for it,
because they were available to users who modified the number in the field
correspondent; of article 32 of the GDPR, for not applying the technical measures
necessary to guarantee an adequate level of security when managing
the personal data of article 13 of the GDPR, due to the lack of information
provided to users, as established in the aforementioned article.

SEVENTH: On 11/14/22, the claiming entity submits a written statement to
the initiation of the file in which, among others, it indicates:

FIRST.- ICNEA TECNOLOGÍA SL, is not the owner of the domain or the page
website https://www.alquivir.com/.

This domain and web is a franchise of its client WORKANDFUN SEVILLA,
which is dedicated to the rental of tourist apartments in various cities of
Andalusia.

ICNEA TECNOLOGÍA SL, is a provider of computer solutions, in
specific to an online booking platform (as there are other
companies that provide payment platforms, such as Paypal or
Stripe), which is integrated into its clients' web pages.

The client is WORKANDFUNSEVILLA (B.B.B.) who subleases the use of the
platform to ALQUIVIR MANAGEMENT OF TOURIST APARTMENTS
(alquivir.com).

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/16

Therefore, ICNEA TECNOLOGÍA is only MANAGER OF
TREATMENT, which does not decide on the collection of customer data, its
use, information or protection of the rights of the interested parties (it does not have to comply with
the requirements of art. 12 and following GDPR, not being responsible) and so
You only have to follow the instructions of your principal, which are summarized in the
custody of the data that is captured through the technological platform that
uses alquivir.com on ICNEA servers, where its clients have
reserved a storage space (charges for its use and depending on the
occupied space), in the extension reserved for them to which
accessed through the url workandfunsevilla.icnea.net and to which the measures of
necessary security (restricted access, encryption and logical measures
necessary). ICNEA is a mere provider of services and space of
storage and complies with the necessary security measures.

As can be seen on the alquivir.com website itself, it is indicated that
This page has been made by B.B.B. (see the footer of the web), which is the
Fiscal name that invoices under the brand WORKANDFUNSEVILLA. In the
mentioned platform, a space is enabled so that the person in charge of
treatment, in this case alquivir.com, place your own privacy policy
and the contracting conditions of its services, on which it neither advises nor
ICNEA TECNOLOGÍA does not intervene in any way.

Attached as Doc. 1, service contract in which it is clearly indicated
that WORKANDFUNSEVILLA undertakes to comply with the provisions
laws in force at all times regarding the content of their databases
data.

The document itself specifies that the platform is planned for the
maintenance of 20 apartments, for which €175 per month is charged, which
which is an important fact since it shows that we do not
We are dealing with a "high volume of data" as indicated
in the sanction proposal, but that WORKANDFUNSERVILLA is a
small owner who manages his apartments and those of some
franchisee, as is the case of alquivir.com.

A great manager of apartments and who in turn handles a large volume of
data is Airbnb that manages more than 200,000 apartments throughout the
Peninsula. Therefore, such a serious and harmful sanction proposal, due to the
large amount of data that it handles is absolutely disproportionate because
based on two false premises: that ICNEA is a large owner and that ICNEA
is responsible for treatment, when it is only a service provider
computers for a small holder of tourist apartments.

In short, ICNEA TECNOLOGÍA SL is not responsible for data processing and does not
is obliged in this case to provide information and notices about
privacy of art. 12 and following GDPR on the alquivir.com website,
nor in that of workandfunsevilla.icnea.net, so it has not committed any
infraction and is not punishable for this reason, indicated in the proposal for
sanction.

SECOND.- The sanction proposal does not correctly analyze or evaluate the
facts presented in the malicious complaint made by the technician
IT D.A.A.A., from the company (...). The reservation suite was delivered to
B.B.B., from Workandfunsevilla to evaluate it, since it was in the
beta, and he unilaterally installed it in operational mode with real data in
the website that it managed for its smallest franchisee, alquivir.com.

When ICNEA realized the facts, it took the suite offline and replaced it
by the current one, which had already completed its internal testing phase. I just know
is aware, from the access logs, that a single user (the computer
complainant) had accessed the data of the previous reservation.

Therefore, ONE DATA, would have been exposed, and without ICNEA having
knowledge, since the reservation suite was not delivered to be
used in exploitation, if not in demo mode. And this data, which was accessed,
carried out by an expert computer scientist, with the sole purpose of harming ICNEA, which did not
had wanted to hire your company as a protection advisor
of data. Needless to say, that unauthorized access is a criminal offence, and more
Using your professional skills.

A normal user, who accesses the platform, it is impossible for there to be
able to view the data. The possibility of visualizing that single piece of information was not
ICNEA's fault, but its client WORKANFUNSEVILLA, who installed it in the
website of one of its franchisees, alquivir.com. And you can't even access
to this data individually, because it only offers the service of
storage. Therefore, this procedure must be archived because it is not
caused an infringement by ICNEA TECNOLOGIA.

THIRD.- At the legal level and application of art. 5.1 and 32.1 both of the
European Regulation 679/2016 (GDPR), despite considering this part that
are not applicable since there has not been a fact that could be
contained in both articles, it must be considered that its application
individualized to the same event radically violates the principle of
proportionality of article 29.5 of the LRJAP.

If both norms were applicable to the fact that concerns us here, we
we would find ourselves before a medial contest of administrative sanctions and not
both must prevail, if not only one of them, since both are
cause effect. When an infraction is carried out as a means or instrument
necessary to carry out a different one, only the most serious of the crimes can be punished.
infractions in contest, and not both.

FOURTH.- In this sanction proposal, a
erroneous application of articles 83 GDPR and 70 et seq. LOPD, in addition
of not taking into account recital 148 GDPR, nor Art. 58.2 b GDPR. No
only, as we have already alleged, there has not been a punishable act,
neither willful nor malicious conduct, but rather that we are not dealing with an alleged
seriousness, nor a large volume of data processed (in addition to never
this company has been sanctioned or even investigated by this Agency).

  ICNEA is not responsible for the treatment of the data obtained through
through alquivir.com or that are stored in workandfunsevilla, therefore, they do not
there is an obligation to inform pursuant to art. 12 and following GDPR by
of the person in charge of treatment, but the obligation is of the person in charge of the
web alquivir.com and workandfunsevilla, that is, from D.B.B.B., which is its owner.
ICNEA is not responsible for the open use of its platform that
It was in the testing phase, because it was delivered for testing outside the
operating environment and it was his client who installed it on alquivir.com.

the intrusion into a single customer data of alquivir.com, was carried out by a
computer technician maliciously, using means that are not up to
reach of a normal user of a reservation platform (or of any kind
of platforms), therefore, at the level of risk analysis, the risk has been
minimum. In no case has there been a serious risk affecting a large
data volume. It has affected a single piece of data, and it has been accessed
unlawful manner by the complainant. Impose a sanction on this
course is to bless the illegal actions of third parties, which precisely
They make this type of complaint for the benefit or revenge of their activities
commercial (by analogy if the evidence has been obtained illegally, it is not
applicable sanctioning rule).

FIFTH.- Nor have the moderating rules been applied correctly
administrative sanctions (seriousness, damage, assiduity, repair of the
damage, etc): it has been established that it is a tourist reservation company and therefore
Therefore, they handle a large volume of data, as if we were talking about
Airbnb, rather than a local company that exclusively manages 13
tourist apartments (remember that ICNEA does not carry out this
activity, if not just a technological platform that facilitates the
management to its clients).

Recital 148 of the GDPR clearly indicates (and is included in article 58.2, b)
GDPR) that, depending on the severity, volume of data, repair of damage,
means by which the Control Authority has learned, in the case
that the penalty would be a disproportionate burden, a penalty may be imposed
warning. Impose a penalty of €23,000 on an SME, which
billing barely exceeds €500,000, it means, at the moment
of crisis and recession, not only a disproportionate burden, but the
leads to its demise.

By virtue of the foregoing, I REQUEST THE AGENCY FOR THE PROTECTION OF
DATA, consider these allegations made against the proposal of
sanction EXP202200368 (PS/0470/2022), and on its merits render said
proposal, archiving this procedure and alternatively, apply the
art. 58.2,b GDPR, issuing a warning to ICNEA TECNOLOGIA, all
this by virtue of the foregoing.

According to the claimant, when making a reservation, through the platform

(www.alquivir.com) the website forwarded the user to another address:

your personal data to complete the reservation and stated that the field
named “idNumerico” that appeared in the URL was auto-incremental and that it was

stated that there was no privacy policy and cookie policy.

Initially, information on the claim was requested from the ICNEA entity
