competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

The RGPD defines in its article 4:

or of the Member States;

Both on the date of issuance of the invoice, 5/2019, and the date of the exhibition,
October of the same year, the RGPD is in force. The LOPDGDD establishes in its
unique derogatory position: “Normative derogation”:

1. Without prejudice to the provisions of the fourteenth additional provision and in the
Fourth transitory provision, the Organic Law 15/1999, of 13
December, Protection of Personal Data.

2. Royal Decree-Law 5/2018, of July 27, on urgent measures is repealed

matter of data protection.

3. Likewise, many provisions of equal or lower rank are repealed

previous sections when this is derived from a legal obligation or is necessary

Regarding the data of the claimant, which are additionally found in the
invoice, it is not relevant in this case and context, the use of these data as a person

only with the name, but the NIF and the bank account are added, and they are used to
relate him to people belonging to the PP environment in ***LOCATION.1,
as the claimant means, that is, as a way to identify the owner
of the establishment, a center in which people who feel related to the
popular party came and celebrated different events. The claimant is a
secondary in the presentation of the facts, insofar as the protagonists are the
group that attended the celebration or meal, on which the opinion is expressed by the
reclaimed. Freedom of expression manifests itself on this aspect, being able to
add that ***RESTAURANTE.1 or its owner is related to the ideas of the party, but not
violating the right of the owner of the data that by the fact of being the owner of the
establishment, you have to sacrifice your personal data, so that the claimed

The tweet is used as criticism of public spending, being the owner of the
establishment also related to said group, and according to the respondent, it was necessary

There is no doubt that the reference to public spending by a political group is
of interest, but if fully identifying data is included, not only name and
surnames, but NIF and bank account of someone who does not participate in said event, but
who is responsible for the establishment, no matter how close he is to the political ideas that are
In other words, the objective of expressing oneself collides with the ownership of personal data, especially
which govern some basic principles. Such data in this case and context is
considered included within the scope of application of the regulations for the protection of

It does not follow that for the disclosure of third parties through the
social network of the expenses of a group of people related to a party, which was
the literal of the expression expressed in the tweet, the personal data must be given
full details of the issuer of the invoice, and the complete bank account. It does not participate in

out on social media.

The defendant, in a private capacity, with his name and surnames on Twitter, expresses
their opinions, and identifies the data of the complainant. In the use of the data, you must
attend any legitimate basis provided for in article 6.1 of the RGPD. The right
of the claimant, that their data is not used in social networks,
prevails when it comes to commenting on a meal of a PP group
that passes to the treasury, or that meet very often in that place, without it being necessary
In addition, express and graphically display the data of the claimant in the photograph,
In addition, owner of the establishment.

The aforementioned exposition in relation to the intention of the news does not add or is

It is considered that in front of his nominal citation and the object of the comment, he does not add

Under the principles of adequacy, pertinence, congruence, and relevance in the
use of the data, when treating them without the consent of the claimant, may
use Twitter to express opinions. However, in this case, the identity of that
person is not relevant to what is meant by the comment, which was that
the food was to be paid for from the public budget.

The same results would have been obtained by covering the account and the NIF, and

effects when the message is shared.

In accordance with the constitutional jurisprudence that defines the profile of the right
of data protection, in this case, the use of the claimant's data on Twitter is
a use that has not been consented by its owner, and there is no legitimate basis in the
treatment of said data in relation to the purpose that is to be understood
in the message that the defendant spread.

It is considered that the claimed party has infringed article 5.1.a) of the RGPD that

indicates: “The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
("legality, loyalty and transparency"); as it is not considered lawful to send the aforementioned
data exposed in the photo that associates the expressive literal of his opinion, which uploads it to
the said network.

The respondent does not certify that the processing of the claimant's data
appears incardinated in some legitimizing scheme of the assumptions that would enable
the treatment, for which the commission of the imputed infraction of article

On this point, we limit ourselves to indicating -reiterating what was stated by this Agency-

GDPR only talks about public access sources when regulating the right to information

Therefore, the concept of public access source does not exist in the RGPD or in the LO-
PDGDD and, what is more, despite the terms in which article 6.2 of the
repealed LOPD, was not a valid concept in our legal system during

from publicly accessible sources by regulating the right to information if the data is not

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for treatment, including the conditions for consent under the articles
5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83
of the aforementioned Regulation, with administrative fines of a maximum of €20,000,000 or, alternatively,

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of

a specified manner and within a specified time.

In this case, the respondent is a natural person, who does not habitually carry out
or professional mainly treatment of personal data, and they do not know
history of previous infractions in the matter of data protection, for which reason
opted for a penalty of warning. It would be advisable, if you have not yet
made, that the data of the claimant exposed and related to the subject of this
complaint were removed from the aforementioned tweet, in order not to persist in the behavior that
motivates this proceeding.
