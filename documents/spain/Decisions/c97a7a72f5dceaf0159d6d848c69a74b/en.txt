FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

II

           Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

                 "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

4/7

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

The infraction for which the claimed entity is held responsible is
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

  (…)
b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so.

The thirteenth clause of the contract for the use of the facilities
facilities at the Fitness Place Sport Center establishment signed by the claimant
with Vasco Andaluza on December 30, 2011, says:

“In accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/1999, the client is
informed and accepts the incorporation of your data to the automated files,
property of the company that owns the center, whose data and address appear on the seal
stamped on the front of this document; address they can write to
accompanied by a photocopy of the DNI or document proving your identity, to
exercise their Rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition.”

5/7

Well, the claimant agreed to communicate her data to the owner company
of the Basque Andalusian sports center, not to the rest of the companies belonging to the
same.

The file contains a bank receipt for the refund of the amount claimed,
where the name of a third company appears, the claimed one, which makes the
deposit into your bank account. Hence, data processing has occurred
without legitimation of the claim, which is the treatment it does when issuing the receipt.

Regarding the exercise of rights that the claimant claims to have made,
It is not proven that he identified himself correctly, and furthermore, he does so at a
email address that is not the place specified in the contract and to a
address that is not enabled for it.

IV

        The determination of the sanction to be imposed in this case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:

effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

          “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
applied under articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;
  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question

As aggravating the following:

- In the present case we are facing a negligent action on significant data that

allow the identification of a person (article 83.2 b).

- Basic personal identifiers are affected (article 83.2 g).

This is why it is considered appropriate to adjust the sanction to be imposed on the

claimed and set it at the amount of €2,000 for the infringement of article 6 of the RGPD.

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
