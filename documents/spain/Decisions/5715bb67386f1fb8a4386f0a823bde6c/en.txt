Regarding the causes that have made the incident possible:
-

After analyzing the facts, they conclude that the failure detected related to this
information system is due to an exposure of data information
personal (public) accessed using a valid session cookie, and editing
the URL accessed one of the input fields called "idPaciente" with an ID
valid. In this way, a series of personal data can be displayed
corresponding to the person with the ID used. Additionally, it is found that
the web application had insufficient blocking mechanisms against

CONCLUSIONS
- Regarding the causes that have made possible the incident published in
ElDiario.es, the representative of the Ministry states that, after analyzing the
facts conclude that the fault detected related to this system of
information is due to an exposure of personal data information
(public) accessed using a valid session cookie, and editing the URL
accessed one of the entry fields called "idPaciente" with a valid ID.
This explanation does not agree with the security incident communicated to this
Agency by FACUA, incident for which personal data was
exposed when making an appointment request with a CIPA number (Code of
Personal Identification of the Community of Madrid) existing. It has been proven
by the inspection of data that Internet Archive keeps the web page
https://autocitavacuna.sanidadmadrid.org existing on the date of June 14,
2021, in which it can be verified that to request an appointment for the vaccine
it only requests the CIPA code and if it does not have said code, it will
request ID and date of birth.
On the other hand, the representative of the Ministry acknowledges that, among the actions
taken to solve the incident, information has been reduced to a minimum to

FIFTH: On July 15, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,
for the alleged infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, Article 33 of the GDPR, Article
25 of the GDPR and Article 32 of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

Once the Initiation Agreement was notified, the MINISTRY presented a written statement of allegations in the
which in summary stated:

-That in the months of May and June 2021, we were at a very
critical related to the management of the pandemic. In this period, in which the
vaccination process to the population in general -although in a staggered manner by
age ranges-, urgently required the organization and opening of said
process in a massive way and, consequently, it was necessary to offer a
system with clear and simple information on the process to be followed by the
citizenship and the urgency required for its adoption at the organizational level, including
also several channels to facilitate the summons of the citizenship.
This state of health emergency made it necessary to develop a
large number of new tools with great speed to be able to provide the best
service to citizens through the development and deployment of the summons process
for vaccination in an agile way in authorized centers, even allowing the
citizen to select the time and center of their preference, which made it easier for the
Comunidad de Madrid reached a high number of vaccinated population,
contributing with said action to be able to face this situation of
pandemic as soon as possible, and facilitate the mobility of the population before the start of
periods traditionally considered as holidays in which there would be
the mobility of the population.

-In this regard, this Agency recalls that both article 25.1 of the GDPR
such as 32 of the same legal text, emphasize the need that, both in the
time of determining the means of treatment as at the time of
own treatment, the person in charge adopts technical and organizational measures
appropriate to effectively apply the data protection principles
and guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, without being able to accept
as exempted by the circumstance of haste alleged by health emergency.
It is not possible to appreciate, in the present case, a state of necessity that justifies the
production of a defective application, which allowed access to
personal data of a large number of citizens, without carrying out
previously the necessary verifications to determine its correct
functioning, and whose use can cause a greater evil than that which is
intends to avoid.

-That in the initiation agreement reference is made in the section "Regarding the
security measures" to the point (...), which is generic, and which for Autocita is
enabled other access procedures so that citizens who do not

And that, according to the CONSEJERIA itself, is the development methodology

-That measures have been established for the continuous improvement of crisis management and
cyber incidents, focused on the prevention, detection and response to incidents of
security. Specifically, the following measures have been implemented to
strengthen security:

• The development and production process of applications has been reviewed, such as
part of the process of continuous improvement in the cycle of development and start-up of
applications, placing special emphasis on the following aspects:

o Reinforcement of the resources allocated to the prior validation of the security of the
application before it goes into production.
o Reinforcement of penetration testing and analysis methods

-In this regard, this Agency values positively the adoption of new
measures that result in greater security in terms of the treatment of

as the one that is substantiated in the present proceeding.

-That the (...) is part of the security regulatory body of the CSCM and is

for security. The content (...) constitutes confidential information whose dissemination,
outside the organization or the scope of people who do not need to know said

in the event that in the decision handed down there is some kind of
information of restricted use, it would proceed to its anonymization as a step
prior to its publication.

SIXTH: On August 12, 2022, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
sanction the MINISTRY OF HEALTH, with NIF S7800001E,

-For an infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, typified in article 83.5 of the
GDPR, with a warning.

-For a violation of Article 25 of the GDPR, typified in article 83.4 of the GDPR,
with a warning.

-For a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, typified in article 83.4 of the GDPR,
with a warning.

-For a violation of Article 33 of the GDPR, typified in article 83.4 of the GDPR,
with a warning.

SEVENTH: Once the proposed resolution has been notified, the DEPARTMENT presents a new
pleadings in which, in summary, reproduces those already submitted to the Agreement
Start, and adds that:

– Notification to the AEPD. As indicated in the first letter sent to the AEPD
in relation to this disciplinary procedure, depending on the level of risk of the
incidence, taking into account the low volume of data that could have been
affected, the type of the same, being only character data

11/23

identification, and the non-existent impact caused to the interested parties, it was estimated that
it was mandatory to inform the Control Authority.
Thus, article 33 of the GDPR states that "In the event of a breach of the security of
personal data, the person responsible for the treatment will notify it to the authority of
competent control in accordance with article 55 without undue delay and, if necessary
possible, no later than 72 hours after it has become aware of it, to
unless it is unlikely that such a security breach would constitute a risk
for the rights and freedoms of natural persons”.

Therefore, in the present case, as we have indicated, taking into account that neither
At that time, or currently, there is evidence that no citizen has
suffered negative consequences in their rights and freedoms, taking into account
consideration additionally that a significant number have not been affected
of personal data, nor have special category data of the
citizens, it was considered at the time that said communication was not necessary
since it was unlikely to constitute a risk to the rights and
liberated from citizens.

In the initial communication to the AEPD, from the design the tool had

The application was modified in order to improve the

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

In relation to the allegations presented to the resolution proposal, the
CONSEJERIA reiterates those already presented previously and adds that:

II

1-Regarding the notification of the breach to the AEPD, depending on the level of risk
of the incident, taking into account the low volume of data that could have been
affected, the type of the same, being only character data
identification, and the non-existent impact caused to the interested parties, it was estimated that
it was mandatory to inform the Control Authority.

In the present case, taking into account that, neither at that time nor currently,
there is evidence that no citizen has suffered negative consequences in
their rights and freedoms, additionally taking into consideration that they have not been
A significant number of personal data have been affected, nor have they been affected
special category data of citizens, it was estimated at the time that said
communication was not necessary since it was unlikely that a
risk to the rights and freedoms of citizens.

-In this regard, this Agency indicates that it has not been submitted by the
CONSEJERIA a risk assessment actually carried out, resulting, for
therefore, very indeterminate the concept of: "it was improbable that the
a risk to the rights and freedoms of citizens”

2- Security measures taken initially. In addition to the above, as indicated
In the initial communication to the AEPD, from the design the tool had

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

adequate security measures to avoid, both that the impact of possible
security incidents were high, such as the same happening.

-In this regard, this Agency confirms that, in fact, the incidents do
materialized, that a failure was detected in the system, due to a
exposure of personal (public) data information accessed through
a valid session cookie, and by editing the URL accessed one of the fields of
entry called "idPaciente" with a valid ID.
Additionally, it was verified that the web application had mechanisms of
Insufficient blocking before retries when entering the data of
authentication.

Article 5.1.f) "Principles relating to processing" of the GDPR establishes:

II

"1. Personal data will be:
(…)

f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or organizational procedures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it is clear that the personal data of those affected, held in the
CONSEJERIA database, were improperly exposed to a third party,
according to the news published in elDiario.es.

From the instruction carried out in this proceeding it is concluded that the
CONSEJERIA has violated the provisions of article 5.1.f of the GDPR.

The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the heading "Conditions
rules for the imposition of administrative fines" provides:

IV.

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that:

"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very
serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83.5 of the GDPR, the aforementioned article provides in
its section 7 the following:

V

“7. Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under the
Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether
