FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/16

Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that "The procedures processed by the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the treatment of
personal data and has:

"1. The personal data will be:
a) treated lawfully, loyally and transparently with the interested party (<<lawfulness, loyalty and
transparency>>;
(…)
2. The controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”

One of the manifestations of the principle of transparency described in section a)
of article 5.1. of the RGPD is the right that the RGPD grants to interested parties, and the
correlative obligation imposed on the person responsible for the treatment, to receive the
information referred to in articles 13 and 14 in the terms detailed
Article 12 of that legal text.

Articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD contemplate, respectively, two hypotheses: that the
data have been collected directly from the interested party, as is expected to happen
in the forms that the claimed party has published on its website, or that the
Data is not obtained from the interested party.

Article 13 of the RGPD establishes:

"1. When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide
all the information indicated below:
a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, of their
representative;
b) the contact details of the data protection delegate, if applicable;
c) the purposes of the treatment to which the personal data is destined and the legal basis
of the treatment;
d) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter f), the interests
legitimate of the person in charge or of a third party;
e) the recipients or the categories of recipients of the personal data, in their
case;
f) where appropriate, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to a third party
country or international organization and the existence or absence of a decision to
adequacy of the Commission, or, in the case of the transfers indicated in the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

8/16

Articles 46 or 47 or Article 49, paragraph 1, second paragraph, reference to the
adequate or appropriate warranties and the means to obtain a copy of these or
to the fact that they have been borrowed.
2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the data is obtained
personal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
fair and transparent
a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this period;
b) the existence of the right to request from the data controller access to the
personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation
of its treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability
of the data;
c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or article
9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;
e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a
necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to
provide personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of
not provide such data;
f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to which
referred to in article 22, sections 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, information
about applied logic, as well as the importance and consequences
provisions of said treatment for the interested party.
3. When the data controller plans further data processing
personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, you will provide the
interested party, prior to such further processing, information on that other purpose
and any additional information relevant under paragraph 2.
4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information.” (emphasis ours)

Recitals 39 and 60 of the Regulation help to specify the scope of the
right of information that is granted to the interested parties. Recital 39 says:

“All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For natural persons
it must be absolutely clear that they are being collected, used, consulted or
otherwise treating personal data that concerns them, as well as the extent to which
that said data is or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that all
information and communication regarding the processing of said data is easily
accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language is used. Saying
principle refers in particular to the information of the interested parties on the identity
of the person in charge of the treatment and the purposes of the same and to the information added to
ensure fair and transparent treatment with respect to natural persons
affected and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the data
personal data that concern them that are subject to treatment. natural persons
must be aware of the risks, standards, safeguards and rights
regarding the processing of personal data as well as the way to assert their
rights in relation to treatment. In particular, the specific purposes of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/16

processing of personal data must be explicit and legitimate, and must
be determined at the time of collection. [...].” (emphasis ours)

Recital 60 of the RGPD adds that “The principles of fair treatment and
transparent demand that the interested party be informed of the existence of the
processing and its purposes. The data controller must provide the data subject with
as much additional information as necessary to guarantee fair treatment
and transparent, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which
personal data is processed. The interested party must also be informed of the
existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling.
If personal data is obtained from data subjects, they must also be informed
whether they are obliged to provide them and the consequences if they do not.
they made." (emphasis ours)

The violation of article 13 of the RGPD is typified in article 83.5.b)
of the RGPD, provision that provides:

 “The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) (...)
b) the rights of the interested parties pursuant to articles 12 to 22;”

The LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, qualifies the violation of article 13 of the
RGPD as a very serious infringement (article 72.1.h) for which it sets a term of
three-year prescription.

III

The agreement to open this sanctioning procedure attributed to the Editorial,
responsible for the website https://edribadeo.com/contacto, an infringement of the
article 13 of the RGPD, since the forms included on its page do not offer
the information you are required to provide to people from whom you collect
personal data by completing the aforementioned forms.

The obligation to inform imposed by the RGPD covers all the extremes that
details its article 13 and the data controller must provide it to the interested party in
the very moment of data collection, that is, when the third party
fill in any of the forms.

The documentation in the file proves that from the website https://
edribadeo.com/contacto, of which the claimed party is the owner, three forms are accessed
of data collection: It is accredited that through the form that has been described
in section 1 of the second Antecedent -which indicates that by means of it one can
request information about the products that the complainant offers and know the opinion
of those who access the page - the name, the electronic address and the
opinion of the interested party. That through the form described in section 2 of the
Second antecedent -in which it is indicated that its purpose is that the owner of the

data create an account that will allow you to receive newsletters and promotions-
collects the name, surname, email and, only optional, the telephone. and what to
through the form described in section 3 of the second Antecedent -which says that
the information contained in it allows you to order products from the claimed party.
collects the email address, the telephone number, only optional, the name, surname,
postal address, postal code and city.

In turn, it has also been proven in the file that the website of the
Editorial does not inform about "its" privacy policy, nor does it provide the information that
specifies article 13 of the RGPD. The only reference to “a” privacy policy
that we can find on the website of the claimed party is related to
“reCAPTCHA” because under two of the three forms the following legend appears:
“This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply.
Google Terms of Service.”

Google reCAPTCHA is a system designed to differentiate between humans and
computers that is used so that bots cannot fill out application forms
maliciously on behalf of a human being and that the privacy policy of
Google, which is alluded to on the website of the defendant, obviously deals with
exclusively, on the processing of data carried out by Google to activate that
system.

We are, therefore, before a data treatment -the one that Google carries out to
provide the person in charge of the web page with its service of the recaptcha system- and before a
responsible for that treatment -Google- other than the claimed party against whom
this sanctioning file is directed. The data processing that Google carries out
carried out by reason of the recaptcha service has nothing to do with the breach by the
Publisher of the obligation to inform imposed by article 13 of the RGPD.

The Publisher has made no objections to the opening agreement. Neither has
responded to the requested evidence nor has it made any arguments regarding the proposal for
resolution. At this point it should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the
article 14.2.a) of the LPACAP, the claimed party is a subject obliged to relate
with the Administration by electronic means. Article 43 of the LPACAP, “Practice
of notifications through electronic means”, it has in its section 2, subparagraph
second, that “When the notification by electronic means is of a
mandatory [...] shall be deemed rejected when ten calendar days have elapsed
from the time the notification is made available without accessing its content.” (The
underlining is ours)

For its part, article 41 of the LPACAP, “General conditions for the practice of
notifications", it provides in section 5 that "When the interested party or his/her
representative rejects the notification of an administrative action, it shall be recorded
in the file, specifying the circumstances of the notification attempt and the
medium, considering the procedure completed and following the procedure.”

As stated in the Factual Background of this resolution, the agreement of
The beginning of the procedure was notified to the Editorial by electronic means and the
notification was rejected in accordance with article 43.2, second paragraph, of the LPACAP
with the effects provided for in article 41.5 of the LPACAP:

The letter in which the defendant was informed of the opening of the evidence phase and
various tests were requested, it was also notified by electronic means and was
also rejected in accordance with the provisions of article 43.2 of the LPACAP and
the effects provided for in article 41.5 of Law 39/2015. notification of that
writing was reiterated exceptionally through postal mail that was received by the
party claimed on 10/25/2022. However, the Publisher did not respond to the tests
requested and limited himself to writing a letter to this Agency -to the electronic address of the
DPD of the AEPD- in which he made various considerations unrelated to the evidence
required, among them that society "is in the process of disintegration and that
He has been without operations for 6 months”.

The proposed resolution was notified by electronic means, being made available to
provision of the claim on 03/23/2022 being rejected in accordance with the provisions of
article 43.2, second paragraph, of the LPACAP, with the effects provided for in article
41.5 of the LPACAP, dated 04/03/2022. The notification of that writing was reiterated
exceptionally through postal mail that was received by the claimed party on
04/13/2022. The Editorial has not made any objections to the proposed resolution.
In this regard, it should be taken into consideration that according to article 41.7
LPACAP “When the interested party is notified by different channels, it will be taken as
date of notification that of the one that would have occurred first.” So
Therefore, the term granted to evacuate the procedure of allegations to the proposal of
resolution concluded on 04/19/2022, ten business days computed from 04/03/2022,
date of rejection of the electronic notification.

It has been indicated that the respondent - who had access by postal mail to the
letter in which he was notified of the opening of the trial phase and the evidence
requested - sent an email to the DPD of the AEPD in which he stated, among
other things, that the limited company was in the process of disintegrating and
operations for six months. In line with this Editorial statement, we have
to underline that none of the circumstances he mentions are equivalent to the
extinction of the corporate legal person. The respondent party does not even prove the
dissolution of the company, indicating that, once the dissolution has been agreed, while the
liquidation is carried out, the company retains its legal personality (article 371 of the
Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, approving the Consolidated Text of the Law
of Capital Companies, TRLSC) In any case, the public deed of extinction of the
The company must be registered in the Mercantile Registry (R.M.), article 396 of the TRLSC.

In that sense, as stated in Proven Fact 7), as of 03/22/2022 the last
inscription that appeared in R.M. in the name of the limited company that is part
claimed in this file was dated 09/18/2020 and dealt with the constitution
of the company, the declaration of its sole proprietorship and the appointment as
Sole administrator of B.B.B. In short, on 03/22/2022 there was no such thing in the R.M.
no registration from which it can be inferred that the company was in the process of
dissolution, so the manifestation of the claimed, as the legal person
continues to exist, it is irrelevant for the purposes of this disciplinary proceeding.

This being the case, having been accredited in the file that the web page of the
which is the owner of the claimed party, despite including three data collection forms
personal, did not report in the terms to which it was bound by article 13

of the RGPD, it is concluded that that entity incurred a violation of this
provision that is subsumable in the offending type of article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

The LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, qualifies in article 72.1.h) as a
very serious infraction “The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the
processing of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this organic law.”

IV

The corrective powers that the RGPD attributes to the AEPD as a control authority
are listed in article 58.2, sections a) to j). Among them, section b)
refers to directing a warning to the person in charge or in charge of treatment when
processing operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation; section i), to the imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with
GDPR article 83; section d), to order the person in charge or in charge of the
treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
GDPR, when applicable, in a certain way and within a certain period
specified and section g), to order the deletion of personal data with
according to articles 16, 17 and 18.

Article 83.5. of the RGPD establishes an administrative fine sanction (article 58.2.i)
for the behaviors that are typified in it, without prejudice to the fact that -as provided in article
83.2. of the RGPD- administrative fines can be imposed together with other
corrective measures provided for in article 58.2 of the RGPD.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, recital 148 of the RGPD admits the possibility that
for the behaviors that are typified in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the RGPD
the administrative fine foreseen in those precepts can be replaced by directing the
responsible or in charge of the treatment a warning contemplated in the article
58.2.b) of the RGPD.

Recital 148 states:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.” (The underline is

The mention that recital 148 of the RGPD makes the infringement minor nothing
has to do with the classification that the LOPDGDD makes of infractions in very
serious, serious and minor. Classification that operates solely for the purposes of
prescription. In this case, for prescription purposes, the infringement attributed

to the claimed party is considered a very serious infringement (article 72.1.h
LOPDGDD)

The lightness or seriousness of the conduct contrary to the RGPD referred to in the
Recital 148 is linked to the risk that the infringing conduct entails for
the rights of individuals, in particular for the clients of the responsible entity
of the treatment. And in assessing the risk, it must be taken into account, among other
elements, the volume of customers.

Opinion 2016/679, WP 253, of the Article 29 Working Group (hereinafter
GT29) makes these considerations regarding the corrective measure of
warning:

“[...] by evaluating the facts of the case in light of the general criteria
provided for in article 83, paragraph 2, the competent supervisory authority may
decide that in a particular case it is more or less necessary to impose a measure
correction in the form of a fine.
[...]
Recital 148 introduces the notion of 'minor infringements'. sayings
Violations may constitute violations of one or more provisions of the
Regulation cited in article 83, paragraphs 4 or 5. However, the evaluation of
the criteria provided for in Article 83, paragraph 2, may lead to the authority
of control considers, for example, that in the specific circumstances of the case the
violation does not entail a significant risk to the rights of the data subjects and does not
it affects the essence of the obligation in question. In such cases, the fine may be
replaced (although not always) by a warning.[...]
Recital 148 does not oblige the supervisory authority to always substitute a fine
for a warning in case of a minor infraction [...] but rather it offers that
possibility, after a concrete evaluation of all the circumstances of the case.
[...]
However, the effective, proportionate and dissuasive reaction to a violation of the
article 83, paragraph 5, will depend on the circumstances of the case.” (The underline is
our)
 
In the present case, evaluating the facts in light of the criteria "provided for in the
article 83 section 2” of the RGPD, as advised by Opinion 2016/679 of the GT29, the
infringement of article 13 of Regulation 2016/679 for which the company is responsible
claimed party must be qualified as “minor”.

In this sense we can refer to section a) of article 83.2. of the RGPD that refers to
“a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered."

In relation to this circumstance, it turns out that in the alleged fact that is the subject of the
claim we have no news that there has been any affected, or that there have been
generated damages to an interested party. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that the
claimant has not even stated that he had completed any of the
forms that are published on the website of the claimed party through which

it collects personal data or that it had tried to fill in any of them.
He has limited himself to declaring, referring to the Editorial, that "they are concerned" because
has informed them that the forms on its website do not comply with the regulations
of data protection.

There are also no indications that the Publisher's website was widely distributed or that it
that its users were numerous. On the contrary, in this sense it is noted that
the claimed party began its social operations on 08/21/2020; the claim
formulated against her was presented to the AEPD on 09/08/2020 -only ten days later- and
the Agency verified on 10/02/2020 -therefore, less than two months after the
claimed party will start its social operations- the existence on its website of
personal data collection forms in which the information was not offered
which is mandatory in accordance with article 13 of the RGPD.

The circumstance described in section g) of article 83.2. GDPR – “g) the categories
of the personal data affected by the infraction”- can also be taken
as a reference to weigh the minor nature of the infraction that is attributed to the
claimed and, therefore, the advisability that in the event that here
examines whether the corrective warning measure is adopted.

Regarding this circumstance (g) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, this AEPD comes
understanding that, although the term category used in that provision
initially refers, making a literal and strict interpretation of the norm, to the
heading of article 9 of the RGPD, “Treatment of special categories of data
personal”, thus concluding that the RGPD classifies personal data, only,
in specially protected and the rest, a systematic and teleological interpretation of the
article 83.2.g) of the RGPD connects this precept with other classifications offered
the GDPR text.

In this sense, recitals 51 and 75 of the RGPD distinguish a group of data
which, by their nature, are particularly sensitive due to the
significant risk they may pose in the context of your treatment for
fundamental rights and freedoms. Data whose common denominator is that their
processing involves a significant risk to the rights and freedoms
fundamental because it could cause physical, material or
immaterial. This group or category of particularly sensitive data includes
the categories of specially protected data regulated by article 9 of the RGPD -
This is how recital 51 of the RGPD is pronounced - and, in addition, many other data are not
regulated in that provision.

Recital 75 of the RGPD mentions in detail the personal data whose
treatment may carry a risk, of varying severity and probability, to
rights and freedoms of natural persons as a consequence of the fact that they can
cause physical, material or immaterial damages. Among these he refers to
those whose treatment “could give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation
identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of
confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social damage”.

In the factual assumption that concerns us, it is verified that none of the data
data that could be collected through the forms published on the page
Publisher's website has the character of sensitive data. For this reason, from the point of
view of the "type of data to which the data collection forms refer" the
conduct of the claimed contrary to article 13 of the RGPD must also
be rated as mild.

In response to the indicated and for the reasons stated, having been accredited
the infringement of article 13 of the RGPD for which the Publisher is responsible,
infringement typified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD, it is agreed to adopt against it
the following corrective measures:

(I) Address a warning in accordance with article 58.2.b) RGPD.

(II) Order you, in accordance with article 58.2.d) RGPD, that within 15 days
computed since this resolution is enforceable, in accordance with the
provided in article 98.1.b) of the LPACAP, proceed to adopt the necessary measures
so that the treatment operations comply with the obligation of information that
Articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD are imposed unless the entity claimed proves before
this Agency that has canceled its website.

The respondent is informed that failure to comply with the measures
corrective measures that are imposed could constitute a new infraction that
would lead to the opening of a new sanctioning administrative procedure
directed against her. Such infraction is typified in article 83.6 RGPD and is
sanctioned with an administrative fine of a maximum of €20,000,000 or, in the case of a
company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous year, opting for the highest amount.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: ADDRESS a WARNING to EDITORIAL RIBADEO S.L., with NIF
B01864982, for an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in article
83.5.b) of the GDPR.

SECOND: ORDER EDITORIAL RIBADEO, S.L., with NIF B01864982, pursuant to
of article 58.2.d) of the RGPD, for an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD typified in
Article 83.5.b) of the aforementioned Regulation, which, within a period of 15 days computed
since this resolution is enforceable, proceed to adopt the measures
necessary to comply with the information obligation imposed by articles 12 and
13 of the GDPR.

THIRD: NOTIFY this resolution to EDITORIAL RIBADEO S.L., with NIF
B01864982.
