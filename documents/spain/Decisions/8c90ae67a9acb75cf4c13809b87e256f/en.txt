“Regarding point 1.- Detailed description of the facts:

The CABILDO certifies that on October 18, 2006, the procedures
necessary in the different administrations for the initiation of segregation and
constitution of the new municipality of El Pinar, on the Island of El Hierro, in accordance with the Royal
Decree 1690/1986, of July 11, which approves the Population Regulations
and Territorial Demarcation of Local Entities.

After overcoming the different processes and requirements of various kinds (administrative,
economic, popular...), on April 17, 2007, the Plenary approved
Extraordinary session of the Island Council the proposal for segregation and constitution
from the municipality of El Pinar; publishing the Minutes of said plenary session in the
transparency portal (at that time general portal) of the Cabildo de El Hierro.

Regarding points 2 to 5.- Regarding the causes of the incident and the information
about those affected:

The TOWN HALL recalls that at that time there were no regulations of a
insular or autonomous community with respect to this matter, for which reason the Law
15/1999, of December 13, regarding the protection of personal data.

That no information related to ideology, religion or
beliefs of the affected.

Likewise, the COUNCIL indicates that the communication of data between
administrations and a third party did not need the consent of the affected party since
these data were intended to be processed for statistical purposes for a question
of public interest, in accordance with article 11 section E) of the aforementioned standard. And it is that
this hearing process was necessary in accordance with article 84 of the already repealed Law
30/1992, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and Procedure
Common Administrative Law, which establishes that "before the drafting of the proposal for
resolution, a hearing process must be given to the interested parties so that they could
reveal the allegations, information and data necessary or related to

and the regulatory requirements subsequently required affects 3,996 people
residents in the segregated municipality and extra-municipal interested parties, whose data
published are of a personal nature, for which those affected can see
affected their right to intimacy, privacy or inviolability of the home, among
others.

And that the gap has been caused not by malpractice or error in copyright law
our corporation, if not for the absence (justified, since there was no imperative norm
to regulate this function) at that time of a system of transparency and
protection of personal data as effective and rigorous as that which exists in the
present.

With regard to points 7 and 8.- Regarding the request for remittance of the
data security measures and the Copy of the Activity Record of the
treatments:

consolidated as an obligation of the administration until well after the date of
incident, so we do not have reports on the security measures of the
treatments, the supporting documentation of the Risk Analysis or the Registry
of Activity of the treatments where the incident occurred. It is not until 2019, in
accordance with the obligations imposed in the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights,
when a specific area is created for the correct treatment and defense of the
personal rights and administrative transparency required of this corporation.

9 and 10.- Finally, regarding the notification to those affected and to the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection of this incident we emphasize that:

This controversy assumes relevance 14 years later due to the absence in that
then of insular, regional, national or European regulations on the protection of
personal data that we are aware of today, but that at no time
was carried out with intent to undermine or for purposes detrimental to the
interested. On the contrary, from this corporation it was necessary to publish
said data for the joint implementation of public opinion and consensus and causes
of this, among the population, in order to carry out a transformation of this
size at island level. Due to the long period elapsed and the different evolution
regulations on the matter adopted in the last 14 years, this security breach
It has not been revealed or communicated (since it is unknown) until
the day of receipt of this notification.

6 and 11.- Therefore, to correct and preserve the right to privacy and protection of
data of those affected, the Cabildo de El Hierro has proceeded to eliminate the
Minutes published and their rectification, which will not include any data whose
public exposure may compromise the rights of those affected.

In addition, an attempt will be made to review the documents published by this Corporation that
include data of this nature, and proceed to correct them in the indicated sense”.

Corresponding to the COUNCIL, as responsible, adapt the treatment that supposes

Anticipating in article 99 of the GDPR that “1. This Regulation shall enter into
force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. [He
GDPR was published in DOUE L119, of May 4, 2016].

2. It will be applicable from May 25, 2018.

This Regulation shall be binding in all its elements and directly
applicable in each Member State.

Bearing in mind that, as the Legal Office has repeatedly pointed out,
of the AEPD, in the different consultations submitted to its report (valid by all
Reports N/REF: 0004/2022; 0089/2020) "the paradigm shift that the

of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons in what
regarding the processing of your personal data and the free movement of such data
(GDPR), as it is based on the principle of "accountability" or responsibility
proactive, as stated in the Statement of Reasons of the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the
digital rights (LOPDGDD): "the greatest novelty presented by the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 is the evolution of a model based, fundamentally, on the control of the
compliance to another that rests on the principle of active responsibility, which
requires a prior assessment by the person in charge or by the person in charge of the treatment of the
risk that could be generated by the processing of personal data in order to
Based on said assessment, adopt the appropriate measures”.

Consequently, by virtue of said principle, the data controller must
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able
demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the Regulation.”

Provided in Recital 39 that: "(...) Personal data must be
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are
treated. This requires, in particular, ensuring that their use is limited to a strict minimum.
conservation period. Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the
treatment could not reasonably be accomplished by other means. To ensure that
personal data is not kept longer than necessary, the person responsible for the
treatment must establish deadlines for its suppression or periodic review”.

Therefore, the Cabildo had to adapt, in the mentioned period, the treatment that supposes
the publication of their acts in their transparency profile, to the new regulations of
data protection, providing a period for the deletion or periodic review of the
published data.

With regard to points 7 and 8.- Regarding the request for remittance of the
data security measures and the Copy of the Activity Record of the
treatments:

The CABILDO maintains that the requirement of transparency and data protection is not
consolidated as an obligation of the administration until well after the date of
incident, so we do not have reports on the security measures of the
treatments, the supporting documentation of the Risk Analysis or the Registry

of Activity of the treatments where the incident occurred. It is not until 2019, in
accordance with the obligations imposed in the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights,
when a specific area is created for the correct treatment and defense of the
personal rights and administrative transparency required of this corporation.

As previously indicated, "the paradigm shift brought about by the
full application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council,
of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons in what
regarding the processing of your personal data and the free movement of such data
(GDPR), as it is based on the principle of "accountability" or responsibility
proactive, as stated in the Statement of Reasons of the Organic Law

Based on said assessment, adopt the appropriate measures”.

Consequently, by virtue of said principle, the data controller must
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able
demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the Regulation.”

Without being able to excuse themselves for not establishing such measures and for not counting on
reports on security measures for processing, documentation
accrediting the Risk Analysis or the Activity Record of the treatments
where the incident occurred in which the requirement of transparency and protection of
data was not consolidated as an obligation of the administration until well after the date
of the incident

9 and 10.- Finally, regarding the notification to those affected and to the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection of this incident we emphasize that:

The CABILDO alleges that this controversy assumes relevance 14 years later before the
Absence at that time of island, regional, national or European regulations
on the protection of personal data that we know today, but
that at no time was it carried out with intent to undermine or for personal purposes
judgments for the interested party. On the contrary, from this corporation it was necessary the
publication of said data for the joint implementation of public opinion and the
consensus and causes of this, among the population, in order to carry out a
transformation of this magnitude at island level. Due to the long period that has elapsed and
the different normative evolution in the matter adopted in the last 14 years, this
security breach has not been disclosed or reported (at
not know the same) until the day of receipt of this notification.

As has already been proven, in the response to the previous allegations, it is not
the fact of the need to publish these data is questioned, but rather the lack of
adaptation of the publication to the new requirements demanded by the regulations of

28001 – Madrid

11/19

data protection, that as responsible should have carried out the
COUNCIL.

6 and 11.- Therefore, to correct and preserve the right to privacy and protection of
data of those affected, the Cabildo de El Hierro has proceeded to eliminate the
Minutes published and their rectification, which will not include any data whose
public exposure may compromise the rights of those affected.

In addition, an attempt will be made to review the documents published by this Corporation that
include data of this nature, and proceed to correct them in the sense indicated

Regarding the allegation referred to points 6 and 11, note that it is considered
positive adoption of the measures to eliminate the published Act and to its
rectification, which will not include any data whose public exposure may
compromise the rights of those affected.

Likewise, it is also considered positive that the documents are reviewed
published by this Corporation that include data of this nature, and proceed to
correction in the indicated sense.

Considering that these measures contribute to limiting or preventing the rights of
affected may be violated by the public exposure of their data.

Although it is considered necessary for the COUNCIL to adopt the appropriate decisions to
accredit the security measures, the Risk Analysis or the Registry of
Treatment activities for which it is responsible.

II

The denounced facts are specified in that through the transparency portal of the
CABILDO, allowed access to the data of the claimant and the rest of the
residents of El Pinar de El Hierro, who made allegations in the file of
segregation of El Pinar, contained in the minutes of the extraordinary plenary session of the Cabildo
Insular de El Hierro of 2007, in which the matter "REPORT - PROPOSAL
RESOLUTION OF THE ISLAND COUNCIL OF EL HIERRO IN THE FILE OF
SEGREGATION OF EL PINAR", violating the principle of confidentiality.

Said treatment could constitute a violation of article 5 of the GDPR,
Principles related to treatment, which establishes that:

"1. Personal data will be:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

12/19

(…)”

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the party
claimed violated article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, principles relating to treatment, to
allow third parties, through the page of the transparency portal of the CABILDO, the
access to personal data of the residents who presented allegations in the
segregation procedure of El Pinar de El Hierro, and this despite the time
elapsed from the processing of the aforementioned procedure to the presentation of the
claim, more than fourteen years, without there being any evidence that
Appropriate security measures have been adopted to prevent access by third parties to such
data.

IV.

Article 30 of the GDPR establishes the obligation for those responsible to wear "a
record of the treatment activities carried out under its responsibility”.

Provided in recital 82 of the GDPR that "To demonstrate compliance
with this Regulation, the controller or processor must
keep records of the processing activities under its responsibility”.

And establishing in article 31.2 of the LOPDGDD that "The subjects listed
in article 77.1 of this organic law they will make public an inventory of their activities
of treatment accessible by electronic means in which the information will be recorded
established in article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and its legal basis”.

As stated in the fourth proven fact of this resolution, the COUNCIL in its
letter of 04/25/2022 states that it does not have reports on the security measures
security of the treatments, of the supporting documentation of the Analysis of
Risks or the Activity Record of the treatments where the incident occurred.

Failure to have a record of processing activities for which it is responsible
supposes a violation of article 30 of the GDPR, and not having published the Inventory
of treatment activities supposes a violation of article 31.2 of the
LOPDGDD.

V

Article 32 of the GDPR, security of treatment, establishes the following:

1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

13/19

 a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

 b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

  c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

    d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the safety of the

Article 4.12 of the GDPR establishes that it is considered "violation of the security of the

allegations.

It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the
security measures that are applicable according to the data that is the object
of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
