THIRD: On 06/04/2019, the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of Data agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the entity claimed in accordance with
to the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,
LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
General Data Protection (RGPD) sanctioned in article 83.5.a).

FOURTH: Once the initiation agreement was notified, the respondent presented arguments on
08/02/2019 in which you request the filing of the proceedings or, alternatively, that
the concurrence of circumstances that mitigate its responsibility is appreciated in accordance with
to articles 85.2 of the RGPD and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, replacing the sanction of

4/9

administrative fine provided for in the initiation agreement for a warning sanction or
warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2., letters a) and b), in connection
with article 85.2 of the RGPD.

In support of the aforementioned claims, it invoked, in summary, these arguments:

A. Alleges the following background:

-That contract (i), reference 284187185, was assumed on 06/30/2009 by
IBERDROLA GENERACIÓN, S.A.U., as this entity was responsible for
then the commercialization of energy in the IBERDROLA group. add that it was
Iberdrola Distribución, S.A.U., “who provided the contracting data, including, among
the same the number of the National Identity Document of the complainant” to
IBERDROLA GENERACION, S.A.U., since it was initially Iberdrola Distribución,
S.A.U., who marketed the electricity contracts.
- Warns that the invoices derived from the contract (i) were being paid within
term without incident until the one issued on 12/14/2012.
- Insists that “…for a period of more than three years…no
incidence in relation to said subscriptions, nor was the question in any way
ownership of the supply.
- Explains that from the invoice of 12/14/2012 there were four non-payments for a
total amount of 397.53 euros although it is only the debt derived from the invoice of the
01/18/2013, for an amount of 140.60 which was reported to ASNEF. This entry in the
ASNEF file was kept until 10/24/2018, date of cancellation of the incident.
- Regarding contract (ii), with reference 446975126, it explains that it had been
at “the customer service point of one of the collaborating partners of
IBERDROLA”. And it states that the supply "was contracted, on behalf of the
complainant, D.., for whom he responded to the name of B.B.B., signed the contract as
B.B.B. As can be verified, this person shares the last name with the claimant,
which, together with the proof of the National Identity Document, allowed us to infer that
the hiring was carried out with a person linked to the complainant for reasons
of kinship”. (The underlining is from the AEPD) The respondent refers to this effect to the
documentation provided to the AEPD in the course of the information requested in the
phase of admission to processing of the claim: The documents are these:

a) The copy -hardly legible- of a contract -being absolutely illegible
the information that should appear in its right header and in the header
left contains an Agent code. The document contains the
name, surnames and NIF of the claimant for the address of
*** ADDRESS.1 before transcribed. CUPS electrical data; the date,
01/11/2012, and the signature of “B.B.B. DNI ***NIF.2”.

b) A document, signed by “B.B.B.” with DNI ***NIF.2, dated 01/11/2012,
bearing the IBERDROLA logo and on the left side the legend
IBERDROLA GENERACIÓN, S.A.U., tax identification number A95075586, which includes the
economic conditions of the previous contract.

c) Document, signed by B.B.B.” with DNI ***NIF.2 01/11/2012 addressed to
Electricity distributor in which it informs you that you have signed a
contract for electricity supply with Iberdrola Generación, SAU, for the
CUPS ***CUPS.1.

-Affirms that all the invoices derived from the aforementioned contract, for more than six years,

5/9

have been paid by direct debit. The entity does not inform who it is
the holder of the bank account in which the payment is made.

B. Confirmed that on two occasions energy contracts were signed
electricity associated with the data of the claimant, the respondent states: "... of said
background, it follows that IBERDROLA could not have had any indications that would lead it to
suspect, even indirectly, that the aforementioned contracts had been produced
with identity theft. Further on, he adds that, having satisfied the
invoices repeatedly there was no indication that could undermine its conclusion
that the service had actually been contracted by the claimant.
- States that “in both cases the number of the National Identification Document was provided.
Identity of the claimant, as well as information proving his identity.
Likewise, it appears that the second of the contracts was entered into in the name and on behalf of
of the claimant by a person with respect to whom identity existed in the first
last name, which allowed at least to infer, the existence of kinship between her and
the claimant”.
-Explains that in the case analyzed the usual modus operandi of
identity theft. The impersonator would only have collected the data
of the claimant in order to make him the holder of a supply contract that, not
However, it intended to satisfy throughout its validity and with its own means.”
All of which constitutes, in his opinion, a clear indication of the legality of the contracts.

FIFTH: The initiation agreement of PS/194/2019, in point 3 of its operative part
agreed to include in the disciplinary file for evidence purposes the claim
filed by the claimant and his documentation and the documents obtained and
generated by the Data Inspection Subdirectorate during the admission phases
pending and previous investigations, as well as the Report of previous actions of
inspection.

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to
resolve this procedure.

Article 25 of the LPACAP provides that, in proceedings initiated ex officio,

the expiration of the maximum term established without it having been dictated and notified

legal to resolve:

“Lack of express resolution in proceedings initiated ex officio.

due to administrative silence.

b) In procedures in which the Administration exercises sanctioning powers-
or, in general, of intervention, likely to produce unfavorable effects or
lien, expiration will occur. In these cases, the resolution declaring the
expiration will order the filing of the proceedings, with the effects provided for in article
ass 95.

(...)” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

On the other hand, article 64 of the LOPDGDD, “Form of initiation of the

procedure and duration”, it says in section 2:

“When the purpose of the procedure is to determine the possible
existence of an infringement of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in the
this organic law, will be initiated by means of an initial agreement adopted by its own
initiative or as a consequence of a claim.

If the procedure is based on a claim filed with the Agency
Spanish Data Protection, in advance, it will decide on your
admission for processing, in accordance with the provisions of article 65 of this organic law.

When the rules established in article 60 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the procedure will start by adopting the
draft agreement to start the sanctioning procedure, which will give
formal knowledge to the interested party for the purposes set forth in article 75 of this law
organic.

Once the claim is admitted for processing, as well as in the cases in which the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Agency acts on its own initiative, prior to the
initial agreement, there may be a phase of preliminary investigation actions, which
shall be governed by the provisions of article 67 of this organic law.

The procedure will have a maximum duration of nine months from the
the date of the start-up agreement or, where applicable, of the draft start-up agreement.
Once this period has elapsed, it will expire and, consequently, the file of
performances.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In the present case, considering the date of the initiation agreement, which dates from
June 4, 2019, it can be concluded that the procedure has expired

present performances.
