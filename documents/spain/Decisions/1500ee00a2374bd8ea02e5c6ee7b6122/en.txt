FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

II

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authori-
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Di-
rector of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and
to solve this procedure.

Article 5 of the RGPD establishes the principles that must govern the treatment

of personal data and mentions among them that of “integrity and confidentiality”.

The cited article states that:

"1. The personal data will be:
(…)
f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the damages
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing
to and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of
appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”)”.

Article 5, Duty of confidentiality, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD), states that:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all
people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality
referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary

of the duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will remain
even when the relationship of the obligor with the person in charge or person in charge had ended
of the treatment”.

III

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed, violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles related to treatment, in relation to
tion with article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when combining and mixing
the health data of the claimant with those of a third party with the same name and
llidos but different DNI.

The claimant considers that the combination of her health data with those of
a third person who has the same name and surnames, but a different DNI, and the
possibility that the data be known by their respective owners or third parties, sub-
puts a violation of the duty of confidentiality, contemplated in article 5.1.f)
of the RGPD, as well as of article 5 of the LO 3/2018, of December 5, of Protection
of personal data and guarantee of digital rights.

Article 5 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, according to which: "the res-
responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all the people who in-
intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality to the
referred to in article 5.1.f) of regulation (EU) 2016/679.

In turn, establishing article 5.1.f) of the aforementioned RGPD that: “Personal data
will be (...) f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security
of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing
ci-to and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of
appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality".

CE), and that in the present case it has been violated as manifested by the claim itself.

not authorized to the data and that are known by third parties, as they are not identified as

in relation to the clinical episode referred to the Health Center of ***LOCALIDAD.2 and that

In addition, it has indicated that "The Managing Director of the Attention Management

active and inactive users of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria through the
Corporate Viewer application of the Cantabrian Health Service, had proceeded to correct
correct the error detected regarding the administrative data of the claimant, in its
condition of user of MUFACE”.

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
costs for treatment, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable.

IV

On the other hand, the LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, in its article 72 indicates:

“Infringements considered very serious:

1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
entail a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular,
ticular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(…)”

v

Second, it should be noted that the security of personal data

It is regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD.

Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:
"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of pro-
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and organizational measures
appropriate channels to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which in its
case include, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and re-
permanent silence of treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data
promptly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration shall be given to
taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as a consequence
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data
transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or unauthorized access
torized to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct under article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
feel article.

4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to guarantee

warrant that any person acting under the authority of the person in charge or the person in charge
do and have access to personal data can only process said data following instructions
instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of the
Union or of the Member States.

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in the article

83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

SAW

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or, alternatively,
being from a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the volume
overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
greater amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge pursuant to articles 8,
11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
(…)”
For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for prescription purposes, qualifies

of “Infringements considered serious:

Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following
following:

(…)
g) The violation, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance
to what is required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.
(…)”
The facts revealed in this claim are specified in
non-compliance with the established technical and organizational measures violating the
confidentiality of the data by combining the health data of the claimant with the
of a third person with the same name and surnames, but different DNI.

7th

As far as security measures are concerned, the RGPD establishes in its
Article 5.1.f) as one of the principles in terms of data protection, that of treatment
storage of the data with adequate security, which means that they must apply
technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to protect against
unauthorized or unlawful treatment and the loss, destruction and accidental damage of the
data.

Article 32 of the RGPD establishes that technical and organizational measures must be applied
organization taking into account the state of the art, the costs of applying the
measures, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment; the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

In relation to the latter, the risks arising from
go from the processing of personal data: accidental destruction, loss or alteration
such or unlawful personal data, unauthorized communication or access to such data,

and that could cause physical, material or immaterial damages. (The Con-
Considering 83 of the RGPD is very enlightening in this regard).

These measures include: pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to
to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resiliency, the ability to
capacity to restore availability and access to data after an incident, process of
verification (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.

In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the processing from violating the
established in this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must evaluate the
risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as encryption.
These measures must guarantee an adequate level of security, including confidentiality.
taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application with respect to
regarding the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. To the
assess the risk in relation to data security, should be taken into account
the risks arising from the processing of personal data, such as the destruction
accidental or unlawful loss, loss or alteration of transmitted personal data, conservation
stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such
data, susceptible in particular to cause physical, material or
immaterial”.

In the present case, as evidenced by the facts and the documentation
that integrates the investigation file E/05273/2020, the AEPD transferred the claimant
do on 06/26/2020 the claim submitted for analysis requesting the contribution
of information related to the incident claimed and without stating the answer
of the claimed.

On this matter, the respondent points out that, in the event that the
documentation, it would have been processed like the other writings and communications
that are received, but not the letter of 06/26/2020, never received in said management.

However, the responsibility of the claimed party is determined by the incident

However, as the respondent points out, "From the Management Department of the SCS,
requests the rectification of personal and order data…” and that “it had been
proceeded to correct the error detected regarding the administrative data of the re-
crying out, in her capacity as a user of MUFACE”.

Therefore, it is estimated that the defendant violated article 32 of the RGPD, infringing

It should be noted that the LOPDGDD in its article 77, Regime applicable to de-
certain categories of data controllers or processors, establishes the following
