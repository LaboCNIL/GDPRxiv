N/REF: 0018/2021

At the time of formulating the query, the new
regime established by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament
and of the Council, of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of people
physical with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation, RGPD) and in the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights.

Indeed, as indicated in the Explanatory Memorandum of Law 3/2018 "the
The greatest novelty presented by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is the evolution of
a model based, fundamentally, on the control of compliance with another
which rests on the principle of active responsibility, which requires prior
assessment by the person in charge or by the person in charge of the treatment of the risk that
could generate the processing of personal data for, from
of said assessment, adopt the appropriate measures”.

Therefore, it is the data controller who must comply
with the principles that are included in article 5 of the RGPD, among which are
finds, as seen, that of proactive responsibility, collected in its
section 2, “the data controller shall be responsible for compliance
of the provisions of section 1 and able to demonstrate it ("responsibility
proactive”)”. And among the principles of section 1 is that of “legality”,
collected in its letter a), so that the personal data will be treated in
lawful manner, regulating article 6 the legal bases that determine the
legality of the treatment. Therefore, it is the data controller who
It is necessary to determine the legal basis that can protect the treatment
correspondent.

Finally, a fundamental role within this new model of
active responsibility established in the General Regulation of Protection of
Data will be performed by the data protection delegate, which the Regulation
General regulates in its articles 37 to 39. In particular, article 37.1 a)
compulsorily imposes the designation of a delegate in the cases in which
that “the treatment is carried out by a public authority or body, except
courts acting in the exercise of their judicial function.

In turn, article 38.1 clearly establishes that “The person in charge and the
in charge of the treatment will guarantee that the delegate of data protection

participate appropriately and in a timely manner in all matters
relating to the protection of personal data” and article 39.2 provides that “The
data protection delegate will perform his duties by providing the
due attention to the risks associated with treatment operations,
taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment".

Finally, article 39.1 enumerates the functions of the delegate of
data protection, among which are "informing and advising the
responsible or in charge of the treatment and the employees who deal with
of the treatment of the obligations incumbent upon them by virtue of this
Regulation and other data protection provisions of the Union or of
Member States” (section a), “supervise compliance with the
provided in this Regulation, of other provisions for the protection of
data of the Union or of the Member States and the policies of the person in charge
or of the person in charge of processing in matters of personal data protection,
including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness and training of the
personnel involved in processing operations, and audits
corresponding" (section b) and "offer the advice requested
about the impact assessment related to data protection and
supervise its application in accordance with article 35 (paragraph c).

Likewise, it is up to the data protection delegate to “act
as a point of contact for the supervisory authority for matters relating to the
treatment, including the prior consultation referred to in article 36, and carry out
queries, where appropriate, on any other matter” (section e).

Therefore, if the data controller has doubts about the
legal basis that can determine the legality of a certain treatment
You should consult your data protection delegate in the cases in which
that, like the present one, its designation is mandatory, who must provide the
accurate advice.

Only in the event that the data protection delegate had doubts
legal decisions on the matter submitted for its consideration that cannot
resolved with the criteria already informed by the AEPD or because it is a
new issues arising from the application of the new legal regime of
protection of personal data and that have a general scope in the
that a report that contributes to legal certainty is convenient,
said delegate may submit a query to this Legal Office, accompanying
to said consultation its own report in which it is analyzed in detail and
reasoned the questions object of consultation.

In the present case, the query is made by the DPO but is limited to
