FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

To analyze the imputed infraction we start from the principle of publicity of the
judicial proceedings, constitutionalized by art. 120.1 EC, and referred to
in different precepts of the Organic Law of the Judiciary (articles 232, 234, 235 and
266.1). Article 232 LOPJ establishes "1 The judicial proceedings will be public, with the
exceptions established by procedural laws.

2. Exceptionally, for reasons of public order and protection of rights and
liberties, the Judges and Courts, may by reasoned resolution limit the scope
of publicity and agree on the secrecy of all or part of the actions".

Article 234 LOPJ prescribes "The Secretaries and competent personnel of the
Courts and Tribunals will provide the interested parties with all the information they request about the
status of the judicial proceedings, which they may examine and hear, unless they are or
have been declared secret in accordance with the law. In the same cases, the

testimonials that are requested, with the expression of their addressee, except in cases in which the
law provides otherwise".

Article 235 LOPJ refers to the access by the interested parties to the books, files and
judicial records that are not reserved and article 266 states that
will allow any interested party access to the text of the judgment.

The STS of March 3, 1995, resource 1218/1991, indicates in relation to the
publicity of judicial actions "...that the right and correlative duty of
knowledge and access to the text of judicial resolutions is graded according to three
various areas or spheres of affectation, each one governed by different criteria, namely: a)
one of maximum amplitude or of generalized affectation, which includes the public or the
citizens in general, without specific qualification and that corresponds to the publicity of the
judicial actions carried out in all kinds of processes, which allows those
go to the practice of proceedings that must take place "in public hearing", except the
declaration of reservation that the court agrees with reasons, principle of
advertising constitutionalized in art. 120.1 of the Fundamental Norm and which includes art.
232.1 of the Organic Law.

b) at the opposite extreme, of maximum restriction of the scope of knowledge of the
judicial decisions, are the acts of notification and communication of these, directed
only to those who have the status of procedural party under the laws of
procedure, and that in terms of sentences determine the right and correlative duty
of the Judges and Courts to their knowledge through the instrumental act of notification,
as prescribed by art. 270 LOPJ.

c) occupying an intermediate position that places the question in a more imprecise sphere,
find the procedural actions already completed, including the sentences, integrated into
books, files or judicial records, and with respect to which, on the one hand, art. 235 LOPJ
determines that: "the interested parties will have access to the books, files and judicial records
that are not reserved, through the forms of exhibition, testimony or
certification established by law"

Regarding the quality of interested party for the aforementioned purposes, it is specified in the
cited sentence that "the legitimate interest that is required in the case, can only be recognized
in whom, natural or legal person, declares and accredits, at least prima facie, before the
judicial body, a connection of a concrete and unique nature with the very object of the
process and, therefore, of the sentence that finalized it in the instance, either with one of the
procedural acts through which it has been developed and which are documented in
record, a connection that, on the other hand, is subject to two conditions: a) that it does not
affects the fundamental rights of the procedural parties or of those who in some way
have intervened in the process, to essentially safeguard the right to
privacy and personal and family intimacy, the honor and the right to one's own image that
could eventually affect those people; and b) that if the information is used,
as a mediating activity, to satisfy the rights or interests of third parties, and in
consequence acquires, as is the case, an aspect of globality or generality by
relation not to a specific process, such interest remains within the scope of the
legal system and its applicators, in general, because something else would be
as well as involving or collaborating with the judicial body in tasks or activities that, by
However lawful they may be, they go beyond their jurisdictional function."

The doctrine established in said sentence has been reiterated in the SSTS of 22

May 1996 and April 6, 2001, appeal 9448/1996.

8/12

Also the SAN (1st) of November 29, 2001, resource 531/2000 echoes the
doctrine established by the aforementioned STS of March 3, 1995, and indicates that "the data contained
in the books and court records are not available to the public in a
entirely free and indiscriminate since access to them is regulated and to a certain
restricted measure. On the one hand, due to the appeal made by the aforementioned articles 235 and
2666.1 of the Organic Law of the Judiciary to the condition of "interested party", whose
significance and scope we already know the jurisprudential interpretation. On the other hand, because
access to such books and archives is mediated by the necessary intervention of the
Judicial Secretary and the mandatory subjection to the application and authorization process regulated in
Articles 1 to 5 of Regulation 5/1995, of June 7, of the General Council of Power
Judicial, on accessory aspects of judicial proceedings".

In other words, and for what interests us here, the publicity of judicial proceedings does not
means that the data contained in a judicial procedure that is in the process of
execution, can be examined and are available to the general public
completely free and indiscriminate way, but such advertising is restricted except
those actions that are held in public hearing to those who hold the condition
of "interested parties", to which article 234 LOPJ appeals. This concept of interested, which does not
necessarily coincides with that of the procedural part and that has been outlined by the
jurisprudence in the above sense.

To finish with the examination of the jurisprudence and the regulations on this matter
It should be noted that the jurisprudential criterion exposed is consistent with the position
maintained by the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court when weighing the publicity of the sentences
holdings with the right to honor, establishing in its judgment of December 22, 2008
the next:

“The publicity of the sentences constitutes an instrument of guarantee of the independence
dence of the courts and their actions in accordance with the law, since these principles
are reinforced by the knowledge of the action of the courts by the citizens,
and must be considered closely linked to the protection of fundamental rights
inherent to the exercise of jurisdictional power by judges and courts.

This publicity can only be restricted or limited, in accordance with what is established
in the law, when it may lead to the impairment of a fundamental right of citizens.
affected individuals or a constitutionally protected asset, especially when the co-
knowledge of the data of a private nature that appear in the sentence can give rise to
the disclosure of aspects of privacy that must be protected, provided that
This disclosure is not protected by the right to information within the framework of the co-
free public communication typical of a democratic society.

Indeed, according to STC 57/2004, of April 19, FJ 5 (in the same sense, res-
respect to the publication of the judgments of the Constitutional Court, ATC 516/2004, of 20
of December, FJ 1, and STC 114/2006, FJ 7), the principles of weighting and proportionality
ity may lead to the conclusion that other fundamental rights or goods with pro-
constitutional protection must take precedence over the publicity of judicial resolutions.
cials.

This principle is applied by article 266.1 II LOPJ, introduced by LO
19/2003, of December 23, according to which «[t]he access to the text of the sentences, or to
ends of the same, may be restricted when it could
affect the right to privacy, the rights of people who require a special

as well as, in general, to prevent sentences from being used with confidence.
are contrary to the laws.”

When the publication of a judicial decision may affect the honor of the person
that has obtained an unfavorable result in the process, it is necessary to determine if

ration of the scope protected by this right when it is the product of the exercise of a right
recognized by the legal system (art. 2.2 LPDH: «The existence of
illegitimate interference in the protected area when it is expressly authorized by
law").

The contrast between the right to honor and the right to disclose the content of the
sentence, which results from the principle of publicity, must give rise to a weighting in the
that is taken into account, in the first place, the fulfillment of the institutional purposes that the
advertising principle pursues. This aspect, in turn, requires taking into consideration the
time in which the publication was produced, taking into account whether it is a communication
neutral content of the sentence or if elements are added or subtracted that are sus-
likely to distort the objective knowledge of what was resolved by the court to convert the
publication of the ruling in a procedure suitable for undermining the honor of the person affected
beyond what is objectively implied in the field of reputation by the failure of
an action or opposition maintained before the courts of justice.

Well then, it is evident that the principle of publicity of the sentences that
tempers our LOPJ is not absolute, but finds limits, either by referring to
those who have the status of interested parties or because of the prevalence of other rights
or goods that enjoy constitutional protection, as occurs with the right to protection
of data, the latter issue that has been examined in the previous legal basis.

Finally, it should be noted that the constitutional doctrine contained in the STC
114/2006, of April 5, does nothing but corroborate what has been stated so far, since in it the Tri-
Constitutional court is limited to extracting from a joint reading of articles 120 and 164.1
CE and articles 86.2 and 99.2 LOTC -in its wording prior to the reform operated by the
Organic Law 6/2007, of May 24-, positions in relation to articles 9.1 CE and 5.1
LOPJ, a constitutional requirement of maximum dissemination and publicity of the full content of
the jurisdictional resolutions of that Court that incorporate constitutional doctrine, which
It is specified, on the one hand, in the formal obligation of publication of such resolutions in the
Official Gazette, and in a material obligation to provide the greatest accessibility and public dissemination
to their content, regardless of their nature and the process in which they are
dictate; and, on the other, that publicity and dissemination must affect the full resolution.

It is significant that for this the Constitutional Court relies especially
in art. 164.1 CE establishes, of the one who preaches that he establishes, even beyond the principle
general publicity of judicial proceedings and their resolutions of art. 120 CE, one
specific constitutional requirement of maximum dissemination and publicity of legal resolutions

Moreover, it highlights the nuances that differentiate the principle of publicity from sentences.
tions of the Constitutional Court of the judgments of the Judiciary itself, by limiting the
applicability to that of the regime established in this regard by the LOPJ, stating the following:

“Being evident that the possibility itself, foreseen in art. 266.1 LOPJ, to totally restrict
mind access to the text of a Judgment could be problematic, as regards
to the Constitutional Judgments, thanks to the obligation of its formal publication in the Bo-
Official bulletin, provided for both in art. 164.1 EC as in art. 86.2 LOTC, and that even the
possibility of omitting the identification of the parties involved in the process may result
be, usually, much more exceptional in constitutional processes than in pro-
court proceedings, thanks to the material obligation, derived from arts. 164.1 EC and 99.2
LOTC, to guarantee the maximum dissemination of the jurisdictional resolutions of this Court.
end; the art. 266.1 LOPJ in conjunction with the aforementioned art. 6.4 LOPD, in any case, can serve
element of reference both in relation to establishing the need for the decision
on the restriction of publicity of the parties involved in the constitutional process
carried out by making an individualized weighing of the concurrent constitutional interests
current in the case with which the principle of publicity may conflict, as in
regarding to highlight which are the interests that could be prevailing,
singularly the right to privacy, the rights of those who require a special de-
duty of guardianship, the guarantee of anonymity, when appropriate, of the victims and injured parties, and the
avoidance that said data may be used for purposes contrary to the Laws. Throughout
case, special emphasis should be made that the literal tenor of art. 266.1 LOPJ does not imply
a limitation of the fundamental rights and constitutional guarantees with which they can
the constitutional principle of maximum diffusion of the re-
jurisdictional solutions of the Constitutional Court, since any fundamental right

as provided in art. 18.4 CE in the terms and with the breadth and autonomy that has been

legal acts 5 and 6”.

Consequently, this doctrine once again leads the controversial issue to the

weighing of interests.

they do not suggest an answer outside the legality exposing the sentence in the social network
