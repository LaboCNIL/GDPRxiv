RESOLUTION OF PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and with
based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Dated 01/09/2019 has entry in the Spanish Protection Agency
Data (AEPD) the claim made by D. A.A.A. (hereinafter the
claimant) against ***SINDICATO.1, with NIF ***NIF.1 (hereinafter, the respondent).

The claim is based on the alleged disclosure of personal data made by
the one claimed through an email sent to the affiliates of the
 
union of the locality of ***LOCALIDAD.1. The claimant explains that he has been
union delegate of the ***SINDICATO.1 of that locality until December 2018. In
that condition, and after a meeting of the local affiliates, he sent a WhatsApp to the
provincial secretary of the union -D. B.B.B.- in which he communicated that all the
members were going to leave the union due to their laziness. On 12/26/2018 the
provincial secretary, D. B.B.B., sends an email to all the members of the town
email from the address “***EMAIL.1” in which you incorporate personal information
that concerns the claimant.

SECOND: The claimant has provided a copy of the email sent on 12/26/2018 by
the provincial secretary of the ***SINDICATO.1 from the address <***EMAIL.1> to the
affiliates of ***LOCALIDAD.1 -nine recipients among which is not included the
claimant - in which the following comments are made:
 
That since the complainant became part of the management of the union,
the disagreements given that "he tries to make union action serve
preferably to attend to their private affairs to the detriment of the interest
general".

As an example, he says: "You have to be called to order on several occasions by
breaching the Union's code of ethics by taking union hours on weekends without
union activity. “It is processed by the legal service of the Union and demands
wins a court ruling by getting the INSS to grant him a disability
total permanent pension with monthly remuneration of more than 1,100 euros, and that the
can be made compatible with a position and full salary of Second-hand Agent
activity in the local police. “You are hired as a teacher at the training center
of ***UNION.1 in ***LOCATION.2”. “With the issue of the negotiation of the RPT
of the Ayuto ***LOCALIDAD.1 you are told that you cannot charge the same as police
in second activity than an Operative Agent, a fact that he does not accept.” (The underlined
is from the AEPD)

From the message sent by the claimed party to the claimant on the same date, at 9:45 p.m.
hours, in which he communicates that the affiliates "will be adequately informed by
the provincial leadership of the union of the developed union action and of the interests
particulars that some have tried to assert…”

THIRD: On 03/17/2020 the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of Data agrees to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the person claimed for the alleged
infringement of article 5.1.f), in relation to article 6.1, both of the RGPD, typified
in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

The start agreement was notified to the claimed party electronically, being the date of
made available on 06/02/2020 and the date of acceptance of the notice on
06/03/2020.

The effects of the suspension of administrative deadlines agreed by the
Covid 19 health crisis. Royal Decree 463/2020, “declaring the state of
alarm system for the management of the health crisis caused by Covid 19”, published
in the BOE on 03/14/2020, established in its third Additional Provision, “Suspension
administrative deadlines”:

"1. Terms are suspended and the deadlines for the processing of the
procedures of public sector entities. The calculation of the deadlines
will resume at the moment in which this Royal Decree loses its validity or, in its
case, the extensions thereof.

2. The suspension of terms and the interruption of terms will apply to the entire sector
public defined in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common of Public Administrations.”

This suspension was lifted on 06/01/2020. Royal Decree 537/2020, published
in the BOE on 05/23/2020, established in article 9: "Administrative deadlines
suspended by virtue of Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14. With effects from
on June 1, 2020, the computation of the administrative deadlines that would have been
suspended will be resumed, or restarted, if so provided for in a rule with
range of law approved during the validity of the state of alarm and its extensions.

Consequently, regarding the calculation of the maximum term of the
sanctioning procedure that concerns us – that according to article 64.2 LOPDGDD
is nine months- the initial term was 06/01/2020 and the final term is the
03/01/2021.

FIFTH: On 06/16/2020, the electronic offices of the AEPD have access to
allegations of the defendant to the initiation agreement in which he requests the file of the
sanctioning procedure PS/264/2019. In defense of his claim, he adduces the
Next:

Regarding the facts, it underlines that "it has acted at all times under the tutelage and
under the Statutes of the Union and in the internal and private sphere” of the union.

It states that the provincial secretary of ***LOCALITY.3 of ***SINDICATO.1 has
attributed by the Statutes “the powers to inform the union sections and
its affiliates of those activities that the union has promoted in the interest
union, individually or collectively, in matters of legal services, .... as well as
carry out the appropriate communications, internal or external, in defense of the Union”.

That the provincial secretary of ***SINDICATO.1, in use of his union powers
and in the internal and private sphere of the union, he sent the communication to nine affiliates
“Having knowledge of some false statements made by the complainant with
the spirit of harming the union ***SINDICATO.1 in an Assembly in
*** LOCATION.1, in the sense that the Union had not carried out any
activity in defense of the affiliates of ***LOCALIDAD.1”.

 

The respondent affirms that the demonstrations that the provincial secretary of the ***SINDI-
CATO.1 did in the exercise of his union office were a reminder of the action
trade union carried out; that are not collected or kept in any file of the syndicate.
and, he adds: “they were already known since 2016, not only by the union section and the
 ***LOCATION.1, because the complainant himself, who
members of the ***SYNDICATO.1 of
was part of the union section (....), he had also made it public, but of
the entire City Council because a negotiation procedure was processed by the Mayor for this purpose.

local police second activity for the complainant for reasons of illness
Taking into account his judicial sentence that was included in the administrative file,
and they were generic references of a judicial sentence without data and content without des-

union to the union section of ***LOCALIDAD.1, through the Legal Services
of the Union (....)”; “and give classes as a professor for the Union and be in second activity.
ity is not something private but public”. (The underlining is from the AEPD)
The respondent invokes the following legal arguments: He begins by transcribing the
Articles 1 and 2 (referring to the object and the subjective scope of application) of the Law
Organic 15/1999, of December 13, Protection of personal data
(LOPD). It mentions article 120 of the Spanish Constitution and refers to the
STS 1191/2008, of December 22, according to which - explains the defendant - advertising
It can only be limited in accordance with the provisions of the law when it involves the
impairment of a fundamental right or a constitutionally protected good,
especially when knowledge of the private data contained
in the sentence may give rise to the disclosure of aspects of privacy that
must be subject to protection, provided that the disclosure is not protected
for the right to free public information typical of a democratic society.

Next, it adds that “Based on the objective fact that the complainant is not
member of the Association I represent and that the published Judgment has the
names of the people involved with roofs, to point out that the publication of the
content of a sentence per se does not imply the infringement of the privacy of the
persons nor does it automatically cause a violation of the right to honor of the person
was involved in the process.

He cites in support of such an assertion “the criteria that the Supreme Court takes into account

to assess whether or not a conduct is susceptible to reproach”, “must be
always to the specific case”: “(…) it is necessary to weigh, in attention to the
concurrent circumstances (v. gr., STS October 16, 2008 (RJ 2008, 5699), rec.
73/2003), the legitimate interest of the person who communicates a judicial resolution (v. gr., STS 28
July 1995 (RJ 1995, 5737, rec. 1321/1992), which may consist of interest
which obtains a favorable result in a lawsuit to make its result known to
their relatives and those who may have a relationship with the object of the lawsuit related to the
fact that this communication is not disproportionate due to the subjective scope
that it spreads or by the way in which it occurs and is justified taking into account the
nature and purpose of the process in question and the set of circumstances,
including the character of plaintiff or defendant who gives publicity to the sentence
has held in a process (...)>>

It also invokes that in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure that has
been notified violates the principle of presumption of innocence, since, it says, according to
settled jurisprudence, the burden of proof of the commission of the infringement
corresponds to the Administration and not to the company and the "principle of legality in its
typicity aspect, recognized in article 25.1” of the C.E.

The respondent proposed in his pleadings brief to the initial agreement that due to the
AEPD will carry out the following test procedures:

(i) That the City Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1, Resource Service be requested
Human the following documentation:
“-Resolution of the Mayor of the City Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1 of the year 2016, by the
that the complainant is granted a transfer to a new local police job in
second activity for a second activity due to illness and where
expressly includes in said procedure his acknowledgment of incapacity
permanent total derived from the judicial sentence.
-Act or certification of the negotiation process by which it is agreed to create and value in the
Municipal RPT said job of second activity of D. AAA.
-If there was communication from the INSS to the City Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1 informing of the
recognition of total permanent disability to D. A.A.A. and if he communicated it
also to the City Council.”

(ii) As witness evidence “That a statement be requested from:
1.- D. C.C.C., with email: ***EMAIL.2 and telephone number, ***TELEFONO.1, affiliated with
union ***SINDICATO.1 and who held the position of union delegate of ***SINDICATO.1
in the Town Hall of ***LOCALIDAD.1, so that it can say if it is true that they had
knowledge of the members of ***SINDICATO.1 in ***LOCALIDAD.1 in 2016
by the trade union section, trade union and the complainant himself, D. [the complainant] that
had won a court judgment and had been granted permanent disability
total with a benefit of more than 1000 euros, and that with it he was going to be able to
occupy and reconcile a local police job in second activity for
cause of illness..

2.- Mr. D.D.D., former Chief of the Local Police of the City Council of ***LOCATION.1, with
email: ***EMAIL.3 and telephone number: ***TELEFONO.2, so that it can say if it is true that
The local police and the City Council had been aware of it since 2016
of ***LOCALIDAD.1, that D. [the claimant] had won a judicial sentence and

had been awarded total permanent disability with a benefit of more than
1,000 euros, and that with this he would be able to occupy and reconcile a job as
local police in second activity due to illness..”

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of 27
April, on the protection of natural persons with regard to data processing
data and the free movement of these data and by which the Directive is repealed
95/46/CE (RGPD), recognizes each control authority and, as established in the
Articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of
data and guarantees of digital rights (LOPDGDD), the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

Article 9 of the RGPD, under the heading “Treatment of special categories of data
personal”, provides:
"1. The processing of personal data that reveals ethnic origin is prohibited.
or racial background, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or affiliation
union and the processing of genetic data, biometric data aimed at identifying
unambiguously to a natural person, data relating to health or data relating to
sexual life or sexual orientation of a natural person.

2. Section 1 shall not apply when one of the circumstances
following:

(…)

d) the treatment is carried out, within the scope of its legitimate activities and with the
due guarantees, by a foundation, an association or any other organization without
for profit, whose purpose is political, philosophical, religious or trade union, provided that
the treatment refers exclusively to current or former members of such
organizations or persons who maintain regular contact with them in relation to
for their purposes and provided that the personal data is not communicated outside of them without
the consent of the interested parties;

(…)”.

Article 6.1 of the RGPD under the heading "Legality of the treatment" establishes:
"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:
(...)

6/13

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the processing
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

In turn, article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that govern the treatment
of personal data, including those of “integrity and confidentiality”:

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing or against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational (<<integrity and confidentiality>>)”

And article 5.2. RGPD adds that “The data controller will be responsible
compliance with the provisions of section 1 and capable of demonstrating it
(<<proactive responsibility>>)”

III

The agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure attributed to the defendant a presumed
infringement of article 5.1.f) in relation to article 6.1.f), both of the RGPD,
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and qualified by the LOPDGDD in its article
72.1.a), for the purposes of prescription, of very serious infringement.

The allegedly infringing conduct attributed to the defendant in the initial agreement is
specified in the communication that the provincial head of the union made to nine people,
recipients of the email sent on 12/26/2019, all of them members of the
union in the town of ***LOCALIDAD.1, referring to the fact that the claimant received
a pension from the INSS, to the type of pension and its amount. The initial agreement estimated
that the processing of these data was not covered by the legal basis of article
6.1.f) GDPR.

Although the initial agreement underlined the importance of the "terms of the debate
that underlies the communication sent by the Provincial Head of the ***SINDICATO.1 and that
reflect the previous WhatsApp exchanged between him and the claimant”, it was not reached
transcribe in it the text of the WhatsApp, of which the claimant had provided a
copy with your claim. Of these messages via WhatsApp are worthy of mention,
especially, those exchanged between the complainant and the provincial head of the union
on date 12/17/2018 that we reproduce:

“17/12/18 21:21- A.A.A.: Good evening. Tell you that in assembly
zed by all the affiliates of *** LOCALIDAD.1 and after exposure of mail and
wassaps where it is verified that in the rpt, union aid has been zero patate-
ro (not answering, or simply saying that it is not going to go ahead), it has been decided
put in the hands of the delegates the decision to change the union to be
these elections, urging many of them to change now. I inform you to know
foundation, the topic is wrong, we've already warned you, and if all the delegates leave
We're leaving, I'm sorry, mate, what is sown is harvested...”.
“12/17/2018 21:45- E.E.E.: Good evening, members of ***LOCALIDAD.1
they will be adequately informed by the provincial direction of the action
developed trade union and of the particular interests that some have claimed
do assert And you precisely few complaints. (...) The door is open for you”
“12/17/2018 21:55 – E.E.E.: You can leave now...or you will be expelled for dis-
loyal to union...”

On the other hand, it seems advisable to reproduce what the complainant stated in his
complaint regarding the email that the provincial head of the union sent
to the nine affiliates of the locality and that gave rise to his claim:

“On 12/26/2018 at 6:44 p.m. he sends an email to all the affiliates (not to me),
*** LOCATION.1, reporting a series of barbarities and lies about me,
but also, it informs about my personal situation, that is, that I am currently
receiving a pension for permanent disability, stating the amount as well,
and that I am teaching in the union as well (attached email). The secretary who
is the one who sends the email, knows about my condition because the one who led the trial is the
lawyer who handles the legal issues of the union and, furthermore, this gentleman had a
copy of the sentence. Note that none of the affiliates knew about my situation
personal, and this gentleman has damaged me notably, because now I have to put up with
constant ridicule and contempt from friends and members of this union.”

According to what was stated by the claimant, the provincial head of the ***UNITION.1
had informed other affiliates of his "personal situation", concept, that of his
personal situation, which the claimant specifies, exclusively, in the information
referring to the fact that he receives a pension for total permanent disability; to its amount and
who teaches at the union.

It is noteworthy that the claimant does not mention in his complaint a relevant fact
that concerns him and to which the message sent by the provincial chief to the
members of the local ***UNION.1: that the claimant performed a
secondary activity position in the Local Police that was compatible with the pension
due to total permanent disability. The email sent by the provincial chief
claimed to the nine members of the ***SINDICATO.1 He said that he had obtained
that "the INSS grants him a total permanent disability with remunerative pension
monthly of more than 1,100 euros, and that can be made compatible with a position and salary
Full Second Activity Agent in the Local Police”.

For its part, the defendant union, in its allegations to the initial agreement, has
underlined the framework in which the provincial head of the union addressed the
local affiliates by email and sent them the controversial message.

In this regard, it says that the claimant had made “some false statements (...)
with the intention of harming the union ***SINDICATO.1 in an Assembly in
*** LOCATION.1, in the sense that the Union had not carried out any
activity in defense of the affiliates of ***LOCALIDAD.1”.

If we stick to the WhatsApp messages dated 12/17/2018 exchanged
between the claimant, then a union delegate in the locality, and the boss
provincial, one of the reproaches that the former addresses to the latter is precisely
that the union had not carried out any activity in defense of the members in the
negotiation of the RPT.

The respondent also states in his pleadings to the initial agreement that both the
union section as the affiliates of the local ***SINDICATO.1 knew from
in 2016 that the claimant received a pension from the INSS that was compatible with
a secondary activity local police post. He claims that these events were
known because the complainant, who was part of the union section, had
made public, and was also known in the City Council because it was "processed by the
Mayor for this purpose a negotiation procedure with the participation of the unions of
creation of a new local police job second activity for the
complainant for reasons of illness taking into account his court ruling that
was included in the administrative file.

In order to corroborate such statements, the respondent requested that they take
carry out tests that would consist, on the one hand, of requesting the City Council of
*** LOCALITY.1 to inform this Agency if the INSS had informed him that
total permanent disability had been recognized in favor of the respondent and if, at his
time, the City Council had communicated this fact to the INSS; in collecting from the aforementioned
City Council the copy of a resolution of the mayor, of the year 2016, by which
granted the claimant a pass to a second-rate local police job
activity and the minutes of the negotiating process by which it was agreed to create in the RPT
municipal a job of these characteristics. On the other hand, in a test
testimonial for the two proposed witnesses to say whether the members of the
***SINDICATO.1 of the locality were aware “by the union section, and by the
complainant himself” since 2016 “that he had won a court ruling and
had been awarded total permanent disability with a benefit of more than
1,000 euros, and that with this he was going to be able to occupy and reconcile a position of
local police work in second activity due to illness”. Witnesses that
on the other hand, are of highly dubious impartiality given that both are
members of ***UNION.1 in the locality, union from which the claimant was
union delegate, but of which he is no longer a member.

In short, there are divergent versions regarding the knowledge that members who
they received the email from the provincial head of the ***UNION.1 they had about
whether or not the claimant was receiving a total permanent disability pension. While
the claimant denies it the respondent affirms that it was a circumstance for all
known within the union section and even in the City Council.

However, at this point it is appropriate to assess other aspects of the issue that
affect the legal assessment of the facts and lead to a result different from the
which was maintained in the agreement to initiate the disciplinary proceedings.

It is noteworthy that the complainant, in the comments he makes in his complaint
about the message that the provincial head of the ***SINDICATO.1 sent to nine affiliates,
message that constitutes the object of your claim, does not allude to a fact that
directly concerns; that is, that he performs a job as a police officer
second activity location. The claimant has also not denied that he was
performing that job or who would have performed it, after
have obtained the total permanent disability pension.

This data, the performance of a job as a second-rate local police
activity, cannot and should not be separated from the other data concerning the
claimant whose treatment determined that this Agency proceed to the
opening of the agreement to start the sanctioning file that concerns us. Namely, that
the claimant received a pension from the INSS and the type of pension received.
We estimate that the compatibility between the performance of a job of that
nature and receipt of a total permanent disability pension is a
matter of undeniable labor relevance and, therefore, we understand that it also has
enormous relevance in the framework of trade union relations in which the provincial chief
of the ***SINDICATO.1 comments on the claimant's situation to other affiliates.

It seems appropriate to mention Law 17/2017, of December 13, on the coordination of
local police of the Valencian Community, in force when the events occurred
that we examine, which regulates the special administrative situation of second activity
for the civil servants of the Local Police forces of the Community
Valenciana (articles 85 to 89). Its predecessor, Law 6/1999, of April 19, on
Local Police and Coordination of the Local Police of the Valencian Community
also contemplated the administrative situation of the second activity in its
articles 40 and following.

Likewise, the STS, Sala de lo Social, of 04/26/2017 (appeal
3050/2017), issued in a Doctrine Unification procedure, which confirms that
are incompatible with the receipt of a pension for permanent incapacity for work
total and the performance of a local police job in a situation
administrative second activity.

The STS, through several of its Legal Foundations, collects the considerations
that we reproduce:
“(...) the starting point (...) must be -perforce- the ordinary regime in the dynamics
of the right to benefits in the IPT, which -by definition- has as its basic principle the
absolute incompatibility between the provision due to it and the performance of the
same profession for which disability is proclaimed, since it must not be forgotten that
the IPT pension is satisfied precisely to compensate for the loss of income
from the performance of the worker's usual profession, so
-says the authoritative doctrine- «between this and that there is an incompatibility
essential".
(...)
This entails its compatibility with the exercise of an activity other than the usual
for which he does have ability or physical capacity, but not his compatibility with the de-
paid performance (assumed with excessive effort, or with abnormal performance)
badly low, or with one and another thing at the same time) of the same usual profession respectively

who has been declared invalid”
(...)
and based on such normative insufficiency, the Supreme Court, rather than close and specify
sensing the «legal definition», has opted for the negative concretion of the term, in the good
understood to focus the issue on what does not deserve the consideration of profession
usual. Thus, it has been categorically admitted that the habitual profession is not identified
ble with the «professional group» [STS 02/28/05 rcud 1591/04]; but neither is it
with the «job» or «professional category» [SSTS 04/27/05 may rcud
998/04; 03/25/09 rcud 3402/07; and 10/26/16 rcud 1267/15]. Affirmations perhaps revised-
bles -we will see to what extent- when article 194.2 LGSS/TR comes into force
2015 in the future version [«...the profession exercised by the interested party or by the group pro-
professional, in which it was framed, before the event causing the
permanent disability...»].
(...), the use of the preceding approaches to the case in hand, by force has
to go through the professional consideration that the «second activity» should deserve.
ity", or what is the same, if the exercise of such functions integrates the profession of "Police
local authority", and this can only be done after ruling on its legal nature,
which is only achievable after studying its legal regime, which -as
is logical - it can only be done in accordance with the specifically applicable regulations
to the claimant in the proceedings, that of the Valencian Community, which is basically integrated
cally by Law 6/1999, of April 19 [DOCV no. 3482, of 04/27/99] and develops
by Decree 19/2003, of March 4 [DOCV no. 4455, of 03/07/03], which re-
regulates the “Framework Standard on the Structure, Organization and Functioning of the
post of local Police of the Valencian Community».
(...)
Indeed, its legal regime of the same is contained in the arts. 40 to 44
Law 13/2001 and in arts. 24 to 29 of Decree 19/2003, in which the “second activity
dad” of the local Police:
a).- It is defined as a “special administrative situation that corresponds to the
rios of the local Police Forces of the Valencian Community for reasons of age
or due to illness” [art. 40 Law; art. 24 Regulation]
(...) If, based on what has been said, the local police officer who has moved on to the second activity continues to
maintaining the same professional quality as Police, even limiting its functions to those
less burdensome among all those that correspond to its category, and at the same time
maintains his correlative income as an active local Police, it is an obligatory consequence
from this, understand that he persists in the exercise of the same profession and that the man-
maintenance of their remuneration is incompatible -by definition and in the applicable legislation
at the date of the causal event- with an IPT pension that has an income nature
substitute for lost wages.”

IV

So that the treatment of the personal data of the claimant carried out by the
claimed could be based on the legal basis contemplated in article 6.1.f) RGPD
should comply with the assumptions that make up that provision.

The first of them, that the treatment was necessary to satisfy an interest
legitimate pursued by the data controller; which I transfer to the assumption that
We are concerned implies that the processing of personal data carried out through the
email dated 12/26/2018 from the provincial head of the union to pursue the exercise

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/13

of the right to freedom of association. Second, that "the interests pursued
do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data”.

As stated in the agreement to initiate the disciplinary proceedings, determine whether the
treatment that the claimed made of the data of the claimant through the mail
email that he sent to nine members of a locality in his province -in which
states that the claimant, a local union delegate, receives a pension of
total permanent disability of more than 1,100 euros per month - is or is not adjusted to
Law requires making a weighing judgment on the interests and rights at stake
to derive from it whether or not it should prevail over the right to freedom of association
the complainant's right to privacy.

Recital 47 of the RGPD says, regarding legitimate interest as a legal basis

The weighing judgment also requires examining the necessity and suitability or
relevance of the data that were processed by the provincial head of the union
regarding the purpose pursued, the exercise of the right to freedom of association.
For this, it is essential to take into consideration the scenario that preceded the
electronic message sent by the claimed party that caused the opening of this
sanction file. A scenario of disagreements within the union

exchanged, in which the claimant announces to the provincial chief the departure of the
union of all the members of the locality and complains of lack of interest in the

In this context, it does not seem contrary to the principle of necessity or proportionality
the treatment carried out by the claimed data concerning the claimant,
regardless of whether or not they were previously known to the affiliates
communication recipients.

The data regarding the claimant's perception of an INSS pension and the type of
pension received -total permanent disability- is relevant and significant in the
trade union context in which the events unfolded. Relevance that is
evident insofar as this datum was treated connected or linked to another affirmation: that such
pension was compatible with the performance of a job as a police officer

On the other hand, it cannot be ignored that the claimant held a position -
union delegate- in the claimed union; that the recipients of the communication
are the members of the union in said locality and that, furthermore, the union claims to have
intervened in the negotiation of the RPT with the City Council so that a
second activity job in the Local Police. The existing relationship between
the ***UNION.1 and the claimant; the performance by the claimant of the position of
union delegate and the labor importance of the data concerning the claimant
that were treated, are reasons to think that the claimant should have had a
more than reasonable expectation that such data processing could occur.

In view of the foregoing, it can be concluded that the processing of data concerning the
claim made by the union ***SINDICATO.1 on the occasion of the mail
email that the provincial chief sent to the affiliates of the locality in which he was
union delegate, was intimately connected with union activity and with the
interests that are their own. Likewise, it is estimated that, considering the particular
circumstances that occur in the person of the owner of the data and the context in which
that the disputed communication took place, cannot be considered prevalent, in
this case in particular, your right to privacy against the legitimate interests
of the claimed. Consequently, there is no evidence in the behavior of the defendant
