FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation
General Data Protection, hereinafter GDPR), grants each control authority and
as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter,
LOPDGDD), the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures processed
by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions of the Regulation
(UE) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions issued in
their development and, as long as they do not contradict them, on a subsidiary basis, by the rules
general on administrative procedures.”

II

The GDPR defines data processing in article 4.2 of the GDPR:
“any operation or set of operations carried out on personal data or
sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as the
collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification,
extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form

The treatment of images, in this case on video, must have a basis of legitimacy,
of some listed in article 6.1 of the GDPR.

For having images of students and teachers, taken without their knowledge or
consent, which are exposed and disseminated on FACEBOOK of the defendant, it is considered that
there is no legitimate basis for it, and the defendant is accused of committing an alleged
infringement of article 6.1 of the GDPR which indicates:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data for one
or various specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is
party or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another

require the protection of
personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment carried out
by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

Once the positive fact of the treatment has been accredited, it corresponds to prove the fulfillment of the
requirements to the claimant. In this sense, it has not proven that its collection and subsequent exhibition
public view of the video on FACEBOOK will have some of the legitimizing bases indicated by the
article 6 of the RGPD, being accredited the commission of the imputed infraction.

Section i) of article 58.2 of the GDPR provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or, in the case of

Digitales (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions considered very
serious" provides:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (U.E.) 2016/679,

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the legal conditions
of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

IV.

a page on FACEBOOK where the video containing the images was posted

students, despite the masks, even for a short time, it is a video and it is
can save, stop, replay multiple times, increment, dealing with data

Well, the defendant violated article 6.1 of the GDPR, since he published having

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria established in the
section 2 of said article.
2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also
