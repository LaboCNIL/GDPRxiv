supply point located in ***LOCATION.1, ***ADDRESS.1 …without having
signed any contract or have any relationship with said address.

The aforementioned document - "Notification of non-payment" - has in the section dedicated to

The respondent entity affirms that “As can be verified from the
minute 7:56 of the audio file called 803818026680675 of the
telephone recording, in accordance with the regulations on
data protection in force on the date of the telephone conversation, EDP
correctly informed about the treatment that is going to be carried out of the
personal data of both the Representative and his represented (the
now Complainant), by virtue of the processing of the change of ownership.”
(The underlining is from the AEPD)

-
That during the processing of the change of ownership -as can be
check in the audio file 803818026680926 that is part of the
document 1- EDP informed Ms. B.B.B. that the ID number of the
affected was detected by the system as erroneous and its
owner verification. It adds that, the following day, 05/18/2017, the
person who claimed to act on behalf of the affected person was put back in
telephone contact with EDP to complete the procedures for the change of
ownership and, in the course of that conversation - the recording of which was also
has provided this Agency -, he stated again that he was acting in
representation of the claimant (minute 2:05 of the audio with reference
803818026691798)

EDP says that "it has kept all the precautions required both in terms of
-
regarding contracting as well as regarding the information obligation
established in terms of data protection. He adds that he understands that the
reason for the request made by the AEPD Inspection may
be due to the fact that “…the Representative has not adequately transferred the
Complainant the information regarding both the terms of the contract
as data processing”.

-
States that, once received the informative request of the
Data Inspection, contacted the claimant by letter
addressed to your address dated 11/15/2018 of which you provide us with a copy. In the
A letter addressed to the claimant states that “…the contracting of the
electricity supply with EDP Energía, S.A.U. (hereinafter EDP) was carried out

-
on their behalf, proceeding with the change of ownership of the supply
corresponding to the address located at ***ADDRESS.1, ***LOCATION.1”.

E/7378/2018 -which brings cause PS/0109/2019- the general information of the
entity extracted from the Mercantile Registry on the same date from which we highlight that
the subscribed and paid-up share capital amounts to 1,000,000 euros and that the
The company began its operations on 03/18/1998.

THIRD:
 The facts object of the claim are subject to the
provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the
Treatment of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data, which entered into
effective 05/25/2018.
         The respondent affirms that she obtained the personal data of the claimant and gave
register an electricity contract in your name on 05/17/2018, through a
phone call from a person who claimed to hold his representation.
         Thus, the processing of the personal data of the affected party began before
that Regulation (EU) 2016/679 came into force -which happens on 05/25/2018- and
when the Organic Law 15/1999 on Personal Data Protection was still in force.
Personal Character, LOPD. However, the conduct of EDP in which the
infringement, the processing of the claimant's data without legitimacy for it
linked to an electricity supply contract, has been maintained over time until the
Currently or, at least, until 11/15/2018 as it is accredited
documentaryly.
         The infringement for which EDP is held responsible is of the nature of the
of the so-called permanent infractions, in which the consummation is projected
in time beyond the initial fact and extends, violating the regulations of
data protection, during the entire period of time in which the data is subject to
treatment. In the present case, despite the fact that on the date on which the
infringing conduct the applicable norm was the LOPD, the norm that results from
application is the one that is in force when the infraction is consummated because it is in that
moment when it is understood committed.

         The Supreme Court has ruled on the rule to be applied in
those cases in which the infractions are prolonged in time and there have been
a normative change while the infraction was committed. The STS of 04/17/2002 (Rec.
466/2000) applied a provision that was not in force at the initial moment of
commission of the infraction but yes in the subsequent ones, in which the conduct continued
offending The Judgment examined a case that dealt with the sanction imposed
to a Judge for breach of her duty to abstain in proceedings
Previous. The sanctioned alleged the non-validity of article 417.8 of the LOPJ when
the events occurred. The STS considered that the infraction had been committed
from the date of initiation of the Preliminary Proceedings until the moment in which the
Judge was suspended in the exercise of her functions, so that rule was of
app.
         The SAN of 09/16/2008 (Rec.488/2006) pronounces in the same sense

FOURTH: On March 21, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed entity,
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/30

in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in
Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

FIFTH: On 04/09/2019 the allegations are received in the AEPD Registry
of the one claimed to the agreement to initiate the sanctioning file in which it requests
that the proceedings be archived “for having acted … in accordance with
Law" and, subsidiarily, that "a light sanction be imposed in the amount
minimal”.

He provides as documentary evidence a CD with a recording, in which no
provides the date on which it took place, on which a person who identifies with the
name, surnames and NIF of the claimant, makes a call to EDP and states that they have
cut off the supply while asking what is the amount owed adding
which sounds like it is 140.77 euros. The entity, after asking about the point
of supply informs him that he owes 170.80 euros and that he can pay by card.

The defendant, in support of her claims, put forward in the brief of

arguments to the initial agreement the following arguments:

- That "he has kept all the required precautions" and that the "contracting has been
at all times in good faith on the part of EDP, complying with the provisions
in current regulations on data protection. He adds that for
reasons that it alleges -which we will detail later- "the contractual relationship with
the Complainant is perfectly valid, the data collection was carried out
in accordance with Law and the treatment of the complainant's data is
perfectly valid."

- In the event that the AEPD does not agree to file the proceedings, it alleges
that the sanction established in the agreement to initiate the disciplinary proceedings
violates the principle of proportionality. He maintains that there was no guilt or
unlawfulness in its action and that "the sanction to be imposed would have to
correspond to a minor infraction, in its minimum amount", because, it says, "it does not
only the alleged aggravating factors would not apply, but would apply
practically all of the extenuating circumstances included in the sanctioning regime”.

- It states that, as it proved in procedure E/7378/2018, "there is a
valid contractual relationship” between EDP and the claimant. He claims that the
legitimacy of the treatment of the data of the claimant and the confirmation of
a valid contractual relationship between the claimant and EDP is justified by two
extremes that the Agency itself has considered proven in the agreement of
beginning and that he described as irrelevant for the purposes of the assessment that corresponds to him
do. Namely, "that the claimant's data was obtained through Mrs.
BBB and that this lady affirmed on several occasions, during the course of the
telephone conversations, acting on behalf of the claimant.”

- States that we are dealing with an example of a representative mandate regulated in
the Civil Code (articles 1709-1739) which leads him to state emphatically that
“…therefore no rule has been broken by EDP in the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

6/30

hiring …". He adds that the mandate can be verbal, "provided that of the
circumstances the veracity and granting of the same can be deduced "and that
It can be express or implied, deduced from the principal's own acts. Is
doctrinal exposition on the mandate contract puts it in connection with
facts such as the recording you attach to your pleadings; what
for EDP it constitutes a ratification of the contract and of the mandate. to such
effect invokes the STS, First Chamber, of 01/09/1964, according to which the principal
that takes advantage of the acts of the president tacitly ratifies the mandate;
the prohibition of abuse of rights (former article 7.2 C.C.) -every time, it affirms,
the “Complainant” would have enjoyed the supplies provided- and would be
also contrary to the good faith that should preside over the exercise of rights
(former article 7.1 C.C.)

It emphasizes that “the consequences of a possible negligent action by
part of Mrs. B.B.B., …, can in no case affect the validity
contractual, .. The contractual relationship between the parties is perfected and is
fully legitimate."

Invokes article 83 of Royal Decree 1955/2000, which regulates the
activities of transport, distribution, commercialization, supply and
authorization procedures for electric power installations, in which,
says, the consumer who is up to date with the payment is granted the power to
transfer your contract to another consumer who is going to use it in
identical conditions. He insists that “the change of ownership occurs under
the same contractual conditions, that is, without the change being
considered a new registration and therefore a new contract”.

-

-

- Given the exposure made by the Agency in the initial agreement regarding the fact that
no evidence had been provided that the claimant had granted his
representation to the person who claimed to act on your behalf (Mrs. B.B.B.)
nor that the entity displayed the minimum diligence required to verify that
Indeed, her interlocutor had the representation that she claimed to hold
EDP counters that “there is no such obligation” and that “the C.C. admits the
freedom of form in the figure of the mandate, this being able to be verbal…”

SIXTH: On 11/18/2019 a trial period is opened in which they agree,
as the only evidentiary proceedings, the incorporation to PS/109/2019 of the
documents that make up file E/07378/2018 -whose incorporation for this purpose is already
it was announced in the Agreement to Commence the procedure-: The claim briefs; the
documentation generated by the AEPD; the response of the respondent to the request for
information and the Diligence of 11/18/2019 with the information obtained on that date to
through AXESOR regarding the result of the activity of the claimed party during the
fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Likewise, they are considered incorporated into the sanctioning file
the allegations of the respondent to the initiation agreement and its attached documents.

SEVENTH: On 11/26/2019, a resolution proposal is formulated in the following
terms:

<<FIRST: That by the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data is sanctioned to EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., with NIF A-33543547, for an infringement

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/30

of article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, with a fine of
75,000.00 euros (seventy-five thousand euros).
(…)

SECOND: That, in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the
EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., with NIF A-33543547, which ADOPTS THE MEASURES
INDISPENSABLE to adapt your telematic contracting protocols to the
provisions of the RGPD regarding the legality of the treatment; in particular in the
contracting through a representative, in which you must be able to
prove both the reality of the representation granted by the owner of the data
as the identity of the person who has the status of represented in the contract.
Also, if you do not have them implemented, you must adopt them in the protocol
face-to-face hiring. Measures that, where appropriate, must be adopted within the
of one month computed from the date on which the sanctioning resolution is
executive.>>

The proposed resolution was notified electronically to the respondent, being the

availability date on 11/26/2019 and acceptance date on 11/27/2019.

Pursuant to article 73 of the LPACAP, the term to formulate allegations is

ten days computed from the day following the notification.

EIGHTH: On 12/12/2019, the electronic headquarters of this Agency have the
allegations of the respondent to the proposed resolution in which he requests that
proceed to file the procedure for having acted, he says, in accordance with the law.

In defense of her claim, the respondent reiterates the allegations already made
-to the agreement to start the sanctioning file and in the previous informative procedure- and,
In short, he adduces the following arguments:

- It states in the first allegation that “the evidence presented by this
representation mark the proactive performance of the representative in contracting in
name of his client, confirming the existence of the point of
supply and therefore the existence of the contract. Consider that the
treatment that EDP has made of the personal data of the complainant is
legitimate because in his opinion there is a valid contractual relationship between the two.

- In her second allegation, the respondent maintains that she is the victim of a
situation of "legal defenselessness" as a result of the actions of the AEPD every time
that this Agency has admitted "accredited the origin of the data, provided in
 BBB,
the call at the time of hiring made by Ms.
However, they are irrelevant in terms of proving due treatment.
of the same when -argues the claimed- it is precisely that point that
that justifies the legitimacy of the processing of the complainant's data,
since the existence of a valid contractual relationship between the parties
is confirmed”

 

Regarding the sound document that EDP provided to this Agency annexed to its
allegations to the initial agreement, after reproducing the assessment that
that test was made by the instructor of the file in the proposed resolution,
adds the following statements, despite the fact that neither in the sound document
provides a date and neither in it nor in any other is what it now alleges justified:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/30

“That this representation not only indicates that the recording collects the
consent of the natural person who calls to proceed with the payment of the
invoices, the date of the call being collected on August 10, 2018, but
that said payer is the son of the Complainant knowing the latter
as contract holder. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The respondent says that, in her opinion, "recruitment by representation, ...., is
has done in accordance with the law, not only requesting the documentation
required and obtained the proof of the contracting carried out, but that the same
it is ratified at a later time.”

 

- In his third allegation he tries to refute the total lack of diligence in his
action attributed to it by the motion for a resolution and in this regard it says: “…
however, my principal acted in compliance with the requirements demanded by the
civil and commercial regulations, ensuring the identification of the old and new
holder, as well as to translate the operation carried out into a durable medium” and
highlights - appears written in bold - that the AEPD "not only hinders and inhibits the
legal traffic, but completely annuls the figure of the representative and the
mandate, not considering this administrative body these operations
performed by third parties as legitimate acts”

- In the fourth allegation -in response to the statement made by the proposal
of resolution that the entity completely lacks a protocol of
action for telematic contracting when the person who facilitates
the data is not the owner, but a third party who claims to act on his behalf- says:
“ We are not facing a contract; which has a double process
verification implemented for new hires” and that the supposed
analyzed supposes "a mere modification of the holder of the contract already signed
previously” which leads him to affirm that it is not applicable “nor the
contracting procedure” “neither the double verification supposes a guarantee
legal mandatory implementation by my client”. And he concludes by saying: “…the
AEPD requires accreditation of the granting of representation through
an element of evidence for my client, such as a minimum duty of diligence
necessary, a requirement that the regulations do not include. Therefore, in this case and
the AEPD sanctions for not complying with this requirement would mean a resolution
not in accordance with law”.

- In his allegation

  the fifth declares: “The different
viable possibilities, both technically and operationally speaking, to
reinforce contracting procedures when such procedures are
processed by a third party on behalf of the owner.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The RGPD dedicates article 5 to the principles that should govern the treatment and,

among them, he mentions those of “legality, loyalty and transparency”. The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party;”
(The underlining is from the AEPD)

Article 6 of the RGPD -under the heading "Legality of the treatment"- details in its
section 1 the cases in which the processing of third party data is
considered lawful:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

13/30

personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation

applicable to the data controller;

d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or

of another natural person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the person responsible for the
treatment;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that on
such interests do not override the interests or rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
particularly when the interested party is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to
treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.
(…)”

It should be remembered that article 5 of the RGPD, after alluding in its section
1 to the principles relating to the processing of personal data -among them, as
exposes in previous paragraphs, to the one of "legality" -, adds in section 2:

“The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the
provided in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”
(The underlining is from the AEPD)

The infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD is typified in article 83
of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of fines
administrative”, says:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

It should also be noted that Organic Law 3/2018, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), for the purposes of
prescription, qualifies in its article 72.1.b) as a very serious infraction "The treatment
of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of legality of the
treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”

III

The person claimed in this sanctioning procedure is attributed a

violation of article 6.1 RGPD. The respondent processed the personal data of the
unlawful claimant. It has not been able to prove that the data processing
carried out had its legal basis in any of the circumstances detailed in the
article 6.1 of the RGPD.

A.- It has been accredited through the documentation that is in the file
administrative process -essentially described in the Proven Facts- that EDP dealt with the
personal data of the claimant (name, surnames, NIF, address and number of
mobile phone) linked to an electricity contract of which the affected party denies having
been a party and without the respondent having provided documentation of any kind of the
that it is evidenced that the treatment of the data was protected in any of the
conditions of legality that article 6.1 RGPD relates.

In accordance with article 6.1 of the RGPD, the processing of personal data of
third parties must be "lawful", for which it must, in principle, comply with any of the
conditions described in sections a) to f) of the precept.

B.- In the case analyzed, EDP attributes to the claimant the status of party to the
electricity contract for the supply point located on the street
***ADDRESS.1, from ***TOWN.1. The claimant denies having signed the aforementioned
contract and denies knowledge of that supply point. The claimant is domiciled in
another Autonomous Community.

The respondent asserts that the claimant is a party to a supply contract
held with her through whom she identified herself as her representative, the
Mrs. B.B.B., implying that the legal basis of the treatment is the
execution of the contract (article 6.1.b, of the RGPD).

However, to protect the treatment carried out by EDP in the article
6.1.b) of the RGPD it is necessary that the condition of contracting party of the affected
is accredited. The raison d'être of this cause of legitimation of the treatment is
precisely that, to the extent that the owner of the data grants the consent
to the contract, you also consent to your personal data being processed
necessary for its execution and compliance.

Thus, the question is whether EDP has provided evidence showing
that the affected party consented to contract with that entity; which transferred to the assumption that
we are dealing with will consist of assessing whether evidence has been provided that Mrs. B.B.B.
actually held the representation of the claimant or, in other words, that
As stated by the respondent, the claimant had agreed with Mrs. B.B.B. a
representative mandate to contract the electricity supply on their behalf.

EDP argues that this is enough evidence to demonstrate that the claimant had
granted its representation to Mrs. B.B.B. to sign with her, in her
name, an electricity contract the sound document that has contributed to this
Agency: a CD with the recordings of the telephone conversations held
between that entity and a third person (Mrs. B.B.B.) in which she
“manifests” “repeatedly” that it holds the representation of the claimant to give
registration in your name (or change the ownership of the supply contract that appeared in
name of a company on whose behalf Mrs. B.B.B. acts) a contract

of electricity for the supply point of ***ADDRESS.1 in
***LOCATION.1.

The recordings sent to the Agency by EDP (described in Facts
proven 7 and 8) do prove, exclusively, that a person, Mrs.
B.B.B., insistently stated that they represent the claimant for
contract on your behalf with EDP. The aforementioned recordings do not prove that the
claimant will grant his representation to the aforementioned lady to contract on his behalf
the electricity supply nor do they provide any indication to that effect.

However, the recordings sent by EDP (four audios, of which two of
they make up document 1 and the rest make up document two of those provided with the
response to the information request) do prove the origin of some of the
personal data of the complainant that EDP processed associated with a contract that he denies
having celebrated: we refer to the data of the name, surnames and DNI of the claimant.
Data that, as evidenced by listening to the recordings, were
provided by Mrs. B.B.B. to EDP.

However, the recordings do not explain the origin of other data in the
claimant that EDP also treated linked to a contract to which the holder of the
personal data is foreign: your address in ***LOCALIDAD.2,, which does not match, as
has already been highlighted, with that of the supply point and the mobile number of the
claimant that EDP included in the copy of the contract that it sent to his address.

The recordings also show these extremes: That the aforementioned lady
BBB -which in the opinion of EPD acted on behalf of the claimant- requested that the
invoicing was sent to your representative at the address of the supply point
-***ADDRESS.1, ***LOCATION.1- but at no time did he provide another
address than that corresponding to the supply point and provided only as
mobile number of the person whom he claimed to represent the ***TELEPHONE.2.

       
 Therefore, from the foregoing we must conclude that it was not Mrs. B.B.B. who
provided EDP with the details of the claimant's address - an address that has nothing to do
with the supply point, since it is located in another Autonomous Community, in the
locality of ***LOCALIDAD.2, ***ADDRESS.2-, address to which EDP sent the
document called "Notice of default" described in the Proven Facts and
later a copy of the contract to be sent to him signed.

Also, the mobile number of the claimant, ***TELEFONO.3, which EDP
incorporated into the contractual document that was sent to your address, it was not provided either
by Mrs. B.B.B.. Let us recall the explanation that the claimant has offered. That
made a telephone claim with EDP through his mobile number and that the
The result was receiving from the entity a contractual document to be returned
signed in which appeared his mobile number, from which he made the call of
claim. Well, in that contractual document, surprisingly,
not even the landline telephone number that appeared in the Non-Payment Notice, the
***TELEPHONE.1 -regarding which the claimant stated in his writing of
claim that did not belong to her - nor the mobile number that Mrs.
BBB provided to EDP in the course of the recordings such as the telephone number of his
assumption represented: ***TELEPHONE.2.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

16/30

And finally, it is striking that this mobile number is curiously
(***TELEPHONE.2) the same one that will later be provided to EDP by a person who
will contact the entity as a result of a cut at the supply point and ask
How much is the amount owed? Recording that EDP has contributed with its writing
of allegations to the initial agreement (see Proven fact 10) that in his opinion would serve
to justify the legality of the data processing on which the claim is based
occupies us.

      
In short: EDP has not provided this Agency with any document that
proof of the condition of representative of the claimant that Mrs. B.B.B. he claimed
hold when he contacted the entity by telephone and changed the ownership of the
contract in the name of the claimant, providing in that act the name, two surnames and
NIF of your supposed represented. EDP has also not proven what the legitimacy is
to process other data of the claimant, such as their address or mobile phone; data that
Mrs. B.B.B. did not provide to EDP.

To this should be added another circumstance of great significance. In the light of
documentation provided by EDP -four audios with the calls made between that
company and Mrs. B.B.B. on September 17 and 18, 2018 in order to
manage the registration of the contract in the name of the claimant- it is verified that in no
At that time, the entity demanded that the third party (Mrs. B.B.B.) who provided the
data of the claimant and said to hold his representation would provide some document that
I would credit that point.

Nor is there any knowledge that the entity, before registering the
electricity supply contract in the name of the claimant -and despite the fact that the legitimacy
of EDP to process the claimant's personal data was supported,
exclusively, in that they had been provided by his supposed representative - would have
taken some measure to verify the reality of that representation. Outside
contacting the owner of the data directly or articulating some other
mechanism, the truth is that EDP has not shown that it had deployed a
minimum diligence in verifying that, indeed, the owner of the data
had granted his representation to the third party who provided them (Mrs. B.B.B.).
Likewise, there is no evidence that this entity has implemented an ad hoc protocol.

C-. Respect for the principle of legality that must govern the processing of personal data.
third parties and referred to in article 6.1. of the RGPD, it implies that the person in charge
be able to demonstrate compliance (principle of proactive responsibility,
article 5.2 of the RGPD)

 In the present case -in which the respondent affirms that the legality of the treatment
is justified by the existence of a contract in which the affected party was a party- it is transferred
the person responsible for the processing of personal data bears the burden of proof of the
hiring; or at least the burden of proof that he displayed the diligence that was
proceeding to comply with such obligation.

We refer to article 5.2 of the RGPD. In similar terms, it was pronounced
the, currently repealed, Directive 95/46, which was transposed into domestic law
Spanish through Organic Law 15/1999, on Data Protection (LOPD) and that
clearly reflected the Regulations for the development of the LOPD, approved by the

Royal Decree 1720/2007. Regulations in force when EDP started data processing
which is the object of assessment in this disciplinary proceeding and which is currently
find repealed.

The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the National High Court, in cases
such as the one proposed here, has been considered under the previous regulations that
When the owner of the data denies the contract, the burden of proof corresponds to
who affirms its existence, and the data controller must
third parties collect and keep the necessary documentation to prove the
owner's consent.

We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Basis of
Fourth Right: “On the other hand, it is the data controller (for all,
Judgment of this Chamber of October 25, 2002 Rec. 185/2001) to whom it corresponds
ensure that the person from whom consent is requested actually gives it, and
that the person who is giving the consent is effectively the owner of those
personal data, having to keep proof of compliance with the obligation to
provision of the Administration, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Law.

D.- EDP also invokes, in defense of its claim that it acted in accordance with
Law and respected the principle of legality when processing the claimant's data, which, the
change of ownership of the electricity contract managed by Mrs. B.B.B. -in
quality of representative of the company that was the holder of the energy contract for
the point of supply of ***ADDRESS.1- did not oblige him to prove that the alleged
representative held the representation of the new client and owner of the data
treated. It justifies such an affirmation in that article 83 of Royal Decree 1955/2000
grants the consumer who is up to date with the payment the power to transfer his
contract to another consumer who is going to make use of it under identical conditions.
And it also adds that in the present case "the change of ownership occurs under
the same contractual conditions, that is, without the change being
considered a new registration and therefore a new contract”.

In response to such allegation, regarding the alleged enabling rule for the
treatment carried out (the R.D. 1955/2000), it is enough to point out that article 6.1 of the RGPD,
in its section c) contemplates as one of the assumptions of legality of the treatment that
this is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment.

  However, the obligation in such a case must be imposed by a rule with
formal rank of Law. The requirement that the enabling norm have the formal rank of
Law was also established in the previous data protection regulations. Us
we refer to article 10.2 of the Regulations for the development of the LOPD, currently
repealed, but in force when EDP started processing the complainant's data.
STC/292/2000 had an impact on this issue at the time regarding the article
6.1, in fine, of the LOPD, which mentioned the Law as an exception to the principle of
consent. The Constitutional Court warned that a limitation to a right
fundamental or to the exercise of the faculties that integrate it requires that it be carried out
carried out through a Law in the formal sense, without the introduction of limitations or
restrictions to the content of a right of that nature through a norm
regulatory.

18/30

In any case, and without prejudice to the preceding exposition, the regulatory norm
invoked by EDP has as a factual assumption that the consumer was at the
payment stream. And as revealed by listening to the recording provided with the
allegations to the initiation agreement - in which a person who is identified with the data
of the claimant contacts EDP to ask about the amount owed since it
have cut off the electricity supply - three bills were due.

Regarding the second reflection of the claimed one -that there was no discharge
new with the data of the claimant but a subrogation of the claimant in the
previous contract - it is a question of a civil/commercial nature on which
this Agency should not pronounce itself. What is relevant for the purposes at hand is that,
regardless of whether we are facing a subrogation or a new contract,
In both cases, the claimant would have, as claimed by the claimant, the
contracting party status. And as such, to assert as a legal basis
of the treatment article 6.1.b) of the RGPD, it is essential that the owner of the data
had given his intended representative consent to act in
such condition, an extreme that in no case has been accredited by EDP.

This Agency reiterates that none of the documents that EDP has provided
proves what is substantial in the matter examined: that the owner of the data granted
to Mrs. B.B.B. his representation so that on his behalf he could manage the change in
the ownership of the electricity contract of the supply point of ***ADDRESS.1.

Nor has the respondent provided documents or evidence that
show that the entity, in such a situation - a telematic contracting through
who claims to be the representative of the owner of the data-, displayed the diligence
minimum requirement to verify that your interlocutor actually had the
representation that he claimed to hold.

Respect for the principle of legality, before the principle of consent, which is in
the essence of the fundamental right to protection of personal data, requires
prove that the owner of the data consented to a third party holding a
contract with EDP or, at least, that the data controller deployed the
essential diligence to prove that point. Not to act like this - and not to demand it
Thus, this Agency, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with the regulations
regulating the right to protection of personal data - the result would be
empty the content of the principle of legality and in particular article 6.1 of the LOPD.

E.- Confirmed that EDP processed the personal data of the claimant and verified
also that this entity has not provided the AEPD with any document that demonstrates
that the claimant granted his representation to the person who entered into the contract with
her and affirmed to act on her behalf -which would have allowed the treatment to be lawful
under article 6.1.b, of the RGPD- it must be assessed if the fault of the
claimed entity or if it omitted the due diligence, attending the
circumstances of the case, essential for the behavior analyzed to be
subsumable in the offending type of article 83.5. of the GDPR.

This, because our sanctioning law governs the principle of culpability,
that prevents the imposition of sanctions based on the strict liability of the alleged

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

19/30

offender. The presence of the element of culpability in the broad sense, as
condition for the sanctioning responsibility to arise, has been recognized by the
Constitutional Court, among others, in its STC 76/1999, in which it states that the
Administrative sanctions share the same nature as criminal ones, since they are
one of the manifestations of the ius puniendi of the State and that, as a requirement
derived from the principles of legal certainty and criminal legality enshrined in the
articles 9.3 and 25.1 of the C.E., its existence is essential to impose it.

Law 40/2015 on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector provides in the article

28, under the heading “Responsibility”:

"1. They may only be sanctioned for acts constituting an infraction.
natural and legal persons administratively, as well as, when a Law
recognize capacity to act, affected groups, unions and entities without
legal personality and independent or autonomous estates, which result
responsible for them by way of fraud or negligence.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In the case analyzed, not only is the element of guilt present -
extreme that the respondent denies in its allegations to the initial agreement - but rather
appreciates a very serious lack of diligence on the part of the respondent that has a consequence
directly in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed.

In compliance with the obligations that the RGPD imposes on the person responsible for the
treatment, it must display the minimum diligence required by the circumstances
of the case. The SAN of 04/29/2020 is illustrative -which, although it was issued in a matter of
fraudulent contracting and under the previous regulations, it is perfectly extrapolated to the
that occupies us- whose sixth Legal Basis says:

“The question is not to clarify whether the appellant processed the personal data
of the complainant without her consent, such as whether or not she used due diligence
reasonable in trying to identify the person with whom you signed the
contract". (The underlining is from the AEPD)

For this reason, even when there is unlawful conduct, when the person responsible for the
treatment certifies having acted with the diligence that the circumstances of the case

data, as strict liability is proscribed in our Administrative Law
sanctioning party, the AEPD proceeds to file the file.

In the case that we examine, it is verified that the EDP entity did not deploy the
the least diligence in order to be in a position to prove that the holder of the
personal data had granted its representation to the person who claimed to act in
your name on the contract. The respondent did not verify before managing the change
ownership of the electricity supply contract in the name of the claimant if the person
he claimed to act on his behalf, he actually held it.

To such an extent, the lack of diligence shown by EDP in the
course that concerns us that the recordings of the conversations held between
the entity and the person who identified himself as the claimant's representative

by checking the document. Rather, as Mrs. B.B.B. explained in
the conversation with EDP whose recording is in the file, the data had been
handwritten by the person it claimed to represent. It is also striking that
despite the incidents arising in telephone contracting regarding the letter of the DNI
of the represented -which forced Mrs. B.B.B. I had to call a second
once to EDP after verifying the letter of the document- the respondent continued without
articulate some consistent measure aimed at verifying that the holder of the
the data had granted its representation to the person who intervened in the
hiring.

In light of the recordings in the file and what is alleged by EDP
In its defense, it is clearly evident that the entity completely lacks a
protocol of action for telematic contracts when the person who
provides the data is not its owner, but a third party that claims to act on its behalf.
Lack that, in addition, prevents compliance with the principle of responsibility
proactive.

Regarding the element of guilt in the framework of the procedure
sanctioning party it seems appropriate to refer to the SAN of 05/30/2015 (Rec. 163/2014)
which has highlighted the differences that exist between the attribution of responsibility to
a natural person and a legal person and connects the “reproachability” of a
certain conduct to a "legal person" with the circumstance that that
“Would it have provided or not an effective protection to the legal right protected by the
rule". The second Legal Basis of the aforementioned Judgment states:

<<However, the mode of attribution of responsibility to people

They are attributable to human behavior. So, in the case of violations
committed by legal persons, although the element of
guilt, it is necessarily applied differently from the way it is applied with respect to
to natural persons. According to STC 246/1999 "(...) this construction, different from the
imputability of the authorship of the infraction to the legal person arises from the
nature of legal fiction to which these subjects respond. missing in them
volitional element in the strict sense, but not the ability to break the rules to the
that they are subjected. Capacity for infringement and, therefore, direct blame that
derives from the legal right protected by the norm that is violated and the need for
said protection is really effective and for the risk that, consequently, must
assume the legal entity that is subject to compliance with said rule”>> (The
underlined is from the AEPD)

EDP–given the nature of the business activity it carries out, which
implies the processing of numerous personal data - had the obligation to
have adopted the necessary and timely measures to be in conditions of
comply with the obligations that are implicit in the principle of legality.

In short, the conduct of EDP, materialized in the processing of data

IV

The arguments put forward by the claimant in her various briefs - briefs
whose content is summarized in the second, fifth and eighth Background, and to which
we mention in the preceding Foundations of this resolution- demand to make
some precisions:

In defense of its claim to archive the file, EDP makes various
allegations that revolve around the same idea: the existence of a contract of
representative mandate between Mrs. B.B.B. and the claimant for the first
will enter into an energy contract with EDP on its behalf. representative mandate that
For EDP, it is the legitimate legal basis for the treatment it has carried out.

To support such an assertion, the respondent makes endless assertions
devoid of any legal consistency. He says, for example, that "there is a relationship
valid contractual relationship” between EDP and the complainant and justifies that assertion in two
elements that, it states, the Agency considered proven in the initiation agreement:
“That the claimant's data was obtained through Mrs. B.B.B. and what is this
The lady stated on several occasions, during the telephone conversations, that
acted on behalf of the claimant.

In the allegations to the proposed resolution, EDP once again focuses on
this issue to now denounce the legal defenselessness to which this Agency has
subdued.

Thus, it states that "he is in a situation of legal defenselessness, since
that the AEPD itself accredited admits the origin of the data, provided in the call
at the time of the hiring made by Mrs. B.B.B., resulting in no
however irrelevant in order to prove the due treatment of the same, when
is precisely the point of reference that justifies the legitimacy of the treatment of
the data of the Complainant, since the existence of a valid contractual relationship
between the parties is confirmed.” Second allegation of the brief of allegations to the
resolution proposal. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Well, in relation to this "legal defenselessness" that EDP suffers, we must

specify what this Agency did say and what it did not say, but EDP wants to attribute it.

In Legal Basis II of the motion for a resolution, section B (in the
this resolution, Legal Basis III), it is said that the recordings sent
by EDP (Proven Facts 7 and 8) “exclusively prove that a
person, Mrs. B.B.B., insistently stated that she represented the
claimant to contract on his behalf with EDP.” And then it is added: "The
aforementioned recordings, nor do they prove that the claimant granted his representation to the
said lady to contract the electricity supply on her behalf, nor do they provide any evidence
any in that sense.” And it goes on to say that the “recordings sent by
EDP (four audios, of which two of them make up document 1 and the rest the
document two of those provided with the response to the information request) do prove
what is the origin of some of the claimant's personal data that EDP processed

associated with a contract that he denies having entered into: we refer to the data of
name, surnames and ID of the claimant. Data that, as evidenced by
the audition of the recordings, were provided by Mrs.
 
  to EDP.”
“However, the recordings do not explain the origin of other data from the
claimant that EDP also treated linked to a contract to which the holder of the
personal data is foreign: your address in ***LOCALIDAD.2, which does not match, as
has already been highlighted, with that of the supply point and the mobile number of the
claimant that EDP included in the copy of the contract that it sent to his address”

 BBB
 

As it seems obvious, in such paragraphs nothing else is stated than the recordings
of EDP demonstrate that the data of the complainant that were subject to treatment by
the entity (except its address and mobile number) come from or originate in the
information that, in light of the recordings sent to the AEDP, was provided by Mrs.
BBB
 
 . This, in contrast to other data of the complainant that EDP also treated
but that the aforementioned lady did not provide him, since they are not mentioned in the recordings
provided: the claimant's address and mobile phone number.

Pretend -as the complainant does- that in such paragraphs this Agency is
acknowledging that it was the claimant who provided his data to Mrs. B.B.B. It is
any inadmissible point.

In short, when the Agency states that the recordings provided are
irrelevant is referring to their lack of virtuality to prove or provide evidence
that the claimant granted his representation to Mrs. B.B.B.. As such
representation is neither credited nor evidence of its existence is provided, it is not possible
accept, as the claimant claims, that there was a valid contractual relationship between
the parts.

The claimed, in proof of the alleged validity of the contractual relationship between
EDP and the claimant, has invoked again the recording that it provided as a document
attached to the pleadings to the initiation agreement.

Regarding this recording – which, as I already underlined at the time, the Agency did not
contains date- EDP, surprisingly, provides new information that, without
However, it is not accompanied by its necessary proof. The entity now says in its
brief of allegations to the proposal - second allegation, third paragraph - that the
recording is from 08/10/2019 (data that does not appear on the sound recording) and that “said
payer, is the son of the Complainant, knowing the latter as the owner of the
contract"

The recording provided by EDP with the brief of allegations to the agreement of
beginning (Proven fact tenth) -in which the person who calls and identifies himself with the
personal data of the claimant asks how much the debt amounts to, since they have
cut off the supply, after which the telephone operator of the claimed one questions him
about the CUPS of the home and informs you of the amount pending payment and the
possibility of card payment - cannot have the probative effect that EDP wants
attribute to him

It suffices to point out in this regard that the processing of the complainant's data without
legitimation for it begins in May 2018; that in the recordings it is indicated that

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

23/30

payment will be made by direct debit, which seems to have not happened
given the existing non-payment situation and that the claimant, who received at his home
the non-payment notification was fully aware of the amount owed.

The entity also affirms (third allegation of the allegations to the proposal,
first paragraph) that “acted…ensuring the identification of the previous and new owner,
as well as to translate the operation carried out into a durable medium”

Interesting statement that demands precision: identification is not the
legal basis of the treatment, but rather that it is the alleged consent of the
claimant to the mandate granted to Mrs. B.B.B.. Thus, it is true that in the
recordings provided by EDP Mrs. B.B.B., who insistently affirms that she
is the claimant's representative, provided EDP, or in other words, "identified" before
EDP to his intended representative and provided his name, two surnames and NIF.

EDP evidently through the recording provided -in which the intended
The claimant's representative identifies him/her - knows his/her name, surnames and NIF. But the
relevant issue is another: the accreditation that the aforementioned lady acted in condition
of the claimant's representative because they both agreed to do so, which requires proving
that the claimant consented to such representation.

The various arguments put forward by EDP have the same common element.
They intentionally omit any reference to what constitutes the core of the
conduct contrary to the RGPD for which the entity is responsible: the proof that
the claimant granted Mrs. B.B.B. his representation to intervene in his
name in contracting with EDP.

Related to the above we have to bring up another of the interesting
statements made by EDP in its defense (which also stands out in bold): that “the
AEPD, not only hinders and inhibits legal traffic, but also completely annuls the
figure of the representative and the mandate, not considering this administrative body
these operations carried out by third parties, as legitimate acts” (The underlining is
the AEPD)

Affirmation that again starts from a false premise. This Agency - of course
could be otherwise because it is subject to the Spanish legal system - nothing
has to say about the figure of the representative mandate

What is decisive is that EDP has not proved that the person who intervened in the
hiring, and said to act as representative of the claimant, held that
representation. What is relevant is the lack of proof that the claimant -whose data
personal has treated EDP associated with a contract that he denies having entered into-
had granted his representation to the person who intervened in the contracting and said
act in such a condition.

 
The defendant -who in her arguments to the initial agreement explained in detail
the provisions of the Civil Code that regulate the mandate and insisted that in our
DC. governs the principle of freedom of form, so this Agency cannot require
that the mandate be documented - forgets that article 1278 of the C.c provides that "The
Contracts will be binding regardless of the form in which they have been concluded,

provided that they meet the essential conditions for their validity. and one of
these conditions is consent. Consent of the claimant to the mandate
representative that he had supposedly conferred on Mrs. B.B.B., who was
essential condition for its existence and about which EDP contributes nothing and says nothing.

Regarding the lack of diligence shown by EDP to verify that the
person who provided the personal data of the claimant held his
representation and that, not even after the phone call, did
some type of activity to confirm the identity of the new owner EDP has responded
in his arguments to the proposal:

“However, this consideration is not correct, since, not even in this case
We are facing a contract, nor does my client lack procedures that regulate
these aspects.” It then indicates:

“First of all, my client has a double verification process
implemented for new hires via text message to phone
of contact provided, keeping it as proof of the ratification of the
hiring.

Second, this case involves a mere modification of the owner of the

contract already signed previously…” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Allegations that only show confusion regarding the obligations to be
which is subject to the person responsible for the processing of personal data of third parties by
the specific legislation. The mere manifestations of those who claim to act in
representation of another cannot justify the legality of the treatment nor constitute a
proof of respect for this principle in the processing of data whose compliance

A) In light of the transcribed regulations and in order to specify the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed on EDP as responsible for a typified infraction
in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it seems appropriate to make two clarifications:

The first, that article 83.2 RGPD requires that the control authority
guarantees that the sanction to be imposed is in each case “effective, proportionate and
dissuasive" and, second, that the amount of the sanction provided for in the RGPD for

data.

 

26/30

infringements contemplated in article 83.5 have as a maximum limit the greater of
these two amounts: 20,000,000 euros or 4% of the total annual turnover
overall for the previous financial year. During the 2017 financial year, the turnover of
EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., amounted to 1,297,962,000 euros, for which 4% of this
amount amounts to 51,918,480 euros.

Although the main claim of the respondent has been the archiving of the
actions, in its allegations to the initial agreement requested in a subsidiary
that the minimum sanction provided for minor infractions be imposed. Allegation
which has no reason to be when -as is the case here- the applicable standard is the RGPD
which, unlike the LOPD, does not distinguish between minor, serious and very
serious and that does not contemplate a mechanism equivalent to article 45.5 of the
aforementioned Organic Law 15/1999.

B) On the origin of estimating any of the mitigating factors described in the standard
EDP argued that for the matter at hand "practice
totality of the mitigating factors included in the sanctioning regime”.

However, we cannot share this assertion of the claimed. It's more,
In the present case, it is not even considered appropriate to consider as mitigating factors the
fact that only one person or the
merely local scope of the offense (article 83.2.a)

 In a case such as the one we are analyzing -in which the claimed entity, for
telematic contracting in which a third party intervenes on behalf of the
owner of the data, lacks a protocol adjusted to Law that allows
demonstrate that he actually holds that representation - the offending conduct does not
constitutes a specific and isolated event, the only specific event is the claim
made by the affected party. Thus, it does not seem correct that the fact that the
affected by the conduct of the entity is a single person, can be estimated as
exponent of less culpability or unlawfulness of their conduct or appreciate
Nor is the local scope of the infringement a mitigating factor. The conduct contrary to
standard is the result of an action model through which EDP develops its
activity and that it continues to maintain since, in its opinion, it is adjusted to Law,
no matter how obvious the breach of the principles of legality and
proactive responsibility.

Nor can the circumstance
described in article 76.2.c) of the LOPDGDD, by reference to article 832.k of the
RGPD: “The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infraction”.

Regarding this issue, the National High Court, Contentious Chamber
Administrative, in its SAN of 04/17/2018 (Rec. 254/2017) rejected the claim of the
plaintiff, sanctioned by the AEPD, to admit as a mitigating factor the
Article 45.5.e) LOPD due to lack of benefits. The third legal basis of
the SAN says: “Regarding the absence of benefits, we can only reiterate what
argued by the appealed resolution, regarding what is relevant is that the
Abanca's action was motivated by the search for economic benefit, for
so the fact that it was not finally obtained cannot serve as a

27/30

basis for a mitigation of culpability or unlawfulness of their conduct. that has
been also the spirit of the SAN of 03/31/2017.

C) The concurrence, as aggravating circumstances, of the circumstances
following:

- The duration of the illegitimate treatment of the claimant's data carried out by
EDP. The documentation that makes up the file reveals that the treatment began on
05/17/2018 (Proven fact 6) and was maintained, at least, until 11/15/2018; that is,
for almost five months. For this purpose, the letter that EDP sent
to the claimant, dated 11/15/2018, in response to the informative request of the
AEPD -Proven fact 9- in which it is shown that it continues to process the data of the
affected since it considers that the claimant had signed a contract with it through
of Mrs. B.B.B., (article 83.2.a, of the RGPD)

- The business volume or activity figure of the entity (article 83.2.a, of the
GDPR) We are in the presence of a large company in the energy sector. The volume
global annual total for the financial year 2017 amounted to 1,297,962,000 euros,
(article 83.2.a of the RGPD)

- Article 83.2.f) of the RGPD mentions “the degree of cooperation with the
control authority in order to remedy the infraction and mitigate the possible
Adverse effects". Circumstance that also operates as an aggravating circumstance.
Although it is true that EDP responded to information requests from this Agency
It is also that, despite the fact that it could not prove the legality of the data processing
of the claimant, since he did not have any document showing that the third party
who intervened in the contracting acted on behalf of the owner of the data -it is
Moreover, it is documented through the recordings sent to the Agency that the
alleged representative of the claimant did not even verify his identity by contrasting it
with an official document but relied on a handwritten note provided by
who had identified himself with the data of the affected person - decided to continue treating the
data of the affected party, associated with an electricity supply contract, after the
AEPD made the information request as shown in the letter
dated 11/15/2018 addressed to the claimant.

- The scope of the treatment (article 83.2.a, RGPD) since the personal data
of the complainant who have been processed by EDP without legitimacy to do so
there were several: the name and two surnames, NIF, home address and telephone number
mobile.

- The defendant has acted with a very serious lack of diligence, (article
83.2.b, of the RGPD). We are not only facing a lack of diligence at the moment
to link the claimant's data to an electricity contract under the
consent granted by the person who claimed to act on their behalf. How I know
detailed in the preceding Foundations, EDP has shown that it absolutely lacks
of an action protocol that contemplated the need to collect some
document that would prove the representation that is said to hold in the
telematic contracts in which the person who contacts the entity claims to be involved
on behalf of another person.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

- The obvious link between EDP's business activity and the processing
of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD in relation
with article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)

SAW

In accordance with articles 58.2 and 83.2 of the RGPD, previously transcribed,
the control authorities may impose, in addition to the sanction of a fine,
any of the corrective measures or sanctions contemplated in letters a) to h) and j)
of section 2 of article 58 of the aforementioned RGPD.

In the present case, taking into account that the claim -regarding the
processing of personal data collected in telematic contracts in which
a third party intervenes and declares to hold the representation of the owner of the data and
represented - completely lacks a protocol of action respectful of the
obligations imposed by the RGPD, it is agreed, under article 58.2. d) of
GDPR, order EDP to incorporate the contracting protocol that it has implemented
for contracting through a representative, all the changes that allow
be in a position to prove before this Agency that the represented party, and owner of the
data, has authorized such representation and has conferred it in favor of the person who
intervenes in the legal business. The period in which you must have implemented the
new measures will be one month computed from the date on which the resolution in
the one that so agrees is executive.

In line with the above, article 83.6 RGPD must be brought up, which
establishes: “Failure to comply with the resolutions of the control authority in accordance with the
article 58, section 2, will be sanctioned in accordance with section 2 of this article
with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a
company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U., with NIF A33543547, for a
infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine
of 75,000 euros (seventy-five thousand euros).

SECOND: Under article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, ORDER EDP ENERGÍA,
S.A.U., with NIF A33543547, that ADJUSTS its telematic contracting protocols
to THE PROVISIONS of the RGPD regarding the LEGALITY OF THE PROCESSING, in
particular in the contracts made THROUGH A REPRESENTATIVE, in the
that as data controller must be able to prove both the
reality of the representation granted by the owner of the data and represented as
his identity.
