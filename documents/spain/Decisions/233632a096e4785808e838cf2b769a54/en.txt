SECOND: In view of the facts denounced in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I,
Second section, of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12 of Protection of Personal Data and

THIRD: On 10/2/2020, a response was received from the Consultancy, stating:

- “Understands that the reported entity is the Community of Neighbors ***COMUNIDAD.1 and
not ASESORIA LISBOA” but answers on behalf of the latter since that is how it has been
required. They consider that "he has no responsibility whatsoever in the reported facts,
among other things because it does not have access to the car park or any rights over the
property"

“The Advisory never publishes the accounts of the Communities it manages on the boards
of ads. The accounts are sent to the owners directly, all members of the
Community, who are informed about the data allowed by the Property Law
Horizontal".

In the parking buildings, being a special community (you cannot drop
the accounts) a copy of the same is left to the Concierges so that they can be provided to the
owners who request them, only to the owners, members of the Community. I never know
they put on the boards.

If this has happened on a specific occasion, it will be a mistake by a Concierge,
possibly unusual in service. “In any case, neither the entity I represent nor the
undersigned have a key to the boards so they cannot be responsible for their
publication”, it is understood that accidental by mistake of an employee, if it has really been
come to produce this fact.

After receiving the request, he has contacted the Concierges (and the
maintenance company that has hired them) to remember the protocol. They have
reviewed the boards and there are no published accounts. The concierges ensure that
they have always followed the protocol and have never published them.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The RGPD indicates in its article 1.2. “This Regulation protects the rights and
fundamental freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to
Protection of personal data"

It is about protecting privacy with regard to the processing of data processed in
a document whose responsible, the claimed, must not expose to third parties who are not
part of the community and that was displayed on a board accessible to anyone
circulate around the environment.

For the purposes of this Regulation, Article 4 defines: "personal data" means any
information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); I know
An identifiable natural person is considered to be any person whose identity can be determined,
directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a
name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one
or various elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychic,
economic, cultural or social of that person.

In this case, the improvement of the conduct that could lead to the
imputation to the defendant, given that the evidence provided is not sufficient to
be able to impute the facts to the defendant.
The Constitutional Court has repeatedly declared that Administrative Law
Sanctioning are applicable, with some nuances but without exceptions, the
inspiring principles of the penal order, being clear the full virtuality of the
principles of presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence must apply without
exceptions in the sanctioning system and must be respected in the imposition of
any sanctions, since the exercise of ius puniendi in its various manifestations
is conditioned to the game of proof and to a contradictory procedure in which
can defend their own positions. In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in
Judgment 76/1990 considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails "that
the sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the one who accuses, without anyone
is obliged to prove his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of
the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body, must be translated
in an acquittal statement. According to this approach, the article
Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of 1/10 of the Law on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector,
indicates: "1. They may only be sanctioned for acts constituting an infraction.

by way of intent or fault.
 For this reason, the presumption of innocence of the person claimed must prevail in the absence of
accreditation of the facts likely to integrate the imputed rates.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,
