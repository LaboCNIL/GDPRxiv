I required the tenant to remove it or focus on the premises and that the recorded
delete, ignoring the request. After this incident I took photos of the

my rights when recording myself on public roads. In addition, it does not have the relevant
signaling (only red sticker without indicating who to claim) and according to
information collected by a neighbor, has been installed by an unauthorized professional
thereto. I understand that camera will not be legally registered or have the
appropriate permissions. I provide the photos I took of the location of the camera, in the

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The defendant is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation of article
5.1.c) of the RGPD, which states that personal data will be “adequate, relevant and
limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”)”.

This infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
b) the rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22; […].”

III

The art. 77 section 5 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (LPACAP, hereinafter),
provides the following: “The documents formalized by the officials to whom the
recognizes the condition of authority and in which, observing the legal requirements
corresponding the facts verified by those are gathered will prove of
unless proven otherwise”. The Security Forces and Bodies
displaced to the scene of the events confirm the presence of the system.

IV

In the present case, it is appropriate to analyze the presumed illegality of the installation of a
 Bar “***BAR.1”, located on the street
video surveillance camera placed in the
***ADDRESS.1, ***TOWN.1, ***PROVINCE.1.

The proven facts show the existence of a camera installed in the
inside the premises that, according to the report provided by the Local Police of the
locality, it does not capture public roads, it only collects images of people who
located inside the private space of the establishment.

v

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
themselves of the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a concrete and determined fact, which obliges in any case to
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of the LPACAP, which establishes that:

"two. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible will have the following rights:

5/5

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is proven.”

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
of April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the
sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.”

SAW

Based on the foregoing, it cannot be concluded that the devices subject to the
claim capture images outside the premises where it is installed, so that it does not
it is possible to speak of infringing conduct within the scope of the regulatory framework
of data protection, reason for which we proceed to the File of this
process.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure as there is no
accredited administrative infraction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to B.B.B. with NIF ***NIF.1.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month from
counting from the day following the notification of this resolution or directly
contentious-administrative appeal before the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the
National Court, in accordance with the provisions of article 25 and section 5 of
the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the
