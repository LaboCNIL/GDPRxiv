digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), being notified on 06/24/2019 and
06/21/2019, respectively.

On 07/19/2019, this Agency received a letter from the Protection Delegate of
Data of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party through which it sends the answer of the
Spanish Socialist Workers Party and B.B.B. to transfer.

a) Response of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party:

"[…]  FIRST. - On the specification of the causes that have motivated the
incident that gave rise to the claim

The claimant D. AAA, in his brief bases the same in that the past 3 of
April, through the instant messaging application WhatsApp, it was sent
photographs containing documents containing personal data
(name and surnames, DNI and address) of different people. These documents were
specifically, the result of the composition of the electoral tables of the municipality
of ***LOCALIDAD.1 (Pontevedra) for the General Elections of 2019, whose
lottery was held that same day in said consistory. As such
photographs were sent from the telephone number ***TELÉFONO.2, attributed to
D. B.B.B., and were received at the telephone number ***TELEPHONE.1, which
corresponds to the local police of ***LOCALIDAD.1

D. B.B.B., was at the time, April 3, a member of the Municipal Corporation of
***LOCALIDAD.1, as Councilor of the Socialist Municipal Group, and today currently
Alderman of the Municipality, when concurring in the lists of the PSOE to the municipal elections
as the head of the list. D. A.A.A., it was on April 3, Mayor of the municipality of
***LOCALIDAD.1, and currently, Councilor of the City Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1 of the
Municipal Group of the PP, when concurring in the lists of this political party as head
list for municipal elections.

After requesting from this Data Protection Delegate information on the
facts to D. B.B.B., he informs us that after knowing as Councilman the
documentation on the polling stations for the holding of elections on 3
of April that he realized to the Plenary, from his personal mobile phone, he sent the
same, to the number in your phonebook that corresponds to the public telephone of the police
local, for the purpose of informing about the results of the public draw of the tables
electoral.

From this, we conclude that, D. B.B.B., having had access to the documentation
indicated and to which he was entitled in accordance with art. 14 of RD 2568/1986, of
Regulation of Organization, Functioning and Legal Regime of the Entities

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

3/11

Local, for the development of its functions, understood that that information to the
having carried out a public draw could be of interest to the Local Police, one
of the security forces responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the
electoral journey; it turns out, therefore, that this was his only interest at the time of the
sending the documentation, without it being their intention to divulge the personal data
of the neighbors.

SECOND. - On the origin of the data subject to treatment, the legal basis on which
the processing of the claimant's data is substantiated

From the documentation we have, we understand that the origin of the object data
treatment is access to them as a result of the character of Councilor of
D. B.B.B., on the basis of art. 14 of RD 2568/1986, and the municipal electoral roll
for the realization of the draw that configures the electoral tables, in accordance with the
LOREG.

The treatment is carried out by D. B.B.B., on its consideration that the draw has a
public nature, in accordance with the provisions of article 26.2 of the LOREG, and that the
information as it has been provided can be made known to the telephone that
sent by the Local Police of ***LOCALIDAD.1, for information purposes.

From the foregoing, it is concluded that this political organization does not carry out
treatment of any data for which it was responsible, and that neither, in relation to the
facts had any intervention, nor were media or data used
responsibility of this organization.

Without prejudice, that in any case there is no responsibility of this organization
as indicated, and according to the best criteria of this Spanish Data Protection Agency,
D.B.B.B's performance we understand that it is protected by the mentioned norm
above, as well as the rights inherent to the Councilors for the exercise of
their functions in local corporations, however, it is true that, according to the
current regulation on data protection rights, the General Regulation
of Data Protection, the principle of minimum data should have been applied, to
scrupulously respect the rights of citizens, and especially the
personal data, so the information that is transferred to the Councillors,
should not include more than those that are necessary to ensure the development of the
lottery process in accordance with the LOREG – check that they are people
included in the corresponding electoral census -, therefore, not including the data of
home, especially.

SECOND [Sic.]. - Of the accredited facts and the concurrent circumstances

The complainant, D. A.A.A., alleges that the data was distributed through “a list
of distribution” and that “although the number of recipients is unknown,
He estimates there were at least 500.”

Well, from the documents transferred, such documents cannot be considered
subjective manifestations, since the transferred photographs correspond to the reception
of communication in "a mobile", without mention of any distribution list, and the
report accompanied by the Municipal Police only refers to the reception in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

4/11

said mobile, without referring to other mobiles or any distribution list. and to greater
abundance, without stating, neither through this Agency, nor directly to this
Data Protection Delegate, any complaint from other people who had
received such documentation.

Therefore, we must consider that only that information was sent to the
telephone number ***TELÉFONO.1, public number belonging to the Local Police
of *** LOCATION.1 (image is attached), from the personal number of D. B.B.B.

On the other hand, it must be considered that the events occur in full development of the
electoral processes, which could be insignificant in another situation, but we must be
aware that the scene where the events took place was that of some
imminent general elections and other European, regional and local elections; And how much
the claimant as against whom the claim is directed, are the representatives
maximum of two political parties that concur to the electoral processes in the
Municipality, which after the May 26 elections, have exchanged their positions in
the local corporation. […]

THIRD. [Sic.]- Regarding the performance of D. B.B.B., as Councilor of the Municipality
of ***LOCATION.1.

In any case, we insist on the terminal and its use corresponds personally to
D. B.B.B., member of the Municipal Socialist Group of the City Council of
***LOCATION.1, which for this shipment did not use a medium or a database
responsibility of the PSOE, and, without this organization, had been
transferred to any electoral or organic responsible instruction in this sense on
electoral processes.

With this, we come to expose that the position of councilor, and his responsibility as such
is inherent to the person who has been democratically elected by elections,
with the protection granted by the fundamental right of article 23.2 of the
Spanish Constitution, since it guarantees that those who have accessed them [at
office of councilor] remain in them without illegitimate disturbances (STS
1011/2006, of January 23). That is, the right to participate in public affairs
is recognized in favor of citizens, not political parties, since "they are
the candidates and not the political party who, regardless of the system
electoral, they receive the representative mandate” (STC 5/1983, of February 4).

In the same way, and as this Agency has come to understand, it is understandable that
a political organization, in this case the PSOE, cannot be held responsible for
the acts carried out by the members of the municipal corporations to the extent
that the Municipal Groups are constituted within the Administrations
Public and, as we have just examined, their actions obey the functions
purchased at your expense. […]”

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of article 5.1.f)
of the RGPD, which states that "personal data will be" treated in such a way that it is
ensure adequate security, including protection against unauthorized processing
authorized or unlawful and against loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the
application of appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and
confidentiality”)”.

The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD and is qualified as having the
Next:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; […]”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, the infraction indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. […]”

IV

The present sanctioning procedure brings its cause in the possible illegality of the
communication made by the respondent on April 3, 2019 to the agent of the
Local Police (through a WhatsApp message from his personal mobile) of some
images containing the statements resulting from the electoral lottery held on
same day for the determination of the people who would integrate the tables
elections in the general elections to be held on April 28, 2019. In these

Estadillos included the personal data mentioned in the proven fact
fourth.

Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD establishes the principle of confidentiality as one of the
basic principles that must be observed in all processing of personal data.
Regarding this obligation, Considering 39 of the same law provides that "[...] the
data must be treated in a way that guarantees that it guarantees security and
appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access
or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment”. In
our system, likewise, this issue is highlighted by article 5 of the
LOPDGDD in a complementary manner to the duty of professional secrecy. the literal tenor
of this article is as follows:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all
people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of
confidentiality referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the
duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained even
when the relationship of the obligor with the person in charge or in charge of the
treatment".

Based on the foregoing, it can be considered, in accordance with the proven facts,
that even when the respondent had knowledge and legitimate access to those statements
because these were part of the documentation related to the electoral lottery that
was communicated to the plenary session of the City Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1 and he was part of the
himself as a councilman, he did not act with due diligence in order to guarantee the
due confidentiality of the personal data contained in the aforementioned
documentation, making, instead, a communication of the same. The fact of
that this communication be made to another municipal instance (Local Police) with
informative purpose since, in accordance with what was declared by the defendant in
the answer to the transfer of the claim, said instance is in charge of
deliver the notifications of the draw, it cannot imply a validation of your
performance. It is necessary to point out at this point that, by virtue of the LOREG, it is at
City Council as the entity in charge of the formation of the electoral tables and their
subsequent communication to the designated persons, functions to be carried out
according to its operating system.

As already stated in the agreement to initiate this proceeding, no
considers for sanctioning purposes the statements made by the claimant
about alleged dissemination of information to a distribution list through the
Messaging application reviewed, as it was not accredited.

v

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, is established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among
they have the power to sanction with a warning -article 58.2 b)-, the

power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD
-article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the controller or processor
that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period -article 58. 2
d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the RGPD, the aforementioned Regulation
has in its art. 58.2 b) the possibility of sanctioning with a warning, in relation
with what is stated in Considering 148:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

SAW

In the present case, when deciding the sanction to be imposed, they have taken into account
count the following items,

 That it is a natural person whose main activity is not linked to the
treatment of personal data.

 That there is no recidivism, because there is no record of the commission of infractions
previous.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions to be imposed for the infractions whose existence has
accredited, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with DNI ***NIF.1, for an infraction of article 5.1.f)
