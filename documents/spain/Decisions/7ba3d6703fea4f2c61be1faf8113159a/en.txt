FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

Yo

Beforehand, it is necessary to resolve the allegation presented by the

representation of the defendant, based on the existence of a criminal preliminary ruling.

II

It is stated that having had knowledge that certain facts that could
be constitutive of an alleged crime of fraud typified in article 248 and
following the Penal Code, a complaint has been filed with the national police,
which would entail the declaration of the suspension of the present procedure before the
concurrence of a possible criminal infraction for false documentation, impersonation of
personality and scam. In particular, and by virtue of the complaint filed by the
claimant, Avon has become aware that its process may have been misrepresented
contracting using a third party fraudulently the identity of the
complainant.

It should be noted that art. 77.4 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (LPACAP): “In
sanctioning procedures, the facts declared proven by
firm criminal judicial resolutions will bind the Public Administrations
regarding the sanctioning procedures that substantiate”. However, even though
there were prior criminal proceedings in process, which do not appear, it must be indicated,
that there is no triple identity necessary to apply article 77 of the LPACAP, (from

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/13

subject, fact and foundation), between the administrative infraction that is valued and the
possible infraction or criminal infractions that could derive from the alleged
Preliminary proceedings carried out by a jurisdictional body. This, because the subject
offender it is obvious that it would not be the same -regarding infractions of the LOPD the
responsible is the XFERA, while the criminal responsible for a possible crime of
usurpation of personality or fraud would be the third party who had passed himself off as the
claimant. Nor would the legal basis be the same: while the legal right
protected by the LOPDGDD is the fundamental right to data protection
personal, the legal right that is protected in criminal types whose commission
would investigate, if necessary, the Investigating Court would be the marital status, the
heritage etc

In this sense, the Judgment of the National High Court of
04/27/2012 (rec. 78/2010), in whose second Legal Basis the Court
pronounces in the following terms in response to the appellant's allegation that the AEPD
has violated article 7 of the R.D. 1398/1993 (rule that was in force until the
entry into force of the LPACAP): “In this sense, Art. 7 of the Royal Decree
1398/1993, of August 4, of the procedure for the exercise of the power
sanctioning, it only foresees the suspension of the administrative procedure
when the effective and real existence of a criminal proceeding is verified, if
considers that there is identity of subject, fact and basis of law between the
administrative infraction and criminal infraction that may correspond.

However, and for the concurrence of a criminal preliminary ruling, it is required
that it directly conditions the decision to be taken or that it is
essential to solve, budgets that do not concur in the case examined,
in which there is a separation between the facts for which it is sanctioned in the
resolution now appealed and those that the appellant invokes as possible illicit
penalties. Thus, and even if it had been initiated, in the present case, and due to the facts
now controversial, also criminal proceedings against the distribution company,
The truth is that both the sanctioning conduct and the protected legal interest are
different in both ways (contentious-administrative and criminal). In the criminal field, the
a protected legal asset is a possible documentary forgery and fraud, and in the
administrative, on the other hand, the power to dispose of your personal data by
of its owner, so such objection of the defendant must be rejected”.

In consideration of the foregoing, the question raised by the

representation of XFERA and must be rejected.

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of legality, loyalty and
transparency, noting:

III

"1. The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("legality, loyalty and transparency");

On the other hand, article 6, Legality of the treatment, of the RGPD establishes that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/13

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

Article 7 of the RGPD, Conditions for consent, states that:

"1. When the treatment is based on the consent of the interested party, the
responsible must be able to demonstrate that he consented to the treatment of his
personal information.

2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a declaration
writing that also refers to other matters, the request for consent will be
presented in such a way as to be clearly distinguishable from other matters, in a manner
intelligible and easily accessible and using clear and simple language. It will not be binding
any part of the declaration that constitutes an infringement of these Regulations.

3. The interested party shall have the right to withdraw their consent at any
moment. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment
based on consent prior to withdrawal. Before giving your consent, the
Interested party will be informed of this. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

4. In assessing whether consent has been freely given, account will be taken
to the greatest extent possible whether, among other things, the execution of a
contract, including the provision of a service, is subject to the consent of the
processing of personal data that is not necessary for the execution of said
contract".

And article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in section 11, states that:

“11) «consent of the interested party»: any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him”.

Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected party,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), indicates
that:

"1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal by which he accepts, either through a

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/13

declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that
concern.

2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent
of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to state
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the affected party consenting to the
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship”.

The defendant is attributed the violation of article 6 of the RGPD; of
In accordance with the facts declared proven, it is proven that the claimed
I carry out the modification of the data contained in the subscribed telephone contract
with the claimant, linking them to the personal data of a third party who had nothing
to do with it without your consent.

In accordance with what was stated above, the processing of personal data
requires the existence of a legal basis that legitimizes it, such as the consent of the
interested party validly lent.

IV

From the documentation in the file it is evident that XFERA
violated article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, since the aforementioned entity carried out a treatment
of the personal data of the claimant materialized in the alteration of the
conditions and personal data of the claimant contained in the contract that
unía, associating your NIF and your bank details to the name, surnames and address
corresponding to a third party; that both the mobile telephone line and the ADSL
contracted stopped working as of the aforementioned modifications and that before the
claim filed by the claimant before XFERA was classified as fraud for
your study.

The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court, in
similar assumptions has considered that when the owner of the data denies the
consent in the processing of your data corresponds the burden of proof to
who affirms its existence, and the data controller must collect and
keep the necessary documentation to prove the consent of the holder. A) Yes,
the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Fourth Law Basis.

The claimant has provided a copy of the contract signed with the company
date 09/08/2016 where there is no change of owner or data of the previous owner, as well as
the invoices before and after the aforementioned modification, in the first one their
address and direct debit data linked to your personal data
personal while in the second your personal data has been modified
including those of a third party unrelated to it and as a form of payment there is direct debit
bank linking the third party as the owner of the same account that is the owner of the
claimant.

It should be noted that respect for the principle of legality of the data requires that
accredited evidence that the owner of the data consented to the processing of the data of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/13

personal character and display a reasonable diligence essential to prove
that end. Failure to act in this way would result in emptying the content of the principle of
legality.

In this sense, XFERA in writing of 05/10/2018 has provided capture of
screen related to the processing of incidents for identity theft,
incidence number ***INCIDENCIA.4 and creation date of 11/11/2018, without
solve. At the bottom there is the following comment: “please verify, attached
the call where the operator calls the client to do technology migration but
despite the fact that the client gives other different data, the operator, instead of
verify/contrast, makes mysim change of address, name directly”.

 
In addition, it should be noted that despite the information requirement of the
Agency, the respondent did not provide a response to the questions raised, such as the
by which the alleged impersonation occurred and the procedure used to
accredit the personality, limiting itself to pointing out that the causes that caused the
incidence could not be exposed by not knowing what happened.

v

The infraction that is attributed to the claimed one is typified in the
article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, which considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount.

The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Offenses, states for prescription purposes
that: "The acts and behaviors referred to in the
sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that
are contrary to this organic law.

And in its article 72, it considers for prescription purposes, which are: "Infringements

considered very serious:

1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
particularly the following:

(…)
b) The treatment of personal personal data without the concurrence of any of the
the conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

(…)”

In accordance with the facts considered proven, the defendant violated
Article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, by illegally processing the personal data of the
claimant without his consent being recorded, modifying the conditions and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/13

personal data contained in the contract that linked them, associating their NIF and data
bank accounts to the name, surnames and address corresponding to a third party, an infraction that
is typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and that for prescription purposes is
determined in article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD.

In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed,
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which
point out:

SAW

"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated
in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
applied under articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such case,

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms

sedeagpd.gob.es

11/13

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.
b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatments
of personal data.
c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the
commission of the offence.

h) The submission by the person in charge or person in charge, with
voluntary, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any
interested."

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to
impose in the present case for the infringement typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD of
for which XFERA is held responsible, in an initial assessment, concurrent
the following factors:

The merely local scope of the treatment carried out by the entity
claimed, since it is a single treatment carried out without consent in
the supply contract that bound them.

Only one person has been affected by the offending conduct.

The damage caused to the claimant by having to file a claim
before the entity and report to the police and, furthermore, according to their own
manifestations the duration of the infraction since on the date of the presentation of the
claim at the Agency continued without landline or Internet connection.

The way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

the extent to which this has been through the claim of the affected party.

The entity claimed has not specified the measures implemented in order to
prevent similar incidents from occurring in order to avoid incidents such as the
occurred by altering the contractual data of its owner without consent, etc.

There is no evidence that the entity had acted maliciously, although

a rather careless performance is observed.

The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal data because in its usual activity it processes customer data such as
of third parties.

Article 83 of the RGPD and 76 of the LOPDGDD impose a penalty of 60,000 euros
for which XFERA must respond.

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
