-“Given the suspicion that they were fictitious incapacities, especially the
first from the Penitentiary Center was asked to specify more
specific to the events that occurred

“They consider that there are specific legal grounds to take into account
account to prevent the Data Protection regulations from being used in fraud
of law and this in the face of the risk of turning into non-controllable and opaque for the
administration, absences from the service of officials.

EIGHTH: Allegations are received from the respondent that, in addition to reiterating what
manifested indicates:

1 On the considerations noted in the proposal of the way in which they were
acting after the initial agreement regarding the proof of absence from working hours
states that the General Secretariat of Penitentiary Institutions does not require its
workers in a case like the one at hand, which in general in all
proof of punctual and occasional attendance that they present, state the
diagnosis in the case at hand lies in the need felt by the
prison administration to be able to adopt a plus of guarantees in positions of
work that concerns the prison of Arrecife Lanzarote, which is a
establishment with a high statistical frequency of sick leave that does not reach
become Temporary Disability for not exceeding 4 days but which usually
coincide with the days on which work should be done and that coincide before or after
behind with other days off or vacations, which generates an overexertion in the
other colleagues reducing the attention that should be given to the population
recluse

2) To achieve a “proportionate resolution” they specifically consider the
following allegations:

a) Although they recognize that the express request for a medical diagnosis to
may imply access from the point of view of the regulations in
Data Protection considers it necessary to contextualize it in the field
precise labor conflict in which it occurs. The high rate of
absenteeism that occurs in the penitentiary center facilitated by “parties
virtually opaque doctors for penitentiary administration”.

b) There has not been an effective injury to the fundamental right to
privacy of the interested party to the extent that despite having been
requested the data or more data related to their situation in no case

legal obligation that implies that in medical proof of absence from work due to
sickness of up to three days, when medical leave is not issued,

as documentation attached by the claimant, as annex 4, in which, in addition to
not respond to the specific allegations of the claimant, considering that he has not
provided the correction of the required medical part, "sends the aforementioned resolution to the
Authorization Office, in order to make the proportional deduction of

THE LODGDD adds in its article 9.2:

"two. The data processing contemplated in letters g), h) and i) of article 9.2

In principle, the prohibition of processing personal data governs

related to health, so the exceptions should be interpreted restrictively.

The use of health data is prohibited, except with the consent

expressed by the affected party or if any of the circumstances of article 9.2 b) and ss.

In this sense, for the case at hand, intended for the purpose of managing
personnel of the Center in which the claimed person renders services, there is no cause for
that the aforementioned health diagnoses of the processes by which
is treated for the preparation of a medical certificate, for times that do not imply sick leave

The RESOLUTION of the Secretary of State for Public Administration of
02/28/2019 (11.4 to .6), only allows what its literal states, "justify in a
immediate concurrence of the cause of disease. , and considering the range
normative and the framework that regulates, it does not follow that it has to be interpreted as

The RGPD establishes legitimizing bases for the treatment of data

involve the processing of personal data, the data controller must
always take time to consider what would be the appropriate legal ground for the
planned treatment.

RESOLUTION and the Instruction, which are associated with articles 6 c) and 6 e) of the RGPD.

Although it is not necessary for both to be present, it is sufficient that one be

“e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

In this case, the data controller exercises public powers in
regarding the custody of persons deprived of liberty, their rights and
freedoms. The regulations governing officials in penitentiary centers

the Instruction of the CCAA of Madrid Other examples on permits or licenses are
contained in the aforementioned instruction, which although referred to the LOPD, is applicable
by analogy since what is intended is to adapt the data to the needs
minimum and precise to justify the lack of attendance.

Given that the claimed party has approved and in operation some
instructions that it applies, demanding data processing, means for the
justification for absence from work, and that has been applied to the claimant
with consequences on their rights, and that is not considered in accordance with the regulations
of data protection, it is estimated that the facts constitute an infringement,
attributable to the claimed, for violation of the principle established in article 5.1.c)
of the GDPR:

"1. The personal data will be:

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed (“data minimization”)”.

For our constitutional jurisprudence, if the right to privacy acts
as a barrier against interference or meddling by others (STC 142/1993, of 22/04),
The right to data protection «consists of a power of disposition and control
on personal data» (SSTC 290 and 292/2000, of 11/30); if the right to
privacy prohibits the knowledge by third parties of certain aspects of the person
(intimate aspects or aspects related to their private and family life), the right to protection of
data provides guarantees of disposal and control regarding personal data that
may or may not belong to the sphere of intimacy and may be subject to
knowledge and management by others; If the right to privacy is the right to
abstention of others with respect to our personal sphere, the right to the protection of
data implies above all self-determination on our data.

In this case, the medical data is generated by and for the patient, and has

infringement.

It means that the personnel departments can treat the data of autho-

Apart from detecting the situation as soon as possible, implementing measures, this disruption
in the service does not allow interference in the rights of employees, being able to
coordinate existing regulations with other complementary measures.

For the justification of absence due to medical consultation, the mere
mention of the doctor expressing date and time and generic allusion, without going into
diagnoses, always remembering that the personal data reflected in the
supporting documents must be adequate, relevant and not excessive. To facilitate the
respect and compliance with said adequacy, the following is valued:

1) It is not advisable to use clinical or administrative documents that
may be designed for use for purposes other than the
issuance of supporting documents, by the mere fact of containing them, with
general, direct or indirect references to the specific health problem of the
patient or user.

two)

  In the issuance of supporting documents for the sick worker himself, no
will consider appropriate the inclusion in the supporting document, among other possible
data, of those related to the diagnosis, test performed or name of the
service that treated the patient. For these purposes, the receipt issued
should be limited to verifying that there is a health problem that is the cause
of the incapacity for work in which the patient or user finds himself.

It is also considered adjusted to data protection regulations, which
if the doctor considers it convenient, in case of impossibility of
assistance on successive days, without issuing medical leave, can
indicate the necessary days of rest, with the considerations before
cited.

3) In the medical consultation part, it could only be required that the
times of the appointment of the consultation, entry and exit, which is appropriate
and proportional to justify that interruption of service.

The infringement of article 5.1c) of the RGPD refers to article 83.5.a) of the

The distinction between data controller and employee is derived from the GDPR.
