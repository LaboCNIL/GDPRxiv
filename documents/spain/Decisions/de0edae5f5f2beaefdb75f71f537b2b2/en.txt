Law 39/2015, of 1/10, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP).

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016 regarding the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter GDPR); recognizes each authority of
control, and as established in art. 47 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12, of
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter
LOPDGDD), the director of the AEPD is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

II

Law 39/2015, of 1/10, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP), points out and differentiates the regime of the
individual notifications to the interested parties, of the publication of administrative acts
that will be published when so established by the regulations of
each procedure or when advised by reasons of public interest appreciated by
the competent body.

Article 44.1 of the LPACAP indicates: “When those interested in a
procedure are unknown, the place of notification is ignored or,
attempted this, it had not been possible to practice, the notification will be made by means of a
announcement published in the «Official State Gazette».

On the other hand, article 40.2 of the same rule states: "Any notification
must be completed within a period of ten days from the date on which the act
has been issued, and must contain the full text of the resolution, indicating
www.aepd.es

of whether or not it puts an end to the administrative procedure, the expression of the resources that proceed,
where appropriate, administratively and judicially, the body before which they would have to
be submitted and the term to file them, notwithstanding that the interested parties may
exercise, where appropriate, any other that they deem appropriate.”

Meanwhile, article 45 of the same law, on the publication of acts
administrative, indicates that it will be done, "when so established by the rules
regulations of each procedure or when advised by reasons of public interest
appreciated by the competent body” that do not concur in this claim,
then the publication would proceed when:

- the act is not addressed to an indeterminate plurality of people

(article 45.1.a).

- It is not a selective procedure or competitive concurrence of any

Type.

publication its effects.

. Article 46 of the LPCAP adds a common denominator applicable to both

notifications as well as publications, of the following tenor:

“If the competent body appreciates that the notification by means of announcements or
the publication of an act harms rights or legitimate interests, it will be limited to publishing
in the corresponding Official Gazette a brief indication of the content of the act and of the
place where the interested parties may appear, within the period established, to
knowledge of the full content of the aforementioned act and proof of such
knowledge."

Without discussing whether or not there is a basis for going to notify through
bulletin for understanding the notification attempt process well, you must
indicate that in any case, therefore, advertisements to be published in the BOE are distinguished,
corresponds to the interested parties, of publications of administrative acts that can
be also in the BOE.

Regarding the effects of the administrative act, article 39.2 of the LPACAP
indicates: "The effectiveness will be delayed when required by the content of the act or is
subject to its notification, publication or superior approval.”, distinguishing from
new the regime of ordinary notification, or publication.

The LPCAP indicates:

article 13.h):” Rights of people in their relations with

Public administrations.

“To the protection of personal data, and in particular to the security and
confidentiality of the data contained in the files, systems and applications of
Public Administrations.”

Article 40.5 of the LOPD, within the title notifications, indicates: "The
Public Administrations may adopt the measures they deem necessary

7/11

for the protection of personal data contained in resolutions and acts
administrative, when they have more than one interested party as addressees.”

Although it should be noted that article 40 of Law 39/2015 establishes that the
notification of resolutions and administrative acts to the interested parties to whom
affects must contain the full text of the resolution, it must be understood in light of the
article 46, to preserve privacy and given the purpose of the announcement, which as
general rule an individual notification through an edict announcement to an interested party
it does not have to contain the complete text of the same . Exposure of your data, the matter
on which it deals is not proportional to the intended purpose, exceeding the
purpose, there being means for not fully indicating such references as
happens in the present case.

In this case, the respondent proceeded to notify an act
singular administrative, which exclusively affects the claimant, being published in a
official newspaper that can be consulted by anyone. The excess in the publication
contain the integrity of the same, disclosing your personal data,
occurred with the question of the return of undue income or that ceased in the
service, the date, or that he was on medical leave supposes a violation of the RGPD.

III

In accordance with the principles of proportionality and necessity, it is considered that
the principle of data minimization contained in the article has been violated
5.1.c) of the RGPD with the tenor:

"1. The personal data will be:

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for those who are treated”

This infraction is referred to in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which indicates:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

This infraction is included in the LOPDGDD, article 72.1.a) that qualifies it as

very serious with the following tenor:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6

sedeagpd.gob.es

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: "Each supervisory authority

shall have all of the following corrective powers listed below:

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
this Regulation;

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period of time.

Article 83.7 of the RGPD adds: "each Member State may establish
rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines can be imposed on
public authorities and bodies established in that Member State.

Article 77 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

1. The regime established in this article will apply to the treatment of

those who are responsible or in charge:

c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the communities

autonomous and the entities that make up the Local Administration.

2. When those responsible or in charge listed in section 1 committed
any of the infractions referred to in articles 72 to 74 of this law
organic, the data protection authority that is competent will dictate
resolution sanctioning them with a warning. The resolution will establish
also the measures that should be adopted to stop the behavior or correct it.
the effects of the infraction that had been committed.

IV

The data minimization design has been embodied in the LOPDGDD, which in
its “Seventh additional provision: on Identification of the interested parties in the
notifications through announcements and publications of administrative acts” indicates:
1. When it is necessary to publish an administrative act that contains
personal data of the affected party, it will be identified by its name and
surnames, adding four random numerical figures of the national document of
identity, foreign identity number, passport or equivalent document.
When the publication refers to a plurality of affected these random figures
they should alternate.

When it comes to notification through advertisements, particularly in the
assumptions referred to in article 44 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, will be identified
to the affected party exclusively by means of the complete number of his national document
identity card, foreign identity number, passport or equivalent document.
When the affected party lacks any of the documents mentioned in the

9/11

two preceding paragraphs, the affected party will be identified only by name and
surnames. In no case should the name and surnames be published together
with the complete number of the national identity document, identity number of
foreigner, passport or equivalent document.

2. In order to prevent risks for victims of gender violence, the Government
will promote the development of a collaboration protocol that defines procedures
insurance of publication and notification of administrative acts, with the participation of
the bodies with competence in the matter.”

The provision has been the subject of a provisional recommendation until
the moment in which the governing bodies and public administrations
authorities approve provisions for the application of the aforementioned Provision
Additional seventh. So objective is to try to prevent the adoption of different formulas
in application of the aforementioned provision may give rise to the publication of figures
numerical identification documents in different positions in each case,
allowing the complete recomposition of said documents.

For your interest, the aforementioned recommendation of 03/04/2019 is transcribed, entitled:
“GUIDANCE FOR THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF THE PROVISION
ADDITIONAL SEVENTH OF THE LOPDGDD”

“In the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, the Catalan Authority for
Data Protection, the Basque Data Protection Agency and the Council of
Transparency and Data Protection of Andalusia, multiple queries have been received
on the application of the provisions of the first paragraph of the first section of the
Seventh additional provision “Identification of the interested parties in the notifications
through advertisements and publications of administrative acts” of the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the
digital rights.

This circumstance has advised that, in order to facilitate a practical criterion,
said authorities propose guidance for the provisional application of
guarantees of protection of the disclosure of the national identity document,
foreign identity number, passport or equivalent document of the
interested.

To do this, they have randomly selected the group of four numerical figures
to be published for the identification of those interested in the publications of
administrative acts. The procedure for the random determination of the
four numerical figures to be published of the identification code of an interested party
performed through the process of random selection in an opaque bag of a ball of
between five balls numbered from 1 to 5, held on 02/27/2019 at the AEPD.

The resulting ball was number 4, therefore:

The publication of national identity document, identity number of
foreigner, passport or equivalent document may be made in the following way:

• Given a DNI with format 12345678X, the digits will be published in the format
occupy the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh positions. In the example: ***4567**.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

• Given a NIE with format L1234567X, the digits will be published in the format
occupy the positions, avoiding the first alphabetic character, fourth, fifth, sixth
and seventh. In the example: ****4567*.

• Given a passport with format ABC123456, having only six figures, will be published
the digits that occupy the positions in the format, avoiding the three characters
alphabetical, third, fourth, fifth and sixth. In the example: *****3456.

• Given another type of identification, as long as that identification contains at least
7 numeric digits, these digits will be numbered from left to right, avoiding
all alphabetic characters, and the procedure of publishing those
numeric characters that occupy the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh positions.

For example, in the case of an ID like XY12345678AB, the post

would be: *****4567***.

• If that type of identification is different from a passport and has less than 7 digits
numeric, all characters, including alphabets, will be numbered with the same number.
previous procedure and those who occupy the last four will be selected.
positions. For example, in the case of an ID such as ABCD123XY, the
publication would be: *****23XY.

• Alphabetic characters, and those numeric characters not selected for their
publication, they will be replaced by an asterisk for each position.”

Therefore, in addition to introducing the aforementioned measures in general, if
to publish or notify any act, it must be taken into account in addition to these
references, a special diligence for the possible identification or identifiability to
through other direct or indirect references that are not name and surnames or NIF
and that allow the person to be identified.

Regarding the fact that this provision was not in force when the
facts, this is true and its implementation is expected to contribute to being able to
apply the publication/notification scheme in edicts or official journals respecting
data protection regulations.

On the other hand, article 46 was in force, which could have been
taken into account and the principle of data minimization is related to the data,
which has its origin in article 4.1 of the LOPD. ”Personal data will only be
may collect for treatment, as well as submit them to said treatment, when
are adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the scope and purposes
determined, explicit and legitimate for which they have been obtained.”

It is estimated that with the measures it has put in place, and those derived from the
LOPDDG it is not necessary to order the respondent to adjust its operations of
treatments, since the criteria expressed in this resolution are decisive for
that a situation similar to the one reported is not repeated.

FIRST: IMPOSE THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,
DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND PUBLIC LIBERTIES, with NIF S4611001A,
