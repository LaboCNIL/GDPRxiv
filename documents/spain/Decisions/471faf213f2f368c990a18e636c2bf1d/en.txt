The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)
f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application

confidentiality").
(…)”

Article 5, Duty of confidentiality, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD), states that:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all

In the present case, it should be noted that teachers cannot be
considered as third parties outside the university institution; are and are part of
the same contributing to reinforce the research activity configuring a model
that the University is obliged to lead.

III

Therefore, the determination of whether the treatment made by the respondent, UPV, of
the personal data of the claimant, providing the contracts
celebrated with the same to professors XX and YY and where their data is recorded to be
provided as evidence in court, is or is not adjusted to law, it must be reiterated that the
professors, cannot be considered as third parties outside the university, but
as part of the institution in which they teach their work, linked to it
nor can they be separated from the employment contracts signed between the UPV
and the claimant since the relationship between them is necessary - the claimant was
doctoral student, being his XX thesis director and collaborator with a project
directed by YY to carry out the proposed purposes.

In this sense, article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, in its sections 1

and 2, provides the following:

"1. All persons have the right to obtain effective protection from judges
and courts in the exercise of their rights and legitimate interests, without in any
case, helplessness may occur.

2. Likewise, everyone has the right to the ordinary Judge predetermined by law,
to the defense and the assistance of a lawyer, to be informed of the accusation made
against them, to a public process without undue delay and with all the guarantees, to
use the pertinent means of evidence for their defense, not to testify against themselves
themselves, not to confess guilt and the presumption of innocence.”

Thus, the right of citizens to guardianship is constitutionally enshrined.
effective judicial process and the right to use the evidence they deem appropriate
to support your claim. However, from this forecast, a
collision between the right to the protection of personal data and the right to
the effective judicial protection of judges and courts referred to, given to legal goods
affected in your application.

Therefore, in such situations, the legislator has created a system in which the
right to the protection of personal data yields in those cases in which
that the legislator himself (constitutional or ordinary) has considered the existence of
reasoned and well-founded reasons that justify the need to treat the
data, incorporating said assumptions to standards of at least the same range as the
that regulates the protected matter.

Indeed, the enforceability of the consent of the owner of the data that
could be subject to treatment in a judicial proceeding, for said
processing of your data would mean leaving the storage of
information necessary for a person to be able to fully exercise their right
to effective judicial protection. Thus, the lack of these data or the dependence on their
application to whoever handled the ownership of the data would imply, logically, a decrease
in the possibility of contribution by the interested party of "the relevant means of proof
for their defense”, violating another of the guarantees derived from the aforementioned right to
effective protection and limiting the possibility of obtaining the full development of
This right.

As the reiterated jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court maintains (for
all, STC 186/2000, of July 10, citing many others) "the right to
privacy is not absolute, as is none of the fundamental rights,
being able to yield to constitutionally relevant interests, provided that the cut
that he has to experience is revealed as necessary to achieve the legitimate aim
planned, proportionate to achieve it and, in any case, be respectful of the
essential content of the law.

Consequently, in the present case there has been a collision between the
right of the claimed to see satisfied the effective judicial protection, enshrined by the
article 24 of the Constitution, and of the claimant to the protection of their data from
personal character. Prevailing the right to effective judicial protection.

Also the AEPD in the Legal Report 0456/2015 indicated that:
“(…)

In the present case, the legitimate interest invoked seems to refer
especially the fundamental right to effective judicial protection (art. 24 CE), in the

The scope of the right to judicial protection in relation to evidence has been
addressed, among others, in the STC 212/2013, of December 16, in which it is made
reference, citing the STC 88/2014, of May 28 to "the intimate relations of the
right to proof with other rights guaranteed in art. 24 CE.
Specifically, in our constitutional doctrine we have emphasized the
connection of this specific constitutional right with the right to judicial protection
effective (art. 24.1 CE), the scope of which includes questions relating to evidence
(SSTC 89/1986, of July 1, FJ 2; 50/1988, of March 22, FJ 3; 110/1995, of March 4
July, FJ 4; 189/1996, of November 25, FJ 3; and 221/1998, of November 24, FJ
3), and with the right of defense (art. 24.2 CE), from which it is inseparable (SSTC
131/1995, of September 11, FJ 2; 1/1996, of January 15, FJ 2; and 26/2000, of 31
of January, FJ 2)’’ (STC 19/2001, of January 29, FJ 4; and, in the same sense, STC
133/2003, of June 30, FJ 3)». In the reviewed SSTC 19/2001 and 133/2003 the
Constitutional Court pointed out that “it has been precisely this inseparable connection
(with the other fundamental rights mentioned, in particular the right to
obtain effective judicial protection), which has made it possible to affirm that the content
essential part of the right to use the pertinent means of proof is integrated by the power
law that recognizes whoever intervenes as a litigant in a process of provoking
the procedural activity necessary to achieve the conviction of the judicial body on the
existence or non-existence of the relevant facts for the decision of the object conflict
of the process (for all, STC 37/2000, of February 14, FJ 3)”.

The relationship between the rights to personal data protection and guardianship
has also been analyzed in Report 469/2011 of December 30,
2011, in which the following is indicated:

“At this point, it must be remembered that this Agency has already had occasion to
analyze the possible concurrence in a certain case of data processing
of the fundamental rights to the protection of personal data and to the
effective judicial protection of the data controller. Thus, it has been considered
example that the treatment by a lawyer of the data of the opposing party of your
client finds its protection in the recognition of the latter by article 24.1 of
the Constitution of their right to effective judicial protection, which implies, according to the
section 2, the legal defense and the use of the relevant evidence for the
defense of his right. In this sense, the report of February 21, 2001
pointed out the following:

“In this case, as was said, the treatment by the lawyers and attorneys of
the data referring to the counterparty of its clients in litigation in which those
exercise the procedural application brings its cause, directly, from the right of all
citizens to legal assistance, enshrined in article 24.2 of the Text
Constitutional.

Indeed, the enforceability of the consent of the opponent for the treatment
of your data by the lawyer or solicitor would mean leaving the
storage of the necessary information so that your client can exercise, in
fullness, their right to effective judicial protection. Thus, the lack of these data may
imply, logically, a decrease in the possibility of contribution by the interested party of
"the means of evidence pertinent to his defense", violating another of the
guarantees derived from the aforementioned right to effective protection and limiting the possibility
to obtain the full development of this right.

For all these reasons, although no provision with the force of Law establishes
expressly the possibility of treatment by lawyers and data attorneys
referred to the opponent of his client within a certain judicial process, it is
evident that said possibility brings direct cause of a norm of rank
constitutional, regulatory as well as one of the fundamental rights and freedoms
enshrined in the Constitution, and developed by the regulatory laws of
each of the Jurisdictional Orders, in the precepts referred to the
Representation and defense of the parties.

For all these reasons, there is, from our point of view, a legal authorization to
the processing of the data, which is covered by article 24 of the
Constitution and its implementing regulations.”

Thus, we understand that there is a lawful treatment of the data of the
claimant understanding that his particular situation allows the same, and this for several
reasons: in the first place, because the data that it denounces has been violated,
provided by the employer (UPV) to "any third party", but to the
figures of Thesis Director of the claimant himself and Principal Investigator of the Project
of the National Plan in which the claimant collaborated and these two professors are
part of the university itself.

Because the respondent herself has indicated her interest in the work activity,
teacher and researcher can achieve the proposed goals; in this sense, the
treatment of the data, even without the express consent of the claimant, have had
a beneficial purpose for the same in other circumstances, since their data were
used for his assistance in 2017 to a Congress, in which Professor PA paid
registration fees to which the claimant was going to attend, requiring for this the
type of contract signed to be able to make the payment, or, the carrying out of procedures
carried out by the two professors to register the claimant in the Project
of the State Research Plan for which the aforementioned employment contract was required, if
well finally it was not possible to discharge him.

Although the claimant was not part of the project, in order to pay a
congress to someone external to the project, it was necessary to demonstrate that the claimant
he had a contract with the UPV, and so it was done, providing the contract.

The predoctoral contract was requested from the UPV and provided by it to the
professors with the sole purpose of paying the registration fee for a conference to which I was going
assist the claimant to complete a procedure of interest to the claimant
complainant, said Congress being prior to the complaint made.

Lastly, the claimant has also raised in his brief dated
09/02/2018 that one of the teachers on 04/26/2017 confiscated the CPU that
had been using, without prior notice, in his absence and without authorization from the
UPV, keeping it in its possession until an undetermined date; that in the same
found, in addition to the work of the Doctoral Thesis, a OneDrive folder linked
to your Microsoft email account, in which you stored personal data
(bank account number, TFM, etc) and that the disk was cloned

same and that after the facts he denounced them on 04/28/2017.

In light of the facts stated, on the date on which the same occurred
the previous Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on Protection
of Personal Data (LOPD) and in accordance with the same the cloning of
CPD without the authorization of the complainant may be considered a violation of the
principle of consent established in article 6.1 of the previous LOPD,
infraction considered as serious and typified in article 44.3.b) of the same Law.

Therefore, the facts that constitute the factual assumption of the imputation
directed against the defendant were framed, at the time of their commission, in the type
sanction established in article 44.3.b) of the LOPD, a serious infraction for which the
Article 45.2 of the LOPD provided for a sanction with a fine of €40,001 to €300,000.

The LOPD, in its article 47.1, 2 and 3, stated that:

"1. Very serious infractions will prescribe after three years, serious ones after

offense had been committed.

3. The prescription shall be interrupted by initiation, with the knowledge of the interested party,
sanctioning procedure, resuming the statute of limitations if the file
sanctioning party is paralyzed for more than six months for reasons not
attributable to the alleged offender.

In general, it should be noted that serious offenses prescribe
effectively after two years, article 47.1 of the LOPD. The aforementioned limitation period
will begin to count from the day on which the infraction was committed (article
47.2 of the LOPD) and when the infraction consists of a commission that deploys its
effects for a more or less long period of time, depending on the time
elapses improperly processing data, the "dies a quo" is maintained until the
infringing activity ceases.

In the present case, there is no evidence that the imputed infringement was
constituting a continuing offence, that is, characterized in that the conduct
deserving of administrative reproach was maintained for a period of time
dragged on.

Therefore, given that the violation of the principle of consent is
considered a serious infringement, which, therefore, prescribes after two years, has
It was proven that it had prescribed on 12/07/2019, when the
opening of this sanctioning procedure, with the knowledge of the interested party.

Based on the foregoing, it must be concluded that on the date of adoption of the resolution of
initiation of this sanctioning procedure, with the knowledge of the claimant
the two years of prescription indicated for infractions had elapsed

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
