IV

By virtue of the provisions of article 58.2 of the RGPD, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, as a control authority, has a set of
corrective powers in the event of an infraction of the precepts of the
GDPR.
Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following:
“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers
listed below:
(…)
b) send a warning to any person responsible or in charge of the treatment when the
treatment operations have violated the provisions of this Regulation;”
(...)

treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a specified manner and within a specified period;”
“i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"
Article 83.5 in section a) and b) of the RGPD establishes that:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9
b) the rights of the interested parties pursuant to articles 12 to 22;”

Article 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD states that “according to what is established in the
article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are considered very serious and will prescribe
after three years the infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the
articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

c) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In turn, article 74.a) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements considered
mild has:
  “They are considered minor and the remaining infractions of a legal nature will prescribe after a year.
merely formal of the articles mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the following:
a)
Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right
of information of the affected party for not providing all the information required by the articles
13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

v

From the facts denounced, a treatment of data without legitimacy is deduced, since
that Civil Protection of ***LOCALIDAD.1 carried out temperature controls in the
dock of ***MUELLE.1(***LOCALIDAD.1) and the claimant by refusing to submit to the
temperature control their personal data were noted on a list, data that
identifies them as their first and last names, which without their knowledge are
reported to the Emergency and Security Coordination Center.

On the other hand, with the evidence available, the assignment of
personal data first by the Civil Protection of ***LOCALIDAD.1 to the Center
Coordinator of Emergencies and Security, and these in turn to the workplace of the
claimant, which implies data processing without legitimacy.

Therefore, personal data has been collected from the claimed party, without indicating
none of the aspects required in article 13 of the RGPD, indicated in the
basis of law III, that is, when taking personal data the
responsible for the treatment, that is, the claimed party, must inform the owner of the
themselves, of the aspects indicated in said precept such as the identity and data of
contact of the person in charge of the treatment, the purposes of the treatment to which they are destined
personal data and the legal basis of the treatment, conservation period,
existence of the right to request access to data from the data controller

related to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation of its
treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to the portability of the
data, the right to file a claim with a control authority, etc.,
and in addition, data processing is being carried out without legitimation.

Therefore, in this case we are faced with two infractions, one against the
article 13 and another against article 6 of the RGPD.

SAW

Therefore, with the available evidence, it is considered that the assignment of
personal data first by the Civil Protection of ***LOCALIDAD.1 to the Center
Coordinator of Emergencies and Security, and these in turn to their place of work,
supposes a treatment of data without legitimacy, which supposes an infringement of the
article 6 of the RGPD.

Against this infraction, a warning could be directed for each of the
infractions in accordance with article 58.2.b) of the RGPD, when collecting data
of the users and consider that the administrative fine that could fall
in accordance with the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a burden
disproportionate for the respondent, whose main activity is not directly
linked to the processing of personal data, since there is no record of the commission of any
previous breach of data protection.

Likewise, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2.d) of the RGPD, this
Agency sends the claimed a warning, requiring him to collect data
of a personal nature, adapt the information offered to citizens, to the
requirements contemplated in articles 13 and 6 of the RGPD, as well as the contribution of
means of evidence accrediting compliance with the requirements.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: ADDRESS THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF SECURITY AND EMERGENCIES,
with CIF S3511001D, for an infringement of article 6 of the RGPD, typified in the
article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning.

SECOND: ADDRESS THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF SECURITY AND EMERGENCIES,
with CIF S3511001D, for an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in the
article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning.

THIRD: REQUEST the GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF SECURITY AND
EMERGENCIES, with CIF S3511001D, under the provisions of article 58.2 d)
of the RGPD, so that it adopts the necessary measures, so that when collecting data from

contemplated in articles 13 and 6 of the RGPD.
