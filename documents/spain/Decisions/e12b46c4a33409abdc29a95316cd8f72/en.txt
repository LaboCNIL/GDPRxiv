RESOLUTION OF PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: AAA (hereinafter, the claimant) dated March 20, 2019
filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against PREDASE SERVICIOS INTEGRAL SOCIEDAD
LIMITADA with NIF B02547164 (hereinafter, the claimed). The reasons on which he bases
the claim are as follows:

"[….]   SECOND. - On the Internet page with the domain name
«www.predase.es», and under the commercial name «PREDASE», they offer, among others,
Regulatory compliance services in the field of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and
Organic Law 3/2018. […]

THIRD. - By scrolling down the browser sidebar on the page of
start, you have access to various links related to the presence in different
Internet social networks of the natural or legal person acting under the name
"PREDASE" commercial.

In relation to data protection services, it stands out, in the margin
left side of the screen, the image of a padlock that includes the legend «RGPD /
LOPD”, […]

FOURTH. - Clicking on the image of the aforementioned padlock links to a
publication in the public profile of «PRÉDASE» in the social network Google+, in which
a quadrilateral appears that groups the graphic symbols of «PRÉDASE» and of the
SPANISH DATA PROTECTION AGENCY, without distinguishing between them,
and adding to the set the contact details of the natural or legal person who
acts under said commercial name. […]

SIXTH.- In this sense, the grouping of the graphic symbols of «PRÉDASE» and
the SPANISH DATA PROTECTION AGENCY, considered as a whole
homogeneous within the same quadrilateral, without distinguishing between its components, and
adding to the set the contact details of the natural or legal person acting
under said trade name, could constitute an illegal act consisting of
create "the appearance that one is acting in the name, on behalf of or in
collaboration with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection”, in relation to the
publication or indiscriminate communication of its offer of services in matters of
data protection to your entire network of contacts in the Google+ social network and to
any controllers and processors who visit your website
Internet for the purpose of contracting professional compliance services
regulations in this area.

sedeagpd.gob.es

2/16

SEVENTH. - Consequently, this alleged misleading and illegitimate use of the
graphic symbol of the SPANISH DATA PROTECTION AGENCY can
suppose an aggressive practice in terms of data protection, generating the
image of a false endorsement of the aforementioned control authority in relation to the services
offered by the natural or legal person acting under the trade name
"PRESENT".

EIGHTH. - Said practice has its supposed continuation in a second performance
that presumably could incur in letter c) of the Additional Provision
sixteenth of Organic Law 3/2018, which considers an aggressive practice in terms of
of data protection the performance of “commercial practices in which the
decision-making power of recipients by reference to the possible imposition
sanctions for non-compliance with personal data protection regulations»:

"It can not be true!!!!! You are not yet adapted to the new general regulation of
data protection (RGPD). DO NOT wait for them to sanction you, find out at C/
***ADDRESSB.1 or ***URL.1” […]

NINTH.- As a corollary of what has been exposed up to here, the facts and factual elements
related in this writing could suppose a presumed conjunction of
aggressive practices in terms of data protection, through interference
undue not only in the image and powers of the Spanish Protection Agency
Data, but also in the autonomy of the will of those responsible and
those in charge of the treatments, through an alleged distortion of the spirit of the
legal regulations on data protection.

TENTH. - The Internet page with the domain name «***URL.1» does not facilitate the
general information established in article 10 of Law 34/2002, of July 11, on
information society services and electronic commerce.

Likewise, despite the fact that it has a personal data collection form,
nor does it provide a privacy policy in order to comply with
what is established in articles 12 (right of transparency) and 13 (right of
information) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons in what
regarding the processing of personal data and the free circulation of these data and
which repeals Directive 95/46/CE (General Regulation for the protection of
data)."

Together with the claim, it provides screenshots of the website, of the Google+ social network
and Facebook for evidentiary purposes of what is indicated in the writing. Also, it incorporates
copy of the Notarial Acceptance Deed granted before the notary of the city of
***LOCALIDAD.1, D. B.B.B., on March 18, 2019, Protocol No. 620, of the
content of the web page that leads to the profile of PREDASE in the social network
GOOGLE+.

SECOND: On April 23, 2019, proceedings are carried out in this Agency to
to state that, after an analysis of the web page that constitutes the object of the

claim (www.predase.es), does not have the same identification of your
responsible or information regarding privacy policy.

THIRD: The claim was admitted for processing on April 29, 2019.

FOURTH: In view of the facts denounced in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant, the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out preliminary investigation actions to clarify the
facts in question, by virtue of the powers of investigation granted to the
control authorities in article 57.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation
General Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD), and in accordance with the
established in Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of Organic Law 3/2018,
of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD).

As a result of the investigative actions carried out, the report prepared
by the acting inspector reveals the following:

 “Regarding the fact of using the logo of this Agency together with
the PREDASE logo and contact information, this is confirmed by
the deed of notary act presented by the claimant of the content of the page

grouped together, and as a whole, the PREDASE logo, the logo of this Agency, the
European flag, and PREDASE contact information.

 Regarding the denounced fact of the publication on the social network FACEBOOK and
indicated in the claim according to the sixteenth additional provision, letter c) that
establishes aggressive practice in terms of data protection:

“Carry out commercial practices in which the decision-making power of the
recipients by referring to the possible imposition of sanctions for
non-compliance with the personal data protection regulations.

It is verified that in the FACEBOOK profile of PREDASE, dated March 12
2019, the following content was published:

"It can not be true!!!!! You are not yet adapted to the new general regulation of
data protection (RGPD). DO NOT wait for them to sanction you, find out at C/
***ADDRESS.1 or ***URL.1.”

As of the date of this report, access to this publication is still available. Diligence is recorded in
the SIGRID system with the publication's screen print.

It is also verified that the website of PREDASE, a company of
advice, among other issues, on data protection, lacks a policy
of privacy and collects data in its contact form without the need for
acceptance of treatment.

mercantile PREDASE SERVICIOS INTEGRAL SOCIEDAD LIMITADA with NIF
B02547164, is the present procedure.

SIXTH: On March 17, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimant, for the
alleged infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the aforementioned
rule.

SEVENTH: Having been notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the respondent submitted a written
allegations on June 25, 2020 requesting the file of the procedure

and unnecessary).”

EIGHTH
 : On August 10, 2020, the instructor of the procedure agreed to the
 
opening of a period of practice of tests, taking for reproduced, for purposes
evidence of the claim filed by the claimant, the data obtained and
generated by the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection and the allegations
filed by the claimant. As it was not possible to notify this period opening
practice tests, due to expiration of the electronic notification, on the 1st of
September 2020, a reiteration of the document was sent, which was notified on
same day 1.

NINTH: On October 5, 2020, the
checks carried out on September 21, 25 and 29 and October 5, 2020
on the website www.predase.es.

TENTH: On October 19, 2020, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the defendant be imposed a sanction of reprimand, for a
infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the same regulation.
In this proposal, a period of 10 days was granted so that the person claimed could
allege what he considers in his defense, as well as present the documents and
information that it considers pertinent, in accordance with article 89.2 of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

The proposed resolution was notified on October 30 and the respondent presented
brief of allegations on November 13, stating the following:

“[…]

FIRST: In the THIRD, FOURTH and SIXTH points (since the point
FIFTH) of the complaint, interprets the alleged union of the PRÉDASE logos and
of the AEPD as an association attempt for potential clients.
Assuming that it is a mere question of structural organization of the design
web and graphic, any minimally informed person knows how to distinguish between the
Spanish Data Protection Agency and a service provider company
(Call PRÉDASE, AUDIDAT or any other).

     As the complainant indicates and appears, clearly in capital letters, in the
header of said website, said image belongs to the SOCIAL NETWORKS of the
company (not to the services provided, budgets, invoices, or any other
document of a public nature that could, effectively, imply an improper use
of the AEPD logo).

     Indeed, said publication was made on March 12, 2019 and the link
corresponds to the Google+ social network, which has not been operational since April 2,
2019 (it was canceled by Google on that date). Following your twisted reasoning
and personal, the use of the Facebook, Google or Twitter logos would also imply
a deception to any customer who visited your website by giving rise to the mistake that

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/16

PRÉDASE (as in its case AUDIDAT) are part of or act on behalf of said
Business.

SECOND: Again in points SEVENTH, EIGHTH and NINTH the
denouncer reattributes judicial competences (which border on insult and
slander) by directly branding "misleading, illicit, image of false authority,
aggressive practices or to restrict decision-making capacity" (since the use of
adjective "alleged" preceding all these niceties does not lower the least or
subtracts seriousness from his accusations) which in any company is a simple
social media advertising campaign.

THIRD: In reference to the alleged breach of Art. 10 of Law 34/2002 of
July 11, as you may well have been able to verify (and according to what you say you have captures of
screen 'fedatadas' before a Notary) all contact information: Name (commercial),
address, phone and email are clearly visible. Not being mandatory for a
self-employed (denomination under which the company operated at the time of its
complaint) registration in the Mercantile Registry.

However, and as you can see in the attached document ("Metadata
***METADATA.1") and despite not being mandatory, a simple search in the
web metadata (and therefore publicly accessible in any search engine or
web browser) if the data of the owner "C.C.C. - ***NIF.1" appears under the "meta
tag" ***META TAG.1.

Regarding the data form and as you will have also been able to verify in your
impeccable detective work, it is not operational (nor has it ever been). Of
In fact, it is an addition of a template in order to use the "blue popup" style of the
Contact Form. You can see that it doesn't show any error message in case of
not entering data (or doing so erroneously), nor a satisfactory message in
shipping case. It just redirects directly to the home screen (I hope there is
left this also duly registered in a notarial public deed).

It is enough to note that if said form were functional and operative, the date would not have been indicated.
email address to the left of it (since it would be redundant
and unnecessary).

FOURTH: The facts denounced must be considered prescribed based on the
sections 1 and 2 of Art. 30 of Law 40/2015 of October 1, on the Legal Regime
of the Public Sector, therefore applicable to the AEPD, in terms of the prescription of
violations:

1. The infractions and sanctions will prescribe according to the provisions of the laws that
establish. If they do not set prescription periods, very serious infringements
they will prescribe after three years, serious ones after two years and minor ones after six months; the
sanctions imposed for very serious offenses will expire after three years, those imposed
for serious offenses after two years and those imposed for minor offenses after one year.

2. The limitation period for infractions will begin to run from the day on which
that the offense had been committed. In the case of continued violations or
permanent, the term will begin to run from the end of the offending conduct.

7/16

For all of the above, WE REQUEST:

That the Spanish Data Protection Agency FILE THE COMPLAINT
based both on the lack of veracity of the reported facts, and on the
statute of limitations from the date of the complaint.

FINALLY: From PRÉDASE SERVICIOS INTEGRALES S.L. (current company name
of the company) we do not know the motivation of the complainant before the facts above
exposed. Only understandable under the desire to intimidate and try to eliminate the
competition through complaints and "chuscas and barriobajeras" actions such as the
detailed inspection of our website (which, by the way, we are updating
together with the computer company, in order to correct the slightest error).

In their eagerness to discredit us or for us to desist in the provision of our
services, Mr. A.A.A. (on behalf of AUDIDAT) demonstrates a clear
incompetence in your complaint by being unable to locate our postal address to the
to address the complaint, which was clearly indicated on the same website
subject of your complaint (thus forcing the AEPD to resort to Orange
Espagne SAU to provide an address that we do not know at all and that nothing
has to do with our mercantile).”

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

SIXTH: The website is still not accessible in the checks carried out on the 8th and
January 12, 2021, returning the same error indicated in the previous fact.

4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information.”

The violation of this article is typified as an infringement in article 83.5 of the RGPD,
which he considers as such:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

[…] b) the rights of the interested parties under articles 12 to 22; […].”

For the purposes of the limitation period of the infraction, article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD
establishes:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and, in particular, the
following:

[…] h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of their
personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679. [...]”.

III

This sanctioning procedure has its origin, as indicated in the agreement
beginning and was reiterated in the resolution proposal, in the absence of a policy of
privacy of the website www.predase.es. As regards the
Complaints regarding aggressive data protection practices
(specifically framed in letters b) and c) of the additional provision
sixteenth of the LOPDGDD: "generate the appearance that it is acting in
name, on behalf of or in collaboration with the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data or a regional data protection authority in carrying out
any communication to those responsible and in charge of the treatments in which the
sender offers its products or services" and "carry out commercial practices in the
that the decision-making power of the recipients is restricted by referring to the
possible imposition of sanctions for non-compliance with the regulations for the protection of
personal data", respectively), it means that their regulation is carried out
by Law 3/1991, of January 10, on Unfair Competition, not holding the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Authority in this matter.

“Article 5 of the RGPD, regarding the principles of the processing of personal data
enunciates in its letter to that of "legality, loyalty and transparency", a principle in which at its
Once again, Recital 39 affects: “All processing of personal data must be lawful and
loyal. For natural persons, it must be completely clear that they are collecting,
using, consulting or otherwise treating personal data that

concern, as well as the extent to which said data is or will be processed. The beginning
of transparency requires that all information and communication regarding the treatment of
said data is easily accessible and easy to understand, and that a language is used
simple and clear. This principle refers in particular to the information of the
interested parties about the identity of the person in charge of the treatment and the purposes of the same and
to the information added to guarantee a fair and transparent treatment with
regarding the natural persons affected and their right to obtain confirmation and
communication of personal data concerning them that are subject to
treatment. Natural persons must be aware of the risks,
rules, safeguards and rights relating to the processing of personal data
as well as the way to assert their rights in relation to the treatment. In
In particular, the specific purposes of the processing of personal data must be
explicit and legitimate, and must be determined at the time of collection. The data
Personal information must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes
for which they are treated. This requires, in particular, ensuring that it is limited to a
strict minimum its retention period. Personal data should only be processed if
the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be achieved by other means. For
ensure that personal data is not kept longer than necessary, the
responsible for the treatment must establish deadlines for its deletion or review
periodic. All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that
rectify or delete personal data that is inaccurate. Personal information
must be treated in a way that ensures adequate security and confidentiality
of personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access or use of
said data and the equipment used in the treatment.”

Recital 60 links the duty of information with the principle of transparency,
by stating that “The principles of fair and transparent processing require that
inform the interested party of the existence of the treatment operation and its purposes. The
The data controller must provide the data subject with as much information
supplementary information is necessary to guarantee fair and transparent processing,
having regard to the specific circumstances and context in which the
personal information. The interested party must also be informed of the creation of profiles
and the consequences of such elaboration. If personal data is obtained from
interested parties, they must also be informed if they are obliged to provide them and the
consequences in case they do not do it […]”. In this order, article 12.1 of the
RGPD regulates the conditions to ensure its effective materialization and article 13
specifies what information must be provided when the data is obtained from the
interested.

In turn, article 11 LOPDGDD introduces the layered information rule when
has:

"1. When the personal data is obtained from the affected party, the person responsible for the
treatment may comply with the duty of information established in article
13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providing the affected party with the basic information to
referred to in the following section and indicating an electronic address or other
medium that allows easy and immediate access to the rest of the information.

2. The basic information referred to in the previous section must contain, at
less:

12/16

a) The identity of the data controller and his representative, if any.

b) The purpose of the treatment.

c) The possibility of exercising the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. [...]”.

In relation to the foregoing, the proven facts show that the website
had a contact section for potential clients that included the
telephone, an email and a data collection form, without stating
no section that provided the information that, in accordance with article 13 of the
RGPD, it must be provided about the treatment of data that may be generated
by providing personal data through any of the means of contact
referrals.

As regards the allegation of the respondent made in the brief of
response of June 25, 2020 to the initial agreement, in the sense that the
form was not operational and that by not collecting data effectively,
indicated the email address next to it, it has not been possible to verify the
veracity of said statement about the functionality of the aforementioned form as it is not
possible access to the website in the checks carried out. Now the
The fact that the form has not been operational does not prevent the web page from
must comply with the duty of information established in article 12 of the RGPD and
specified in the subsequent article 13 for situations in which the information is
obtained from the interested party, since the collection of personal data is susceptible to
also be made through the rest of the published means of contact (and
particularly, as the respondent himself points out, through the email address
that has been indicated supplying the lack of functionality of the form).

And with regard to the allegations presented by the respondent to the proposal of
resolution, and which are objectified in the alleged prescription of the imputed infraction and
in the statement that the website is in the process of being updated,
the following is noted:

 Regarding the possible prescription of the infraction, the respondent alleges that it would be
The provisions of article 30 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, of the
Legal Regime of the Public Sector (hereinafter, LRJSP) and that the facts
denounced must be considered time-barred since, according to the underlined
accompanies this document, the respondent seems to understand that the imputed infraction is
would consider mild (and would prescribe after 6 months) and that the term would begin to
computed from the day it was committed. These arguments cannot
qualify for several reasons:

1. Article 30.1 of the LRJSP provides that "Infringements and penalties
shall prescribe according to the provisions of the laws that establish them. [...]”. In this
sense, the LOPDGDD has a Title, the IX, dedicated to the regime
sanctioning Within this title, article 71 establishes that they constitute
infractions the acts and behaviors typified in article 83, sections 4, 5 and
6 of the RGPD as well as those contrary to the LOPDGDD itself and dedicates the
articles 72 to 74 to determine a gradation of the infractions in very
serious, serious and minor, instituting the statute of limitations for each of them.
the levels. Therefore, the applicable limitation period will be the
provided in the LOPDGDD.

2. The imputed infraction is subsumed, for these purposes of prescription, in the
article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD and in this article it is specified that
considered very serious and that it will prescribe after 3 years. This is reflected in the
Legal Basis V of the initiation agreement and is recalled in the Basis
Legal II of the motion for a resolution.

3. With regard to the time of the start of the calculation of the term of
prescription, the LOPDGDD does not establish any specific regime, so
At this point, the provisions of article 30.2 of the LRJSP with

interrupted on June 5, 2020, the date on which the notification took place
effectiveness of the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.
