communication YouTube” part of the intervention of the Lawyer in the exercise
of the right of defense of its principal through the edition and assembly of

parties carry out the data that would have been disclosed to them in the
process development”.

 That “It is evident that the delivery to the representative of the actor Union
of a copy of the audiovisual support of the incidental hearing on measures
precautionary measures has no other purpose than procedural, specifically that it could
have as many elements of judgment needed in order to challenge in
replacement of the order that, to that effect, was issued. However, this is not the use
that has been made of it, but that it has been hung in two
versions -complete and partial- in a well-known open channel of
communication on the Internet. Moreover, the recording has been manipulated with the
introduction of phrases taken from the context in which they were pronounced, and
includes, the images and words of the intervening parties and their
Lawyers, in addition to the voice of the President of the Court”. (The underlining is from
the AEPD)

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to
resolve this procedure.

Yo

The RGPD deals in article 5 with the principles that must govern the

treatment of personal data, provision that provides:

II

"1. The personal data will be:
a) treated lawfully, loyally and transparently with the interested party (<<lawfulness,

loyalty and transparency>>)

 (…)
2. The data controller will be responsible for compliance with the
provided in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”

Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", defines in section 1 the

assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/17

conditions:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
applicable to the data controller;
d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or of
another natural person.
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the controller
of the treatment;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
over said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
in particular when the interested party is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to

treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

2.Member States may maintain or introduce more

in order to align the application of the rules of this Regulation with
regarding the treatment in compliance with section 1, letters c) and e), setting
more precisely specific treatment requirements and other measures that
guarantee lawful and equitable treatment, including other situations
specific treatment under chapter IX.(...)”

Article 4 of the RGPD, “Definitions”, offers in section 2 a legal concept
of “processing”: “any operation or set of operations carried out on
personal data or set of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling of
access, collation, interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction”.

Likewise, article 4 of the RGPD, section 1, understands “personal data”
“any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (<<the
interested>>); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier,
such as a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The infraction for which the defendant is held responsible is provided for in article
83.5 of the RGPD that states: "Infringements of the following provisions are
will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000
Eur maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year

above, opting for the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The LOPDGDD in its article 72.1.b) qualifies as a very serious infraction "The
processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of legality
of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

A. The conduct for which the defendant is held responsible consisted of processing personal data
third parties - the image and the voice, in particular the image and voice of the Lawyer of a
of the suing parties, the Territorial Confederation of Madrid, Castilla La Mancha and
Extremadura of the General Confederation of Labor, D. B.B.B., and the voice of a
member of the Court - without concurring any of the conditions of legality
provided for in article 6.1 RGPD.

Organic Law 1/1985 of the Judiciary (LOPJ) provides in its article 236
quinquies, 2: “In any case, the provisions of the legislation of the
protection of personal data to the treatment that the parties carry out
of the data that would have been revealed in the development of the process”.

In accordance with the RGPD, article 6.1, the processing of personal data will only be
lawful if it is covered by any of the conditions detailed in sections a) to f)
of the precept. In the matter at hand, the data processing contrary to the RGPD
materialized in the publication made on the internet channel YouTube, on the date
08/09/2018, of a video with the recording of the act of the Precautionary Measures hearing,
procedure XXXX/XXXX -separate piece opened as an incident in the
Procedure for the protection of fundamental rights and public freedoms- in which the
Letter D. B.B.B. intervened on behalf of his principal. The video was a
judicial document to which the defendant's lawyer had access in the development of the
jurisdictional activity for the fulfillment of its own purposes.

A video with the complete recording of the hearing and
another with a fragment of it. Work in the diverse administrative file
documentation obtained from YouTube through links ***URL.1
and ***URL.2 from which, respectively, both videos are accessed with the
complete recording of the sight and a fragment of it and, in addition, to an image of the
physical support (facts proven 3rd, 4th and 6th on the one hand and fact proven 5th on the other).
In the screenshots obtained from both videos, whose duration, as recorded
in them, it is, respectively, from “53:12´” that of the complete recording and from “03:21´” the
partial version, you see images of the court room and an image of the support
physical version of the recording, a DVD, on which the seal of the TSJ of
***LOCALIDAD.1 and the handwritten indications “TSJ ***LOCALIDAD.1. Social room.
Sect. 1st. Copy D.XXXX/XXXX. 11-07-18”.

When accessing YouTube from ***URL.1, the content of the recording is reported
with this note: “Precautionary Measures. Full Video YouTube”. Also listed are these

The screenshots obtained from the video with the complete recording of the
view that show the Courtroom correspond to the minutes “18:55/53:12” (the
described in the proven fact 4th) and "0:12/53:12" (that of the proven fact 6th) In the
images described in the first of those proven facts, in the upper corner
left, the following information appears overprinted that identifies the origin of the
video: “11.07.2018. DEM XXXX/XXXX”. One of the two documents also bears
the upper right corner the indication “10:09:17:664”, which seems to correspond to the
time the recording was made.

The image of the Court room captured at minute “0:12/53:12” of the
recording, which is described in proven fact 6, has these superimposed
annotations that reconfirm the origin of the video: “07.11.2018”, “DEM-
XXXX/XXXX”. In the upper right corner “09:50:35:289”.

 
The processing of personal data -particularly the image and voice of persons-
nas that intervened in the act of hearing - by publishing on the social network
YouTube of the recording of that oral hearing held in the incidental proceeding of
Precautionary Measures XXXX/XXXX, cannot be legally protected in any of
the reasons for legitimation collected in article 6.1 RGPD.

In accordance with article 5.2 RGPD, it is the responsibility of the data controller to
obligation to prove that the treatment respected the principle of legality, that is,
had its legal basis in any of the conditions of article 6.1. GDPR. Without
However, the defendant has not proven anything, since, as has been stated in the An-
background of the resolution, rejected the notification of the agreement to initiate the file
tea.

It must be emphasized, on the other hand, that it has been proven that the conduct
offender has persisted over time for at least one year. the internet channel
YouTube reports that the video of the act of the Precautionary Measures hearing of the
procedure XXXX/XXXX was published on 08/09/2018 and in the file
administrative it is documented that as of 08/08/2019 the aforementioned video continued
published on the internet channel.

B. The documentation in the file shows that the Labor Union-
tors of the Public Administration, STAP, also identified, on occasions with the
acronym SAP, is responsible for the processing of data subject to the sanctioning procedure.

As stated in the list of proven facts of this resolution, in the videos
videos published on YouTube, both in the one that corresponds to the full session of the viewing
of the incidental procedure as in the one that offers only a fragment of it, it appears
always bear the STAP CGT anagram and the indications “CGT STAP”, “Published on
Aug 9 2018”.

The SAP union, established in 1977, is organically linked, according to
Article 4 of its Statutes, to the General Confederation of Labor, framed in
the corresponding Territorial Confederation within the CGT, hence the
publicly identified by the acronym STAP-CGT or SAP-CGT.

C. The respondent, who rejected the notification of the initiation agreement, has not formulated
allegations at the opening of the sanctioning file. However, it seems

advisable to make a brief reflection on the argument put forward by the
Lawyer Ms. A.A.A. in its response to the informative request made by the AEPD with
prior to the acceptance of the claim for processing.

  The Lawyer, who intervened in defense of the defendant in the proceeding for
Precautionary Measures XXXX/XXXX, justified the "dissemination of said recording" with this
statement: “it is an elementary principle that trials should be public and
transparent, not only because the Union's Statutes so require, but also
by constitutional imperative, consequently, this Agency lacks the
competence to adopt any resolution on the diffusion of said recording”.

The treatment of personal data that the Courts and Tribunals carry out in the
development of its jurisdictional activity is covered by the basis of legality described in
article 6.1. e) RGPD: “the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a
mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the
data controller”.

Well, in the case under consideration we are dealing with the dissemination on a social network of
a document - the recording of the hearing of an incidental proceeding - that was obtained
in the development of jurisdictional activity and which has been used for a
purpose totally unrelated to that for which it was delivered, the exercise of the right of
defending. The conduct of the defendant object of the sanctioning file has nothing to do with
do with the development of jurisdictional activity and is the result of a free and
of the claimed, maintained over time for at least one year. So,
no consideration deserves the argument of the Lawyer who intends to make
extendable to the illicit action of the defendant the principle of publicity that, by
constitutional imperative and under the conditions established in the LOPJ and laws of
procedure, presides over jurisdictional activity. It is strictly in the activity
jurisdiction in which the principle of publicity that is invoked governs, in the terms of
Articles 232 to 236 of the LOPJ in relation to the respective laws of
process.

The recording by the Court of the act of the hearing was part of the activity
jurisdiction of the TSJ of ***LOCALIDAD.1; It was a legal activity
documentation of judicial proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the
LOPJ. Let us remember that article 230.1. of the LOPJ establishes that "The courts and
courts and prosecutors are obliged to use any technical means,
electronic, computerized and telematic, placed at your disposal for the development of
its activity and exercise of its functions, with the limitations that the use of
such means establish chapter I bis of this title and the organic regulations of
personal data protection." Oral proceedings and recorded hearings and
documented in digital format may not be transcribed, except in cases
expressly provided for in the law (paragraph 3 of article 230 LOPJ).

The delivery that the Judicial Office of the 1st Chamber, 1st Section of the TSJ, made to the
Lawyer of the defendant, at his request, of a judicial document, of the DVD with the
recording of the hearing, since that was the documentary support of a procedural action,
it was with a specific purpose: the preparation of the reconsideration appeal against the
Order rejecting the precautionary measures requested in the framework of the
Protection of Fundamental Rights procedure filed against CGT, Committee

Confederal, the Territorial Confederation of Madrid, Castilla La Mancha and Extremadura
of the CGT and the Managing Commission of STAP-MADRID. The treatment carried out by
claimed from the judicial document that was delivered to his Lawyer for the purpose of
exercise the right of defense within the framework of this procedure, which he has disseminated
in a social network, is not covered by any of the legal bases of article 6.1.
GDPR.

The defendant used the document that was provided to his Lawyer within the
procedure in which he intervened and with a specific purpose within said
procedure apart from it. Used it for a purpose unrelated to the procedure
and to the defense of the claims deduced in that procedure and disclosed it
in a social network. Through such dissemination, he incurred in an illicit treatment of data
personal data of third parties, the image and the voice of the participants.

This conduct constitutes an infringement of article 6.1 RGPD, in relation to the
article 5.1.a), typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD. Infraction qualified by the
article 72.1.b) LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, very serious.

Article 58 of the RGPD, “Powers”, states:

IV

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
d) order the person responsible or in charge of treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period.

(…)
i) impose an administrative fine under Article 83, in addition to or instead of
of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the
particular case

(…)”

A. In determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the following
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that provide:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question,
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
applied under articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;
  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
or indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.
b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatments
of personal data.
c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.
d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the
commission of the offence.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process after the commission
of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
f) Affectation of the rights of minors.
g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a delegate for the protection of
data.
h) The submission by the person in charge or person in charge, with
voluntary, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any
interested."

In determining the amount of the sanction of an administrative fine that
it is appropriate to impose the defendant as responsible for an infringement of article
83.5.a) RGPD, it is appreciated, in light of the transcribed precepts and taking into account
consideration the documentation that works in the file, the concurrence of the
following elements that operate as aggravating factors:

- The processing of data carried out by the respondent deserves the qualification, in the

taking into account the origin of the published document and the diffusion it has
could achieve the illicit processing of personal data.

- The illicit treatment of personal data carried out through the publication in
the YouTube channel of the video of the Precautionary Measures hearing was notoriously
malicious or intentional (article 83.2.b RGPD) The publication on social networks
of both the full video and fractions of it and the circumstance that the
publications have not been unsubscribed after a year can only
explain whether there is an unequivocal will to disseminate a document
judicial process with the consequent illicit processing of personal data. The character
intentional unlawful processing of personal data is confirmed by the
circumstance that two videos have been released (a complete recording and
another very brief of a few moments of sight) and the interest shown by the
demanded to inform of the nature of the judicial file that the recording has
spread. We refer in this regard to the declared proven facts.

- The infringement of the principle of legality has been maintained over time for more
one year: the video was made public on YouTube on 08/09/2018 and the
08/08/2019 was still published. There is no information that on the date of
issue this resolution the video would have been removed from the social network (article 83.2
k, of the RGPD in relation to article 76.2.a) of the LOPDGDD)

The RGPD, article 83.1, requires that, in the imposition of administrative fines
for infringement of the RGPD, the control authority guarantees that they are, in each case,
“effective, proportionate and dissuasive”. These criteria that govern the
determination of the amount of the sanction of a fine, in the event that we
occupies, to assess all the circumstances that could reflect less guilt
of the offender or a decrease in the unlawfulness of her conduct, without thereby
the violated fundamental right is no longer effectively protected.

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned provision, it is necessary to take into account
consideration the small size of the Union responsible for the infraction, a
regional union (the Autonomous Community of Madrid) and with little
level of implantation whose economic resources do not seem to be abundant judging
due to the fact that the headquarters it occupies is premises assigned by CGT. can't either
ignoring, for the purposes of article 83.1 RGPD, that the allegedly infringing subject is
a union, a non-profit association as well as an institution of
social character called to represent the general interest of a sector of the population.

Based on the foregoing, it is agreed to sanction the defendant with an administrative fine.

whose amount is set at 3,000 euros.

B. Among the corrective powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD attributes to the
control authorities appear, in addition to the administrative fine provided for in their
section i), that of “ordering the controller or processor that the
processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation,
when appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period”,

Article 83.2 of the RGPD allows them to be imposed, together with the sanction of
fine, some of the other corrective measures included in article 58.2
GDPR. Thus, article 83.2 establishes that, depending on the circumstances of each
case, "administrative fines will be imposed" "in addition to or as a substitute for those
measures contemplated in article 58, section 2, letters a) to h) and j)”.

Thus, "in addition" to the sanction of a fine, under article 58.2.d)
RGPD, the claimed party is ordered to remove the video or
videos -there is a complete and a partial version- relative to the sight of the incident of

As long as the defendant does not proceed to withdraw the videos, it will continue to perpetrate the
infringement of article 6.1.a) RGPD for which it is responsible.

The term granted to the claimed party to proceed to withdraw from the YouTube channel

resolution could constitute a new infringement of the data protection regulations.

an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover
