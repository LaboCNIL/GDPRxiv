FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

The Director of the Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2
of the RGPD and in art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, which indicates in section 1 the cases in which the
Processing of third party data is considered lawful:

                 "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

(…)”

 The infraction for which the defendant is held responsible is typified in
Article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition
of administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

  (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file shows that the respondent treated
various personal data of the claimant (her name, telephone, mobile, photograph with
the image of it, as well as descriptions of a sexual nature) without legitimation
violating the principle of legality, loyalty and transparency in the treatment referred to
Article 5.1.a) of the RGPD.

In the present case, the respondent has recognized that the data of a
claimant's personal name, telephone, mobile, photograph with the image of the
itself, as well as descriptions of a sexual nature), have been treated on the website
contact MILEROTICOS.COM, on August 13, 2018, without the consent
of the claimant, being accessible by any user of this website of
Contact. The defendant acknowledges that he carried out said treatment without legitimacy.

It is clear that the defendant published a false advertisement on a web portal of
contacts for adults in MILEROTICOS.COM, containing a photograph of the
claimant and other personal data, data processing of the claimant who performed
without her consent.

Thus, it is estimated that the facts that are submitted to the assessment of this
Agency could constitute an infringement of article 6.1.b), in relation to
Article 5.1 of the RGPD.

Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”

         “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and

in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

          "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, and for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the
RGPD, for which D.C.C.C. is responsible, the following are considered concurrent
