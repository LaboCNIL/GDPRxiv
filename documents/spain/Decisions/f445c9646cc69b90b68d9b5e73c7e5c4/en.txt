Data Protection (AEPD) in the sanctioning procedure PS / 0006/2019 it was held
knowledge that the website banderacatalana.cat had modified the identity
of the person responsible for the page and the processing of personal data, so that
this became D. A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1. End of which was recorded in
the Diligence dated 10/31/2019 raised within the framework of the aforementioned file

Previous Actions of Investigation in order to determine if the new person in charge of the
website banderacatana.cat, D.A.A.A. (hereinafter the respondent) complied with the
data protection regulations.

It should be remembered that in the sanctioning procedure PS/0006/2019, it was sanctioned
to the entity GRUP BC, S.L., which was responsible for the website
on the date on which the opening of this sanctioning procedure was agreed, for
breach of article 13.1 of the RGPD in relation to articles 6.1.a) and 8 of the

THIRD: On December 10, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed, for the
alleged infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, in relation to articles 6.1.a) and 8
of the RGPD and article 7 of the LOPDGDD, typified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

FOURTH: The notification to the defendant of the initiation agreement was made through the
following actions:

On 12/12/2019 it is sent by postal mail, through the State Society
Post and Telegraph, S.A. (hereinafter Correos), to the address that appears on the page
website www.banderacatalana.cat linked to the person in charge: ***ADDRESS.1.

The notification thus practiced was unsuccessful. Work on file
document issued by Correos on 12/20/2019, called “Certification of
Impossibility of Delivery” in which it is certified that “according to the information
existing in the Information System, its shipment NT 28019822ADKH09112601,

03 absent”. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Article 44 of Law 39/2015, on the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP) indicates that when the addressee of the
notification is unknown, the location of the notification is ignored, or the notification is attempted
it would not have been possible to practice, the notification will be made by means of an announcement
published in the B.O.E.

The notice board of the BOE dated 01/07/2020 published the notification announcement
of the AEPD, of 01/02/2020, in procedure PS/00438/2019. The embedded ad
in the BOE it said:

“...within a maximum period of 10 business days counted from the day following the

corresponding to the indicated administrative act, for knowledge of its content
in full, requesting it through the Electronic Office of the Agency (https://

of Data, calle Jorge Juan, 6, 28001 Madrid. If after this period has not
appeared, the notification will be understood as practiced for all legal purposes from
the day following the expiration of the maximum term indicated for appearing.”

There is no record in this Agency that the person claimed, by himself or through
representative, has requested a copy of the agreement to initiate the file
sanctioning There is also no evidence that the respondent has presented allegations to the aforementioned
agreement.

FIFTH: The agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, in its dispositive part,
second section, agrees to incorporate into the administrative file, for the purposes of
evidence, “the Internal Note from the Director of the AEPD in which she orders the Inspection
of Data that carries out the precise actions to determine if the claimed person incurred
in a violation of data protection regulations and documents
obtained and generated by the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection during the
research phase. Likewise, the sanctioning procedure incorporates the
Diligence dated 10/31/2019 of the sanctioning procedure PS/0006/2019”.

SIXTH: Article 64.2.f) LPACAP provides that, in case of not making allegations
to the initial agreement, it may be considered a resolution proposal if it contains
a precise statement about the imputed responsibility.

In view of the fact that the respondent has not made any objections to the initial agreement
and to the fact that the aforementioned agreement contained a very clear statement regarding the
responsibility attributed to the claimed party, the resolution is handed down.

SEVENTH: As a consequence of the suspension of administrative deadlines caused
Due to the Covid 19 health crisis, the maximum duration of this procedure
Sanctioning PS /438/2019 ends on 11/27/2020.

Royal Decree 463/2020, "declaring the state of alarm for the
management of the health crisis caused by Covid 19”, published in the BOE on
03/14/2020, established in its Third Additional Provision, “Suspension of ad- ditional terms
ministerial”:

"1. Terms are suspended and the deadlines for the processing of the
procedures of public sector entities. The computation of the terms is carried out
will cease at the moment in which this Royal Decree loses its validity or, as the case may be,
its extensions.

2. The suspension of terms and the interruption of terms will apply to the entire
public sector defined in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common Agreement of Public Administrations.”

This suspension was lifted on 06/01/2020. Royal Decree 537/2020, published
enacted in the BOE on 05/23/2020, establishes in article 9: "Administrative deadlines
pending by virtue of Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14. With effects from
June 1, 2020, the computation of the administrative deadlines that would have been suspended
pending will be resumed, or restarted, if so provided for in a standard with

range of law approved during the validity of the state of alarm and its extensions.

Therefore, although the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure was signed on
11/19/2019 and that, in accordance with article 64.2, last paragraph, of the LOPDGDD, the term of
maximum duration of the procedure is 9 nine months computed from that date,
the suspension of deadlines agreed by Royal Decree 463/2020 affected the procedure
sanctioning procedure that we examined and the computation of the deadlines was resumed with the date
06/01/2020, pursuant to Royal Decree 463/2020. Applied the standards cited last
The day of the maximum duration of the procedure is 11/27/2020.

In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/2016, regarding the “protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of data” (RGPD) recognizes each control authority and according to what
established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

Article 13 of the RGPD, under the heading “Information to be provided

when the personal data is obtained from the interested party”, establishes:

"1. When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time they are obtained, will provide
all the information indicated below:

The identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable,

The contact details of the data protection officer, in his

b)
case;
c)

The purposes of the treatment to which the personal data is destined and the

The data controller is obliged to inform the interested party whose
personal data is collected from what is the "legal basis of the treatment" that will be
realize; which implies informing you of the legitimacy of the entity that collects the
data for the specific treatment that it intends to carry out.

In this sense, article 5.1.a) of the RLOPD mentions among the principles that
The processing of personal data is governed by that of “legality”. Article 6 GDPR under the
heading “Legality of the treatment provides:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of personal data

for one or more specific purposes;
      (...)”

This precept is completed with article 8 of the same legal text that deals
on the “Conditions applicable to the consent of the child in relation to the
information society services.
         "1. When article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) applies in relation to the offer
directly to children from services of the information society, the treatment of
personal data of a child will be considered lawful when they are at least 16 years old.
If the child is under 16 years of age, such consent will only be considered lawful if
the consent was given or authorized by the holder of parental authority or guardianship over the child,
and only to the extent given or authorized.
         Member States may establish by law a lower age for such purposes,
provided that it is not less than 13 years.
          2. The controller will make reasonable efforts to verify in
such cases that the consent was given or authorized by the holder of the country
authority or guardianship over the child, taking into account the available technology.
                 3. Section 1 shall not affect the general provisions of the Law
of the Member States, such as the rules relating to the validity,
formation or effects of contracts in relation to a child”. (The underlining is from the
AEPD)
         

The LOPDGDD made use of the authorization that article 8.1., last paragraph, of the
RGPD grants the Member States of the Union to determine the age in the
that it is lawful for a minor under the age of 16 to give their consent to the processing of their
data in relation to the direct offer of information society services.

Within the limits of Regulation 2016/679, the LOPDGDD sets the age for
consent to the processing of data at the age of 14. Article 7 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, under the heading "Consent of minors", establishes:

               "1. The treatment of the personal data of a minor only
may be based on your consent when you are over fourteen years of age.
           The cases in which the law requires the attendance of the holders are excepted.
of parental authority for the celebration of the legal act or transaction in the context of which
consent for treatment is obtained.
         2. The treatment of the data of minors under fourteen years of age, based on the
consent, it will only be lawful if the consent of the holder of parental authority or guardianship is recorded, with
the scope determined by the holders of parental authority or guardianship.” (The underline is
of the AEPD)

The incidence of article 8 of the RGPD in the matter examined derives from the fact
that commercial bulletins sent through electronic means constitute
an information society service. In this sense, we refer to the definition
tion that Law 34/2002, on Services of the Information Society and Commerce
Electronic (LSSI) offers in its Annex:

“For the purposes of this Law, it shall be understood as:
a. Services of the information society or services: all services provided
normally for consideration, remotely or electronically and at individual request
of the recipient. (...) They are services of the information society, among others and

provided that they represent an economic activity, the following:

The contracting of goods and services electronically

1.

(...)

         4. Sending commercial communications.
        (...)” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

III

As stated in the list of Proven Facts, the page
www.banderacatalana.cat., in its "legal text" or privacy policy informs of the
identity of the data controller -A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1 - and their data
contact, providing your "fiscal address", located in ***LOCALIDAD.1, thus giving
compliance with the obligation imposed by article 13.1.a) of the RGPD.

          Section c), of article 13.1 RGPD requires that the person be informed of
who collects your personal data, at the time they are obtained, from
the purposes of the treatment and the legitimacy for the treatment of data that is going to be
realize. The website for which the complainant is responsible offers this information
through three sub-headings, which coincide with the three ways in which
plans to collect data from third parties: the “contact forms”; "mailing
emails” and “subscription to our newsletter”.

The privacy policy of the www.banderacatalana.cat informs that the database
legal treatment of the personal data of third parties that are collected when
these are registered in the commercial bulletin, treatment that will be specified in the sending
of the aforementioned newsletter, is "the consent" provided by the owner of the data
when you decide to subscribe to the newsletter. Therefore, the paragraph that the text
legal of the web page dedicated to the "Subscription to our newsletter" says that the
"Legitimation:" for the treatment is "The consent of the user when subscribing to
our commercial mailings or newsletter”. And with that said, the privacy policy
adds the following: “The provision of personal data requires a minimum age of
13 years or, where appropriate, have sufficient legal capacity to contract” (El
underlined is from the AEPD)

In short, the defendant reports on his website, www.banderacatalana.cat,
that to register in the newsletter of the company a minimum age of
13 years and, at the same time, also informs that the legal basis for the treatment of
data of who fills in the form of the newsletter is the consent
granted when completing said commercial bulletin.

It is evident, in light of articles 6.1.a) and 8 of the RGPD and 7 of the
LOPDGDD, that the information offered by the respondent regarding the consent
granted by minors for the processing of their data for the purpose of
provide them with an information society service - such as sending the newsletter
commercial by electronic means or SMS- violates the aforementioned provisions. Admit that a
under 13 years of age can sign up for your newsletter and protect the
treatment on the legal basis of article 6.1.a) RGPD is to attribute to minors under 13 years of age
the capacity to dispose of your data for the aforementioned purpose, capacity of which
lacks and that the law grants to minors who have reached 14 years of age.

Thus, given that the website for which the user is responsible
claimed provides information on the legality of data processing
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/11

of minors under 13 years of age that does not comply with the rules that regulate this
matter -article 6.1.a, related to article 8 RGPD and article 7 LOPDGDD- the
legal text or privacy policy of the website violates article 13.1.c) RGPD.

         The infringement of article 13.1.c) of the RGPD is typified in the article
83.5.b) of the RGPD, a provision that states: “Infringements of the provisions
following will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines
EUR 20,000,000 maximum, or in the case of a company, an amount
equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the
previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

a)(...)
b) the rights of the interested parties under articles 12 to 22

For prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD (article 72.1) qualifies as very serious, and
sets a three-year statute of limitations for it, the “h) The omission of the duty to
inform the affected party about the processing of their personal data in accordance with the
provided in articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this law
organic”.

IV

Article 58.2 RGPD establishes that "Each control authority will have
all the following corrective powers” among which he mentions, in addition to the fine
administrative (letter i) that of “ordering the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to
processing operations comply with the provisions of this
Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a certain period
specified…” (letter d)

At the same time, it should be noted that the imposition of the measure described in the
section d) of article 58.2. RGPD is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative, in accordance with the provisions of art. 83.2 of the RGPD according to which "in
depending on the circumstances of each individual case”, the administrative fines
may be imposed “on an additional basis”, that is, in conjunction with the measures
referred to in article 58.2, letters a) to h) and j).

It seems convenient to remember, in addition, that the RGPD introduces an infringing type
in which the typical behavior consists of not having complied with the corrective measures
imposed in their sanctioning resolutions by the control authority, that is, by
the AEPD. Thus, article 83.6 of the RGPD establishes that "Breach of the
resolutions of the supervisory authority in accordance with article 58, section 2,
shall be sanctioned in accordance with section 2 of this article with fines
administrative fees of a maximum of 20,000,000 euros or, in the case of a company,
of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover
of the previous year, opting for the highest amount"

A. In determining the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed on the
claimed, the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the
Regulation 2016/679.

In the present case, in determining the amount of the sanction of a fine for
the infringement typified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD attributed to the claimed party,
They appreciate, as aggravating factors, the following factors:

sedeagpd.gob.es

  

9/11

- The one described in article 83.2.b) RGPD, “The intention or negligence in the
infringement". It is accredited in the file (Proceeding of 10/31/2019) that, in that
date, the respondent already had the status of person in charge of the web page
Catalan flag.cat. On 11/19/2019 -date of the Certificate of Proof issued by
the data inspection in E/10868/2019- it is verified that the information that the
website provides continues to be wrong. Up to that date they had
More than eleven months have elapsed since the entry into force of Organic Law 3/2018
(what happens on 07/12/2018). Sufficient time in the opinion of this Agency so that the
responsible had adapted its privacy policy to current regulations.

The serious lack of diligence revealed by the defendant's conduct is
also manifest in that he necessarily had knowledge of the procedure
sanctioning promoted by this Agency against the previous person in charge of that same
website, for identical facts. Procedure that ended sanctioning the then
responsible -Grup B.C., S.L.- for the same breach of the RGPD. Just an obvious and very
serious lack of diligence on the part of the person responsible - close to fraud - can explain why, despite
your full knowledge that the information you offer violates the law, continue
publishing it.

- The circumstance described in article 83.2. k) of the RGPD, in relation to the
Article 76.f) of the LOPDGDD, which refers to "The affectation of the rights of
minors”. Failure to comply with the duty to inform under the terms of article 13.1.c)
RGPD, as stated in the Foundations of the resolution, has repercussions
directly in the treatment of data of minors -under 13 years of age
fulfilled - who are not authorized by law to dispose of their data with the
purpose of registering for newsletters through electronic means.
Circumstance that reveals a plus of illegality and guilt of the subject
offender.

B. Pursuant to article 58.2.d) GDPR is sanctioned with the consistent corrective measure
in ordering the respondent to remove from the website the information it publishes,
regarding the consent of minors under 13 years of age as a basis
legitimizing the treatment of your data through the subscription to the newsletter,
that violates the data protection regulations, and that provides information about
of the legitimizing basis of the processing of personal data obtained through the
registration in the newsletter by minors who comply with the provisions
in force.

The maximum period in which the claimed party must comply with this order is
of ten business days, which will be computed from the date on which the present
non-executive resolution.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: SANCTION A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction of article 13
RGPD -in relation to articles 6.1.a) and 8 RGPD and in relation, also, to the
article 7 LOPDGDD-, typified in article 83.5.b) RGPD, with an administrative fine
(according to article 58.2.i, RGPD) of €10,000 (ten thousand euros).
