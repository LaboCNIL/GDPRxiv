FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

In the present case, we proceed to examine the claim dated November 12
of 2020 by means of which the placement of a
video surveillance camera on the stone wall of the boundary between the properties of the
claimed and the claimant and that records the property of the latter.

The art. 5.1 c) of the RGPD provides that "Personal data will be adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (“data minimization”)”.

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems
installed comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with
all the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory sign
informative, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment in your case of the data
of a personal nature.

Article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that:

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
understood fulfilled by placing an informative device instead
sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding
intimidate neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as control areas
transit of the same without just cause.

Nor can images of public spaces be obtained with this type of device,
as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, which are seen
intimidated by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install imaging devices
of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

III

On March 15, 2021, a written statement was received from the respondent
stating that the installed system is of a simulated nature, that is, it does not obtain
any image fulfilling a mere dissuasive function.

Article 28.7 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common of Public Administrations (LPACAP, hereinafter) provides: "The
Interested parties will be responsible for the veracity of the documents they submit.

It should be noted that individuals can install cameras on their private property

avoiding intimidating third parties with said devices.

The accused party provides a document that proves the fictitious nature of the same

necessary to avoid intimidating third parties who are unaware of the character
fictitious of these, who may believe they are recorded by them, in such a way that they
should avoid its orientation towards public space.

Although in the past the AEPD has sanctioned data controllers for
use of this type of device, it is currently understood that the use of cameras
simulated does not imply an infringement of the fundamental right to data protection.

The Judgment of the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of November 7, 2019
declares that the installation of a fake video surveillance camera, apparently
identical to other fully operative ones, is likely to restrict the freedom of
third parties.

The TS reasons that when an individual does not know that he is being filmed,
behaves with a naturalness and spontaneity that would not occur otherwise. And that

question is operational or not, or whether "RCRE has replaced it with another fully
identical in appearance and functional.

Therefore, it must be taken into account that the behavior described in the event of
excessive can have consequences in other areas of law, being
It is advisable to take the necessary precautions to avoid excessive orientation
towards public space, limiting itself to the façade of the house to be protected.

Likewise, it is recommendable to follow the indications of the Forces and Bodies of the
locality, which can guide you in the matter if you need it, avoiding with
them new complaints about it.

IV

Based on the foregoing, it is proven that the camera is false, this
is, that it does not obtain any image of an identified or identifiable natural person, therefore
that since there is no processing of personal data, it cannot be said
administrative offense in the matter at hand.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
