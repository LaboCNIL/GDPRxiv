find out if mr. ,,, was it ***PROFESSION.1 or not, as he himself had let them know in
your emergency assistance. Said call that you should not have made given that the
sir… you appeared at our center as a user of your private health card, you
led to an internal investigation of the claimant, which has led to the claim
by the user to our hospital”.

part of its obligations presided over by good faith, in accordance with article 40.3 k of the
collective agreement of the sector, considering as a very serious offense the violation or

violation of secrets of obligatory reserve. This type includes any conduct
that reveals the pathological process of patients or that affects the privacy of
these.

of the RGPD, in accordance with article 83.5 a) of the RGPD.”
"For the purposes specified in the art. 64.2 b) of Law 39/2015, of 1/10, of the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations, (hereinafter, LPACAP) the

of the documents that make up said procedure, including the stamp of the Clinic and
an unnamed signature. Only the authorization is specified, and there is no effective
request by the DPD or any of the persons referred to.
On 05/01/2021, a new letter is received from the DPD, on behalf of the respondent,
entitled "authorization" in which it indicates that it "authorizes" two persons that it identifies,
HELAS CONSULTANTS, to submit a written statement, bearing the seal of the Clinic

used for the provision of medical care. Indicates that it was the claimant himself

condition” and that suspecting identity theft, the nurse proceeded to
call the ***INSTITUTION.1 and “they will take the appropriate measures as a member of the
State Security Forces and Bodies”, although he adds that the call was made “without

attendance.

of data of the patient that is imputed is carried out in an exceptional situation and caused

who attend a possible identity theft or risk situation, which leads them
to have an excess of zeal in communicating to the Security Forces and Bodies what
happened. The safety of the center, your personal safety, and that of your patient, who
was demanding the issuance of medicines of certain characteristics to the
which is very difficult to access and also using their status as a ***PROFESSION.1”.

In the context of the statements of the ***INSTITUTION.1 there is no evidence that this file
intern has been opened as a consequence of the call but of his antecedents
jobs of which they are unaware.”
-The defendant has adopted a series of measures, the legal services and the
labor department in case any responsibility was deduced from the center of their
professionals and a procedure was started for the inmate that ended with a reprimand for

1) The claimant, (...), went on ***DATE.1 to the emergency room of the Hospital
“HOSPITEN, from ***LOCALIDAD.1 where his medication was previously dispensed by the
doctor who was not there that day, with Dr. B.B.B. appearing in her place, who was the first
time I visited him. The claimant was identified through the health card and
from the time he showed up, 1:40 p.m., according to the attendance record, according to the
Doctor. stated before the ***INSTITUTION.1 (subsequently, on ***DATE.5 declares in
within the disciplinary file against the claimant) instilled suspicion in him for his
appearance: “he was wearing a white T-shirt with an open vest on the back of which
the letters ***PROFESSION.1 appeared in reflective form, as well as a plaque hanging from the
neck that did not look like a real plate with a shield whose symbology he could not recognize.”
His colleague at the reception told him that he required regular medication that
usually another doctor did. According to the doctor's statement, she checked the history

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

The RGPD defines in its article 4:

2) “processing”: any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not,
such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or
modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or
any other form of authorization of access, collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or
destruction;

7) “controller” or “controller”: the natural or legal person, authority
public, service or other body that, alone or jointly with others, determines the ends and means
of the treatment; if the law of the Union or of the Member States determines the purposes and
means of treatment, the person responsible for treatment or the specific criteria for its
appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the Member States;”

The LOPGDD in its article 70 "Sanctioning regime", determines in its number 1.a) that
"They are subject to the sanctioning regime established in the RGPD and in this law
organic: a) Those responsible for the treatment”.

The distinction between data controller and employee is derived from the GDPR,
for example when referring to the Data Protection Officer, in its recital 97: "...
Such data protection officers, whether or not they are employees of the data controller
treatment”, and its functions in article 39 of the RGPD “a) inform and advise the
responsible or in charge of the treatment and the employees who deal with the
treatment of the obligations incumbent on them under this Regulation and
other data protection provisions of the Union or of the Member States;”.
By this, it is meant that the positions or employees of the data controller, at
carry out personal data processing in the performance of their duties,
are in the circle of the data controller, who is the one who must establish
guidelines and dissemination of information so as to achieve uniform application in
the way of acting in the development of tasks related to data processing. The
habitual performance and the routines ordered by the person in charge in the exercise of their
functions such as uniformity in the answers and the tasks to be carried out in matters
related to data protection thus takes on special relevance.

The distinction between data controller and employee of the latter is derived from the GDPR, which
has the effect of being empowered to process personal data under its authority and on its behalf.
bre

With this, it is meant that both the decision-making positions of responsibility and the employers
employees acting on behalf of the data controller, when carrying out data processing
of personal data in the performance of their duties, within their structure.
ra, they are in the circle of power of direction and action of said person in charge of the treat-
also in what affects the implementation of its data protection policy
(data governance).

III

Regarding the call to verify the claimant's identity, although it seems that previously
identifies the patient or could have been identified for the purpose for which he comes to the
consultation, it means that the doctor was able to access his history and verify that it was the same,
unaware of the need for the call to the ***INSTITUTION.1.
Predictably, the antecedents would be exposed, so that they gave rise to motivation to
carry out the confidential information that happens later. This identification gives rise to
that the ***INSTITUTION.1 knows at least that he was in the emergency room, and
added circumstances that motivate that, according to the claimed, the next day
start reserved actions. This supposes on the part of the claimed a violation of the
article 5.1.b) of the RGPD that indicates:

"1. The personal data will be:

b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; according to article 89,
section 1, further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the interest
public, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered
incompatible with the original purposes (“purpose limitation”)”

Knowing the identity of the claimant, appearing in the doctor's account to the
***INSTITUTION.1 that had seen the clinical history before, the known data is connected
to, in a telephone call, identify the claimant, a circumstance that is achieved in
positive sense. Presumably, mere identification through name would not lead to
that the next day informative proceedings be initiated, but presumably,
thanks to the alleged behavior or idea that they seemed to observe, led to adding
informative elements to the account of events, otherwise, it cannot be explained that letters are taken
in the matter by the ***INSTITUTION.1. the caller.

The facts referring to the feeling that the claimant instilled in the doctor and the
nurse does not imply that the infraction has not been committed, nor does it exonerate the commission of
the same, being accredited that the personal data with which it is used to
identify you, they are not the purposes for which they should be treated in a consultation assistance
medical.

IV

11/16

The statements that the doctor makes before the ***INSTITUTION.1, within a
disciplinary administrative procedure, being warned of its purpose, although it does not appear
in writing, supposedly verbally, contain the following elements:
-It is reiterated that the call was made to the ***INSTITUTION.1 to verify if it was
***PROFESSION.1, appearing before: "That the claimant verified the history of said
person and his appearance aroused suspicion.”
“That at that time, the aforementioned person showed the deponent the medication he was taking,
in the case of a hypertensive, an anxiolytic and an antidepressant and wanted the respondent to
prescribe the same medications through ISFAS prescriptions”.

This implies a violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD by the claimed party, which
states: “The personal data will be:
processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss,
accidental destruction or damage, through the application of technical or organizational measures
appropriate (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In relation to article 5 of the LOPDGDD, which determines:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all persons
that intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality to the
referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the
duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained even when
the relationship of the obligor with the person responsible or in charge of the treatment had ended.

This infraction may be related to the complement of measures that must be contained
to guarantee confidentiality, established in article 32 of the RGPD, which states:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the nature,
the scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of probability and
variable seriousness for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person in charge and
The person in charge of the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to
guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience

permanent treatment systems and services;

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular account shall be taken
the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as a consequence of the
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of transmitted personal data,
stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such
data.

4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to guarantee that
any person acting under the authority of the person in charge or the person in charge and
access to personal data can only process said data following instructions from the
responsible, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of Union Law or the
Member states."

Recital 74 of the RGPD says that it indicates: "The responsibility must be established
of the person in charge of the treatment for any treatment of personal data carried out by
himself or on his own. In particular, the person responsible must be obliged to apply
timely and effective measures and must be able to demonstrate the conformity of the activities of
treatment with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures
must take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment as well
as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.” .

Likewise, it must be emphasized that the cause of the disclosure of the data by the
Doctora has no relation to the commission of crime or investigation. Nor the
request that he makes of collaboration to the claimed one contains no element that indicates in
that sense. It is an administrative collaboration within a procedure
tending to purge possible responsibilities that concern the behavior of the
claimant, as a result of what was reported in the call on the day of the consultation, for which it was
summoned to testify the doctor. The vague "administrative assistance" reported to the
doctor verbally, indirectly alludes to a disciplinary procedure. Except test in

Article 5 of the RGPD refers to the principles related to the processing of personal data, and
in its number 2, to proactive responsibility, in the sense that the person responsible for the treatment
will be responsible for compliance with the aforementioned principles, and capable of demonstrating it,
known as "compliance" which could be equivalent to, not only regulatory compliance in this
case, but also in prevention and responsibility of the members that make up your organization.

With the RGPD, anticipation of the infringement or injury of rights is sought, compliance
in advance to avoid injury or infringement of the right or freedom of the interested party. Yes
Well, the RGPD/LOPDGDD binomial does not specifically list what those measures are,
It is especially linked to the protection of the data of natural persons, demanding a
proactive responsibility, and not a reactive responsibility, as it happened in the model
previous. This proactive focus on the “permanent implementation” of the measures implies
that they are no longer static (as in the previous model), but dynamic.

Consequently, proactive responsibility is required, rather than
reactive (risk-based approach), having to act preventively, having the
due diligence to avoid unwanted processing or breaches in the protection of
the interests of citizens in the field of privacy.

In this case, it is estimated, according to the proven facts, that there were enough
elements provided for the processing of data with guarantees in terms of forecasting of the
existing risks, dissemination of information on data protection to staff,
concurring in addition an active occupation in the recorded incident and its follow-up.

Law 40/2015, of 1/10 of the Law on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, states in its article
the 28.1 and 4:

"1. They may only be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative infraction
natural and legal persons, as well as, when a Law recognizes them capacity to act,
affected groups, unions and entities without legal personality and estates
independent or autonomous, who are responsible for them by way of fraud or
fault."

"4. The regulatory laws of the different sanctioning regimes may classify as
infraction breach of the obligation to prevent the commission of infractions
administrative by those who are subject to a relationship of dependency or bond.
Likewise, they may provide for the cases in which certain persons will be responsible for the payment
of the pecuniary sanctions imposed on those who depend on them or are linked to them.”

And in article 29.3.a):

"3. In the normative determination of the sanctioning regime, as well as in the imposition of
sanctions by the Public Administrations, the due suitability and
necessity of the sanction to be imposed and its adequacy to the seriousness of the constitutive act of the

a) The degree of culpability or the existence of intent”

“That an administrative infraction could not be considered committed, if the
subjective element of guilt or what is the same, if the behavior typically constitutive
administrative infraction, was not attributable to intent or fault. It should be noted that the principle
of guilt prevents the admission in the sanctioning administrative law of the
Strict liability, it is also true, that the absence of intentionality results
secondary since this type of infraction is normally committed for an act
guilty or negligent, which is enough to integrate the subjective element of guilt.
From the material point of view, culpability consists in the ability of the subject
obliged to act differently and, therefore, in accordance with the legal system.
Therefore, what is relevant is the diligence displayed in the action by the subject, in this case the
responsible for the treatment, as indicated in article 70.1.a) of the LOPDGDD, which is
accredited, excluding the imposition of a sanction solely based on the mere result,
that is, to the principle of strict liability.
Considering the nature and type of the infraction, the circumstances that occurred in that
moment, taking into account the principle of guilt and proactivity, it is not considered
that the behaviors carried out by the employees of the defendant, is required
any responsibility to this, or stop the damage of the sanction, since it is not possible
to demand from the defendant a different way of acting than the one she has had, insofar as the framework
of compliance is reasonably adequate for the assurance of the measures
