RESULT OF INVESTIGATION ACTIONS

In order to investigate the occurrence of the events described, on March 14
of 2022, a request for information was made to the outgoing marketer and dated
March 16, 2022 to dealer.
The responses to these requirements were entered into the electronic headquarters of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection dated April 7, 2022, the response
of the distributor, and dated April 13, 2022, the response of the marketer
outgoing.
Manifestations that are collected in the answers
The distributor shows that:
- Any contractual modification that a marketer requests from a
distributor is made through XML digital requests complying with the formats
of exchange between agents established by the CNMC.

- The communication channel is the Supply Point Management web portal
where the exchange of XML files is carried out, to which they only have
accesses i-DE itself and the marketing companies.

- The distributor is a mere executor of these requests as long as they comply with
certain technical conditions and the formats themselves, so this does not
makes value judgments about whether a change of marketer, a change of owner
or both, are from within the habitual and contractual relationship between the
client and the marketing company, nor does it receive any kind of
supporting documentation of the signing of the contract between the end customer and the
marketer.

- In a request for a change of vendor with a change of owner, since it is a
strictly administrative request, no type of documentation is requested

of Commissioning (APM) or similar, and therefore it is enough with the own
XML request that has legal validity for all purposes.

The outgoing marketer shows that:
- As an outgoing marketer, you do not have any control over the change of a

your customer to another vendor.

- The only agent that interacts with the outgoing marketer is the distributor,
without the incoming marketer or the customer interacting with the
outgoing marketer.
The only information you received in connection with the change (subject of this
Expediente) is the XML message from the distributor "low by marketer
outgoing" that it keeps and custody together with the rest of the documentation

-

On April 21, 2022, information was requested from the incoming marketer and with
dates May 13 and 19, 2022 your response was entered in the electronic headquarters and in
the Agency register, respectively.

 Request for supply address and CUPS
 

 

The telephone recording is provided in which the contracting of electricity is carried out by
part of the new owner for his new habitual residence and in the conversation that
maintained with the agent of the incoming marketer provides the following information:

- CUPS, other than the CUPS of the home owned by the claimant.
- Supply point address: “***ADDRESS.1, they put ***FLAT.2,
but actually in ***FLAT.2 there is ***FLAT.2 A, ***FLAT.2 left, and
***FLOOR.2 right and I'm on ***FLOOR.1”, reiterates “***FLOOR.1”, adds
"There must have been an error when making the contract and they put ***PISO.2 and
here in the *** FLAT. 2 live two people who are not me, they are two neighbors
different” and repeats the address again: “***ADDRESS.1, ***FLOOR.1”.

In relation to the address of the supply point provided by the new holder, the
The incoming marketer indicates and documents that in the portal that the
distributor makes available to the incoming marketer to make the request for
change of marketer, in relation to the farm ***ADDRESS.1 there are two
references: ***REFERENCE.1 and ***REFERENCE.2.

The supply address that appears when selecting ***REFERENCE.1 is

And additionally, it adds as "Possible cause of the facts that motivate the
request":

After making the appropriate checks regarding this case,
we have located what we suspect may be the origin of the events that
have given rise to this information requirement.

As the new owner indicates in the call, in the contract with Iberdrola the
address that appears is that of "***PISO.2" and specifies on several occasions that the
correct door would be the "basement - patio".
As can be seen in the portal that the distributor makes available to
the marketer for the management of its activities in relation to the farm
***ADDRESS.1, there are 2 references ***REFERENCE.1 and ***REFERENCE.2.
That is, the addresses associated with the CUPS are exchanged, so
that in the CUPS ending in 07HV the address that appears in the distributor is
***ADDRESS.1 ESC. 1 ***PISO.2 and the CUPS that ends in 04HZ is the one that
it appears in the distributor as basement 1, so there could be an error
human when processing the switching.

2021 and it is verified that the address of the supply point and the CUPS code that
includes are those of the home owned by the claimant.



The distributor points out and documented that on November 8,
2021, the incoming marketer made a request to change the marketer without
change of owner and that was rejected by the distributor because the owner provided in the
itself was the new owner, not coinciding with the owner that was current to the
distributor up to that time, the complaining party.
In the XML request that the incoming marketer exchanged with the distributor the
The data provided is the data of the new owner and the CUPS of the property owned
of the complaining party.
The incoming marketer conveys in his response that, after the objection of the
distributor to the change of marketer, on November 9, 2021 requested the new
holder verification of the data provided.
And it provides a screenshot addressed to the new owner with the following information:
WE NEED A VERIFICATION
We have managed your registration request with the distributor in your area, distributor, and
informs us that the current contract is not in your name.
We need to confirm that the supply point located in “C/

electricity bills were in someone else's name.
Could you check it please?
It is important that you provide us with the CUPS, which is on any of your invoices.

The response of the new owner to this request is not provided.
Likewise, the inbound marketer adds in his response:
"The new CUPS should have been verified, through a new contribution of the same by the
client, otherwise it would not have been activated. This is how it is explained in the
procedure followed by our contractors, that in order to relaunch switching the
client must say the CUPS in a clear and precise way. This call was made by
one of our regular platforms, Global Sales Solutions (GSS) belonging to
to the Covisian Group, a call that was coded as follows:
SFID: GS002004, 11/09/2021, 18:24:01
When requesting the call from GSS in order to contribute it to this procedure,
They tell us that they cannot locate it and that this may be due to human error, moreover,
we are informed that the agent responsible for that call was removed from service with

And it provides a screenshot of the email received from Covisian, dated 11
May 2022, in which he is informed of what is indicated in the previous paragraph.
On November 10, 2021, the incoming marketer requested from the distributor
a change of vendor together with a change of owner in the name of the new
headline.
In the XML request that the incoming marketer exchanged with the distributor the

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

breached obligation

The claimed party is accused of committing an offense for violation of the
article 6.1 of the GDPR.

Article 6 of the GDPR, ***PISO.2, the heading "Legality of processing", details in its
section 1 the cases in which data processing is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said

interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

In turn, article 6.1 of the LOPDGDD, indicates, on the treatment of data
based on the consent of the affected party that: “1. In accordance with
provided in article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is understood by
consent of the affected any manifestation of free, specific,
informed and unequivocal by which he accepts, either by means of a declaration or a
clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him (…)”.

Classification of the infringement of article 6 of the GDPR

II

The violation of article 6 for which the party claimed in the
this initiation agreement is typified in article 83 of the GDPR that,
*** FLOOR.2 the heading "General conditions for the imposition of fines
administrative”.

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
overall annual total business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9”.

The LOPDGDD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to start the disciplinary procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the facts exposed could suppose the violation of
the provisions of article 6.1 of the GDPR.

The documentation in the file shows that the conduct of the
claimed party (incoming marketer) contrary to the principle of legality, has
consisted
where on November 10, 2021, the incoming marketer requested the distributor
a change of vendor together with a change of owner in the name of the new
headline.
Thus, it turns out that the incoming marketer exchanged with the distributor the
data of the supply point, address and CUPS code, of the home owned by the
complaining party. The change became effective on November 11, 2021.
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

9/17

It should be noted that the electricity supply contract signed by the
new owner with the party claimed on November 8, 2021, the data of the
supply point, address and CUPS code, which are included are those of the home
property of the complaining party.

Likewise, the claimed party (incoming marketer) does not certify that the new
owner will provide, within the framework of the contracting of energy services, the code
CUPS of the home owned by the claimant. It must be specified that the new
owner provided the number of the CUPS for whose supply point he wanted to hire the
electric power.

On the other hand, the defendant states that "This call was made by one of the
our usual platforms, Global Sales Solutions (GSS) belonging to the Group
Covisian, a call that was coded as follows:
SFID: GS002004, 11/09/2021, 18:24:01
When requesting the call from GSS in order to contribute it to this procedure,
They tell us that they cannot locate it and that this may be due to human error, moreover,
we are informed that the agent responsible for that call was removed from service with
dated November 16 for malpractice whose nature has not been revealed to us.”
Given the foregoing, it should be added that, of the circumstances listed in article 6.1
of the GDPR on which a priori the legality of the treatment carried out by the
claimed party, the only one that could be invoked as a legal basis for the treatment
carried out would be section b): "the treatment is necessary for the execution of a
contract in which the interested party is a party or for the application at his request of
pre-contractual measures;”

This circumstance legitimizes the processing of data concerning the party
in a contract and that it is necessary for its performance or it is necessary to deal with
pre-contractual character. In no case can it serve as a basis for processing data
unrelated to who is a party to the contract, for what is of interest here, a number of CUPS
that does not correspond to the supply point of the home for which the customer requests
to the claimed party contracting the electricity supply, but is associated with
the home of a third party, the claimant.

Article 5.2. of the GDPR includes the principle of proactive responsibility by virtue of the
which the person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate compliance. The principle of proactivity
transfers to the data controller the obligation not only to observe the
principles that preside over the treatment, also that of being able to demonstrate said
compliance.

Article 5.2 of the GDPR is developed in article 24 of the GDPR which obliges the
responsible for adopting the technical and organizational measures that are appropriate
"to guarantee and be able to demonstrate" that the treatment has been in accordance with the GDPR.
The precept establishes:

"Responsibility of the data controller"

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/17

"1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as risks of varying probability and severity for
rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to
Demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with this Regulation. said
measures will be reviewed and updated when necessary.

2. When they are provided in relation to the treatment activities,
the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the application, for
part of the person responsible for the treatment, of the appropriate protection policies
of data.

3. Adherence to codes of conduct approved under article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may be
used as elements to demonstrate compliance with obligations
by the controller."

In the event that we examine the data controller the claimed party
should have implemented organizational measures that would allow it to guarantee the legality
of the treatment carried out: that the personal data processed really concerned
your client and not to third parties, because only in such case the treatment could
be based on the legal basis of article 6.1.b) of the GDPR and considered lawful. Was
obliged to verify and be able to prove that its client, as a result of a
transfer of use, whatever the legal title that protected it, was the new
user of the dwelling corresponding to the supply point and that the CUPS that was going to
to treat coincided with that of the supply point for which the client requested to contract.

The verification of these extremes and the obtaining and conservation of the
documentation proving it was a necessary measure in accordance with article
6.1 in connection with article 5.2 of the GDPR, since, as explained, if the
CUPS data is inaccurate and does not coincide with that of the household supply point
of the client of the incoming marketer its treatment is not lawful, at least the
The legal basis of this treatment cannot be the circumstance of section b) of the
article 6.1. of the GDPR.

As indicated, article 24 of the GDPR, which develops article 5.2, obliges the
controller to adopt the technical and organizational measures that
are adequate to "guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with
with this Regulation" and sends to assess the need and suitability of the
measures to these criteria: the "nature", the scope, the context and the purposes of the
treatment” and “the risks [....] for the rights and freedoms of natural persons”.

When an electricity retailer manages at the request of a client a change of
supplier for a given point of supply processes various data
information of your new customer, including the CUPS data of the supply point and
the treatment carried out has an impact on the information that is transferred to the
information on supply points (SIPS) of the zone distributor. If, furthermore, as
here has happened, the marketer manages before the distributor, as
representative of the incoming client, a change of ownership of the CUPS, the scope of the
treatment has an extraordinary relevance for the SIPS and a great risk for the patients.

rights of clients in the event that the CUPS does not correspond to that of the point of
incoming customer supply.

In short, the particular nature and scope of the personal data processed with
occasion of the management of change of marketer with and without simultaneous change
owner, the purpose pursued with that treatment and the risks that its
treatment may involve the rights of third parties, determines that the
trading companies are obliged to adopt the organizational and technical measures
suitable to guarantee compliance with the obligations imposed by the GDPR.

In accordance with the evidence available at this stage of agreement of
start of the disciplinary procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the investigation,
it is concluded that the claimed party could have committed a violation of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD, since, on the occasion of a change of marketer with
simultaneous change of owner that his client requested, he treated without any legal basis the
Data from the electrical CUPS code of the claimant's home.

in article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, in a
