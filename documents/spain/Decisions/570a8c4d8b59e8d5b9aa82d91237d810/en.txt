Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Re-
General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each authori-
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The formal procedures
ted by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a sub-
sidiario, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

The video-surveillance systems can obtain, according to sound characteristics
of what happens in "common" areas reaching the recording of conversations of
private nature, this being a disproportionate measure when carrying out a "treatment

The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the content of art. 5.1 c) RGPD, by being able to obtain with
the same (s) recordings of a private nature, without just cause for it.

According to article 72 LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) “Infractions considered

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided in
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the

that includes open and closed spaces where the video camera circuit is
operative.

The facts described above imply an affectation to the content of the article
13 RGPD, as the informative poster lacks an effective address to which you can

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of their
personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this organic law.

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: “Infringements of the following provisions

as well as the absence of previous infractions, being also a support measure
given by the Community of owners, to impose a penalty of €600 (€300+€300),
due to the affectation of articles 5 and 13 RGPD, previously mentioned.

The text of the resolution establishes the infractions committed and
the facts that have given rise to the violation of the data protection regulations
these, from which it is clearly inferred what the measures to be adopted are, without prejudice to
that the type of procedures, mechanisms or concrete instruments to implement
tar them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is the person in charge of the treatment who
fully knows his organization and has to decide, based on the responsibility pro-
active and in risk approach, how to comply with the RGPD and the LOPDGDD.

Remember that not meeting the requirements of this body can be considered
considered as a new administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD,
typified as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the
opening of a subsequent sanctioning administrative proceeding.
