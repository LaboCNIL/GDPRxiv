"MONTALITROS" report is received in this Agency, dated May 29, 2019, in
which, among other extremes, indicates that:

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that articles 55.1, 56.2 and 58.2. b) and d) of the RGPD
recognize each control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and
48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
is competent to resolve this procedure.

Yo

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The capturing of images of natural persons identified or identifiable through
through video surveillance cameras, or other capture systems, with the
purpose of guaranteeing the safety of people, goods and facilities constitutes a
Treatment of personal data.

The treatment of images through a video surveillance system to be
In accordance with current data protection regulations, you must respect the
principles of limitation of the purpose and minimization of data collected by the
sections b) and c) of article 5.1 of the RGPD.

In this case, it is elucidated whether the processing of images for the purpose of
video surveillance carried out by the defendant could exceed the private sphere of the
establishment of public attendance of its ownership. Note that the
video surveillance cameras installed for security purposes in private spaces not
can capture images of public spaces, since in accordance with the Law
Organic 4/1997, of August 4, which regulates the use of video cameras
by the Security Forces and Corps, and its Development Regulations, approved
by means of Royal Decree 596/1999, of April 16, the capturing of images of the road
for security purposes must be carried out by the Police Forces and Bodies
Security.

Just as the person responsible for processing for video surveillance purposes does not
can capture private spaces owned by third parties without the consent of their
holders or, as the case may be, of the people who are in them, cannot
treat images of the public road for security purposes as it is a treatment
reserved for the Security Forces and Bodies.

Therefore, the data controller for video surveillance purposes must
adopt the necessary measures so that the cameras are oriented towards the spaces
private individuals under surveillance.

However, on some occasions the protection of private spaces is only
it is possible if the cameras are located in spaces such as facades. Sometimes also
it is necessary to capture the accesses, doors or entrances, so that, although the
camera is inside the building, it is impossible not to record minimum and
essential of the public road, which is inevitably captured. By what is
exception is applicable, there should be no possibility of alternative installation.
Bearing in mind that:

- The person responsible for processing the data carried out through cameras and/or
video cameras will adapt the use of the installation, so that the impact on the
rights of pedestrians is the minimum possible.

9/15

- In no case will the use of surveillance practices be admitted beyond the
environment object of the installation and in particular, not being able to affect the spaces
surrounding public, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the
guarded space.

- In any case, any unnecessary data processing should be avoided in order to

the purpose pursued.

However, from the assessment of the set of evidence elements
in the procedure, it follows that the defendant, responsible for the treatment of
images resulting from the video surveillance system installed in the establishment of
ownership, captures images of the public road through the two cameras of
video surveillance placed on the main and rear facades of the premises, which
are also recorded.

This conduct leads to imputing the defendant the violation of the provisions of the
article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which establishes, with respect to the “Principles related to the
treatment”, the following:

"1. The personal data will be:
c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization");

For its part, article 22 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading “Treatments with

video surveillance purposes”, it establishes in its sections 1, 2 and 5 that:

"1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the
purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
installations.

2. Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that

is essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.

However, it will be possible to capture the public road in an extension
superior when necessary to guarantee the security of goods or
strategic installations or infrastructures linked to transport, without
In no case may it involve capturing images of the interior of a home
private.

(…)
5. Under article 2.2.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is considered
excluded from its scope of application the treatment by a natural person of images
that only captures the interior of their own home.

This exclusion does not cover processing carried out by a security entity
private that had been contracted for the surveillance of a home and had access
to the images”

  
In this case, from the set of documentation in the procedure,
especially the videos contained in the files provided in the testing phase by

III

the defendant showing the captured images, at 5:25 p.m. on the 7th of
February 2019, for each of the two video surveillance cameras located in the
front (main) and rear facade of the Musical Bar "MONTALITROS", it is evidenced
that the treatment carried out by the defendant affects several meters of the road
public area adjacent or surrounding said facades.

These images show that the camera located on the main facade does not
I was just focusing and capturing images of the window and the front door of the
local, but also collected the width of the entire sidewalk at the height of the
***ADDRESS 1. For its part, the camera placed on the rear facade, which overlooks the
***ADDRESS.2 of ***CITY COUNCIL.1, collected several meters from the sidewalk
surrounding the facade that reaches to the door.

Consequently, the documentary evidence provided by the respondent
undermines his allegation that “The installed video surveillance cameras capture
minimum the essential space of the public thoroughfare necessary for the purpose of
surveillance and security of the establishment”, and proves the existence of the conduct
offending

The respondent has not justified in any way that said treatment, which
involves the capture, storage and recording of images, including
images of pedestrians passing by
  through the video-monitored area,
essential for the intended surveillance and security purposes or that is
impossible to avoid due to the location of the cameras, which could be
reoriented to focus only on the minimum and essential perimeter space
of the public road adjacent to the facades and front and rear access doors
to the premises, thus avoiding collecting images of public roads with a range greater than
necessary to achieve the aforementioned purposes.

Consequently, it is considered to constitute a disproportionate treatment and
unnecessary personal data concerning customers and passers-by who
transit or remain through the spaces of the public thoroughfare captured by each of
the aforementioned video surveillance cameras, as evidenced by the two files provided
by the claim that they show how these exterior cameras focused several
meters from the public road.

In parallel, from the statements and documentation provided by the
claimed in the evidence phase, it is evident that he has not reoriented the
external cameras in order to avoid the disproportionate treatment of images with
personal data from the area of public roads captured, which occupies several
meters from the aforementioned streets

On the other hand, from the content of the report sent on May 29,
2019 by the Local Police of the City Council of *** TOWN HALL.1 follows
that the two aforementioned cameras were not only still installed in the aforementioned premises with
dated May 18, 2019, but were still working. Thus, in the said report
figure that during the aforementioned police action the sole administrator of the company
owner of the establishment “when asked by the Agents involved as to whether the
cameras were for viewing or recording, he stated that they were for recording and that the
images were collected on a hard drive that was in a ship of the
company, without specifying its location.

11/15

In relation to said police report, it is pointed out that article 77.5 of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations, under the heading "Means and trial period", provides the
next: “5. The documents formalized by the officials who are recognized
the condition of authority and in which, observing the legal requirements
corresponding the facts verified by those are gathered will prove of
unless proven otherwise”.

In any case, the defendant in his brief of allegations to the proposal for
resolution has not accredited by any means of proof the manifestations
poured into it. In particular, given its direct link to the events
analysed, has not proven the assertions that after the 18th of
May 2019, the two video surveillance cameras located in the
front and rear facades of the establishment, just as it has not been credited in
in any way that said devices have stopped capturing images or accredited
the date on which they began to perform a merely deterrent function.

Consequently, of the set of evidence items available in the
procedure, it is considered that the defendant violates the principle of minimization of
data collected in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD when capturing through the two cameras
located on each of the facades of the establishment images of the roads
surrounding the place where the two entrances are located and, consequently,
of pedestrians passing through these public areas adjacent to the entrances and
to the main and rear facades of the establishment, since said
processing of personal data from public roads, in addition to being
exclusive jurisdiction of the Security Forces and Corps, is inappropriate and
excessive by capturing, disproportionately, images of natural persons who
are found in it, when said information, which is kept recorded by
periods of 20 days, it is unnecessary to fulfill the purpose of video surveillance
claimed with respect to persons, property and facilities within the
establishment.

IV

For the purposes of determining the sanction that could entail the

mentioned infraction, the following precepts must be taken into account:

Sections b), d) and i) of article 58.2 of the RGPD provide the following:
“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with

For its part, article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD establishes that:
