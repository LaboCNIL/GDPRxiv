Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The formal procedures
ted by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a sub-
sidiario, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

In the present case, the claim dated 09/30/20 is examined by me-
gave from which is transferred as the main fact:

“presence of a series of cameras that, according to a statement by the claimant,

could affect the rights of third parties without just cause” (folio nº 1).

filed any complaint with the local Security Forces and Bodies for
the facts described.

On 12/09/21, a communication was received from the AET communicating new data
identification data of the claimed party—C.P. ***COMUNIDAD.1 with NIF ***NIF.1, which
justifies the initiation of this procedure in order to determine the alleged in-

art. 5.1 c) RGPD (regulations currently in force) that provides: "Personal data
they will be:

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed (“data minimization”) (…)”.

Likewise, in the case of false cameras, they must be oriented
to a private area, avoiding intimidation of neighboring neighbors who are unaware

Another of the obligations involved in the use of video surveillance for security purposes
ity, in relation to data protection, is to comply with the right to information,
by means of an informative badge.

To facilitate the adaptation of the treatments to the provisions of the RGPD, the AEPD has
edited the Guide for compliance with the duty to inform, in which it is explained how
comply with this right, through the so-called "two-layer" system, due to the
type of information that must be provided by those responsible in relation to the different
processing of personal data of the interested parties that they carry out.

III

At the request of this body, the collaboration of the Forces and Corps is requested.
Security Office (Bilbao City Council) that in the Report on the date of entry in this
Agency 05/05/22 confirm after going to the scene of the events the presence of at
least two exterior cameras although "without operation".

“Record that the person identified stated that said cameras were un-

connected and not working” (folio nº 1 Report dated 03/30/22).

Article 77 section 5 of Law 39/2015 (October 1) provides the following:
"5. The documents formalized by the officials who are recognized as
authority and in which, observing the corresponding legal requirements
the facts verified by those are collected will prove them unless they are
prove the contrary”.

On this aspect, remember that this Agency only analyzes behaviors
that involve a "data processing" outside the cases permitted by the regulations
in force, not being the same according to the outlined report: in operation in the
current moment.

Although in the past the AEPD has sanctioned data controllers for
use of this type of device, it is currently understood that the use of simulated cameras
ladas does not imply an infringement of the fundamental right to data protection.

Article 22 section 2 of the LOPDGDD (Lo 3/2018, December 5) provides:
“Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that it is impressive.

The party complained against has not directly clarified in the corresponding
written the cause of the installation, beyond the brief police observation of motives
You video-surveillance of the passage according to the purpose of this type of device.

After analyzing the photograph (s) presented, it is possible to specify the minimum bad
orientation of the same, as they are oriented towards public space and adjacent road,
making passers-by “discomfort”, so it would be advisable to reorient
of it, minimizing the impact of its presence.

gives.

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and has
to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its
manifestations, is conditioned to the test game and to a procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended.

Pursuant to this principle, no penalty may be imposed on the basis of the
guilt of the accused if there is no activity to prove the charge, which in the
appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).

IV

Based on the foregoing, it can be concluded that the operability of the
cameras, much less an illicit processing of personal data associated with

exposed could have repercussions in other branches of law, reasons all
they who advise to propose the File of the present administrative procedure, if
well with the recommendation of a minimum reorientation of the camera in question towards
cia minimum private space necessary.

However, it is warned that not meeting the requirements of this body may
be considered as an administrative infraction in accordance with the provisions of the
RGPD, typified as an infringement in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such con-
conducts the opening of a subsequent sanctioning administrative proceeding, given that
this Agency has already expressed itself on the advisability of reorienting the camera if
well as little as possible.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection Regulation RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the ARCHIVE of these proceedings as they are not accredited
