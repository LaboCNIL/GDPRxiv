the minutes of the meetings of August 2019 in which he is designated as a member of the board

prove that it belongs to the entity.
He stated on 04/09/2021, that in the course of the disciplinary procedure, in allegations
made on 03/14/2020 provided as a documentary the appointment of A.A.A. as a member
of the Board of Directors of the Club.

-2.2 If you have any protocol that has been disseminated to Club staff regarding
communication of minutes of the General Assembly.
He stated that he complies with the regulations of the RGPD and the Club's staff is prohibited from
communication of data to third parties outside the entity. They only have access to
documentation of the Club the members of the entity. They reproduce article 11.2.d of their
statutes stating:
Member Rights:
The following will be the rights of the partners in any case:
Have access to club documentation.” However, what they have strictly

State that it was a mistake. “The intention of A.A.A. was to send that email to himself
from your ***EMAIL.4… address to your other ***EMAIL.5… address that you use
to save documentation and have it better classified.” Due to an inadvertent error when searching
his email due to his lack of skill with the IPad device he had purchased
recently at that time, he was wrong to mark the initial, and instead of the i, mark the
initial e, appearing the two email addresses of ***EMAIL.1 and
***EMAIL.3 I had recorded in the email. The reason they were
recorded in the email those two addresses, it is because in another previous time
he belonged to the LNFS itself and had a relationship with both professionals.

It reiterates that the 02/14/2020 email from A.A.A. lacked a message, it was empty of
contents, as it shows that in sending the email to said recipients
not even a short courtesy message was written.

GDPR.”

No objections are received against the proposal.

NINTH: Of the actions carried out in this procedure and the
documentation in the file, the following have been accredited:

PROVEN FACTS

1) The LNFS, in accordance with its Statutes, is a private sports Association with a
national. It is endowed with its own legal personality independent of its associates,
all Sports Clubs (32), which participate in official futsal competitions,
whose first team militates in sports categories organized by it.

2) On 07/11/2019, the Ordinary General Assembly of the LNFS was held. At the meeting,
the participants had additional documentation previously delivered, as
It follows from the fourth point: ”report activities season 17/18”” printed in the
documentation delivered”, fifth: “progress of closing the budget and financial statements
of the finished season”, existing in the point of the sixth agenda: “proposal and
Approval, if applicable, of the budget for the 2018-2019 season.” It also appears that in
A meeting the day before explained aspects such as the presentation of the draft
activities for season 18-19 (seventh point). All votes cast
unanimously approved.

3) The claimant indicates that A.A.A., for short A.A.A., who previously worked as
***POSITION.1 in the LNFS, received from the respondent ***EMAIL.2 on 09/17/2019, an e-mail
containing the minutes of 07/11/2019, understanding that it is a third party that should not have
access to the document. The aforementioned sending by e-mail is accredited

It is credited, however, that A.A.A. at the time of receiving the e-mail, 09/17/2019, it was
member of the Board of Directors of the respondent, according to the "minutes of the assembly
ordinary meeting of the claimed Club, from 8 and 22/08/2019” (incorporation proposal for
members of the Board of Directors as Advisor to A.A.A. For the performance of their
functions is deemed necessary and basic that you can access any document
including the minutes of 07/11/2019.

 
For not communicating to the LNFS the appointment of A.A.A. as a member of the Board of Directors
and therefore, not be registered in the database of this, the LNFS on 05/12/2020
sanctioned the defendant for infraction of art 73.d “make public or communicate to third parties
people outside the Association internal data of the LNFS without the consent of the Board
Directive” with respect to the aforementioned minutes of 07/11/2019, considering that it had not been fulfilled

the Board of Directors, granting this communication constitutive, non-declarative character, and
considering that it was not staff of the Board of Directors. The matter is pending appeal.
in civil proceedings filed by the defendant. Both the statement of objections and the file
insist on the communication to third parties outside the Association of the act of

07/11/2019. It appears as evidence, the email from ***EMAIL.2 to A.A.A. of 09/17/2019 with the
attached "ACTA AG of 07-11-19"

4) In the claim it is added that the claimant finds out on 03/03/2020 that this act has been
forwarded A.A.A. to two people by email on 02/14/2020, 11:31 p.m., to a person from the
LNFS, known to its President, (his address: B.B.B., ***EMAIL.3) and the other person, to
***EMAIL.1) , “Subject: Fwd: minutes July 19”,
 What
history of that email from 02/14/2020, it can be seen in the forwarding chain, the initial that
to A.A.A. it was made from the minutes of 07/11/2029, on 09/17/2019 from ***EMAIL.2. The mail from
03/03/2020 from B.B.B. informing the President of the LNFS of the reception,
accompanied by an attached minutes AG 11.07.2019.pdf, plus "attached data without title 00010htm
 ”.

 no greeting or attention.

 

According to the defendant, it was the intention of A.A.A. refer himself, through the mail to another
your address in their systems the aforementioned record, marking the initial e instead of the i, and so on
error was sent to those recipients listed as sender's contacts. is credited
thus, that the forwarding to GOLSALA of 02/14/2020 occurs, and the minutes of
07/11/2019, the recipient not forming part of the LNFS.

5) Finally, it is also included in the claim that this act, by that person A.A.A.…
was transferred to the GOLSALA website that published on 07/11/2019, the same day of the
Assembly, data and facts that were contained in the minutes. A.A.A. access the information of
minutes in September 2019, and the news published by GOLSALA.COM is from the same 07/11/2019,”
giving information about the holding of the General Assembly on 07/11/2019, specifying
detailed items on the agenda contained therein, although it is not attached or
associated with the information given with the aforementioned Minutes. It was stated in the information that the
LNFS has approved a profit sharing of €700,000, which was approved unanimously
the regulations governing competitions, the proposal for the budget of the
season 19-20, that “the economic distribution between the Clubs was unanimously approved
for the 2019-2020 season, which would amount to €700,000" and that "in point 6 of the order
of the day, the budget for the 2019 season was unanimously approved
2020”

It is not accredited that the information that appears on the GOLSALA.COM website the
07/11/2019 on the General Assembly of said date, proceed or are a consequence of the
mail with the minutes that A.A.A. receives on 09/17/2019 and sends to a person with address
GOLSALA on 02/14/2020, since the news apart from having been published before, the
07/11/2019, refers to aspects that do not correspond to or are contained in the minutes, such as the
mention of the economic distribution of 700,000 euros and the news only mentions as data
personal substitution in the Board of Directors of a person and the President.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

The RGPD defines in its article 4

II

2) “processing”: any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not,
such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or

appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the Member States;

9) "addressee": the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body

10) "third party": natural or legal person, public authority, service or body other than the

The defendant was originally accused of incurring in the illicit treatment of personal data
staff, by sending by email (automated means) a record containing data
personnel of members of the Assembly of the Futsal League of 07/11/2019 of which
the Club was part, "a third party" as a person or entity with no relation to the
reclaimed.

The party responsible for the processing of these data is the League, and the claimed football club,
member of the AG communicated the data to a third party, thus deciding on purposes and
means of treatment that are considered not to be competent in terms of the communication of the
document with the data of the minutes of the Assembly held on 07/11/2019.

The transmission of data revealed on 9/17/2019, nor can it be deduced that it was
did to an outside third party or that lacked legitimacy. From a few days after
receive the certificate by mail from the claimant, 08/05/2019, the claimant justifies that he had
a legal protection to transmit to A.A.A. the data. Not otherwise to be interpreted
Documents 1 and 2 provided in allegations by the respondent.

Document 1, minutes of the Club assembly of 08/01/2019, in point four of the agenda
day, deals with the proposal for the incorporation of a new member to the Board of Directors that
is approved. Document 2, in the minutes of 08/22/2019 ratifies the aforementioned person
as part of the Board of Directors.

The sanction is the fact of communication through e-mail of the Club claimed to
A.A.A. of the minutes, and its adjustment or not to what is established in the Statutes contemplated as a

infringement of article 73 of the Statutes, in relation to the obligation to communicate
established in the Statutes the variations of people of the Boards of Directors of the Clubs.
To this, the claimant associated or linked the conclusion that despite the fact that the respondent has
legally approved in its minutes the appointment of A.A.A. as a member of the Board
Directive, disciplinary sanctions the delay or non-communication of said designation and
Basically, he considers him as a third party who receives the minutes.

The Statutes in its article 11.2.d), indicate as a right of the partners to have access to the
documentation of the Club, it remains to specify which people or positions within the members,
have effective access and depending on what powers or purpose would be granted that
access. The complainant states that A.A.A. was not a member of the Board of Directors who are the
it seems, they have the right of access to the documents of the minutes of the GA. I know
It is unknown if the Statutes establish what type of person or if there is any
delimitation in terms of said accesses.

For data protection purposes, the suspension of the procedure is not appropriate because
produced two meetings of a Club body claimed in a valid and legitimate way, the
appointment of said person, A.A.A., despite not having been communicated as the
Statutes, cannot have constitutive effects but said third party, is not considered a third party,
but as the minutes say, member of the Board of Directors, and specifying access to
perform their duties.

Given its internal validity through its accreditation in the minutes of the Boards provided,
nothing prevents, that regardless of your communication or lack of it, registration or not in
databases, for the purposes of data protection, the circumstance of the designation of
A.A.A. as a member of the Board of Directors had occurred before said shipment, although not
will be reported to the LNFS.

In the present case, this file not only assesses that aspect, but also the
revelation that A.A.A. in sending an email in February 2020 with a copy for two
people, one being, according to the President, an employee of the LNFS and the other from the
GOLSALA.

Therefore, what would be aired in said judicial channel does not affect the analysis of the facts and
behaviors that will be considered for data protection purposes.

The formal defect of not having communicated the appointment of A.A.A. or what the league
considers that his delay or absence may constitute, according to its Statutes, is independent
of the legal effects of said appointment that is not considered null or invalid, and
As far as is known, the claimant does not consider it that way either. The strictness of the foul character
serious statutory nature that gives the claimant and the LNFS to the lack of communication of the
designation produced before mailing, nothing predetermines the validity
of the A.A.A. as a member of the Board of Directors, his
legitimacy or validity of said acts.

When there are internally approved documents that verify that A.A.A. Yes it was
member of the Board of Directors of the claimed, being in September 2019 when he receives the e
mail, the facts would perhaps be limited to the fact that the LNFS did not know, but not to the fact that said
person is not part of the Board of Directors of the Club on the aforementioned date, an extreme that has not
been legally contested for some type of incompatibility or legal cause that could

meet that person. The effects of such defect are being elucidated in civil court
for which the respondent requests that this procedure be suspended.

In accordance with the applicable procedural regulations, the LPCAP contemplates the suspension
of the procedure, art 22.1:

"one. The expiration of the maximum legal term to resolve a procedure and notify the

Resolution may be suspended in the following cases:

g) When for the resolution of the procedure it is essential to obtain a prior
pronouncement by a court, from the moment it is requested,
what will have to be communicated to the interested parties, until the Administration has
proof of it, which must also be communicated to them.”

It is not considered essential to obtain the verdict of the sentence for the resolution of
this procedure, since it is considered that the internal documents of the claimed Club
guarantee the legality and validity of the appointment of A.A.A. as a member of the Board of Directors
of the claimed already in August 2019, then for this AEPD said internal communication did not

documentation of the Board for the performance of its functions.

Therefore, the suspension of this proceeding is not appropriate.

As a result, with the aforementioned legitimacy of A.A.A. to receive the minutes in the mail

Despite this, if it is observed that the facts contained in the initial agreement are included
in the commission of another infraction different from the imputed one.

The obligation of confidentiality contained as a fundamental principle of protection of
data pursues that the person responsible for the data and the people who may have access
within their organization, they must not disclose to third parties that are not part, in this
In the case of the LNFS, data referring to its members.

The communication that said person, A.A.A., makes as of 02/14/2020, as a party belonging to the
person responsible claimed, to the address of GOLSALA, with the minutes received in September
2019, it is appreciated that A.A.A., puts it into circulation through two forwardings, on 02/14/2020,
affecting the shipment to the GOLSALA address, with the transmission of said data
contained in the minutes of 07/11/2019. Thus, the infringement originally charged must
be varied to that of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD for that sending to the electronic address of a
person from GOLSALA. The article determines:

"one. The personal data will be:

processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss,
accidental destruction or damage, through the application of technical or organizational measures
appropriate (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

The commission of said infraction is considered accredited.
