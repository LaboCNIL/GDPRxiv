conducting your surveys. During the state of alarm, but also in
General for as long as the health crisis continues, the CIS
You cannot continue to carry out your surveys in person, both for security of
the pollsters as well as for the safety of the respondents, as well as for the
mobility limitations and social distancing imposed. As a consequence of
all this, the CIS has found in the telephone interviews the only solution, both to
logistical level as well as at the level of sociological quality.

This type of survey, fully recognized in the regulations, requires a
series of elements, including the telephone numbers of the individuals to be surveyed.
In some cases those numbers can be randomly generated, in other cases

Delegated authority of the state of alarm, the Minister of Health, the CIS opted for
outsource the conduct of your surveys.”

The CIS declares that within the framework of the contract under study, no transfer was made to the
company that carried out the study any personal data, nor did it give to the CIS
no personal data collected. The purpose of the contract was to carry out a study
by phone. For this, the company had its technical means and
randomly generated phone numbers, and once the survey was done
communicated to the CIS the results of the already anonymized study, did not provide any data
of a personal nature. For all these reasons, the CIS considered that there was no
data processing, since neither gave nor received personal data. points out
that the company was told to apply the following:
,
- “In the event that the personnel, on behalf of the successful bidder, who in the development of
carrying out their activity in the managing entity of the contract was aware of
information related to treatment activities that the managing entity of the contract
carried out in the development of its activity, it must follow at all times the
indications that are so indicated, showing the due reserve on the information

solely from the anonymized statistical results that he commissioned from the aforementioned
company obtain by studying research. The CIS established the number of
people to interview (not who specifically) and the sample design based on
sociodemographic profiles that the people to be interviewed must meet.

The technical conditions established for the telephone survey were the
following:
 

a. National scope.
b. Universe: Spanish population and over 18 years of age.

50,000; from 50,001 to 100,000; from 100,001 to 400,000; from 400,001 to 1,000,000, and

unknown if said first name is real and if it really corresponds to the owner of
the phone line being called.

In order to carry out quality control in the process of collecting information
in the field work, the information validation methods are applied
prescribed in article B.7.2.3 of Annex B of the UNE-ISO 20252:2019 standard

Market, social and opinion research, including Insights and data analytics –
Vocabulary and service requirements. This validation method consists of
monitoring of the interviews through remote listening that allows the
real-time validation or audio recording that enables validation with
after conducting an interview. This validation seeks to verify
that the interviews have actually been carried out, that the answers provided by the
person interviewed respond to the required sociodemographic profile, that the
interviewer asks the questions correctly according to the instructions
methodologies of the research study and that the interviewer records the
answers correctly (truth and completeness).

Once the field work is finished (in the collection of information through the
telephone interviews), the information obtained is applied a process of
anonymization by means of which the telephone numbers in which
conducted the interviews. This is a process of absolute deletion and not
dissociation, since once the telephone numbers are erased it is impossible

information that identifies them individually.

From this point on, the contracted company only processes anonymous data for the
performance of statistical analyzes and preparation of tables of results. Thus, at

allows individual identification of the people who responded to the survey.
The recordings are kept only for the time necessary to

contrast the information obtained with its source (the interviews).

 The term of conservation of personal data (telephone number and recording in
audio of the interview) meets the criteria established in the Code of Conduct
CODIM (Code of Conduct for the processing of personal data by
Market Research organizations, approved by Resolution of the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency with file number
CT/0005/2017 and to which said company is adhered), which establishes with a period
maximum of 6 months.” In this regard, he points out that, in the specific case of this study,
the aforementioned company proceeded to its suppression after the publication of the
results on April 15, 2020.

Regarding the script used by the company in the calls, it is as follows:
“INFORMATION SUBJECT TO STATISTICAL SECRET (Law 12/89, of May 9, of
the Public Statistical Function) Survey included in the National Statistical Plan
2017-2020 approved by Royal Decree 410/2016, of October 31.

personal data protection." The script used in the surveys and included in the
questionnaire published, was prepared by the contracted company from the model
used by the CIS in its face-to-face surveys, to adapt it to your way of
telephone surveys.

The CIS declares that the contracting of the study has been carried out by procedure of
emergency, in accordance with the provisions of article 120 of Law 9/2017, of 8
November, Public Sector Contracts. Within the framework of this type of
processing, article 37.1 of Law 9/2017, of November 8, establishes that
may carry out a contract that is not subject to the usual formal nature of the
public contracts, even being able to make a verbal contract.” That is why for
what the CIS understood was that it was not necessary to formalize any aspect, thus not only
data protection regulations were formalized, but neither was
formalization of any other type was carried out, beyond requesting four bids for
choose the most advantageous. Since the formal processing of the
contracts in ordinary processing, the CIS did not prepare prior to the execution the
usual annexes, and therefore, neither the data protection.

It refers, in this sense, to the provisions of Royal Decree-Law 7/2020, of March 12,
adopting urgent measures to respond to the economic impact of the
COVID-19, which, in its article 16, establishes the following: “1. The adoption of any
type of direct or indirect measure by public sector entities to
dealing with COVID-19 will justify the need to act immediately,
Article 120 of Law 9/2017, of November 8, on Contracts is applicable.
of the Public Sector, which transposes into the Spanish legal system the
Directives of the European Parliament and of the Council 2014/23/UE and 2014/24/UE, of 26
February 2014.
2. In accordance with the provision established in the previous paragraph, all contracts
to be held by public sector entities to meet the
needs arising from the protection of people and other measures adopted
by the Council of Ministers to deal with COVID-19, it will be applicable
emergency processing.

The CIS points out that, of the proposals received, a copy of which it provides, the one from
the company ***EMPRESA.1 for being the most advantageous to carry out the field work
of the “Special Barometer April 2020: coronavirus COVID-19” through a survey
CATI phone. The estimated reasons for the award were its lower price and
best time for delivery of the data file (sooner), under the same conditions
techniques. In addition, the adherence of the company ***EMPRESA.1 to the Code of
Conduct for the treatment of personal data by organizations of
Market, Social, Opinion and Data Analysis Research, approved by
the Committee for Supervision and Follow-up of the CODIM, Code type registered in the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. A certificate of adhesion of the aforementioned is provided

information: That the contract for conducting opinion polling services
for the tender of special barometers on the measures adopted
Regarding COVID19, it was awarded to ***EMPRESA.1. The date of agreement
The award date is May 8, 2020 and the contract formalization date is May 11, 2020.
May 2020.

The CIS has provided the administrative document formalizing the contract of
“Special barometers on the measures adopted regarding COVID-19”. In
Said document does not include the stipulations required by article 28.3 of the RGPD.

THIRD: On April 16, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the CIS, for the alleged
infringement of Article 28 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.4.a) of the RGPD,
declaring that the sanction that could correspond would be a warning, without
prejudice to the result of the investigation.

FOURTH: Notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the CIS presented on April 30, 2021
brief of allegations in which he requests the file of the sanctioning procedure,
basing its request on the allegations that are summarized below
continuation:
On March 14, 2020, the State of alarm is declared in Spain through the Real
Decree 463/2020, of March 14, declaring the state of alarm for the
management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, due to a
“an unprecedented health crisis of enormous magnitude.” Because of this and with
of an urgent nature, in order to comply with the obligations of the Center for
Sociological Research (hereinafter CIS) collected in Law 39/1995, of 19
December, on the organization of the CIS and in Royal Decree 1214/1997, of July 18
relative to the realization of periodic surveys that allow the knowledge of the
Spanish public opinion, this is forced to radically suspend, both for
safety of the interviewers as well as for the safety of the respondents the realization
of surveys in person, having to carry them out during this situation
Exceptionally over the phone.

In this way, given the urgency for the fulfillment of the duties that have been
assigned by the aforementioned legislation, the CIS chose to outsource
The Monthly Barometer for April was exceptional. Furthermore, in this context, the Minister of
Health, delegated authority of the State of alarm, sent a letter to the CIS requesting
carrying out studies to be able to have, as soon as possible, the
relevant sociological information.

Taking advantage of the exceptional procedures allowed by the legal framework, the
The processing of the contract was carried out through article 120 of Law 9/2017, of 8
of November, of Contracts of the Public Sector, by which they are transposed to the
Spanish legal system the Directives of the European Parliament and of the Council
2014/23/UE and 2014/24/UE, of February 26, 2014 and in accordance with article 37.1
of the same Law, which establishes that a contract cannot be carried out
subject to the usual formal nature of public contracts, and may even be made
a verbal contract.

In the same way, Royal Decree-Law 7/2020, of March 12, which adopts
urgent measures to respond to the economic impact of COVID-19, said the
possible application of emergency processing to those cases in which
take measures directly or indirectly related to the pandemic.
In this way, within the strictly legal framework and in an extremely
complicated for Spain, the CIS requested four urgent offers to choose the most
advantageous and made the emergency contract without all the formalities required in
periods of normality and whose procedures, as is well known, last for
quite a few more days than were available at the time.

The winning company offered all the guarantees of quality and especially of
protection of personal data, since this company complies with the Code
Code of Conduct CODIM (Code of Conduct for the processing of personal data
staff by organizations of Market Research, Social, Opinion and
Data Analysis) approved by Resolution of the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection with file number CT/0005/2017). This fact is
especially relevant, since, being a Code endorsed by the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, any Administration must take it for granted that the company
corresponding is compliant in the field of data protection. which I know
evidenced by the fact that there has been no breach of protection
of data in the execution of the contract.

The CIS understood that, in this exceptional situation, having no obligation not even
to formalize a written contract, he was not obliged to introduce the clauses
of data protection that usually appear in all Specifications of clauses
(PCAP), since such specifications are not even drawn up. of having
carried out a usual procedure, said Bidding Document had been prepared, and
had included the pertinent clauses, since in the formalization documents
it is unusual to include such clauses.

For all the above, the alleged non-compliance alleged by the Agency is not a
breach of material content, as evidenced by the subscription by the
awardee of the CODIM Code of Conduct, but it would be, in its case and in other
conditions, a defect of formal character. In this sense, it is considered that
it is appropriate to speak of the existence of a defect of a formal nature, which may give rise to
to a warning, when an emergency procedure is carried out that does not require
any formalization, and that, therefore, does not require specifications. This approach actually
could suppose the eventual warning to all those departments or
organizations that processed emergency contracts in that period of time,
that none of them elaborated specifications, having even done so, some of them, of
verb form. The requirement of this formalization is totally contrary to the spirit
of a rule that allows contracting even verbally. Consequently, if
consider that this obligation does not exist in emergency contracts, as
maintains the CIS, no warning would proceed.

The existence of a possible obligation to formalize a clause of protection of
data in an emergency contract, which does not require formalization, is a criterion of
interpretable character and, therefore, the only thing it should give rise to, in its case, is a
Resolution or regulations in this regard by that Agency, applicable to all by

the same, and not a warning to a specific managerial center when this criterion of
performance has been widespread.

FIFTH: On 03/11/2021, a resolution proposal was issued in the sense
Next:
"That by the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is sanctioned with
warning to SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH CENTER, with NIF
Q2802464D, for an infringement of Article 28 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.4
of the RGPD.“

SIXTH: Once notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the investigated entity submitted a written
of allegations on 11/12/2021 in which he requests that the withdrawal of the sanction be assessed
proposal, basing your request on the considerations set out below
briefly:

FIRST. - The CIS did not incur in any data custody violation
personal, adopting all real and effective guarantees. It only did not include
clause in the contract, which could be considered a formal error. Also I don't know
the rights of citizens were violated since measures were adopted
specific as the choice of the winning company, attached to the Code of
CODIM Conduct (Code of Conduct for the processing of personal data
staff by organizations of Market Research, Social, Opinion and
Data Analysis) certified by the Spanish Data Protection Agency itself,
which provided guarantees and security regarding strict compliance with the regulations
protection of personal data, which is precisely the purpose of all
the formal obligations contained in the regulations.

SECOND. - The Sociological Research Center has all its actions
adapted to the data protection regulations and keeps all its
processing activities in the Record of Processing Activities, as well as the
corresponding risk analysis, as determined by the RGPD and the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the
digital rights. In this sense, the CIS makes a permanent and ongoing effort
of continuous improvement to comply with the provisions of the regulations for the protection of
data and in the instructions indicated by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
being in permanent communication with the Data Protection Delegate of the
Ministry of the Presidency, Relations with the Courts and Democratic Memory.

THIRD. – The CIS has adopted specific measures to verify the inclusion of the
data protection clauses in all its contracts. Attached as an example are
annexes that were included in contracts, of a similar nature to the one that is the object of
this writing, executed with the company ***EMPRESA.2 for the realization of 4
studies: 2 barometers and two studies on the consumer confidence index.
Provides a copy of an annex dated May 20, 2021 containing
stipulations relating to the order of treatment.

2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the
Treatment of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data and for which
Directive 95/46/CE (General Data Protection Regulation, in
hereinafter RGPD) and in articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD).

Article 4 of the RGP, under the heading "Definitions", provides the following:

“1) «personal data»: any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity
physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;

2) “processing”: any operation or set of operations carried out on
personal data or sets of personal data, whether by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction”.

7) “responsible for the treatment” or “responsible”: the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
purposes and means of treatment; whether the law of the Union or of the Member States
determines the purposes and means of the treatment, the person in charge of the treatment or the

or of the Member States.

In this case, the following information relating to people is treated
identified or identifiable: landline or mobile phone number, first name, voice,
postal code, population, province, age, gender and answers to the questions
raised, although an anonymization process is subsequently carried out.
This treatment is carried out by a company contracted by the CIS to carry out
the operations that it cannot carry out due to the lack, as it states, of the means
technicians and is carried out on behalf of said entity as stated in the script
contributed, in which the participants in the survey are informed as follows
"We are conducting a survey for the Center for Sociological Research."

The CIS, on the other hand, is the legitimate entity to carry out said treatment,
in accordance with the provisions of article 6.1.e) of the RGPD in relation to the provisions
in article 25 of the LOPDGDD, article 3 of its regulatory law, according to which
“The functions of the Center for Sociological Research are: (…) c) carrying out
studies that provide diagnoses on situations and social issues and serve
of orientation to the public authorities in their normative and executive initiatives” and the
Royal Decree 308/2020, of February 11, which approves the Annual Plan Program
National Statistics 2017-2020.

Likewise, the file shows that the CIS has determined, at least, the
following aspects:

a. National scope.
b. Universe: Spanish population and over 18 years of age.

Field Date: End of March / Beginning of April

a. Methodology: Telephone interview through the CATI System (delivery to the CIS of the

anonymized ASCII or SPSS file).

b. BBDD: Fixed telephones in homes and mobile telephones with records generated
randomly. About 50/50% will be done on phones
fixed/mobile.

c. Sample: 3,000 surveys.
d. Sample distribution: Proportional to the population of each Community
Autonomous and population size. The strata were formed by the crossing of the
17 autonomous communities, with the size of habitat, divided into 7
categories: less than or equal to 2,000 inhabitants; from 2,001 to 10,000; from 10,001 to
50,000; from 50,001 to 100,000; from 100,001 to 400,000; from 400,001 to 1,000,000, and
more than 1,000,000 inhabitants. The selection of municipalities will be totally
random keeping the mentioned sampling distribution parameters.

and. Quotas: Cross-sex quotas will be covered with 6 age brackets.
F. Questionnaire: The questionnaire will last 15 minutes with questions
closed. In some of them the option of “Other answers” is contemplated in
open.

Consequently, the CIS, the entity authorized to carry out the barometers of
opinion in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, determines the purpose of the treatment
that entrusts to a third party: to carry out one of its functions (the barometer
special April) that the CIS could not carry out by itself; determines
also, the means to be used: interview through the CATI system, the scope, the
dates in which the treatment must be carried out, the sampling distribution, etc.,
thus responding to the definition of responsible contained in article 4.7 of the RGPD.

The aforementioned article 4 of the RGPD also defines, in its eighth number, the “manager
of the treatment” or “in charge” as “the natural or legal person, public authority,
service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the person responsible for the
treatment".

Article 28 of the RGPD under the title "Data Processor" provides that:

"1. When a treatment is going to be carried out on behalf of a person in charge of the
treatment, this will only choose a person in charge who offers sufficient guarantees
to apply appropriate technical and organizational measures, so that the
treatment is in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation and guarantees the
protection of the rights of the interested party.
 (…)
3. The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract or other legal act with
under the law of the Union or of the Member States, binding the person in charge
with respect to the person in charge and establish the object, duration, nature and
purpose of the treatment, the type of personal data and categories of interested parties, and the

obligations and rights of the controller. Said contract or legal act shall stipulate, in
particular, that the person in charge:

a)

responsible for that legal requirement prior to treatment, unless such Right
prohibits it for important reasons of public interest;

b) will guarantee that the persons authorized to process personal data

confidentiality obligation of a statutory nature;

c)

d)

have as their object the exercise of the rights of the interested parties established
in chapter III;

F)

established in articles 32 to 36, taking into account the nature of the
processing and information available to the processor;

g) at the choice of the person in charge, will delete or return all personal data

i)

  will make available to the person in charge all the information necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this
article, as well as to allow and contribute to the performance of audits,
including inspections, by the controller or another authorized auditor
by said person in charge.

In relation to the provisions of letter h) of the first paragraph, the person in charge will inform
immediately to the controller if, in his opinion, an instruction violates this
Regulation or other provisions on data protection of the Union or of
the member states.

4. When a person in charge of the treatment resorts to another person in charge to carry out
certain treatment activities on behalf of the person in charge, will be imposed on
this other manager, by contract or other legal act established in accordance with the

Law of the Union or of the Member States, the same obligations of
data protection than those stipulated in the contract or other legal act between the
responsible and the person in charge referred to in section 3, in particular the provision
of sufficient guarantees of application of appropriate technical and organizational measures
so that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of this
Regulation. If that other processor breaches its data protection obligations,
the initial processor will remain fully accountable to the controller

duty manager.
(…)
9. The contract or other legal act referred to in sections 3 and 4 shall be recorded by
written, including in electronic format.

From the documentation in the file it can be deduced that the CIS, given the
pandemic situation and the impossibility of carrying out by itself before the
absence of technical means the study referred to in this procedure,
decided to go to outsourcing by requesting 4 proposals, selecting the
that it considered most advantageous, taking into account for this, among other reasons, the
adherence of the company that had provided it to the Code of Conduct for the
processing of personal data by research organizations
Market, Social, Opinion and Data Analysis, approved by the Committee of
Supervision and Follow-up of the CODIM, Code type registered in the Spanish Agency of
Data Protection.

The contracting was carried out by the emergency procedure, which allows the
verbal contracting, formalizing the contract on May 11, 2020. The
formalization document does not contain the stipulations required by article 28.3
of the RGPD, nor has any other binding document been provided for the
in charge with respect to the person in charge that contains them.

The CIS alleges that it has availed itself of the exceptional procedures allowed by the
legal framework, carrying out the processing of the contract through article 120 of
Law 9/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts and in accordance with the
article 37.1 of the same Law, which establishes that a
contracting not subject to the usual formal nature of public contracts, being able to
even make a verbal hiring. He also alleges that he understood that, in this
exceptional situation, not having the obligation to even formalize a contract for
writing, it was not obliged to introduce the data protection clauses that
They usually appear in all Administrative Clauses Documents (PCAP), since neither
such specifications are not even made. If normal processing has been carried out,
said Specification had been drawn up, and the pertinent clauses had been included, either
that it is not customary to include such clauses in formalization documents. It states,
also, that the non-inclusion of the clause in the contract could be considered a
form error.

This Agency cannot share such arguments. The RGPD does not regulate in its article
28, no exception to the obligation to formalize the contract or act in writing
legally binding for the person in charge with respect to the person in charge. On the other hand, of the
same way in which it is pointed out that such clauses appear in all the specifications of
administrative clauses, and that if a usual procedure had been carried out

28001 – Madrid

16/20

would appear in it, since in the formalization documents it is not usual
include such clauses, the required specifications could have been included
by article 28.3 of the RGPD in any other document, provided that the same
be binding.

Nor can the absence of the contract referred to in article 28.3 of the
RGPD as a mere error of form. Article 28.9 of the same rule imposes the
obligation to conclude a written contract, when no other act is in force
legally binding, so its absence constitutes an infringement of the RGPD. In this
meaning of the LOPDGDD in its article 73 entitled, "Infringements considered serious",
considers as such in its letter k) the following:
“k) Entrust the processing of data to a third party without the prior formalization of a
contract or other written legal act with the content required by article 28.3 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

The CIS alleges that the winning company offered all the guarantees of quality and
especially, of personal data protection, since this company
complies with the Code of Conduct CODIM (Code of Conduct for the treatment
personal data by Market Research organizations, Social,
of Opinion and Data Analysis) approved by Resolution of the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency. Considers that they were not violated
rights of citizens since the choice of the winning company,
ascribed to the aforementioned code, provided guarantees and security regarding strict compliance
of the personal data protection regulations, which is precisely the
purpose of all the formal obligations contained in the regulations.

This Agency cannot share said allegation either. adherence to this code,
published by the AEPD on its website https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ct-
organizations-research-markets.pdf, regardless of whether it has been
approved in accordance with the data protection regulations prior to the RGPD, without
has not yet produced its conversion to the code of conduct regulated in the RGPD in the
terms required under the same, does not exclude the obligation to formalize the
corresponding contract or legal act that binds the person in charge with respect to the
responsible, as required by article 28.3 of said regulation. In this sense,
Article 28.5 of the RGPD provides that "The adhesion of the person in charge of the treatment to
an approved code of conduct under article 40 or a mechanism of
certification approved under article 42 may be used as an element for
demonstrate the existence of sufficient guarantees referred to in sections 1 and
4 of this article.” Said precept does not allow to consider that adherence to a
code of conduct exempts the person responsible for complying with the obligations
provided for in number 3 of article 28, since it refers expressly to the guarantees
referred to in numbers 1 and 4 of the aforementioned article 28.

It should be noted here that the RGPD not only requires the formalization of a
contract with the specifications of article 28.3, but requires, in article 28.1,
that the person in charge choose a person in charge that offers sufficient guarantees to apply
appropriate technical and organizational measures so that the treatment is
in accordance with the requirements of the RGPD and guarantees the protection of the rights of the users.
interested. It is in this sense that adherence to a code of
code of conduct, which, on the other hand, must have been approved in accordance with the provisions

28001 – Madrid

in article 40 of the RGPD, but such adhesion in no case replaces the celebration of the
contract referred to in article 28.3.
 
Insofar as the CIS has adopted specific measures to verify the inclusion of
the data protection clauses in all your contracts, attaching as an example
the annexes included in contracts of a similar nature, does not justify the fact that in the case
object of this file is not fulfilled the obligation set forth in the
article 28.3. In the same way, with regard to the adaptation of its
actions to the data protection regulations keeping updated all
your processing activities in the Record of Processing Activities and keeping
carried out the corresponding risk analysis, do not justify such non-compliance either.
In any case, all these actions alleged by the CIS are not the object of this
procedure, so it is not appropriate to rule on whether they give due
compliance with the provisions of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD.
.
Consequently, in accordance with the exposed evidence, the aforementioned facts
represent a violation of the provisions of article 28.3 of the RGPD, typified as
infringement in section 4.a) of article 83 of the RGPD, which under the rubric
"General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines", establishes the
Next:

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount:

a)

the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge in accordance with articles 8, 11,
25 to 39, 42 and 43;”

 For the purposes of the limitation period, the LOPDGDD in its article 73 k), "Infringements
considered serious”, states the following:

  “Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

k) Entrust the processing of data to a third party without the prior formalization of a
contract or other written legal act with the content required by article 28.3 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

III

In the event that there is an infringement of the provisions of the RGPD, between
the corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates the
following:
“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers
listed below:

b) send a warning to any controller or processor when
treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation". (correction of errors in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, DOUE number
74, of March 4, 2021
(…)
d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period;
(…)
i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;".

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in letter d)
above is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine or
warning.

IV

Notwithstanding what is stated in the previous Legal Foundations, article 83.7
of the RGPD provides that, without prejudice to the corrective powers of the authorities of
control under Article 58(2), each Member State may establish
rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines can be imposed on
public authorities and bodies established in that Member State.

The LOPDGDD in its article 77, Regime applicable to certain categories of
responsible or in charge of the treatment, establishes the following:

d) Public bodies and public law entities linked or
dependent on the Public Administrations.

f) The Bank of Spain.
g) Public law corporations when the purposes of the treatment are
related to the exercise of powers of public law.
