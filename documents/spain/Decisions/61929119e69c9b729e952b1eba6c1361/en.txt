Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in
based on the following:

FACTS

FIRST: D.A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party) dated May 4, 2022
filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U. with NIF A80907397 (in
forward, the claimed party or Vodafone). The reasons on which the claim is based
are the following:

The claimant states that on March 31, 2022, he received on his tray
Spam an email from Vodafone telling you that it has been
created a user and gave access to "your Vodafone account" (despite not being a customer
for more than a year), where they authorize an email address of
a third party ("***EMAIL.1") to access your Vodafone account, being able to access
with the same permits as the holder and, therefore, can make purchases or
online subscriptions.

After what happened, he contacted Vodafone and they tell him that they have requested with his data
the portability of four mobile phone lines in the name of a third party, the
donor operator Lycamobile and also a fiber portability with a number of

Well then, Vodafone informs you that the contract was made by telephone and that
it was signed virtually by SMS.

The complaining party requests the cancellation of the portability and the interruption of the service
of the fiber line, proceeding Vodafone to open a file number for fraud
for identity theft, which is subsequently closed without receiving
explanations about it.

Subsequently, he receives two invoices generated, one charging the cancellation of the service and
another for zero euros.

Thus, the Vodafone customer service department tells you that
there are changes in your billing addresses and now data from other
addresses with canceled services in their name and also showing a service
canceled in your name at ***LOCATION.1.

After multiple claims, Vodafone told him by telephone that there had been no
an identity theft, but that what happened is due to an error of the company itself
entity when processing the portability requested by another user.

Well then, the claimant contacted the portability numbers listed at
your name and the user indicates that it was an error by Vodafone and that they requested
a portability in their name and they never provided their data to Vodafone.

Likewise, on May 3, 2022, he received another invoice for an amount of
XXX.XX euro.

Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on June 6, 2022 as
It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On July 9, 2022, this Agency received a written response indicating:
"That the claimed incident is currently resolved, having been
investigated by Vodafone's fraud department and declared fraudulent,
being, at present, annulled any debt related to the claimant and
returned the amounts invoiced, having also adopted measures of
security on the claimant to avoid that more invoices can be generated and
Debt payment claims on behalf of the claimant.

In any case, a letter has been sent to the claimant informing him
about the steps taken by my client to clarify the situation and
apologize for the events that occurred, as well as indicate that currently
there is no record of any active service linked to his person. Attached as Document
number 1, copy of the letter sent to the claimant.

In any case, it should be noted, as recognized in the complaint, that the
complainant was aware of the allegedly fraudulent contracting that occurred on
March 30, 2022, through the notification made by Vodafone on the 31st
March in which he was informed of the registration of a new user in his profile, a measure of
security proactively implemented by this entity and through which, in the
moment in which the registration of a new user is detected, this is notified by
email, which in this case allowed the claimant to become aware of the
fraud and could report the suspected fraud to Vodafone.

Vodafone has not detected any unauthorized access by a third party to its
systems or any other security incident that has led to data leakage
personal information or the passwords or credentials of your clients.

The incident arose because it appears that the claimant, without having a relationship
any contractual agreement with Vodafone, you receive at your email address, the day
March 31, 2022, a communication from Vodafone, which informed him of the discharge
of a new user in your customer area.

The claimant proceeded to contact Vodafone and request information in this regard,
being informed that the portability of 4 telephone lines had been requested
mobile, from LYCAMOBILE, on behalf of a third party, as well as a portability of a
fixed telephone and fiber, from ONO (AUNA), which would have been installed at the address
postcard from a third party. The same day that the incident is confirmed, the
claimant files a complaint with the Civil Guard, dated March 31,
2022. around 7:00 p.m., indicating that their data from
fraudulently, which is why he proceeded to close his bank account. Furthermore, at

situation and, later and after contacting the entity again, he reports that the

new requirements to Vodafone, claims not to have received a response
satisfactory. Finally, the claimant considered it pertinent to file a
claim before this Agency from which this requirement has been derived. In
In any case, it should be noted, as recognized in the complaint, that the
complainant was aware of the allegedly fraudulent contracting that occurred on
March 30, 2022, through the notification made by Vodafone on the 31st
March in which he was informed of the registration of a new user in his profile, a measure of
security proactively implemented by this entity and through which, in the
moment in which the registration of a new user is detected, this is notified by
email, which in this case allowed the claimant to become aware of the
fraud and could report the suspected fraud to Vodafone.

Accordingly, this party may conclude that the alleged offender who became
with your personal information obtained the same through the claimant himself or
any other source outside Vodafone's intervention and control, something that Vodafone
cannot control, being the custody of your personal data and credentials of
access responsibility of the claimant himself. Consequently, access to
personal information of the claimant and the contracting of products and services at his
name did not occur as a result of a data leak in the systems of
Vodafone, but because of a phishing or social engineering attack or as
consequence of negligent custody or inadequate conservation of this
information on the part of the claimant, which allowed a third party to have access to their
personal data and, with this, proceed to the contracting of different products and
services on behalf of the claimant.

 Thus, we understand that what happened is outside the scope of responsibility
of my principal, since the interested parties have the responsibility of keeping
properly your personal data, being only within the sphere of control
of my principal the adequate definition of the procedures, systems, controls and
Security measures applicable depending on the criticality of the treatment that
ensure the correct identification of the owner of the personal data. proof of
correct exercise of these tasks is that the claimant was aware of the
fraudulent contracting that occurred on March 30, 2022 through the
Communication sent proactively by Vodafone on March 31 upon detecting the
registration of a new user in the customer profile of the claimant.

Also, at the time the claimant reported the fraudulent action, my
principal proceeded to evaluate the facts reported, apply the security measures
pertinent security and, after qualifying the action as fraudulent due to its
fraud department, proceeded to cancel the portability requests of the
mobile telephone lines –as of April 5–, cancel telephone services
fixed and fiber -as of April 14 with effect from the day of contracting-, as well as
carry out the procedures to cancel any amount owed by the claimant to
cause of fraudulent contracting, the claimant recovering control of his
personal information processed in Vodafone systems.

Finally, Vodafone proceeded to cancel any invoice in the name of the claimant,
return the amounts paid by the latter –invoice dated June 8–,
include the claimant's data in their internal databases for the prevention of
fraud and thus avoid new fraudulent contracts and verify that the claimant

attached, as Document number 2, copy of invoice No. ***INVOICE.1, dated
of issue on June 8, 2022, for an amount of -XXX.XX €, in order to prove the
payment of amounts issued in favor of the claimant.

Therefore, my client acted as quickly as possible to resolve the
situation once he became aware of a possible fraud, after the
statements made by the claimant himself, since until now the
contracts formalized by the third party appeared to be correct. Being so, the
fraudulent action is a consequence of the fact that a third party stole or accessed the
personal data or credentials of the claimant without their consent, facts that are not
may be controlled or known by my client.

Regarding the additional security measures applied by Vodafone, from the
March 14, 2012 my principal acts under the Security Policy for the
Hiring of Individuals, provided together with this document as a Document
number 3. This Security Policy has been progressively updated,
having implemented its last modification on January 4, 2022. Through
Said Security Policy, my client establishes what type of information should be
require the client for each requested management. Also included is how
proceed in the event that a user does not exceed the Security Policy, as well as the
preventive actions in fraud situations. The aforementioned Privacy Policy
Security, is mandatory for all employees and agents of
Vodafone, who are in charge of applying and respecting it.

On the other hand, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring, Vodafone works
continuously to improve the Security Policies implemented in the
contracting of services and in any other process that entails possible risks of
fraud or irregular actions for our clients.

Likewise, Vodafone is reviewing the internal processes to ensure
that the defined Security Policies are complied with or introduce the changes
necessary when deemed appropriate. Specifically, my client is
working on the continuous improvement of: • Review of internal processes to
ensure compliance with the Security Policies and verification controls that are
have been defining and incorporating, both in person and by telephone. •
Periodic reinforcement of communication of Security Policies and verifications
that have been defined by Vodafone for contracting or modifying services and
that must be applied by agencies, commercial stores and agents. • Send of
Periodic communications to the face-to-face and telephone channel, as well as to the operator
logistics, where it is alerted to the risk scenarios detected, their characteristics and
behavior patterns to prevent new cases.

These communications include details of how these requests are produced,
channels through which they are requested, documentation provided, description of the
handling, geographical areas where incidents are taking place. With
all this, we can confirm that currently my client has carried out all the
pertinent actions to solve the claim, estimating that it has
been properly resolved."

Three months have elapsed since it entered the AEPD.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

Well then, the defendant is accused of committing an offense for violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR, "Legacy of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.
application to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions”.

 The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The LOPDGD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

II

In accordance with the available evidence, it is considered that, of the
denounced facts, it follows a treatment of data without legitimacy, since the
The requested entity carried out the portability that is the object of this complaint, without ascertaining whether the
The person requesting it was or was not the claimant, which constitutes a violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, the
diligence used by the defendant to identify the person who requested
portability.

The claimant found out because he received an SMS indicating that they were
Accessing your "my Vodafone" profile but with another email.

Well, it is accredited as recognized by the claimed party in its writ of
response to this Agency dated July 20, 2022, << the incident has been
originated because apparently, the claimant, without maintaining any contractual relationship
with Vodafone, you receive in your email address, on March 31,

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/15

2022, a communication from Vodafone, which was informed of the registration of a new
User in your customer area.

The claimant proceeded to contact Vodafone and request information in this regard,
being informed that the portability of 4 telephone lines had been requested
mobile, from LYCAMOBILE, on behalf of a third party, as well as a portability of a
fixed telephone and fiber, from ONO (AUNA), which would have been installed at the address
postcard from a third party.>>

In any case, the operator must be able to prove that for this specific case
has followed the verification protocols implemented when requesting the
portability.

Subsequently, when making the claim, they proceeded to cancel the portability and
refund of amounts collected. In short, it should be noted that respect
to the principle of legality of the data requires that it be proven that the owner of the data
data consented to the processing of personal data and display a
reasonable diligence essential to prove that end. If he doesn't act like that
The result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

In the explanation provided by the claimed party, it does not indicate which could have
been the specific cause that led to the realization of portability, beyond
some generic explanations.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, the
diligence used by the defendant to identify the person who requested
portability.

In accordance with the evidence available at this procedural moment and
without prejudice to what results from the investigation of the procedure, it is estimated that the
conduct of the claimed party could violate article 6.1 of the GDPR and may be
constituting the offense classified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation
2016/679.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

"(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, either in this Regulation or under other Union law
or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

IV.

The determination of the sanction that should be imposed in the present case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the GDPR, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to
impose on the entity claimed as responsible for an infringement classified in the
article 83.5.a) of the GDPR and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in this case:

As aggravating factors:

-

The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
treatment of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the
GDPR in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).
   The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant
