Indeed, on March 24, 2020, I sent my sister in my own name

THIRD: The burofax, which was included in the emails, recalls the split of a
society in which the claimant and the respondent participated, and the financial obligations

five days, it will initiate judicial actions, including criminal ones.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation
General Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD) recognizes each authority of

Article 5 of the RGPD, whose rubric is entitled Principles related to the treatment
establishes in letter f) of its section 1 that personal data will be "processed
in such a way as to ensure adequate security, including protection against
unauthorized or unlawful treatment and against loss, destruction or accidental damage,
through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and
confidentiality”)”. In relation to this principle, Considering 39 of the aforementioned
GDPR states that “[…] Personal data must be treated in a way that guarantees
adequate security and confidentiality of personal data, including for

treatment”.

For its part, the LOPDGDD, in its article 5 provides that:

ity referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the
duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained even when
the relationship between the obligor and the person in charge or in charge of the transaction had ended.

The claim is based on the presumed unlawfulness of informing third parties

mante via emails sent to email addresses
from his workplace, as well as through WhatsApp messages sent to two
people from their immediate environment.

The claimant provided, as evidence of these statements, the documents to which
reference has been made in the first and second antecedents of this resolution.

Thus, in the provided screenshots, it can be seen that in the emails
sent by the claimed party on March 30 at 11:16 a.m. to the addresses of
mail <***USER.2>, <***USER.3> and ***EMAIL.2, and at 13:14 to <***USER-
RIO.1>, in which the burofax is made available at an office of
mail, this is attached in .pdf format. An examination of the content of the burofax itself
shows that it contains data about participation and claim status.

reduction of capital, in addition to the fact that the object of the burofax itself (“Requirement
compliance process”) already refers to a position held by the claimant
in an economic relationship. It is important to point out that the complainant appears as
recipient in a copy of these emails (something that is also observed in the mail of the
11:16 attached by the respondent in his response to the transfer). This would show that
the respondent knew the email address of the claimant, without it being
necessary, if the purpose of the communication was to send you the notice, send to third parties
ros outside the aforementioned emails (neither the one sent at 11:16 nor the one after the
13:14 after the answer provided by <***USER.3>)

The dissemination of these data by whoever was a partner and administrator of the company and res-
respect to which their legitimacy to dispose of them is not questioned and
treat them in the exercise of the rights that may correspond to third parties unrelated to
the person to whom the request is addressed, supposes a violation of the principle of
confidentiality established by the RGPD in the processing of personal data, obli-

this article are, as indicated in section 1, those “that reveal the ethnic origin
racial or cultural background, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or affiliation

gar, because the exception refers to "treatment necessary for the formulation,
the exercise or defense of claims or when the courts act in exercise
of its judicial function;”, and not to the communication to third parties that are not involved in said
claim.

In relation to the information provided to people close to the claimant through
WhatsApp, of which screenshots have been provided, it should be noted that
Whatsapp is an instant messaging service through which you can send
text messages and documents, among others, and, in this specific case, it was used by the
claimed as a partner of a company, providing details of the capital reduction
made and outstanding debts; Therefore, in this case, you cannot
considered to be a treatment of personal data that is carried out in the
exercise of exclusively personal or domestic activities.

The respondent alleges that he is not responsible for files or processing. In this sen-
tion, it should be noted that article 4, paragraph 2 of the RGPD, defines the treatment of
personal data such as:

“processing”: any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal information or sets of personal data, either by automated procedures
two or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation
tation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission,
dissemination or any other form of authorization of access, collation or interconnection, limitation
tion, deletion or destruction.

The data of the claimed party have been processed by the claimed party, for
which had to comply with all the requirements established in the RGPD when carrying out said
treatment.

In accordance with the available evidence, it is considered that the facts
claimed would breach the provisions of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, so they could
suppose the commission of an infringement typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which
put the following:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, treating-
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of

previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with article

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
These, as a control authority, are established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among them
are the power to issue a warning -article 58.2 b)-, the power to
impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD -article 58.2 i)-,
or the power to order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations
ns of treatment comply with the provisions of the RGPD, where appropriate, of a
certain manner and within a specified period -article 58. 2 d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine.

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83, the aforementioned GDPR provides for the possibility of
punish with a warning, in relation to what is stated in Considering 148:

“In the event of a minor infraction, or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute
be a disproportionate burden on a natural person, rather than sanction by
fine, a warning may be imposed. However, special attention must be paid
tion to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, to its intentional nature, to
the measures taken to mitigate the damages and losses suffered, to the degree of responsibility
bility or any relevant prior violation, to the manner in which the enforcement authority
control has been aware of the infraction, to the fulfillment of ordered measures
against the person in charge or person in charge, adherence to codes of conduct and any
any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.

In the present case, it has been taken into account, in particular, that it is a person
physical whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data
(article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD).
