the general rules on administrative procedures.”

In accordance with the definition of "personal data" offered by article 4.1 of the RGPD, the
image of a natural person has the character of personal data. So, according to
article 1.2 of the RGPD, the image of a natural person must be subject to the protection
tion dispensed by this Regulation

Article 12.1 of the RGPD states: “1. The data controller will take the measures

any additional relevant information pursuant to paragraph 2.

4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and to the extent

Regarding the way in which the data controller can provide the data subject with
the information that must be provided, article 12.7 RGPD indi-
ca: “The information that must be provided to interested parties by virtue of articles
13 and 14 may be transmitted in combination with standardized icons that allow pro-

At the same time, article 22 of the LOPDGDD –“Processing for video surveillance purposes”
lancia”- contains specific regulations on the matter and provides the following:

"1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the treatment
ment of images through camera systems or video cameras with the purpose
to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as its facilities.
2. Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that it is im-

5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security and its development provisions.

8. The treatment by the employer of data obtained through camera systems

In order to be able to fulfill in a concise and understandable way the
duty to inform the interested party imposed on the data controller by article
12 of the RGPD, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD provides for an information system by
layers.

The first layer, which must refer, at least, to the existence of the treatment; to
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in the
articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, will be contained in a device whose design and location
must be such that the affected party has a clear view of the information available on
about the processing of your personal data and about where and how to find the information
detailed tion. The importance of providing this information in advance arises,
in particular, of recital 39 of the RGPD. It is not necessary to specify the location

clear the context of surveillance.

Second layer information needs to be readily available in one place
accessible to the affected party, be it an information sheet at a reception, cashier, etc. ..., co-
located in a visible public space or in a web address and must refer to the res-
of the aspects that must be reported in accordance with article 13 of the
GDPR.

In summary, taking into consideration what was stated in the preceding Rationale,

- Respect the principle of proportionality.
- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a private security company that meets the requirements of article
5 of Law 5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security.
- The video cameras will not be able to capture images of people who are
outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since
the treatment of images in public places can only be carried out, unless
Government authorization concurs, by the Security Forces and Bodies. Either
spaces owned by third parties may be captured or recorded without the consent of
their owners, or, where appropriate, of the people who are in them.

To facilitate consultation, the Spanish Data Protection Agency, through its
website [https://www.aepd.es], offers access to the legislation on protection
tion of personal data, including the RGPD and the LOPDGDD (section “Reports and
resolutions” / “regulations”); to the Guide on the use of video cameras for security and

IV

The infringement of the data protection regulations attributed to the respondent that motivates
the opening of this sanctioning file is specified in the fact that the billboard installed
in the hotel establishment of which he is the owner, announcing the existence of a
video-monitored area, lacks the information that, mandatory, must contain
in accordance with articles 12 and 13 RGPD in relation to article 22 LOPDGDD.

In the Report of the complaint sent to this Agency by the claimant, the officials of
The Local Police recorded that in the Cafeteria-Bar ***BAR.1 there was a
video surveillance camera connected to the electrical network and a poster informing of the
existence of a video surveillance area, without any other information being included in it.
tion.

The photographic report in the file, provided by the claimant, reveals
that data processing was carried out in the aforementioned hotel establishment
personal by capturing images by video surveillance and that the poster that
reported the existence of an area subject to capturing images not offered
the information that under the RGPD is obliged to provide, since it is not included
included in it the identity data of the data controller; nor your data
Contact; nor was it informed of the possibility of exercising the rights that the
RGPD recognizes the interested parties in articles 15 to 22.

As stated in Basis II of this agreement, the data controller
ment - the defendant, in his capacity as owner of the establishment, is obliged to
inform the interested parties, at the time of collecting their personal data, in
the terms detailed in article 13 of the RGPD. It is also explained in that Funda-
that the joint application of articles 12.7 RGPD and 22.4 LOPDGDD allows
that the information detailed in article 13 RGPD be provided through a device

tive or poster located in a place of easy visibility in which the existence of
video surveillance cameras, the name of the controller and the possibility
to exercise before him the rights recognized to the interested parties by articles 15 to 22
of the GDPR.

As for the rest of the information mentioned in article 13 RGPD and that
the person in charge is also obliged to provide the interested parties, it will be enough
have it available in a place easily accessible to them, such as a
information sheet at a reception or at the cashier, placed in a conspicuous space or on
a web address.

Thus, the evidence available at this stage of the procedure
sanctioning constitute solid indications that the defendant violated the obligation that
It is imposed by article 13 of the RGPD, so such conduct could constitute
an infringement typified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the defendant identified by the local Police of the town in
brief of allegations dated 05/09/21 warns about the existence of an error in the
identification of the person responsible for the alleged infringement, which is wrongly attributed
mind to his person, there being a change of ownership in the commercial activity of the
investigated establishment.

He argues that the activity license was initially in his name, although the same
mo does not run the hotel establishment "bar ***BAR.1" as there has been a
modification of the activity, with the current owners being responsible for the “irre-
irregularities” that the camera system could present, whose existence is unknown.

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and has
to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its
manifestations, is conditioned to the test game and to a procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended.

Pursuant to this principle, no penalty may be imposed on the basis of the
guilt of the accused if there is no activity to prove the charge, which in the
appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).

v

According to the above, taking into account the arguments put forward by the
claimed it is considered that it is not responsible for the installation of the
maras devoid of informative posters in legal form, which is why it is appropriate to order
file the present procedure.

The complaining party, once the alleged real author of the infringement is confirmed
described may resubmit the Complaint to this AEPD for the purposes of processing
initiation of the corresponding procedure against the presumed author of the facts
crits.
