THIRD: On July 2, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed entity,
by virtue of the powers established in article 58.2 of the RGPD and in articles
47, 64.2 and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), for the infringement of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

FOURTH: Once the initiation agreement has been notified, the entity claimed, by means of a letter of
dated July 16 of this year, made, in summary, the following allegations:
“Vodafone, first of all, wants to state that after receiving the request
of information E/2742/2019, Vodafone analyzed the claimant's claim and
proceeded to its resolution immediately, proceeding to cancel the services
registered in their name and eliminating the debt from their systems, despite not
have responded to the aforementioned request for information within the term
conferred for it.
The hiring made in the name of the claimant had an appearance of
correct hiring. In this sense, my client has two recordings,
both made on the date ***DATE.2. In both recordings it is collected
clearly the consent given on behalf of the claimant. A CD is attached with
the copy of the recordings.
Given the non-payment of the services, effectively, my client included the data of the
claimant in solvency files on the following dates: Experian file registration and
discharged on March 11, 2018 and August 20, 2018. Asnef file, date of discharge 8
March 2018 and goes down on August 20, 2018.
In this sense, it is relevant to highlight the repeal of article 130 of Law 30/1992,
of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and the
Common Administrative Procedure. Its substitution by article 28.1 of the Law
40/2015 of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector eliminates the mention of
the "simple non-observance" making the rule "nullum poena sine culpa" prevail.
The foregoing comes only to highlight the lack of room for the
responsibility without fault, principle that governs or must govern in the administrative field
sanctioning, because to the extent that it is a manifestation of "ius puniendi" of the State,
It is inadmissible in our legal system a liability regime

In this sense, it indicates Judgment of the Constitutional Court number 219/1988, and this
for being inadmissible a system of strict liability or without fault as
it also comes to point out Judgment 246/1991. I cannot be penalized
represented for infraction of article 6.1. of the LOPD, without reference to the
subjective element of the type, not proving fraud, guilt, or negligence.
Additionally, taking into account the special nature of penalizing law
that determines the impossibility of imposing sanctions without taking into account the will
of the acting subject or the factors that may have determined the breach of a
legal obligation, this part maintains the inadmissibility of the imposition of sanctions
some.
Thus, the Supreme Court indicates in the Judgment of December 21, 1998
(RJ1998/10226) (Appeal 9074/1991), January 27, 1996 (RJ 1996\926)

(Appeal 640/1992) and January 20, 1997 (RJ 1997\257) (Appeal of
Appeal 2689/1992)". The Supreme Court also points out in a Judgment of 20
July 1990, Arch. 6163,
Well, as can be seen, in the behavior described there is no
intentionality, neither by way of intent, nor by way of guilt. Therefore, do not
If there is any guilt, it is totally inadmissible to impose a sanction
any to my client, as long as one of the essential requirements of the
Sanctioning Administrative Law.
For all these reasons, neither represented understands that what is appropriate is for the AEPD to agree on the
dismissal of this file and the file of the proceedings since the
facts have occurred without any intention on the part of my client and
It seems that due to some kind of error. Subsidiarily and in the event that
Despite the explanations provided above, the Agency understood that my
represented is deserving of a sanction for the commission of an infringement of art.
6.1. of the RGPD, the amount of said sanction must be moderate, imposing in its
minimum amount, taking into account the following circumstances set out in art.
83.2 of the GDPR:
It is requested, therefore, to agree: The dismissal of the file, with the consequent
record of proceedings. Subsidiarily with respect to what is intended in number
1, impose a sanction on my client, having taken into account the AEPD for the
determination of its amount, the alluded mitigating factors”.

FIFTH: On July 22, 2019, the test practice period began,
remembering: 1. Consider reproduced for evidentiary purposes the complaint filed
by the claimant and her documentation, the documents obtained and generated that
are part of file E/02742/2019 and 2. Consider reproduced for purposes
evidence, the allegations to the initiation agreement of PS/00207/2019, presented by
the reported entity.

SIXTH: On September 6, 2019, the respondent was notified of the proposed
resolution formulated in the following terms: <<That by the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Commission, VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U. with
NIF A80907397, for an infringement of Article 6 of the RGPD, typified in Article
83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of €60,000.00 (sixty thousand euros)>>.

belief that the services had actually been contracted for by the
claimant, proceeded to issue the corresponding invoices for the services rendered,
which had consumption and before the non-payment of said bills, proceeded to include the

when my client receives the claim in relation to the hiring and acts
with all diligence and speed possible, canceling the debt and deregistering the
service".

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of

The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of Article 6 of the
RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the cases in which
the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

In the case at hand, the data processing carried out by the
claimed was carried out using reasonable diligence. In this sense, it has
to take into account that in the systems of the respondent there are data related to

the claimant, both for contracting and for portability and are
associated with the claimant's DNI. The sale was formalized over the phone. Fruit
of said registration, some invoices were issued that were canceled immediately in the
same moment in which the respondent became aware of the situation.

Likewise, the respondent provides a copy of the two telephone recordings to
through which consent was granted, on behalf of the claimant, both
for contracting services, as well as for portability. these recordings
were carried out on date ***DATE.2, where, in the first of them, the
summary of the contracting carried out (telephone lines, Ono fiber and Television) and
in the second, the portability request for two lines from Jazztel to Vodafone, in
which the following information is provided: the name and surnames of the contracting party, as well as
as your DNI/NIF, to which the interlocutor responds with the data of the claimant and
reports on various aspects of contracting.

Therefore, the degree of culpability existing in the present must be analyzed.
case. The jurisprudence has been requiring those entities that assume in their
becoming, a constant processing of data from customers and third parties, which in the management of
the same, prove compliance with an adequate level of diligence, due to the
increasing casuistry in terms of fraud in the use of data
personal. In this sense, it is manifested, among others, the judgment of the High Court
National Law of April 29, 2010, establishing that “The question that arises
in the present case, in view of the approach of the claim, it is not so much to elucidate
if the appellant processed the personal data of the complainant without her
consent, such as whether or not you used reasonable diligence in trying to
identify the person with whom the financing contract was signed” or as
included in the ruling of the National High Court of March 10, 2015 when pointing out
that: “therefore, no reproach can be made to the actions of Telefónica Móviles
Spain S.A. in this sanctioning area, because as has already been stated, he acted with the
due diligence, treating the data of the complainant from the appearance of
legitimacy of the contracting of the line in question that was granted by the recording
telephone (...)

In short, it is not possible to assess culpability in the actions of the entity
appellant, so it cannot be charged or sanctioned ex article 130 LRJPAC
for violation of the principle of consent nor, and in correlation, of the
principle of data quality since the prior request for payment was made in the
address that according to the aforementioned telephone recording corresponded to the owner of the line”

According to these criteria, it can be understood that the respondent used a
reasonable diligence, since it took the necessary measures to identify the
person who made the contract.

Considering the aforementioned precepts and others of general application,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: FILE sanctioning procedure PS/00207/2019, instructed to
