FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to the authorities of
control and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

The Spanish Constitution (C.E.) guarantees in its article 9.3, among other principles, the
of legal certainty and responsibility. In turn, article 24.2 of the C.E. recognizes
everyone the right to the presumption of innocence, a presumption that encompasses
both the imputation of the facts and the demand for responsibility of the subject
offender.

According to settled jurisprudence, there is no doubt of the application to the Law
Administrative penalty, with certain nuances, of the principles that inspire the order
penal, as both are manifestations of the State's punitive system, and
Among them, the principle of culpability takes on special virtuality. The presumption of
innocence has to do with proof of responsibility for the acts and guilt
attributable to the person who, where appropriate, performs them (STC 76/1990, of April 26, F.J. 8, B), and
that any sanctioning resolution, whether criminal or administrative, requires at the same time certainty
of the imputed facts, obtained by means of proof of charge, and certainty of the judgment of
guilt on those same facts.

In this sense, and limited to the scope of the sanctioning administrative procedure, it is
cite the STS, Third Chamber, of 06/24/1998 (Rec. 1776/1994), Legal Basis 2,
stating that “Personal responsibility becomes the basis on which
establishes the punitive system since no one can be convicted or punished except by
acts that, either by way of intent or guilt, can be directly imputed to him.” (The
underlining is ours)

Article 28 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public (LRJSP), under the heading "Responsibility" provides in section 1 that
“Only those that constitute an administrative infraction may be sanctioned
individuals and legal entities, [...], who are responsible for them by way of
fraud or guilt.”

III

Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the common administrative procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP) regulates in article 64 the content of the agreement
initiation of the sanctioning administrative procedure and indicates that it must
contain, at least, the “a) Identification of the person or persons allegedly
responsible."

Well, the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, PS/216/2020,
identified Mrs.
A.A.A., with NIF ****NIF.1.

In determining the identity of the person responsible for the alleged violation of the
RGPD that gave rise to the opening of the sanctioning procedure that concerns us is
took into consideration that in the Report of the complaint sent by the respondent,

However, based on the allegations made by the respondent and the
documentation provided with it is accredited that, despite what is indicated in the
Record of complaint dated 05/05/2019 that the respondent sent to this Agency, she
did not have the status of owner of the establishment “*** ESTABLISHMENT.1” in
the date the inspection was performed. The work life report provided leaves
proof that between 02/19/2019 and 06/21/2019 she was a self-employed worker
outside of Doña B.B.B.

At this point, it should be remembered that the agreement to open the procedure
sanctioning dealt with the existence of video surveillance cameras installed in the
local reference, in which there was no informative poster of the capture of
images nor was it provided to those affected, through other means
additional information, the information that must be provided under the terms of the
article 13 of the RGPD. Likewise, it should be taken into consideration that the obligation to
reporting provided for in article 13 of the RGPD is imposed on the data controller,
which is defined in article 4.7 of the RGPD as “the natural or legal person, [...] who,
alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and means of processing; [...];”.

Given that the respondent has proven that she was a self-employed worker
outside the owner of the establishment on the date on which the Agents of the authority
inspected the premises, it cannot be attributed the status of data controller.
Therefore, article 89 of the LPACAP is applicable to the case, according to which “[...]
will resolve the completion of the procedure, with filing of the proceedings, without it being
necessary the formulation of the resolution proposal, when in the instruction of the
procedure it becomes clear that any of the following concurs
circumstances:
[...]
d) When it does not exist or it has not been possible to identify the person or persons
liable or appear exempt from liability. [...]”. (The underline is
our)

Thus, in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the filing of the file must be agreed
sanctioning PS/002016/2020, open to the defendant, as they are not attributable to her
the facts object of the claim that determined the opening of this
penalty procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: AGREE to FILE the sanctioning procedure PS/00216/2020,
open to A.A.A., with NIF ****NIF.1, as it is proven in the file that it is not the
Responsible for data processing allegedly contrary to the RGPD that motivated the
opening of the sanctioning procedure.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the claimed party.

THIRD: In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, the
