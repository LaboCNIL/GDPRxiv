FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

The RGPD defines in its article 4:

II

"personal data": any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity
physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The right to privacy is applicable to the field of labor relations,
as revealed by STC 98/2000, of April 10 (FFJJ 6 to 9). The number of
mobile phone for private use by which the claimant is identified and contacted,
being its owner, it should, before being used, have been obtained in a manner
legitimate for a specific, legitimate and suitable purpose by the claimed party, and
the claimant should have been informed of its use, purpose and exercise of
rights of said treatment.

Previously, the need to treat the
private mobile lines of employees in connection with the execution of work
performed by the claimant within the entity, although in this case, the
The claimant was also on medical leave known by the person responsible for the
entity. As the defendant has not proven that it has any legitimate basis
for its collection and use, it is considered that the claimed infringed article 5.1.a) of the
RGPD that indicates:

1. The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("legality, loyalty and transparency");

The legitimizing bases for the treatment are contained in article 6 of the
RGPD, and in this case none of them concurs as the origin of the treatment of the
data of the mobile line of the claimant, that the ***CHARGE.2 of the Commonwealth
used to make work-related calls, making use of a line
individual of the claimant.

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
costs for treatment, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article.
Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% maximum
amount of the global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting-
I know for the highest amount.”

Article 83.7 of the RGPD indicates:

Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under
of Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether
can, and to what extent, impose administrative fines on authorities and organizations
public authorities established in that Member State.

Article 58.2 of the RGPD indicates: "Each control authority will have

all of the following corrective powers indicated below:

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period.

The Spanish legal system has chosen not to sanction with a fine those
public entities, as indicated in article 77.1. c) and 2. 4. 5. and 6. of the
LOPDDG: “1. The regime established in this article will be applicable to
treatments for which they are responsible or in charge:

c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the communities

autonomous and the entities that make up the Local Administration.

2. When those responsible or in charge listed in section 1 committed
any of the infractions referred to in articles 72 to 74 of this law

resolution sanctioning them with a warning. The resolution will establish
also the measures that should be adopted to stop the behavior or correct it.
the effects of the infraction that had been committed.

The resolution will be notified to the person in charge or in charge of the treatment, to the body of the
that depends hierarchically, where appropriate, and to those affected who had the condition

4. The data protection authority must be notified of the resolutions that
fall in relation to the measures and actions referred to in the sections
previous.

5. They will be communicated to the Ombudsman or, where appropriate, to similar institutions
of the autonomous communities the actions carried out and the resolutions issued
under this article.

6. When the competent authority is the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, it will publish on its website with due separation the resolutions
referred to the entities of section 1 of this article, with express indication of the
identity of the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that would have committed the
infringement."

No action measure related to the infraction is imposed except the one that

it clearly follows from not continuing to use the claimant's mobile line.

Regarding prescription, article 72.1.a) of the LOPGDD indicates:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE MANCOMUNIDAD GUADALQUIVIR, with NIF P9104001D,
for an infringement of Article 5.1.a) of the RGPD, in accordance with article 83.5 of the
RGPD, a sanction of warning, as established in article 58.2.d) of the RGPD.
