Of the actions carried out in this proceeding and of the

PROVEN FACTS

1. The complainant reports that EDP has processed their personal data linked to a
electricity supply contract without your consent and without having entered into any
contract with the claimant.

2. EDP has provided a CD with the recording of a telephone conversation in which
a third, Mrs. B.B.B., identifies himself as the claimant's partner, declares to act in
his representation and in such concept he gives his consent to the contracting and facilitates
the personal data of the claimant (name, two surnames, NIF, bank details,
CUPS number and address of the supply point) In addition, “authorized to consult
the Universal Supply Point Code in the consumer database and

personal data such as those of your client would be processed by EDP.

3. EDP has stated that “an express and positive confirmation action was required
by the contracting party, to complete the process”, demanding that he answer
an SMS text message with the word “Yes”. The respondent has provided a copy of

sent, as well as the recipient telephone number and "the date, time and content of the
reply to it”.

4. EDP has provided a copy of the Award issued by the Regional Arbitration Board of
Consumption of *** CCAA.1 dated 03/06/2019, totally rejecting the
claims of the claimant. In Basis III, Background of the matter, it is indicated:
  “(…) Since the plaintiff has not attended the Arbitration Hearing, it has not been
possible to request clarification of the events that occurred, although it is reasonably
infer that your request to cancel the invoice is due to your position of not having
contracted with the defendant any service or supply, since it states 'no
have signed anything.

For its part, the company maintains that the claimant contracted with them the
supply of electricity and natural gas, providing specific dates of the respective registrations,
as well as the information that said contracts are currently in
sick leave, also specifying their dates...

It is therefore evident that the basic question to be elucidated will be to determine if

whether or not there was a valid contract between the parties. (...)

Consequently, the contract must be considered validly concluded, since
It has been sufficiently proven that there was confirmation via SMS, a method
accepted as legitimate by law, and made to the mobile phone number of the
claimant (the underlined corresponds to the AEPD).

The Award issued has the following content: “That should be DISMISSED

on 09/03/2018 they are based on the treatment that the company EDP had carried out
of your personal data linked to an electricity contract despite the fact that
He claims not to have entered into any contract with her.

However, regarding these same facts, the claimant made a request for
arbitration before the JJAA of Consumption of ***CCAA.1 questioning the validity of the contract
of supply and registration in the service. To this end, it works in the file provided by
EDP full copy of the arbitration procedure.

9/10

The arbitration procedure is governed by Royal Decree 231/2000, which
regulates the consumer arbitration system and, in matters not provided for in it, by the Arbitration Law
60/2003. Article 40 of the aforementioned Law 60/2003 provides that “Against a final award
The annulment action may be exercised in the terms provided in this title.

As indicated in the preceding Foundations on 03/06/2019,
issued the Arbitration Award that agreed to totally reject the claimant's claim
formulated against the company EDP and considered "validly concluded the contract, since
that it has been sufficiently proven that there was confirmation via SMS, method
accepted as legitimate by law, and made to the mobile phone number of the
claimant” (the underlined corresponds to the AEPD).

Article 40 of Law 60/2003 provides that "Against a final award,

exercise the annulment action in the terms provided in this title.

However, there is no evidence that against the Award that the JJAA of
***CCAA.1 issued in the matter at hand would have been exercised by the current
claimant the annulment action before the Civil and Criminal Chamber of the Court
Superior Court of Justice of ***CCAA.1 within the two months following their
notification, in the terms provided in Title VII of Law 60/2003, on Arbitration.

On the other hand, article 43 of Law 60/2003 states that “The award produces effects
acts of res judicata and against him it will only be possible to exercise the annulment action and, in its
case, request the review in accordance with the provisions of Law 1/2000, of January 7,
of Civil Procedure for final sentences.”

 Thus, while there is no news that the Award issued by the JJAA of
***CCAA.1 would have been appealed for annulment and, given that the award produces
res judicata, this Agency is bound by the aforementioned arbitration resolution. For such
reason, it is appropriate to agree on the file of the sanctioning file that concerns us.
