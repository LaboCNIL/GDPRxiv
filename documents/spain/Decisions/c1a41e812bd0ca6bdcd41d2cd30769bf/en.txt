Any data collection through the use of cameras must be reported to
through the placement of an information poster that is sufficiently visible
in the accesses to the monitored areas, which will clearly indicate a series of data
regarding the existence of the treatment (video surveillance), if it constitutes a file, the

“Whoever causes damage to property belonging to others not included in other titles of
this Code, will be punished with a fine of six to twenty-four months, attending the con-
economic condition of the victim and the amount of the damage” (article 263 CP).

The investigations carried out have made it possible to determine that the cameras installed
they do not affect the private area of the claimant, nor is surveillance of
public space without just cause.

One of the chambers is limited to the protection of private property against
external aggressions without any affectation to the right of third parties has been verified.
ted, stating with the proper information of "Video-surveillance Zone".

The other camera has in principle an angle limited to the banners object of
protection against vandal attacks (e.g. graffiti, destruction, etc.) without affecting
space of the complaining party, limiting itself to obtaining images in a limited angle,
excluded from the "privacy" of third parties.

The orientation of one of the cameras towards the banners mentioned, without
more considerations, it can be considered covered in the protection of the same
against the aforementioned attacks, so that the images obtained can be
made available to the competent authorities, affecting only those who
approach them with malicious intentions.

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and has
to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its
manifestations, is conditioned to the test game and to a procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended.

Pursuant to this principle, no penalty may be imposed on the basis of the
guilt of the accused if there is no activity to prove the charge, which in the
appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).

IV

Based on the foregoing, after analyzing the evidence provided, it can be concluded that
the commission of any administrative infraction in the matter that we
occupies, which justifies the Archive of this procedure.

Lastly, the transcendence of the rights at stake is recalled,
avoid instrumentalizing this body for matters unrelated to it or that may
where appropriate, be resolved by the local security forces and bodies.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and after assessing the graduation criteria
