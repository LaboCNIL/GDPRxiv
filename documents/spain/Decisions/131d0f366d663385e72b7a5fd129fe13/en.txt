the members that form part of DIGITORIUM SOCIEDAD COOPERATIVA

professional, it is usual that, before going to court, the rights of our
clients are claimed by friendly means. To them we are summoned not only by the
legislator, but also by the principles of procedural economy and good faith.

In the judicial procedure initiated by this party, therefore, the judicial body has already
weighed the rights that in terms of data protection may assist the
now claimants, by complying with the requirements that the Law provides
specifically for this, and has assessed the possibility of adopting the measures

preliminary diligence adopted.

client concurs legitimate interest and that having the data of the presumed

compliance with a court order. The purposes for which they have been obtained
data, after having been exposed by this party in the procedure of
preliminary proceedings and submitted to the assessment of the competent judicial body, have been
declared legitimate by said judicial body by virtue of the Order provided.

The purpose of the subsequent treatment is identical to that for which the request was made.

In this sense, this Spanish Data Protection Agency considers that, in
relation to the lack of legitimacy for the treatment of the personal data of the
Euskaltel customers, it is necessary to take into account the response of the head of the Court
of the Mercantile No. ***JUZGADO.1, in order No. ***AUTO.1 of January 8, 2019, at the
Euskaltel's opposition to the provision of personal identification data
holders of the requested IPs.

In the SECOND Legal Reasoning, section 8, it is stated: “8. Application

mobile, email) that is part of the privacy of users and exceeds
necessary for the intended purposes.

The Judge does not share Euskaltel's assessment. The data referred to is necessary.
to contact the users and to be able to formulate against them the judicial claim or,
in his case, extrajudicial.”

In addition, in section 9 the Magistrate states the following: “9.1. Legality. Alleges the
operator that the report is the result of interference by a foreign company
in the personal data and contents of the communications that constitutes a
infringement of the European Data Protection Regulation. (…)

In this case, there is no evidence that with the program for the protection of the rights of
intellectual protection data other than the IP address has been obtained and it is
being used to be able to claim before the civil courts for the infraction of
such rights. Therefore, both the obtaining of the data and the
its use.

In this sense, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 establishes as principles related to the
treatment, the collection of data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes for
be treated in accordance with said purposes, and the limitation of the data to what is necessary in
relation to the purpose for which they are processed (art. 5.1. b and c), and article 6 considers
lawful processing necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not override interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In
Regarding the fundamental right to secrecy of communications, it is not affected
for 'obtaining the data related to the IP address.'

IV

In this case, it is taken into account that the respondent must provide the information
indicated in article 14 of the RGPD, when the personal data has not been
obtained from the interested party.
The respondent, in particular, on October 5, 2020, has stated in response to the
requirement of this Agency that the information currently offered in the

v

By virtue of the provisions of article 58.2 of the RGPD, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, as a control authority, has a set of
corrective powers in the event of an infraction of the precepts of the
GDPR.

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following:
“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers
listed below:
(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;"
(...)
“d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a specified manner and within a specified period;”
“i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"

merely formal of the articles mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the following:
a)
Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right
of information of the affected party for not providing all the information required by the articles
13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the exposed facts, the respondent has violated article 14 of the
RGPD, whose infringement is sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with article
58.2.b) of the RGPD, when collecting through said form basic data of the
users and consider that the administrative fine that could fall in accordance with the
provided in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a disproportionate burden
for the claimed, whose main activity is not directly linked to the
processing of personal data, since there is no record of the commission of any infringement
above regarding data protection.

SAW

On the other hand, article 83.7 of the RGPD provides that, without prejudice to the
corrective powers of the control authorities under art. 58, paragraph 2,
each Member State may lay down rules on whether and to what extent
impose administrative fines on authorities and public bodies established in
that Member State.

The defendant has proceeded to resolve the facts that are the subject of this proceeding

following communication:
“Your personal data is processed for the exclusive purpose of exercising the rights of
