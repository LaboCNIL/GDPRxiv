IV

In the present case, the respondent has not presented arguments or evidence that
contradict the facts denounced within the period given for it.

In accordance with the evidence available and which has not been
distorted during the sanctioning procedure, the defendant has installed a
video surveillance system in the cafeteria, located at ***ADDRESS.1, ***LOCATION.1,
capturing images of the public highway one of the cameras placed inside the
local. In addition, the informative poster of the video-monitored area does not comply with the regulations
current since it mentions the repealed Organic Law 15/1999.

Based on the foregoing, the facts entail a violation of the provisions of
articles 5.1 c) and 13 of the RGPD, which supposes a commission of both infractions
typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which provides the following:

d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under
of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the treatment;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.

h) Submission by the person in charge or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between them and any interested party”.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in article 83.5 a)
of the RGPD, it is appropriate to graduate it according to the following aggravating factors:

-

-

The nature of the infringement. The claimed by having a system of
video surveillance that is oriented to public roads without just cause,
produces damages to all interested parties (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

The intentionality or negligence in the infringement. With the system
video surveillance carries out excessive control of the area without any justified cause,
highlighting the poor orientation of the device (art. 83.2 b) RGPD).

- The degree of cooperation with this Agency in order to remedy the
infringement. After having made two transfers to the person claimed for the purposes of
being able to answer and two requests for additional information, the AEPD has only
received a reply to one of the transfers. Nor has it been obtained
any response, once the opening agreement has been notified (art. 83.2 f)
GDPR).

-

The way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement. The
The way in which this Agency has become aware has been through the
presentation of the claim by the claimant (art. 83.2 h) RGPD).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infringement of article
5.1 c) of the RGPD, allows a fine of 1,000 euros (one thousand euros) to be set.

Regarding the infringement of article 13 due to the absence of an informative poster according to the
RGPD, based on the exposed facts, it is considered that it is appropriate to direct a
warning. Despite the fact that the person claimed already has an informative badge in
the entrance of the premises, must be updated in accordance with the RGPD.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction of article 5.1.c)
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, a fine of €1,000 (one thousand euros).

SECOND: ADDRESS a warning to B.B.B., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction
