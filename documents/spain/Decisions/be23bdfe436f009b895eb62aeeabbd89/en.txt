Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character

purposes and means of processing; if the law of the Union or of the Member States
determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the
Specific criteria for their appointment may be established by Union law
or of the Member States;”

The exposure of data contained in administrative resolutions and in a judgment
on the website of the defendant constitute personal data processing.

II

For data processing, (display on the judgment and resolution website
administration containing the data of those affected and their associated information) the
responsible for the treatment, in this case the defendant, must identify a basis
legal treatment in order that the treatment carried out is legal. Article
6.1 of the GDPR, establishes the assumptions that allow the treatment of data to be considered lawful.
following personal data:

1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled

conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data

for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested party or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;

In the present case, it is not proven that the "public interest" alleged for
the exhibitions on the website of the defendant, given that they are communications of
administrative resolutions between bodies, in whose regime the
public exposure of the same, nor are they as a means of subsidiary notification to
those affected, nor is there a rule that enables such communication. Furthermore, if there is
habilitation, the exposed documents should not remain more than a time
specifically determined for the purpose for which they are exhibited, in application of the
principle of limitation of the conservation period that indicates that personal data
will be: “maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties
for no longer than necessary for the purposes of data processing
personal", and the defendant may still dispose of documents exposed in
similar characteristics from several years ago.

It is not estimated that any of the assumptions that enable the aforementioned
exhibitions that contain personal data, accrediting the commission of the
violation of this article.

Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR indicates:

IV.

5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

The LOPDGDD in its article 72.1.b) states:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

b) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of

legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

V

The defendant is accused of a violation of article 37 of the GDPR in relation to the
Article 34 of the LOPDGDD that state:

"1. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will designate a delegate of protection
tion of data provided that:

4. In cases other than those contemplated in section 1, the person in charge or the
data controller or associations and other bodies representing
categories of managers or managers may designate a protection delegate
of data or they must designate it if required by the Law of the Union or of the States
members. The data protection officer may act on behalf of these
associations and other bodies that represent managers or managers.”

The LOPDGDD specifies in its article 34.1 o) and .3: "Appointment of a delegate of
Data Protection:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment must designate a delegate of
data protection in the cases provided for in article 37.1 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and, in any case, in the case of the following entities:

o) Sports federations when they process data of minors.

3. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment will communicate within ten
days to the Spanish Data Protection Agency or, where appropriate, to the authorities
data protection, the designations, appointments and cessations of
the data protection delegates both in the cases in which they are
bound to their designation as in the case in which it is voluntary.”

It is notorious and public on the website of the defendant, which issues sports licenses for
minors, from 14 years old and offers other information on its website about competitions and
ages from which the sport can be practiced. The defendant has not given any
an explanation of the designation and appointment of the obligation imposed by the
said provision, so that from the claims and throughout their processing
it is considered that it has not complied with this obligation.

SAW

The infringement is considered as such in article 83.4.a) of the GDPR which states: "4.
Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 10,000,000 EUR or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the volume of
overall annual total business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

a) the obligations of the controller and the person in charge under articles 8, 11, 25 to
39, 42 and 43;”

The LOPDGDD in its article 73.v), states:

"Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the

when their appointment is required in accordance with article 37 of the Regulations
(UE) 2016/679 and article 34 of this organic law.”

VII

Sections d) and i) of article 58.2 of the GDPR provide the following:

2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
"d) order the person in charge or person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a specified manner and within a specified period;”

“i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or in
instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case;”

The eventual mandate to adapt the publication processing operations to the
GDPR, would be to do it anonymously, so that it would not be possible to identify or
make those affected identifiable, neither directly nor indirectly, and the designation and
Appointment of Data Protection Officer.

The determination of the sanctions that should be imposed in the present case requires

 Within this section, the LOPDGDD contemplates in its article 76, entitled "Sancio-
and corrective measures”:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation
(UE) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria

there are controversies between those and any interested party.

3. It will be possible, complementary or alternatively, the adoption, when appropriate, of
the remaining corrective measures referred to in article 83.2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.”
In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction of article 6.1 typified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, for which the defendant is held responsible, it is estimated
concurrent as aggravating factors the following factors that reveal a greater
illegality and/or culpability in the conduct of the defendant:
-Article 83.2.a) GDPR "nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, taking into account
account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation
concerned, as well as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages
that they have suffered; It is not necessary to disclose the identifying data of the claimants
to give transparency to the actions of the defendant, without adding anything to the
knowledge of these data that are framed as resolutions of interest that
catalogs the claim, affecting two people, one of them more than one resolution,
not being classified as an eventual isolated fact.

-Article 83.2.b) GDPR. "Intentional or negligent infringement": It is not

repeated facts, with the consequent deduction of a clear lack of diligence in the
Act.

-Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD, "The link between the offender's activity and the
processing of personal data.", not being strange the treatment
for the activity of the defendant in matters such as licences, sports discipline, etc.
in which the processing of personal data is operated.
As a balance of the circumstances, it is considered that the amount of the sanction is
5,000 euro.

Regarding the infraction due to the absence of DPD, it is considered that the amount of the sanction
tion is 1,000 euros.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
