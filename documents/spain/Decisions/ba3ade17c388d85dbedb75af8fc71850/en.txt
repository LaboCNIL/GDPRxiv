control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The defendant is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation of article
5.1.c) of the RGPD, which states that personal data will be “adequate, relevant
and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”).”

This infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

III

The present procedure has its origin in the installation of two devices of
video surveillance in the property located at the address indicated in the antecedent
first of this resolution, which could be oriented and capture images of areas
common and even from a neighboring house.

As regards the possibility of installing a video surveillance system with the
purpose of guaranteeing the security of the dwelling and of the private space of the claimed
and with respect to the collection of public roads, article 22 of the LOPDGDD —related to
processing for video surveillance purposes—provides that, in order to guarantee
the safety of people and property, images of public thoroughfares may be captured "in the
to the extent that it is essential", in accordance with the principle
mentioned data minimization. It is reported that the ability to grasp
images on public roads is attributed, in general, to the Forces and Corps
of Security in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 4/1997 by which
the use of video cameras by the Security Forces and Bodies in
public places and their implementing regulations.

In the same way, the installed cameras cannot obtain images of space
proprietary third party. It is not allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the
private property of neighbors in order to intimidate them or affect their environment
deprived without just cause

Likewise, it is necessary to point out that article 13 of the RGPD —in compliance with the
duty of information collected in the preceding article 12 of the same legal text—
regulates the information to be provided when personal data is
obtained from the interested party, a situation that occurs in the cases in which they are captured
images by a video surveillance system. In this sense, article 22.4 of the
LOPDGDD establishes that "The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing a
informative device in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the
existence of the treatment, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the
rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Also
A connection code or email address may be included in the information device.
internet to this information.

And on the other hand, individuals who use this type of device are responsible
that these comply with current legislation, and must comply, when the property
is under the regime of community of owners, with the requirements
established in Law 49/1960, of July 21, on horizontal property (LPH). A) Yes,
The installation of a video surveillance system by an individual will require
authorization of the board of the community of owners both when its
location in a common area as when, even installed in an area of use
exclusive, is oriented to surrounding common areas and captures —respecting in any case
the principle of data minimization—tangentially common areas.

In relation to the foregoing, the facts proven in this proceeding
It is clear that both devices, due to their location, and particularly in the case
of the camera installed on the terrace, would be capable of capturing images of
common elements as well as even neighboring houses.

However, notwithstanding what is indicated in the previous paragraph, in accordance with the
manifested by the claimed to the Local Police of ***LOCALIDAD.1, the cameras
they would be of a dissuasive nature and would not have a recording system. This statement
would come to be corroborated by what was stated by the company TRABLISA
MULTISERVICIOS S.L. which, in its letter dated October 20, 2020, indicates that
has not carried out any installation in the referred property and that both the models of
cameras observed as the informative posters do not correspond to those that
installs or facilitates the company.

It is convenient to bring up, with respect to dissuasive devices, what has been said
highlighted by the Judgment of the Supreme Court, Civil Chamber (STS 3505/2019,
11/07/19) regarding fictitious cameras, which states that “that the cameras of
false security also represent an illegitimate intrusion on privacy given
that those affected do not have to endure "permanent uncertainty" about
whether or not the device is operational.”

The plaintiff's right to the tranquility of his private life also includes
that of not having to endure permanent uncertainty as to whether the camera
oriented towards his farm is operational or not, since his external appearance prevents him from
verify it and, on the other hand, the defendant would always have the possibility of substituting the
non-operative chamber for another operative.

For the same reasons, the installation of the camera facing the garden of the
plaintiff cannot be considered an exercise of a ius usus inocui in the field
of neighborhood relations, because far from being innocuous, it objectively disturbed, and
without necessity, the life of the plaintiff.”

This type of conduct may have repercussions in other spheres of law,
affect the privacy of third parties, so it is recommended that they be
exclusively oriented towards your particular property. The deterrent function of
this type of device is limited, therefore, by the proportionality of the
measure, which is fulfilled by avoiding intimidating third parties and being oriented towards the
main strategic points of the house (eg orientation towards
street, adjoining windows, etc.).

IV

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
of the alleged offender.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), which
establishes that:

"two. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible will have the following rights:

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is proven.”

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
of April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the
sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.”

v

In accordance with the foregoing, it is not proven that the device in question is
capturing or recording any image, so that by not being able to determine the
existence of effective data processing, it is not possible to speak of infringing conduct
within the scope of the regulatory framework of data protection, reason why
which proceeds to file this procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure as there is no
accredited administrative infraction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to A.A.A. and inform COMMUNITY
OWNERS ***URBANIZATION.1 OF ***LOCATION.1.
