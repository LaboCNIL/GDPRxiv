30 of the RGPD) in relation to the activities of processing personal data
carried out in the context of contracting services with EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.
2. Copy of the content included in the Risk Analysis or Assessment carried out by the
entity in compliance with article 32 of the RGPD in relation to the processing of
personal data collected in the context of contracting services with EDP
ENERGY, S.A.U.
3. Enter the information previously provided by the entity to the AEPD, registered
with the number 001390/2020, it is specified recursively (see evidences 2, 3, 4,
6, 10, 12, 14, 15) that the personal data will be processed for the set of
purposes described, in addition to by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., by another legal entity
(EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U). In this regard, the following information is requested:
3.1. Reason that justifies that both entities process the personal data collected.
3.2. Detail of the circumstances that determine, if any, that the treatments
carried out on specific personal data are executed by one or the other
entity.
3.3. Details, where appropriate, of the procedures and mechanisms used to
guarantee the separation of the personal data processed by one and another entity of
so that each one only has the possibility of dealing with what corresponds to it according to
of the legitimate purpose pursued at all times.

SEVENTH: On June 17, 2020, you have entered this Agency in writing of
EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. in which the following is stated with respect to the last
question raised in the requirement of this Agency referred to in point
previous:

“THIRD.- Among the information previously provided by the entity to the AEPD,
registered with the number 001387/2020, it is specified on a recurring basis (see
evidence 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15) that the personal data will be processed for the
set of purposes described, in addition to by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., by another
legal entity (EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.). In this regard, the following is requested
information:
 
3.1. Reason that justifies that both entities process the personal data collected.
 
3.2. Detail of the circumstances that determine, if any, that the treatments
carried out on specific personal data are executed by one or the other
entity.
 
As these two questions are directly related to each other, the answer is
joint to them. In relation to the evidence provided and
correspond to supports that are used to carry out the contracting through
of the different channels, reference is made to both EDP ENERGÍA and EDP
ENERGY S.A.U. (EDP ENERGÍA), because the company with which they are contracted
services will be one or the other depending on the product and/or service requested, being
highly likely that the same customer when requesting the contracting of the supply
electricity and gas, is contracting with both companies at the same time.
For this reason, the "dual" contract has been prepared and structured in such a way that a
customer can obtain discounts or additional benefits for hiring

both energies with two companies of the same business group, and in order to
keep updated the discounts in each of the energies and information
derived, it is necessary for both societies to know if the energy initially
contracted with the other Group company remains active in order to maintain and
correctly manage the discounts/advantages applied.
For this reason, and in order to provide the maximum possible transparency to a process
carried out eminently in writing, such as the contracting of services
energy, is why in the clause on data protection it is reported that
The personal data provided during the contracting process will be processed by
both entities, always respecting the functions of each one in accordance with the
contract signed in each case and particularly the type of energy services that
finally get hired.

On the other hand, and regardless of the foregoing, we inform that
Agency that the existence of two companies within the Group with the role of entities
marketers is due to a merely formal issue, a consequence of the
corporate structure and shareholding composition of the companies acquired by the
EDP Group at the time of its establishment in Spain, but not
corresponds to the operational functioning of said marketers, given that
only one of them, EDP ENERGÍA, currently has employees and capacity
management and operations. Thus, in practice, all treatments are
carried out by said entity, either in its capacity as data controller or as
in charge of the treatment of EDP ENERGÍA. Additionally, indicate that the Group
EDP planned the corporate reorganization of EDP ENERGÍA and EDP ENERGÍA and
the adaptation of its corporate structure with that of its actual operation and its
business operations. This reorganization has currently been affected by
a sale process to TOTAL in which both companies are immersed, and which
materialize, could alter or terminate said integration.
 
3.3. Details, where appropriate, of the procedures and mechanisms used to
guarantee the separation of the personal data processed by one and another entity of
so that each one only has the possibility of dealing with what corresponds to it according to
of the legitimate purpose pursued at all times.
 
As already stated, all users with access to the system are employees of
EDP ENERGY.
 
In this way, EDP agents access the personal data of EDP customers.

personal data of EDP ENERGÍA customers, in its capacity as Data Processor

quality of the two different roles they occupy under contractual regulation
that we make available to this Agency.” (SIC)

Together with said response, an extract from the Record of Treatment Activities is provided.

inherent, the risk scale has 4 levels: low, with a rating from 0 to 12;
medium rating from 13 to 25; high from 26 to 38 and very high from 39 to 51. The assessment or
weight given to each of the risk factors is from 1 to 4. In the analysis of
risks, a yes or no is marked for each of the sales channels in each of the
15 risk factors listed above. The sum of the weight attributed to each of
the factors for each channel determine the inherent risk. The result of the risk
inherent is average in all contracting channels, except for web channels and
external forces through home visits in which the result of the risk
inherent is low. No risk correction measures are indicated.

2. That, for all of the above, EDP has reviewed the procedure to be followed in the
contracting by third parties on behalf of the owner, in order to strengthen said
procedure and reduce the risks of possible identity theft carried out
in bad faith by the contracting party in this type of process, taking into account,
additionally, the particular needs identified due to the state of
alarm decreed last March and that has necessarily required that

3. That in order to inform the AEPD of the specific actions that are
being carried out in relation to this matter by EDP, in compliance
of your duty of proactive compliance (accountability), we enclose the
"Procedure of contracting by third parties on behalf of the owner", so that they have
visibility on the modifications that are being implemented in said processes
in order to meet your request in this regard, as well as to highlight the
EDP's proactivity regarding its suggestion to adapt said
process."

sanctioning
 
ELEVENTH: On July 31, 2020, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the
entity EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/2016,
regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Treatment of
Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data (General Regulation of
Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD), for the alleged violation of article 25
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) of the aforementioned Regulation; for the alleged
infringement of article 6 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned

Regulation; for the alleged infringement of article 22 of the RGPD, typified in the
Article 83.5.b) of the aforementioned Regulation; and for the alleged infringement of article 13 of the
RGPD, typified in article 83.5.b) of the aforementioned Regulation, determining that the
sanction that could correspond would amount to a total of 3,500,000.00 euros, without
prejudice to the result of the investigation.

TWELFTH: Once the aforementioned initiation agreement was notified, the investigated entity
presented on August 7, 2020 a letter in which he requested an extension of the term to the
purpose of submitting claims. Granted the extension of the term, they presented the
allegations on 08/25/2020 which are summarized as follows:

FIRST: ALLEGED BREACH OF THE PRIVACY PRINCIPLE BY
DESIGN IN CONTRACTING PROCESSES THROUGH REPRESENTATIVE.

The AEPD intends to justify the initiation of this disciplinary proceeding in the alleged
non-existence of documentation that has never been requested. In this regard, it must
It should be noted that EDP ENERGÍA has a methodology for the identification, analysis
and risk management, both to identify inherent risks and
specifically to assess the need to carry out the Evaluations of
Impact, Alleges that it includes as an annex the supporting documentation that proves,
amply, that EDP ENERGÍA fully and fully complies with these
obligations and which is specified in the following: - "Risk Analysis Methodology and
carrying out Impact Assessments” - “Record of Treatment activities and
risk assessment of treatments related to contracting EDP
ENERGY” - “Privacy Impact Assessment: Channel of Leads to Convert by
Telemarketing” - “Privacy Impact Assessment: Telemarketing to clients for

Likewise, and as a consequence of the measures adopted as a result of the
recommendations derived from risk analyzes and impact assessments
carried out by EPD ENERGÍA, the DPD has developed a large number of
procedures for compliance with data protection obligations from
the design and by default that are provided as annex 2.

Specifically, the following procedures are included in this Annex 2
related to Privacy by Design and by Default, which are part of the

It is really striking that the AEPD grants the relevance it grants to the fact
specifically that EDP ENERGÍA had not taken into account in its analysis of
risks, the specific analysis of the risks associated with the possibility of contracting
through a representative, when the AEPD itself, in its own “Practical Guide to
Risk Analysis in data processing subject to the RGPD” (published in its
web (https://www.aepd.es/sites/default/files/2019-09/guiaanalisis-de-riesgos-rgpd.pdf)
does not include any reference, neither direct nor indirect, to the need to evaluate the
specific risk in relation to data processing, either in contracts or in
other processes, carried out by authorized third parties.

Second, it alleges that all data processing carried out by
EDP ENERGÍA were analyzed to verify their degree of compliance with the
obligations related to RGPD, proposing measures for its correct
adaptation, regardless of whether assessments were necessary
impact or not. Delving into the specific risk related to the contracting carried out
by third parties, it must be indicated that the content of the analyzes carried out was
updated at the time, taking into account the considerations that the AEPD has
transferred to EDP ENERGÍA in the administrative procedure related to this
issue that began at the end of 2019 and that, we understand, is the cause of the
sanctioning procedure in which we find ourselves at the moment.
Indeed, as we have already had the opportunity to expose in the framework of said
sanctioning procedure previously initiated by the AEPD, the processes of
contracting through authorized third parties had not been identified by
EDP ENERGÍA as a relevant inherent risk factor, taking into account
account that: 1) The virtual non-existence of claims by customers in
related to this reason. 2) Until now, EDP ENERGÍA did not have any
sanction file opened for this cause. 3) The contracting carried out through
third party as verbal agent is expressly recognized in the Code
Civil 1889.

Although the potential risks identified by the AEPD are perfectly possible,
the probability of materialization of said risks, in the specific case of EDP
ENERGY, was practically nil and therefore his diligence, with regard to the
performance of the risk analysis, has been amply accredited.

 Specifically, this fact is based on the very low number of claims for
for this reason that EDP ENERGÍA has received. Indeed, the number of complaints
contracted through third parties, amounts to 8 cases out of a total of
105,606 contracts made, as stated in the information provided in the
own file, which we understand, that as surely the
AEPD with EDP ENERGÍA, in probabilistic terms, could be considered a
value that, objectively, does not require an independent assessment and
detailed. And it is not only that in absolute numbers the existing precedents in
the case of EDP ENERGÍA were practically nil (8 cases out of 105,606
contracts), but as the AEPD knows very well, of the aforementioned eight (8)
claims, there is only one sanctioning precedent for this entity,
having to take into consideration that the AEPD includes in its writing a procedure
which has not yet been firmly resolved (PS/00109/2019), to the extent that
it is being the subject of the corresponding contentious-administrative appeal
before the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court.

  It asserts that the possibility of concluding a contract between two parties through the
intermediation of a third party is an exclusive matter of Civil Law, so the
need, or not, of formalities associated with the accreditation of the representation has
to be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code and, where appropriate, by the provisions of the
consumer protection regulations. In this regard, the requirement by the
AEPD that the representation referred to by the representative is recorded in a medium that
allows its accreditation could be considered logical in an isolated interpretation of
data protection regulations, but it loses meaning when put into context
with the rest of the legal system, more specifically, with the provisions of the Code
Civil, which contemplates, among others, the possibility of contracting by representative
collected in article 1259, or the figure of the “mandate”, regulated in articles 1709
to 1739 of the same and that establish that: "by the mandate contract, a
person to provide a service or do something for the account or commission of another” and
for which total freedom of form is allowed, establishing that «the mandate can
be express or implied" and that, likewise, "acceptance may also be express or
tacit, the latter deducted from the acts of the president. In this case, it does not seem
that such a wide freedom of form is compatible with obtaining evidence of
the existence of the representation or the mandate, beyond the manifestations of the
agent, protected by contractual good faith. Also, it is little
It is understandable that a separate consent is required for the treatment of
your data or a confirmation of the order by the principal, since this
would imply distorting the representation, since it would be absurd that whoever is
appointed to enter into a contract in favor of a third party cannot provide
the data of the person on whose behalf it acts, or that confirmation is necessary
separate from it to authorize said communication, since the need to
addressing the principal directly would make the intervention of the representative useless,
because it would be meaningless.

Likewise, and in relation to the possibility that the principal may provide
additional consents to the contract itself, it should be noted that this
possibility may well have been authorized by the principal in a
specific, but by governing the same freedom of form for the granting of this
authority (which the rule does not oblige in any case to have in writing), nor is it
Reliable accreditation is required at the time of contracting. About this
In particular, it should be noted that to date there have been no assumptions in the
that no type of incidents have been reported by those represented
related to the granting of said consents.

With regard to other risks identified by the AEPD, it should be noted that the
risk of identity theft is very low, since the representative is identified
personally by reliable means when the hiring is face-to-face and
providing your ID data when you do it remotely. However, as well
the AEPD knows the theory of risks, it does not maintain that the existence of a low risk
could be considered a non-existent risk. In this sense, the risks of the existence
identity theft do not differ from those that correspond to the
contracts in their own name, since the same checks are carried out for
avoid it, based on the risks and threats detected in relation to each form
hiring. For all these reasons, it cannot be taken for granted that this risk has not been
taken into consideration by EDP Specifically, this fact is based on the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

29/136

very low number of complaints for this reason received by EDP ENERGÍA, nor
that no measures have been adopted to mitigate it, as
will be set out below in the explanation regarding the contracting procedure.
On the other hand, as far as the potential economic damages are concerned, although this
is an issue more linked back to the civil field of contracting than to the
protection of personal data, it must be indicated that in the cases in which the
cancellation of contracts for any reason, EDP ENERGÍA assumes the costs of
the services provided, so there would be no economic damage to the
affected, proof of this is that EDP ENERGÍA has so far not received
no claim for the alleged damages put forward by the AEPD

Regarding the way in which the contracting is carried out, as was already stated and it is
both in the information made available to that Agency and in the Background
de Facto of the Home Agreement, the contracting of the services is preceded by a
series of guarantees that allow identifying the author of the contracts, following the
common practices throughout the supply services contracting sector and
companies of what is known as "Utilities", both in person and remotely,
leaving this information registered, so that, in the event of any
incident there is proof of who is the person who has carried out the
hiring. Contrary to the insignificance that the AEPD intends to grant to the
declaration of the representative, perfectly identified, on his condition of
representative of the person on whose behalf you contract, it should be noted that this
manifestation has binding legal consequences, which, as already stated,
are subject to regulation and are expressly recognized by our
Legal System, and that imply responsibilities, both from the point of
civil view, as criminal, so it is not a "mere demonstration", as the
comes to denominate the AEPD in the Foundations of Law of its writing of initiation of
sanctioning procedure, but rather it is a legal act, such as the
own consent of the owner, defined by the RGPD itself as a "manifestation
of will”. Consequently, it does not appear that a legal defense can be made
discrimination of the relevance of some manifestations compared to others, due to the fact that
that are collected or not within a specific regulation, or manifested in a
form, or another. Similarly, as stated in the factual records, although
later it seems to be ignored in the Foundations of Law, in all cases
in which the contracting is carried out remotely, it is indicated that: "To the holder of the contract,
informative purposes, it is sent to you in duplicate, with a stamped envelope, the
contractual documentation in compliance with the provisions of the regulations of
consumer and user protection. That is why, in any case, the holder
has the possibility of knowing the terms in which the

 Notwithstanding all of the above, as a result of the sanctioning procedures opened in
the year 2019, and following the criteria transferred by the AEPD in the resolution of the
PS/00109/2019 (do not sign on the day of the presentation of this document, due to being appealed)
EDP ENERGÍA has proceeded to identify the risk related to the
intervention of third parties in the contracting, making the corresponding analysis

compliance with the considerations of the AEPD so that in the procedures

The proposed contracting protocol has been brought to the attention of the AEPD in

30/136

dated July 16, 2020 and registration number 025308/2020, presented in any case
before receiving the letter of Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure, being
an information requirement with a common number for EPD ENERGÍA and EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA without the AEPD to date having ruled on
to the same with the corresponding legal valuation report, as
requested, in order to implement a system that was fully compliant with the
criteria and interpretations of the AEPD, limited so far to include in the
Startup Agreement sent to EDP ENERGÍA certain considerations in
relationship with himself. Specifically, the doubts raised in relation to the
proposed procedure, which we understand are the only ones that the AEPD has, are the
following: 1) it is not clarified if it applies to all contracting channels, including the
Leads subchannel that is not referenced; 2) situations are not considered
in which the principal cannot be informed by the indicated means (email
email or SMS); 3) the client is not informed of the consents given by the
representative for other treatments with purposes other than contracting the
service requested during the contracting process, nor the possibility of revoking
such consents. 4) no effective dates of implementation of this are indicated
process.

  Again, incomprehensibly, instead of requesting additional information from EDP
ENERGY in relation to the proposed procedure, the AEPD chooses to interpret
information whose content is not clear to you negatively. However, and as
We understand that the will of the AEPD, like that of EDP ENERGÍA, is to achieve a
procedure that allows not only to comply with the different modalities of
contracting provided for in the Civil Code, recognized by the consumer authorities
and the competent courts in contractual matters, but also to the
considerations of the AEPD, then we proceed to clarify those that
we understand would be the only doubts of the AEPD in relation to the modifications to the
contracting procedure submitted: 1) The proposed procedure will be applied to
all contracting channels with which EDP ENERGÍA works, including those
“Leads” and any other that EDP ENERGÍA implements in the future. 2) Regarding the
doubt raised about what would happen in the event that the contracting person does not
has none of the means provided to carry out the confirmation of the
contracting (email or SMS), indicate that the alternatives will be: a. Do it
the owner himself b. Presenting written authorization and a copy of the DNI of
representative and represented 3) Regarding the consents granted and the
possibility of revoking them, it should be noted that with the communication access is given to the
contractual documentation, where each of the consents is stated. The
user, once this information is known, has the possibility of modifying them. Nope
However, following the comment of the AEPD in which it questions the validity of the
Authorization of the representative for the authorization of additional consents to the
contracting, EDP ENERGÍA proposes to allow representation only for this purpose and
will obtain the additional consents directly from the owner. 4) Regarding the
implementation date, it depends precisely on the opinion that on this
procedure manifests the AEPD, since it would not make sense to start it if
the supervisory authority considers that it does not meet its criteria to consider it a
appropriate procedure, taking into account the economic costs associated with this
implementation, in addition to the resources of time and dedication necessary for the
deployment of these measures.

 It is alleged that the alleged breach of the obligations of article 25 RGPD, and
the consequent quantification of the possible sanction to be imposed on the client
derived from said alleged non-compliance, lack any basis for their
consideration. In addition, and, in any case, the quantification of said possible sanction
it lacks any hint of being proportionate.

SECOND. - ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE IN RELATION TO THE
 .
CONSENT GIVEN BY THE INTERESTED PARTY
 

It alleges that it is interested in stating that the treatment relating to the creation of
a commercial profile based on the information of third parties for the referral of
advertising information is not, in practice, being carried out, nor at the date of
issuance of these allegations, nor prior to them. For the
Therefore, the treatment that could potentially have been carried out has not had
place in any case, at any time, so that, even if it can be questioned
from the perspective of the other requirements of the RGPD, it is not possible to attribute to EDP
ENERGY the performance of an unlawful conduct that may be punishable
derived from the mere obtaining of the consents related to a treatment of
data that, to date, has been non-existent and therefore has not generated the
alleged damages to the fundamental rights of citizens wielded by this
Agency.

 The commission of the reference infringement, regulated in article 83.5 (a) RGPD and in
72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, necessarily requires that the
caused a treatment and that about it has not been identified or has not been
regularized the adequate basis of legitimation, by stating: “1. Depending on what
established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and
Infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after three years.
of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following: (...) b. The
processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of legality
of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

In relation to informed consent, in the Agreement to Start the Procedure
Sanctioning party to consider that the required consent is not valid, it is based on
the consideration that the information provided to the interested party is not
sufficient, insofar as neither what third-party databases are going to be consulted nor
what type of data will be collected, so that the interested party does not know
absolutely what it is that you are consenting to. And it is appreciated that a single
consent for two different purposes.

In this regard, it is alleged that the information is provided in response to the good
practices enunciated by the AEPD itself and ratified by the LOPDGDD, so that
is transferred to the interested parties through the double layer system, so that
the interested party can reinforce the information provided through the consultation that consists
in it, through the different mechanisms that are granted for this purpose
(information locution, back of the physical document or website of EDP ENERGÍA.

In relation to the absence of clear identification of third-party sources or the
categories of data, it should be noted that such information may be derived from the
information provided to the client in the first layer (by clearly identifying that the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

32/136

treatment will be carried out with third-party sources) as in the second layer, whose
content is contained in the section called "general conditions of the contract",
whose content indicates: "(II) The elaboration of commercial profiles of the Client
by aggregating EDP databases with data from
databases of third parties, in order to offer the Client products and services
customized, thus improving the customer experience. (III) The adoption of
automated decisions, such as allowing the hiring, or not, of certain
products and/or services based on the Client's profile and particularly, on data
such as, the history of non-payments, the history of contracts, permanence,
locations, consumption data, types of devices connected to the energy network, and
similar data that allow knowing in greater detail the risks associated with the
hiring. (iv) Based on the results obtained from the aggregation of the
indicated data, EDP may make personalized offers and specifically
aimed at achieving the contracting of certain EDP products and/or services.”
As reflected in the cited text, EDP ENERGÍA has widely identified
detail the types of data that are processed for the detailed purposes, being the sources
consulted for this an obvious derivation of the above.

The indication made about obtaining third-party sources is therefore
sufficient content for the user to be fully aware that their
authorization will suppose the possibility that the authorized entity can obtain said
information. It must be remembered that there is no legal requirement that imposes that, in the
At the time of collecting the data of the interested party, the questioned information must
be contemplated directly in the requested consent. That is, being the
origin of the data the interested party, it is only up to the Entity to inform
in accordance with the provisions of article 13 RGPD, a provision that does not establish, in
none of its precepts, the obligation to identify neither the source nor the type of
the data. Only in the event that said treatment had been reached
carry out, the Entity should have reported such extremes, since only in
At that time, the provisions of article 14 RGPD would apply. given account
of the non-materialization of said enrichment, this information did not become
transferred to the interested party, not appearing in EDP ENERGÍA data bases
unrelated to those that have been provided or generated on the occasion of the relationship
contract held between the parties.

In addition, it should be noted that, in the event that the obtaining of data
from a third party, would be the one who, in his capacity as assignor of the data,
would be obliged to legitimize the communication of the data on the basis of the
consent of the interested party, notwithstanding that EDP ENERGÍA would also do so, in
compliance with its information obligation once data has been obtained
of a third party in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD. In this sense, said
situation could only occur, in the event that the interested party, exercising his
right to dispose of the data and with full awareness of it, would have
expressed your authorization for your personal data to travel to another company,
such as EDP ENERGÍA, who could only make use of them, in the
assuming that he had also expressed his consent, by means of the
marking of the box or the express indication, indicating that "Yes" in case of
be done by phone.

33/136

On the other hand, in relation to the alleged accumulation of treatment purposes,
when pointing out that the interested party would authorize the sending of advertising and, secondly, the
use so that EDP ENERGÍA can assess the feasibility of contracting by
said user. In relation to this point, we must state that the assessment
carried out by the AEPD starts from an erroneous premise, considering that they are
two differentiated treatments, in a case in which it is clear that it is
a single purpose, such as the generation of a commercial profile, the use of which is
sticks to two contexts linked to each other: (i) the first, to carry out the assessment
of the possibility of contracting and, (ii) the second, to issue the corresponding offers
commercial to the user in question.

In this way, both assumptions are necessarily interrelated,
since there is no doubt that it would be meaningless to design a customer profile, based on
the data provided by the user and those derived from the service provided, for the
referral of a commercial offer that was sent to an interested party who did not comply
the internal parameters of the Entity to carry out a contract at the moment
of your request.

 In relation to this aspect, it is well known by this company that the RGPD requires
that the consents that are collected are specific, as well as it is
unanimous criterion of the control authorities point out that the grouping of purposes
related to each other, as would happen in this case, has a full place in said
concept, without such grouping giving rise to the consideration, per se, that it has not been
specifically obtained consent. In this area, the approach
on which the AEPD maintains the non-compliance attributed to EDP ENERGÍA,
It ignores the regulation established by the LOPGDD, in which article 6.2 states that: “2.
When it is intended to base the processing of the data on the consent of the
affected for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to state
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.” To the light
of the above, there is an evident specific regulation that enables the grouping of
purposes that the AEPD is now questioning

As an additional matter, it is indicated by this Agency that the consent obtained
is not in accordance with the regulations, considering that it is not explicit, but
obtained in the same way as a general consent, although there are no
clearly identified the reasons why it would not meet the criteria
issued. For these purposes, the inclusion of the analyzed consent is carried out in a
separate context to the acceptance of the contract itself, so that either
is collected in a box in those contexts in which there is documentary support
for it, or in an informative locution that is read and that must be
expressly ratified by the interested party to understand that it has been provided.

 In this regard, in the absence of clarity in the regulations on the ways that will allow
determine that a consent deserves to be considered explicit (understood
as a reinforced consent to the one already required by the RGPD), in the aforementioned
Guideline 5/2020 mentions various nuances that help in this clarification. Of
it is extracted that, in addition to meeting the requirements defined in the
article 7 GDPR, the validity of an explicit consent does not require the attention of
exact requirements, which may be valid both in written documents and in
telephone recordings.

At this point, it is interesting to emphasize an essential question: although there is neither
legal precept or opinion from the control authorities that determine
clearly the requirements to consider that the consent obtained is
explicit, nor the differences that correspond to the "regular" consent, yes it is
attributed to EDP ENERGÍA, and to any other entities that act as
responsible for the treatment, the task of defining at their free discretion in what situations
shall understand that such requirement has been fulfilled.

 Said casuistry can only cause serious legal insecurity, which in the
course that concerns us is not solved, not even with the foundation that
It is stated in the document of the Agreement to Start the sanctioning procedure, since in
At no time is it clearly stated what factor, element or action has not been
executed by EDP ENERGÍA, to determine that its conduct has resulted
unlawful and deserves a sanction of such magnitude. Accordingly, the
request to the client for an obvious action, such as the verbal indication that yes
consent or the marking of a box, the content of which clearly sets out the purposes
for which the data will be used, which is unrelated to any other
acceptance and that is not subject to other purposes, must be considered as a
explicit consent in order to comply with the obligation imposed by the
data protection regulations.

 In view of the extremes mentioned, EDP ENERGÍA complies with all
of the legally required requirements, of what must necessarily be concluded
that the work of the Entity to obtain the consent of the client, so
explicit, have been rigorously addressed. It is proof of this that, both in the
telephone channels, such as those in which they are carried out in writing, the
Obtaining consent is carried out in a different way from the actual
contracting, it is stated that it is additional to it and is understood to be collected,
only, in cases where the client checks the box or clearly states
that he does consent From all this we can only conclude that the collection process
consent has been made in light of the criteria required by the
applicable regulations, being therefore adjusted to Law.

Thus, the process of obtaining consent that EDP ENERGÍA comes from
using is not something new for the AEPD, which has had the opportunity to analyze
the same prior to the start of this disciplinary proceeding, in those
files (information requirements and/or sanctioning procedures)
opened due to a claim from a user. Within these, the
AEPD had full knowledge of the contracting process and the type of
consents that were collected from the interested parties, having been provided the
contracts by EDP ENERGÍA as evidence of compliance. Needless to say, the
final result of both turned out to be the archive of the same (see the
claims with reference E/00915/2019, which was not even admitted for processing, and the
file E/02714/2019), without additional assessments being made on the
compliance with the regulations, which only deepens the confusion that
this party has in the face of the very serious accusations made against EDP ENERGÍA for
this Agency.

Additionally, and without prejudice to the arguments set forth, it is noteworthy that
presumption made in the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure, in which
the valuation relative to the infractions is carried out taking as a premise a double
attribution: (i) the first, derived from the absence of adequate information and, (ii) the
second, as a consequence of the execution of a non-consensual treatment. To these
purposes, it should be noted that, even if the information provided
to the interested party is deficient, this fact cannot lead to the determination of a
infringement of article 6 RGPD, since the treatment that would be carried out takes
as a starting point the adequate legitimizing base. Thus, the definition
carried out by EDP ENERGÍA regarding the legal basis that would allow it to process the data
with the purposes that have already been mentioned, it would be strictly limited to the legitimation
that corresponds. In other words, EDP ENERGÍA carries out the actions
necessary to obtain the corresponding consent of the interested party,
granting the possibility of granting it or not, voluntarily, through the
marking of the box provided or the express indication in the cases that these are
collected by phone call. For all these reasons, it cannot be seen
conduct that may be legally reprehensible to EDP ENERGÍA, taking into account
that has rigorously subscribed to the terms required by the norm, when proceeding to
request the interested party an action of express, free, unequivocal will and not
conditional on another purpose. And for this reason it is not possible to impute to my client the commission of
any infringement of those typified in article 83.5.a) RGPD, in relation to its
article 6.

THIRD. - ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE IN RELATION TO THE
DATA PROCESSING RELATED TO AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND
PREPARATION OF CUSTOMER PROFILES.

Thirdly, the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure establishes in its
Basis of Law IV a series of alleged breaches linked to the
apparent lack of observance by EDP ENERGÍA of the obligations
derived from the provisions of article 22 of the RGPD, regarding the consideration by
part of the AEPD of the existence of an impediment, the obstruction or the non-
reiterated attention to the exercise of the rights established in articles 15 to 22
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to automated decisions and the
preparation of customer profiles, typified in article 83.5.b) RGPD and, qualified
as a very serious breach for prescription purposes in article 72.1.k) of the
LOPDGDD. Specifically, the AEPD maintains that:
1) EDP ENERGÍA does not grant users the possibility of exercising their right
regarding not being the subject of automated decisions, as well as not granting the user the
proper information regarding this right,
2) The user is unaware of the possibility of refusing the adoption of this type of
decisions.
In this way, the sanction proposed by the AEPD is based on the fact that the
information that is provided by EDP ENERGÍA to data owners is
insufficient and imprecise, without prejudice to the recognition by the AEPD that EDP
ENERGÍA facilitates and makes available to users the documents with
information regarding compliance with data protection regulations, both in the
time of contracting, as in durable support at the end of the contract.

Firstly, regarding the information provided by EDP ENERGÍA in
relationship with the legitimate basis (consent in the case at hand)
We must emphasize that the information that is provided to users regarding the
treatments that, being additional to the contract itself, require the
consent of the user, is duly provided to users.

☐

☐

 Specifically, in the so-called Evidence 6 presented by EDP ENERGÍA during the
Substantiation of the informative file of which the present sanctioning file
brings cause, the following is reflected in the supply contract model:
boxes: “You can read the information regarding the processing of your personal data in
the reverse.
 I consent to the processing of my personal data once the
contractual relationship, for the realization of commercial communications adapted to
my profile of products and services related to the supply and consumption of energy.
Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the term and after the
termination of the contract, on non-energy products and services, both of the
EDP Group companies and third parties.
 I consent to the processing of my data
personal for the elaboration of my commercial profile with information coming from
third-party databases, for the adoption, by EDP, of decisions
automated in order to send personalized commercial proposals, as well as
as to allow, or not, the contracting of certain services” In this case, and
expanding information regarding the processing of user data in the
general conditions, we find the following information; "As long as the customer
you have explicitly accepted it, your personal data will be processed, even once
once the contractual relationship has ended and as long as there is no opposition to said
treatment, for: (I) The promotion of financial services, protection services of
payments, automotive or related and electronic, own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or
participation in promotional contests, as well as for the presentation of
commercial proposals linked to the energy sector after the end of the contract,
(II) The elaboration of commercial profiles of the Client through the aggregation of the
databases of third parties, in order to offer the Client products and services
customized, thus improving the customer experience, (III) The adoption of
automated decisions, such as allowing the hiring, or not, of certain
products and/or services based on the Client's profile and particularly, on data
such as, the history of non-payments, the history of contracts, permanence,
locations, consumption data, types of devices connected to the energy network, and
similar data that allow knowing in greater detail the risks associated with the
hiring. (IV) Based on the results obtained from the aggregation of
indicated data, EDP may make personalized offers, and specifically
aimed at achieving the contracting of products and/or services of EDP or third parties
entities depending on whether the client has so consented or not, being in any case
processed data whose age will not exceed one year. In the event that this process
carried out in an automated way, the client will always have the right to obtain
human intervention by EDP, admitting the challenge and, where appropriate,
assessment of the resulting decision.

From these fragments, it can only be concluded that (i) both for the preparation of
profiles, such as for data processing by adopting automated decisions EDP
ENERGÍA requests the explicit and specific consent of the user, without being able to
be interpreted that the adoption of automated decisions is treated under another basis
legitimizing, as well as that (ii) the information related to the elaboration of profiles and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

37/136

automated decisions, complies with the requirements of article 13 of the RGPD, since
that informs about the existence of automated decisions, including the elaboration of
profiles and provides significant information on the applied logic, as well as the
importance and expected consequences of such processing for the data subject. By
all this and taking into account the first aspect raised by the AEPD regarding the
alleged breach committed by EDP ENERGÍA in relation to the information
provided to users to obtain specific consent, there is no
any interpretation regarding the lack of information and confusing treatment by
of EDP ENERGÍA, which includes the information corresponding to the treatments
specific, providing all the information required in the RGPD.
 
Secondly, in relation to the information provided to the owners of the data
Regarding the exercise of rights, it should be noted that EDP ENERGÍA informs
expressly to users in the information provided to them of their right
specific to “oppose” to “the adoption of automated decisions of your data
personal, requiring human intervention in the process, as well as to challenge
the decisions that are finally adopted by virtue of the processing of your data”.

  In this sense, the AEPD considers that EDP ENERGÍA is in breach of its obligation to
inform the holders of the data by the mere fact that in the information
provided does not appear, expressly and literally, the right to “revoke the
consent”, appearing in its place the verb that grants the right of the
data owners to "oppose" to "the adoption of automated decisions of their
personal data, requiring human intervention in the process, as well as
challenge the decisions that are finally adopted by virtue of the treatment of
your data". We are sure that the semantic and technical nuance associated with both
verbs "opposition" and "revocation", both the experts that the AEPD has,
such as those owned by EDP ENERGÍA are capable of differentiating them
each other, and determine that these are two legal concepts, but it will also be convenient
with us that Agency, that the average user (a concept widely used by
part of that Agency throughout the procedure that concerns us) is hardly going to
be able to distinguish these concepts. In the case at hand, what is really
What is important is the effect that the user's request has in practice, which, in
definitively, it is the one that is relevant for the owner of the data, and that generates
positive or negative to their fundamental rights, this being what really
protects the RGPD, and not the use of one verb or another, even more so when the same
They can be used as synonyms.

In this case, the only thing that is intended to be used in the information that is provided to the
users the term "opposition" regarding automated decisions, is to be able to
provide the user with a clear, concise and transparent understanding of the information that
is made available to you, and facilitating, in the event that the request of said interested party
complies with the regulatory requirements, the exercise of the different
Rights. Thus, according to the definition contained in the RAE Dictionary, revoking
means "to render without effect"; and to oppose, “to put something against another thing to prevent its
effect”, so except for those who have knowledge in the matter and
can appreciate the nuance that differentiates one from the other, the truth is that, for purposes of
majority of the population, both terms would be synonymous and would suppose, in the
practice, same thing.

Notwithstanding all of the foregoing, we must highlight, by the
relevance that this has in this allegation, the information contained in Clause 16
of the General Conditions of Contract, regarding data protection. In
said clause, in the section corresponding to "Rights of the owner of the data"
expressly refers to the possibility of revoking the consent previously
granted, thus, it is expressly indicated "(VII) Withdraw, at any time,
the consents granted.

It refers to its internal procedure, and states that therefore, not only the
Users are informed at all times of the possibility of revoking the
consents granted, but rather that EDP ENERGÍA itself, as a procedure
and in order that those in charge of managing the requests have the
necessary knowledge in relation to the different possibilities, express with
express nature of said right, regardless of the technical term used, since
that the main purpose is to inform and that the user knows the possibility of not being
object of automated decisions. Thus, the internal procedure referenced
above even collects response models to be able to attend with character
In general, the different requests. All this, without prejudice to the fact that each of the
requests are treated in a particular way and according to the specific circumstances of
affect the specific case, and it is necessary to adapt said model of
response depending on the specific casuistry of each request. It is provided as
Annex 3 the procedure related to the management and answering of the exercises of
Rights.

In view of the foregoing, the AEPD addresses the lack of knowledge of the average user,
as an argument to consider informative clauses as not very transparent,
aspect that nevertheless considers substantially essential when relating only
as a valid exercise the opposition of the interested party. Considering that the right
related to not being subject to automated decisions is collected with
independent and express character in the general contracting conditions,
requiring, where appropriate, the explicit and specific consent of the user, and
being the same duly reporting specifically, as
is justified by the evidence provided, as well as the possibility of opposing
to be subject to automated decisions, it is at least surprising that the
AEPD considers that EDP ENERGÍA does not comply with article 22 RGPD for not
offer the client the possibility to “revoke consent” literally, that is,
strictly formal and semantic aspect, that an average user without knowledge in
matter has no ability to understand the difference with the word “opposition”,
understanding that Agency that it is not valid to inform of the possibility of "opposing",
as a synonym, to said treatment, which is what EDP effectively performs
ENERGY.

In line with the above, it should be noted that EDP ENERGÍA has in no case
denied the exercise of rights that have not been requested/drafted with
precise character, directing in case of doubt the request to the user, so that the same
can be resolved effectively, satisfactorily and without delay.

Likewise, as has already been reflected in previous points, in relation to the
automated decisions, the possibility is offered to the client to obtain intervention
human, admitting challenge and, where appropriate, assessment of the resulting decision,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

39/136

which is why, in addition to informing about the possibility of not being subject to
automated decisions, the client is empowered as an alternative to intervene
human. For all of the above, it cannot be reasonably interpreted that the holder of
the data may, even remotely, be unaware of the possibility or right to
that your data is not subject to automated decisions, nor that EDP ENERGÍA
places limitations, or does not make available to said interested parties the mechanisms
necessary to be able to make the request, being able at any time to “oppose”
to said treatment, or better said, "revoke" the consent given for the
adoption of such decisions, as well as requesting human intervention, which on the other hand
side, in the case of EDP ENERGÍA it always occurs, because although the query of
the information is automated, the final decision is made by an employee after
analyze its content.

It is provided as Annex 4, by way of example, exercises of right of opposition and
revocation of consent that have been processed during the last year, to those
effects that the AEPD can know, first hand, what kind of rights are
exercised by the holders, in what modality they are received, as well as specifically
how they are duly attended by EDP ENERGÍA.

Furthermore, and in order to address the true scope of the infraction,
despite the fact that EDP ENERGÍA includes the possibility of profiling and adopting
automated decisions, the only profiling carried out is that related to the qualification of
customers in terms of fraud prevention, treatment for which there is
legal authorization and is based on the legitimate interest of EDP ENERGÍA, with
the purpose of safeguarding the good future of contracts made by EDP
ENERGY, as well as to prevent customers, whose sole purpose is to consume the service
energy without paying the bills, become part of the customer portfolio.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the owners of the data are informed that said profiling is
reviewed and finally processed by EDP ENERGÍA personnel, which is why
can be considered as an automated decision in itself, considering in this
literal sense of the concept established by the authorities. In other words,
there is no data processing based on automated decisions, nor is there
any statement about such treatments, since outside of those strictly
necessary to continue with the service and those provided by law, are not
carried out, which is why, not only can it not be considered that there
breach of article 22 of the RGPD, since the requirements are met
collected by the regulations, but that there are not, nor can there be data owners who
may have been affected by said treatments, so we refer to the
extensive jurisprudence previously enunciated in this section for being of full
application to the case at hand.

This is enough so that there is no basis whatsoever in order to attribute to my client
any infraction of those typified in article 83.5.b) RGPD in relation to its
cited article 22, however, for dialectic purposes and in the unlikely event that
If the commission of said infraction could be considered proven, we state what
follows in relation to the amount of the sanction foreseen for said alleged infraction

Make a series of considerations on the evaluative criteria included in the
RGPD, understanding that the aggravating factors considered in the initial agreement by the
AEPD would not concur in this specific case, concluding that it has not been substantiated
fully the seriousness, nor the criteria that allow setting such a high amount of
sanction in this case.

FOURTH.- ALLEGED BREACH IN RELATION TO THE DUTY TO
TRANSPARENCY.

The AEPD, in its Agreement to Initiate Sanctioning Procedure, attributes to EDP
ENERGY the infringement of Article 13 of the RGPD, assuming a breach of
duty of information that is its own as responsible for the treatment, typified in
article 83.5.b) and classified as minor for prescription purposes in article 74.a)
of the LOPDGDD. Specifically, it considers the existence of said infringement due to:
 1) lack of information to the interested parties about the possibility of accessing information
required in article 13 of the RGPD.
2) the web address provided does not lead directly to the required information
in accordance with article 13 of the RGPD, without allowing immediate access to the
information, nor is access easy for anyone. EDP ENERGY no
has another remedy to manifest, again, and as he has done and demonstrated in the
rest of the alleged breaches alleged by this Agency, which cannot
share the appraisals made by the AEPD, which is why the following
will identify the reasons why it understands that, in effect, EDP ENERGÍA
fully complies with the requirements of the data protection regulations
data in terms of transparency in relation to the information provided to the
holders of personal data in the contracting processes.

As regards the CAC inbound channel, on which it is stated that the information
provided is incomplete, it must be indicated that, since these are incoming calls, there is
start of the call, before the recording starts – and regardless of the
management that intends to carry out who calls the customer service department of the
entity-, a telephone announcement informing, among other aspects, of the
rights that attend the interested parties, as well as where to find information
additional, so that users receive this information whenever they call,
which not only means that this information is provided to them in the call in which they go
contracting the supply, but also when they are already customers and are going to
carry out any procedure (be it a query, request a change of power,
make a payment, request an installment or file a claim).

In this sense, it should be noted that the RGPD itself expressly provides in its
point 13.4 that: “The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply
when and to the extent that the interested party already has the information. So,
clients receive all the required information in a first layer of information
verbally, which they can complete by accessing the EDP ENERGÍA website or
directly in the call itself, depending on the management that is carried out.

 Thus, this information is provided in layers, distinguishing on the one hand the layer
1. “This call may be recorded. The data you provide us will be processed by

established to comply with the legal obligations of maintenance of the
information and, at most, during the statute of limitations for legal actions
corresponding, the data must be kept blocked during the aforementioned
prescription period. After this period, the data will be deleted.
In application of the provisions of article 32 of the RGPD, EDP undertakes to
comply with the security obligations of the data provided by users,
trying to establish all the technical means at its disposal to avoid loss,
misuse, alteration, unauthorized access and theft of the data that the user provides to
through it, taking into account the state of the technology, the nature of the data
provided and the risks to which they may be exposed. Without prejudice of the previous,
the user must be aware that the security measures in the CHANNEL
TELEFONICO are not impregnable.
EDP will treat the user's data confidentially at all times, keeping
the mandatory duty of secrecy over them, in accordance with the provisions of the
application regulations.
 The user can exercise their rights of access, rectification, deletion, opposition,
limitation and portability, as well as the revocation of the consents granted
previously, in the legally established terms, communicating it in writing to
EDP, to the following address: LOPD Communication Channel, Plaza del Fresno, nº2,

6, 28001 Madrid"

Next, it is indicated by that Agency that "the provisions of the
Article 11.1 of the LOPDGDD in the other two telephone channels (Telemarketing and
Leads), nor is the interested party informed that they can access all the information required
in accordance with article 13 RGPD at the indicated electronic address. Nevertheless,
such affirmation is made after reproducing the AEPD the texts in which it informs the
clients of the identity of the person in charge of the treatment, the purposes of the treatment,
as well as the rights they can exercise and the website where they can obtain information
additional. Therefore, it does not seem that such a statement corresponds to the reality of the
facts, so we understand that the Agency will see fit to modify and eliminate this
alleged non-compliance in its draft resolution proposal.

The analysis continues by referring to the fact that the general conditions of
contracting to which the information is sent, indicating that those hosted on the web
they are not easily accessible. In this regard, it is interesting to specify that:
1) Article 11 of the LOPGDD refers to the fact that this information must be provided to the
interested "indicating an electronic address or other means that allows access to
simple and immediate way to the rest of the information" and that, in this case, as
informs the interested party in the locution, after contracting a copy of the
contract in which, obviously, the general contracting conditions are included,
therefore, direct access to said information is provided. Complementarily,
This information is available at all times on the web.

2) Faced with the alleged difficulty alluded to by the AEPD in finding the aforementioned
general conditions contrasts the fact that, as exemplified, a simple
search to access them directly, using the search engine
available on the website. Performing the search for "contract conditions"
or "general contracting conditions", the first results are published
documents related to the general contracting conditions that are of
application in both Spanish, Galician, Catalan, and Basque, leaving
clearly identified the documentation that refers directly to the document
in PDF format, as evidenced at the following address: ***URL.3.

3) Regarding what is required to be "searched in the general conditions (which
include numerous aspects related to contracting) the information related to the
data protection”, it must be made clear that the general conditions
They are composed of four pages, of which practically one of them is
is exclusively dedicated to providing information on the treatment of
personal data made by EDP ENERGÍA, as we are sure that the
AEPD has been able to verify during the procedure for preparing its writ of
sanction proposal.

In relation to this alleged non-compliance, it is worth mentioning the guidelines
provided by the Article 29 Working Group, in which it recommends including the
access to information regarding the processing of personal data through
means in which the interested party can immediately recognize where and how
access this information, (direct links or in the form of an answer to a question
in natural language, in the FAQ section, or pop-ups).

 However, it also states that "depending on the circumstances of the collection
and data processing, a data controller could be forced to
use additionally. [...]”. Other possible ways of transmitting the information to the
interested parties derived from the following different environments of personal data could
include the following modes, listed below, applicable to the
relevant environments. a) On paper, for example, when concluding contracts by means
postcards: written explanations, brochures, information in contract documents,
cartoons, infographics or flow charts; b) By phone: explanations
verbal expressions directly by a person to allow a conversation and the
response to questions, or automated or pre-recorded information with the possibility of
hear more detailed additional information;

The Article 29 Working Group, solely and exclusively provides this information to
recommendation mode, without in any case being considered a bad practice,
nor of course a regulatory breach the fact of making the publication to
through a simple method that, taking into account that the service requires the
conclusion of a contract, the essential method and format and therefore that prevails in this
course is the same as indicated in the guidelines of the GT29, through the
medium in paper and telephone support. All this, without prejudice to keeping accessible
through the web for anyone interested who decides to carry out and attend the
content in an intuitive and simple way and without prejudice to the obligation to deliver in
durable support all the contractual information both with the previous information, as well as

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

44/136

with the contract itself. In this sense, we can see that the possibility of
linking "immediately" is likely to be interpreted.

 The AEPD itself on its website makes it the interested party who must "get it right" or
"find out" which of the treatments included in the record of activities of the
entity are those that really affect its relationship with the AEPD, since the
purposes are included within the description of each of them and not in the
privacy policy that is accessed.
 
As far as the identity of the data controller is concerned, the
information already provided after the request for additional information on June 3,
2020 in which EDP ENERGÍA was required, for this purpose, within the Requirement of
Information E/05549/2019 in which it was explained that the fact that it includes
information of both entities is due to the fact that it is not possible to know in advance
contracting the services that will be requested by the interested party (gas and/or
electricity) nor, therefore, by which of the companies will they be provided, so this
can only be specified when said services are identified by the user himself.
client. highly probable that the same client when requesting the contracting of the
electricity and gas supply, is contracting with both companies.

  For this reason, the so-called "dual" contract of
way that a client can obtain discounts or additional advantages for the fact of
contract both energies with two companies of the same business group, and in order to
keep updated the discounts in each of the energies (electricity and gas)
and derived information, it is necessary for both societies to know if the energy
initially contracted with the other Group company remains active in order to
maintain and correctly manage the applied discounts/benefits.

As a result of the foregoing, in the clause on data protection it is reported
that the personal data provided during the contracting process may be
processed by only one of the entities or both entities, depending on the type of
contracted energy services. Therefore, there is no inconcretion, but
the explanation of who is the specific person responsible for the treatment in each case is
contains literally in the first section of the contract, which identifies the
parties, as stated in Evidence 6 provided in the response to the Request
of Information made to this company during the processing of the aforementioned
informative file of which the present sanctioning file brings cause: "The
customer contracts, for the indicated supply, the supply of gas with EDP
Comercializadora, S.A.U. and the supply of electricity and/or services
with EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., (hereinafter joint and/or
individually, as applicable, referred to as “EDP”) in accordance with the Terms
Specific that are collected below and to the General Conditions in annex.”

 Therefore, customers know which company will process their data based on the
requested supply (electricity or gas), something that we understand is perfectly
clear and is derived both from the explanations of the sales agents, and from the tenor
literal of the first clause of the contract. In case of being both services, the data
will be treated by both entities.

To date, neither in the field of data protection, nor in relation to any of the
the regulations applicable to the regulated sectors of electricity or gas, or the
referred to the defense of consumers there has been no request for
additional information, claim, or complaint in this regard, nor by the users themselves.
consumers, nor by the multiple regulators that control and
they control the activity of the trading companies, so it seems evident
that the information provided does not create problems for customers or other regulators
of the country, rather than the AEPD itself.

Additionally, we reiterate two essential aspects in the sector's own operations
in which EDP ENERGÍA develops its activity, whose exhibition was contemplated in the
information previously sent: 1) The existence of two companies within
of the Group with the role of marketing entities is due to a question
merely formal, as a result of the corporate structure and shareholding composition
of the companies acquired by the EDP Group at the time of its establishment
in Spain, but which does not correspond to the operational functioning of said
trading companies, since only one of them, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, has
currently with employees and management and operational capacity. In this way, in
In practice, all processing is carried out by said entity, either as
Responsible for the treatment or as in charge of the treatment of EDP ENERGÍA.
 
2) The EDP Group planned the corporate reorganization of EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA and EDP ENERGÍA and the adaptation of their corporate structure
with that of its actual operation and its business operations. This reorganization is
has currently been affected by a sale process to TOTAL in which both
companies are immersed, and that, if materialized, could alter or terminate said
integration.

For all of the above, it understands that transparency is perfectly justified in
in relation to how the information is provided, as well as the fact that it is
perfectly understandable for the average customer.
 
The AEPD continues its analysis referring to the purposes and legitimizing bases of the
treatment. In the first place, reference is made to those treatments reported
whose legal basis is the contract itself -existing contractual relationship- or the
legitimate interest of the company.

On this particular, it is pointed out that "It is not easy for anyone, without
knowledge of the matter of data protection, differentiate what treatments
derive from the contract and which are based on the legitimate interest of the controller”.
This appreciation is debatable, since for any person it can be evident
that treatments such as “managing, maintaining, developing, fulfilling and controlling the
contracting of electricity and/or gas supply and/or complementary services of and/or
gas and/or complementary review services and/or technical assistance and/or program of
points, and/or improvement of the service” are closely related to the execution of the
contract, the others being assignable to legitimate interest. In this regard, we can
compare this information with that provided by the AEPD itself regarding its
treatments when these have diverse bases of legitimacy, as is the case of
called "HR Management", published on its website (***URL.4), in whose information

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

46/136

It can be seen that various bases of legitimation are identified, without indicating to what
specific purpose refers to each of them.

Therefore, although there is nothing to object to in this part about the fact that the AEPD's criteria
can be a good practice in terms of the level of transparency, it seems
to consider the fact of not having reached this level of management of the
information, cannot be considered a breach of the norm, especially if
We take into account that not even the body that issues the guides of
transparency (and who is now proposing a sanction of nothing more and nothing less
than a million euros for this reason), has considered such a distinction necessary in its
website, as has been duly evidenced.

As regards the alleged omission by EDP ENERGÍA to report
“what is the legitimate interest that the person in charge attributes to himself”, it should be noted that the
They are clearly exposed and placed in relation to the purposes that are
they pursue, that is: fraud prevention and marketing, in relation to the sending of
personalized commercial communications. In these cases it is obvious that there is a
identification between the informed purpose and the interest pursued, so that
making a separate allusion to the latter would be redundant.

Similarly, for illustrative purposes, it should be noted that the direct competitors of
EDP ENERGÍA use informative formulas similar to those implemented in my
represented, without proceedings against them to date.

On the other hand, the high number of requests for rights received in the channels
willing to do so demonstrate that customers fully understand the content
of the information and the rights that assist them, and they are perfectly clear about what
is what they want to achieve with their request and EDP ENERGÍA executes said
requests in all cases, always with a marked character of compliance with the
regulations and protection of the fundamental rights of users.

With regard to the need to report on the weighting carried out to
assess whether the legitimate interest is preponderant in this case, it is relevant to mean that
These two assumptions have been addressed by the legislator himself, who in the
Recital 47 of the RGPD expressly refers to the possibility of carrying out these
processing based on the legitimate interest of the data controller.

Specifically, it is provided that: “the processing of personal data
strictly necessary for the prevention of fraud also constitutes an interest
of the data controller in question. Data processing
personal information for direct marketing purposes may be considered made by
legitimate interest”.

 The AEPD itself has also ruled on the latter in its report 195/2017
indicating that “if the data came solely from the information that
provided by the entity in relation to the products or services contracted by the
client, without it being completed with that originating from other different sources,
certainly the conduct of the entity, consisting of carrying out a profiling
for the referral of offers of products or services to its clients, it would turn out to be
less invasive of the rights and interests of the clients, being able in this case

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

47/136

consider the applicability of the provisions of article 6.1 f) of the Regulation
general data protection.

Therefore, in both cases the weighting of the legitimate interest has already been
carried out, both by the legislator and by the Control Authority and, therefore, the
reason given by the WG29 to recommend its publication so that those affected
can file a claim with said authority when they “doubt whether the
weighing examination has been carried out fairly” would be meaningless in this
case, having to present said claim before the Court of Justice itself.
Justice of the European Union, in order to examine the legality of the provision
introduced in the RGPD, or where appropriate, before the control authority itself and/or
competent national courts. In any case, GT29 itself identifies this
possibility as a good practice and, as stated in the report itself, its
objective is to “indicate the approach that, in the opinion of the WG29, those responsible for
treatment must assume in terms of acting with transparency”. It is not about,
therefore, of a legal obligation whose defective fulfillment may entail
a sanction, as is the case with many other issues that the AEPD is
trying to sanction in this procedure, lacking the slightest principles of
characterization, guilt and evidence, these facts that do not cease to surprise us in what
that we understand that it is an action that should be subject to compliance
full and rigorous by the sanctioning Administration.

The AEPD continues its analysis, stating that the treatments for which it is requested
consent, considering that it is not easy to understand for a person
without specialized knowledge. However, he offers no explanation for
reach that conclusion (beyond a vague reference to point four).
  Contrary to the criteria of the AEPD, we understand that the information is given in a
simple language, understandable for anyone. The information contained in
This second layer must be related to the requested consents.

The first consent says: “I consent to the processing of my personal data once
Once the contractual relationship has ended, to carry out communications
commercials adapted to my profile of products and services related to the supply and
energy consumption. Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the
validity and after the end of the contract, on non-energy products and services,
both of the companies of the EDP Group and of third parties.”

In the second layer this information is expanded indicating which are the sectors to
those belonging to the third parties about which communications can be sent "(I) The
promotion of financial services, payment protection services, automotive or
related and electronic, own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or participation in
promotional contests, as well as for the presentation of commercial proposals
linked to the energy sector after the end of the contract.”
  As can be seen, not a single technical term is used that makes it difficult to
understanding of these texts, and the conditions of consent are fully
clear.

The second consent requested says: “I consent to the processing of my data
personal for the elaboration of my commercial profile with information coming from
third-party databases, for the adoption, by EDP, of decisions

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

48/136

automated in order to send personalized commercial proposals, as well as
to allow, or not, the contracting of certain services.”

 The second layer details the content of this consent, indicating: (II) the
possibility of processing personal data of third parties to be added to your profile (III) the
contractual information used by EDP ENERGÍA in preparing the profile (IV)
the details of the purposes of the aggregation of this information.

 Finally, information is given on the rights that attend the interested parties in the case of
that automated decision-making occurs in these processes. Therefore, the
The clear objective of EDP ENERGÍA is to allow those interested to have a knowledge
detailed description of the uses for which consent is requested in the absence of will or
any fraud to hide the information. Likewise, the AEPD points out that there is a
lack of clarity in the information provided regarding the aggregation of
information from third parties, as it is not distinguished if it is referred to the purpose related to the point
(II) (the possibility of processing personal data of third parties to be added to your
profile) or (III) (the contractual information used by EDP ENERGÍA in the
profiling). In this respect, it seems obvious that the word aggregation is
concise enough, and refers to the sum of both information. The word
to add is commonly used on a day-to-day basis and, according to the RAE, means: "to join or
bring some people or things together”. In this case, it is clear from the context
that it would be a matter of uniting the data that EDP ENERGÍA already has, with which it could
obtain from third parties.

Beyond this, it is unknown what is the specific information whose understanding
it can be complex, since no clarification is provided in this regard. EDP
ENERGÍA has tried at all times to use clear and understandable language and
there are no technicalities that can complicate the reading of the text, something that seems to
now the AEPD considers a negative action that penalizes the good faith of EDP
ENERGY in relation to compliance with regulations.
 
Finally, the AEPD refers to the information related to the exercise of rights,
regarding which, as in the previous cases, it does not seem to be enough
for the AEPD the information provided in this regard. Thus, under the heading “Rights
of the owner of the data” EDP ENERGÍA informs that: “The client will have in all
moment with the possibility of exercising freely and completely free of charge the
following rights: i) Access your personal data that is processed by
EDP. ii) Rectify your personal data that is processed by EDP that
are inaccurate or incomplete. iii) Delete your personal data that is processed
by EDP. iv) Limit the processing by EDP of all or part of your data
personal. v) Oppose certain treatments and decision-making
automated processing of your personal data, requiring human intervention in the
process, as well as to challenge the decisions that are finally adopted by virtue of
of the processing of your data. vi) Carry your personal data in a format
interoperable and self-sufficient. vii) Withdraw at any time, the consents
previously granted.

  In accordance with current regulations, the user can exercise their rights
requesting it in writing, and together with a copy of a reliable document of accreditation

of identity, at the following postal address: Plaza del Fresno, 2 33007 Oviedo or at
the email ***EMAIL.2.

  Likewise, you can contact the data protection delegate of
EDP, at the following postal address: Plaza del Fresno, 2 33007 Oviedo or by mail
email ***EMAIL.1, in the event that you understand that any of your rights has been violated
related to data protection, or where appropriate, file a claim
before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection at the address Calle de Jorge Juan,
6, 28001 Madrid.”

The AEPD considers insufficient the mention made by EDP ENERGÍA regarding the
possibility of objecting to “certain treatments” without specifying one by one what
treatments we are referring to, to the extent that the AEPD states that
"It must be clear to the interested party what are the treatments that can be
object of opposition”.
This party does not share this appreciation, since this supposed obligation that the
AEPD highlights and seems to impose on EDP ENERGÍA is not required by the RGPD, nor
has no legal backing, which, as this Agency knows, is a condition
“sine qua non” to be able to sanction-

Moreover, and for greater abundance, this part would like to once again highlight
that the formula used by EDP ENERGÍA is precisely the one recommended by the
AEPD itself in its multiple guides and tools related to the duty of information
in accordance with the RGPD, and even on the AEPD website itself, something that, again, does not
ceases to surprise this party, since that Agency considers an infringement of the
RGPD, proposing for said infringement a penalty of one million euros, for a
alleged non-compliance in relation to a certain practice that she herself
recommended to do. In this line, it is worth noting

1) The Guide for compliance with the duty to inform, in which the

following example

3)

2) 2) The FACILITA Tool, of the AEPD, intended for entities to carry out
the adequacy according to the RGPD, including the informative clauses
in accordance with the applicable regulations (fictitious data has been included):
Report on privacy policies on the internet. Adaptation to the RGPD, where
the AEPD itself presents as a valid example to adapt the policy of
GDPR privacy.

4) Privacy policy of the AEPD, does not collect the alleged information either
which is now required from EDP ENERGÍA, and includes formulas such as “when
proceed"

Consequently, EDP ENERGÍA cannot be criticized for not including a
information that is not even indicated as a good practice in the guides
elaborated for the adequate fulfillment of their obligations by the
responsible for the treatment, and that neither the AEPD itself complies with its Privacy Policy
Privacy and other informative clauses used on its website.

Neither does the reference to “It is imprecise to point out that the
The interested party can oppose the adoption of automated decisions of their data
personal”. It is obvious that the information provided using the word "oppose" is
understood as a right both when the treatment is legitimized in an interest

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

50/136

legitimate as in a consent (in any case the possibility of
object at any time to the consents granted). The proof is that,
When exercising their rights, the interested parties rarely use any of these
terms and are limited to requesting the "unsubscribe" or directly requesting that they stop using their
data for certain purposes, without using formalisms as has been
evidenced in this procedure through the contribution of innumerable examples.

Additionally, it is in this party's interest to show once again that the AEPD
has had the opportunity to analyze both the general contracting conditions,
as the information provided in the different contracting processes of which
EDP ENERGÍA has available during the different information requirements and in its
case sanctioning procedures that the AEPD has initiated up to now, without
so far, the AEPD has ruled on possible breaches
of the duty of transparency, having proceeded to file multiple files
in which this documentation was reviewed by the AEPD.

Therefore, having brought this information to the knowledge of the AEPD and
having been analyzed by it, without having ruled against the
same, EDP ENERGÍA continued to make use of these documents and procedures
in the legitimate expectation that this was adjusted to the normative requirements, in the
to the extent that the AEPD, having access to and first-hand knowledge of these
alleged breaches, did not at any time indicate to EDP ENERGÍA that
there was any irregularity, now proposing a penalty of one million euros
for an alleged breach, of which he would have been aware years ago, but
that it no longer considered not sanctioning but not even warning EDP ENERGÍA. In this
sense, it should be noted that the purpose of this control authority is none other than
guarantee compliance with the regulations, so that in the absence of justification
law that motivates the opening of a Sanctioning Procedure on certain aspects
that were previously known and even subject to an archive, cannot have
no room later for the imposition of a sanction of the amount that is exposed.
In conclusion of all the foregoing, it cannot be interpreted that EDP ENERGÍA
fails to comply with its duties set forth in article 13 of the RGPD.

Makes a series of comments on the evaluative criteria related to the
AEPD in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, considering that
concur in the present case.

 FIFTH.- ABOUT THE AGREEMENT TO START THE SANCTION PROCEEDINGS AND THE
ASSESSMENT OF THE POSSIBLE PENALTY. LEGAL BASIS AND
PROPORTIONALITY OF THIS.

A. BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDICTION OF ARBITRATION.
In relation to this principle we must attend to two specific questions:
 1) The recommendations and publications of the AEPD,
  2) The amounts of the sanctions that have taken place in previous cases
Similar.
In the first place, certain practices recommended and even applied by the AEPD
regarding the collection of consent and the information to be provided to the
interested parties, have served in this case to argue and motivate the alleged
infractions committed by EDP ENERGÍA.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

51/136

  These criteria are expressed both in the form of jointly compiling the
purposes whose legitimating basis is the consent of the user, as collected
in the Second Allegation, as well as in the presentation of the information related to the
exercise of rights of the interested parties collected in the Fourth Allegation. These
aspects, which a priori the AEPD recommends and puts into practice, considering them
examples that are adapted to the applicable regulations, are used as elements
offenders to justify the alleged breach of different legal precepts by
EDP ENERGY.

All of this, and said in strict terms of defence, not only implies that the AEPD
considers insufficient what the Authority itself has incorporated in its clauses
informative, resulting therefore, said insufficient information in accordance with the RGPD,
but the fact of modifying the criterion adopted invalidating aspects without
motivation, nor any justification, implies a clear situation of legal insecurity,
contrary to the constitutional principle of interdiction of arbitrariness contained in the
article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution; principle that implies that the authorities do not
can make arbitrary decisions, understanding by such, those that suppose a
infringement of the principle of equal treatment of the administered before the application of
the law and objectively determined rules.

Secondly, the amounts of the previous sanctions in cases of fact
similar are not comparable, to the proposals in this case.

  Specifically, we must bring up the Penalty Procedure
PS/00097/2019, in which, after having analyzed the contracting system and the
information provided to each of the intervening parties, both the representative,
as well as the represented, the file of the file is dictated, validating therefore all the
documents that accompanied the procedure, that is, the documentation linked
to the hiring process.

Likewise, it should be noted that, last March 2019, EDP ENERGÍA, also
received file of actions of the information request E/04707/2018,
initiated after a complaint filed by Mr. B.B.B.. In this case, the AEPD resolves
that it is not appropriate to process the claim received, considering, therefore, the
contracting procedure and documentation provided, in accordance with the law.

As in the first section of this point, the proposed sanctions, carried out
without motivation or due justification, they go against legal certainty, a principle
Constitution contained in article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution, as well as against
the principle of legal foundation. In other words, every decision made by
the AEPD must be objective, well-founded and typified.

 In this sense, it is worth mentioning the Judgment of the Supreme Court of the 3rd Chamber
Contentious-administrative, Section 3, Judgment of May 13. 2015, Rec.
28/2013, in which the interested party appeals, stating, among other things,
allegations the infringement of the principles of interdiction of arbitrariness, security
legal and equality established in articles 9.3 and 14 CE, under article
88.1.d) LJCA and the Court upholds said motivation. From this resolution it is worth noting
the next:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

52/136

  “c) The constitutional requirement of the motivation of the sentences, included in the
article 120.3, in relation to 24.1, of the Constitution, appears justified, without further
to underline the ends to which it tends to achieve, which, above all, it aspires to do
patents the submission of the Judge or Court to the rule of law and contributes to achieving the
conviction of the parties in the process about the fairness and correctness of a decision
court, facilitating the control of the sentence by the Superior Courts, and operates
as a guarantee or preventive element against arbitrariness.
d) The breadth of the motivation of the judgments has been nuanced by the doctrine of
Constitutional Court, indicating that it does not authorize to demand judicial reasoning
exhaustive and detailed of all the aspects and perspectives that the parties
may have of the matter to be decided, but must be considered sufficiently
motivated those judicial resolutions that are supported by reasons that
allow us to know what have been the essential legal criteria underlying
of the decision, that is, the "ratio decidendi" that has determined that (judgments of the
Constitutional Court 14/1991, 28/1994, 145/1995 and 32/1996, among many others). So
The Constitutional Court itself has recognized this when it refers to the fact that it is not
an exhaustive or exhaustive examination of the arguments of the parties is necessary, and
when it even allows the argumentation by references to reports or other
resolutions. The Judgment of the Constitutional Court No. 122/94 of April 25, affirms
that this right to motivation is satisfied when the judicial resolution
explicit or implicit contains reasons or elements of judgment that allow knowing the
criteria underlying the decision.

As a result of the above, it should be noted that the AEPD identifies as an example of a sanction, the
Sanctioning Procedure with file number PS/0025/2019, since
involves a procedure of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. found in
contentious route and therefore, it does not become firm. For all these reasons, it cannot be considered a
file that affects the diligence operated by EDP ENERGÍA, nor can it be
considered as a precedent, since said sanction is not yet final.

Likewise, with respect to the rest of the files brought up in the Agreement
of Start of Sanctioning Procedure, PS/00101/2018, PS/00363/2018 or
PS/00109/2019. In Ref.: PS/00236/2020 EDP ENERGÍA Penalty Procedure
54 regarding the first file, the same despite having been paid soon
payment, in no case EDP ENERGÍA accepted the facts and the infraction that had
been charged, having debated the interpretation of the AEPD throughout the
Sanctioning Procedure, which is why such payment could not be interpreted as
trespassing In the case of file PS/00363/2018, as in the previous one, in
each of EDP ENERGÍA's responses, defends both the legitimacy of the
treatment, such as the contracting procedure, a procedure that the AEPD does not
had never described as not very transparent, insufficient and imprecise,
characteristics considered by the AEPD that occur in this proceeding
taking into account that the same information has been used in each of the
files

B. LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY.

 At this point, it should be remembered that the principle of proportionality is a principle
General of Law. Reason why the AEPD must take this principle into account
both when determining the evaluative criteria, and when determining the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

53/136

applicable sanction, a principle that, as can be seen from the procedure, from the beginning
of the investigation and said to be in the strictest sense of defense, has not been
applied by the AEPD in the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure.

In short, analyzing each of the alleged infractions that are imputed to my
represented, one can only interpret that there is an absolute disproportionality in
the interpretation made by the AEPD in this Start Agreement
Sanctioning Procedure, not only because it lacks motivation when it comes to
consider the alleged infraction to have been committed, but by the fact that the sanctions
Proposals escape any criteria previously assessed by the company itself.
AEPD.

And for this reason, at least the correction by the AEPD corresponds, in the event of
not considering the due annulment and filing of the proceedings, assuming therefore
a substantial reduction of each potential infraction to its minimum degree, reaching
even to the warning, because there is no non-compliance, lack of motivation and
disproportionality.

C. DUPLICITY OF SANCTIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE "NE BIS IN" PRINCIPLE
IDEM"

From the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure an aspect is derived that has
been pointed out at various points in these allegations to the same, and
whose relevance cannot be ignored. Thus, the infractions that are indicated are
repetitions of the same facts, whose estimation would cause a notorious
duplicity in the sanctions imposed, either because they address circumstances
previously examined by the AEPD or because it estimates the concurrence
multiple offenses on the same fact.

In the first place, this Agency has pointed out the concurrence of a
infringement derived from the provisions of article 25 RGPD when estimating that they have not been
carried out the appropriate actions, referring to the adequacy of the
procedures that are implemented for contracting by third parties. Without prejudice to
the arguments that have been stated in the corresponding First allegation,
which we refer to for brevity, it is relevant to highlight that the appreciation of the
Commission of infringement derives from events that, prior to it,
have been previously analyzed by the AEPD. This has meant that, taking into account the
casuistry concurrent in it, he was sanctioned in a proceeding that,
the date, is appealed.

From the foregoing it should necessarily follow that the imposition of the
infraction brings cause of the production of new facts that motivate the imposition of
the proposed sanctions. Well, this is not the casuistry that concerns us either,
there have been no new claims or circumstances that have led to the AEPD
to this Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure. Certainly the
imposition of the proposed sanction would mean that, faced with an act that has been
evaluated and solved or punished by the corresponding authority, be it again
examined from the same perspective or, on the contrary, that, in the absence of
materialization of said risk, said sanction would be imposed based on conduct

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

54/136

that could potentially give rise to a breach, but whose production is,
the date, non-existent.

Secondly, the AEPD makes use of different normative precepts to
sanction the same act, for simultaneously constituting the commission of three
infractions, although each of them is based on the breach of the
duty of information regulated in article 13 of the RGPD

In this sense, as has already been advanced in the previous allegations, although the
Agreement to Start Sanctioning Procedure part of the applicability of three
differentiated infractions, corresponding to articles 6, 13 and 22 of the RGPD,
All of them are based on poor information and ignorance of the
user of the object of the consent request. Thus, the argument that
to substantiate your consideration regarding obtaining consent
insufficient, it is stated that:
“It is considered that the consent thus given is not adjusted to the provisions of
the RGPD and in the LOPDGDD. Consent is requested with information
deficient, insofar as neither what third-party databases are going to be consulted nor what
type of data will be collected, so that the interested party is absolutely unaware
which is what you are consenting to. Nor is it determined who will be responsible
treatment, a generic reference to EDP is made, without the client who has
contracted a service with only one of the two entities (EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U. or EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.) know if you are consenting
that such treatments are carried out by both entities or only that of which
is client. Nor is it clear what type of services will be allowed to contract or not.
Such deficiencies do not allow the interested party to know the consequences of their
decision and thus assess the convenience of giving or not consent. (Page 46
of the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure).

In the same way, regarding the alleged infringement of article 22 RGPD, regarding the
commission of automated decisions, the AEPD in its own written Agreement of
Initiation of Sanctioning Procedure, after collecting the aspects related to the
processing of data in which there are automated decisions, collects the following:

 “From all this it can be concluded that the consent given for such purposes does not
is in accordance with the provisions of article 4.7 of the RGPD insofar as it is not
duly informed in general, the requirements are not fulfilled
specific information established in article 13.2 for decisions
automated and is also not specific. The absence of such requirements determines that
the same is not valid so that the treatments based on it lack
legitimation, thus contravening the provisions of articles 6 and 22 of the RGPD.”
(Page 47 of the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure).

In light of the foregoing, each insufficiency mentioned, derives cumulatively, at the
potential breach of article 13 of the RGPD, regarding the duty of information.

For these purposes, the exposure made by the
that Agency of two infractions derived from the absence of legal basis
sufficient as it is not informed consent and, simultaneously, another infraction
due to the lack of transparency in the information provided. about that, ok

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

55/136

it is known by the AEPD that our jurisprudence has reiterated in many
occasions as a fundamental principle of law, that the same fact cannot be
sanctioned twice. The application of this non bis in idem principle supposes
a manifest impossibility to impose two or more administrative sanctions, for a
same fact, whenever a de facto identity occurs, it is attributed to a
same subject and are imposed on the basis of a common foundation in what is
refers to the protected legal asset.

 Therefore, there is no doubt that, if the assessment of the AEPD is applicable
of the commission of an infraction by EDP of the exposed facts referring to
to the aforementioned articles, it will require the necessary concurrence of applicable laws. In
In this sense, it is essential to bring up the provisions of article 29.5 of the
LRJSP, which notes that:

“When the commission of an infraction necessarily derives from the commission of another or
others, only the sanction corresponding to the most serious infraction should be imposed.
serious offense.”

Notwithstanding the scant jurisprudence derived from said precept, as a result of its
previous regulation (Royal Decree 1398/1993, of August 4, approving the
Rules of Procedure for the Sanctioning Power), our Courts
have preached that, for the assessment of the aforementioned contest, the regulations
 “(…) requires, for the application of the media contest, a necessary derivation of some
infractions with respect to the others and vice versa” (Sentence of the Supreme Court of 8
February 1999).

In application of said precept, there are favorable judgments of the Chamber of the
contentious-administrative of the National High Court that, in analysis of the matter that
concerns us, stated that:

  Accordingly, this Chamber considers that in the present case there is a
direct connection between the violation of article 6 (treatment of personal data
without the consent of the affected party) and the violation of articles 4.3
(processing of inaccurate data), both from the LOPD. Connection that stands out
due to the fact that the processing of the complainant's data without their consent,
is carried out only in the communication by letter (of the information
on the movements of the Cortefiel POS) to his old address, which is what gives
gave rise to the complaint filed by him, and that by not correcting himself (precisely because
said incorrect treatment did not have any economic or accounting reflection in said
Bank), is maintained in the different communications by letter made. That is, such
and as indicated by the plaintiff in the lawsuit, it turns out that the treatment that has
consisted, exclusively, of improperly including some data of the affected party in a
report of operations that do not refer to it, can only be produced without mediating its
consent, so the non-consensual treatment of data of article 6.1 LOPD
necessarily derives from improper or erroneous treatment of the same (Art 4.3).
For this reason, the aforementioned article 4.4 of the Regulation for the
exercise of the sanctioning power, therefore, since both infractions are equal
seriousness, it is appropriate to impose a single sanction of 60,101.21 Euros, which is considered
be in this case the one corresponding to the infringement of the principle of treatment not
consented, in which the infraction of the

principle of data quality, both from article 44.3.d) LOPD.” (Judgment of 19
November 2009, rec 338/2009)

  Based on this, even though the precepts of the
regulations preceding the RGPD and cover a differentiated scenario, there is no doubt that
that the National Court appreciated the origin of estimating the concurrence of
infringements on the basis of a medial contest between the infringements contemplated
in the data protection regulations, when necessarily the commission of a
requires the production of the other. In this regard, said Court states that,
If there is a single action from which two infractions could derive, it can only
be taken into account the most serious. As in the aforementioned case,
in which the improper obtaining of a data necessarily caused a treatment of
inaccurate data, in the case at hand, the consideration by this AEPD of
an illegitimate acquisition for not meeting the principles defined by the RGPD for
determine that the consent is informed and unequivocal, must be subsumed
in the pertinent assessment of the duty to inform, not fitting in any way the double
valuation indicated in the sanction proposal.

Therefore, as stated by the AEPD in this procedure, it is not possible

sanctions proposed in the Sanctioning Procedure Agreement.

D. LACK OF CONFIRMABLE EVIDENCE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE INFRINGEMENT
AND CORRESPONDING IMPOSITION OF THE PENALTY.

It is necessary to bring up the inquisitorial principle or the ruling officiality in the
administrative procedure, which implies that it is the administrative authority
obliged to proceed with the verification of the alleged facts through the practice ex
office of the relevant evidence, thus prevailing the principle of material truth. So
Therefore, in the administrative procedure it is an essential requirement that all
statements made are submitted to the confrontation with the facts, falling
on the competent authority the accreditation of the same, in order to guarantee the
legal certainty required for the sole purpose of complying with the purposes of the
Public administration.

 Likewise, it is pertinent to point out the provisions of article 53 of Law 39/2015 of 1
of October, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations,
regarding the presumption of innocence and the non-existence of responsibility while
unless the contrary is proven.

  Furthermore, reference should be made to the Judgment of the Court
Constitutional Law 76/1990, of April 26, 1990, Rec/695/1985, which delimits the scope
and respect for the presumption of innocence in the sanctioning procedure and that indicates
the next:

 "Indeed, there can be no doubt that the presumption of innocence governs without
exceptions in the sanctioning system and must be respected in the imposition
of any sanctions, whether criminal, administrative in general or tax

28001 – Madrid

57/136

in particular, since the exercise of ius puniendi in its various manifestations is
conditioned by art. 24.2 EC to test set and procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended. In this sense, the
right to the presumption of innocence entails: that the sanction be based on acts or
evidence of charge or incriminating of the reproached conduct; that the load
of the evidence corresponds to the person who accuses, without anyone being obliged to prove their
own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of the tests,
practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, must be translated into a
acquittal statement.

 Likewise, we cannot affirm that the evidentiary activity carried out by the
Administration can be considered a charge, and, in the event that this body
consider it so, (STS of December 18, 2000- RJ 2000/92) it has been
fully distorted by the statements made by this party, as well as
as well as through the documents attached to this lawsuit.

In the same way, the jurisprudential line followed by
Constitutional Court in its judgment of February 20, 1989, in relation to the
principles and guarantees of the criminal judicial procedure applicable to the procedure
administrative sanction and, which indicates "Our doctrine and criminal jurisprudence have
been arguing that, although both can be considered as manifestations of
a generic favor rei, there is a substantial difference between the right to presumption
of innocence, which develops its effectiveness when there is an absolute lack of evidence
or when those practiced do not meet the procedural guarantees and the principle
jurisprudence in dubio pro reo that belongs to the moment of the valuation or
probative appreciation, and who has to judge when, that activity concurs
indispensable evidence, there is a rational doubt about the real concurrence of
objective and subjective elements that make up the criminal type in question"

Regarding such criteria, the Spanish Agency has ruled, agreeing on the
file of actions (E/04684/2017) and indicating literally the following:

“(…) For this reason, it is necessary to review in relation to the principle of presumption of
innocence that, to the Sanctioning Administrative Law, due to its specialty, are of
application, with some qualification, but without exception, the inspiring principles of the
criminal order, being clear the full potentiality of this principle of presumption of
innocence. In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in Judgment 76/1990, considers
that the right to the presumption of innocence entails "that the sanction be based on
acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the reproached conduct; that
the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without anyone being obliged to prove
his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of the tests
practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, must be translated into a
acquittal pronouncement. According to this approach, it is necessary to
account that they can only be sanctioned for acts constituting an infraction
administrative the natural and legal persons who are responsible for the
themselves by way of intent or fault" (...) In short, the application of the principle of
presumption of innocence prevents imputing an administrative infraction when it is not

facts giving rise to this charge. (…)

Finally, review the Judgment dated May 25, 2001, issued on appeal
administrative litigation by this National High Court, number 29/2000,
pronounces regarding the imposition of a sanction based on a presumption
carried out by the Agency, and rules that "(...) the Chamber, as we go on to
reasoning, from the assessment of the evidence contained in the administrative file, arrives at
the conclusion that this integrative fact of the
type, that is to say, it is not proven that the Bank gave Mr.... the respective extract,
raising this concrete fact serious doubts, compared to the required certainty. Y
concludes by stating that without denying that the events could have occurred as indicated by the
complainant, the possibility that the extract was not
delivered to the husband by the Bank, but rather that he obtained it by taking advantage of some
visit to the home or through the action of a family member, said in terms of
pure hypothesis.

  In this same sense, the High Court of Justice of Madrid ruled in
Judgment of 02/21/2001, in which it states that “The only evidence against which the
APD infers the responsibility of the appellant, it is the fact that he was the ex-husband
of Ms... who provided the lawyer with said extract that was contributed to the incident
of modification of measures, and it must be agreed with the appellant that the possession of the
extract, in the opinion of this Chamber, is insufficient circumstantial evidence to destroy its
presumption of innocence since, certainly, said extract could reach the possession of
D... through channels other than direct delivery by the bank, by
Therefore, none of these hypotheses being proven, this reasonable doubt
about how the ex-husband obtained the account statement from the
complainant must always operate for the benefit of the sanctioned party, proceeding, in
Consequently, uphold his claim for annulment of the sanction imposed for lack of
enough proof of the participation of the appellant in the delivery of the bank statement
to a person other than the owner of the account.

 In short, appreciating the various criteria that the body has taken into account
competent in matters of data protection when carrying out the file of
actions in those cases in which it is considered that there is a lack of evidence
and in which, the outlined jurisprudential lines have been followed, this part
considers that the legal guarantees that every procedure must
respect.

E. LACK OF LEGAL BASIS

 As we have stated throughout this document, the alleged infringements
committed by my client, have not taken place, so it has not materialized,
nor is there any possibility that EDP ENERGÍA has infringed the aforementioned
articles following what is alleged by the AEPD in the Agreement to Start the Procedure

It should be noted that all sanctioning procedures and, where appropriate, the sanction
resulting, must be motivated, substantiated, and even more decisive, must meet
with the due principle of legality, typicity. As a result of this aspect it is brought to collation

RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) and classified as serious for the purposes of
prescription in article 73.d) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine amounting to
500,000 euros (five hundred thousand euros).

SECOND: That the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
sanctions the entity EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., for an infringement of article 13 RGPD,
typified in article 83.5.b) and qualified as minor for prescription purposes in the
article 74.a) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine amounting to 1,000,000 euros (a
million euros).

THIRD: That, due to lack of evidence, in application of the principle of presumption of
innocence, is declared not attributable to EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., the violation of the
established in articles 6 and 22 of the RGPD.

that it is requested that the file of the sanctioning procedure be agreed or,

requests in the considerations that are summarized below:

FIRST.- ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 25 OF THE RGPD:

(Yo)

The contracting process through a representative is in accordance with the
normative:

The arguments exposed in the allegations to the proposal of
resolution, related to the freedom of form of the mandate contract in accordance with the
provided for in the civil code, in particular it insists that "In this case, it does not seem
that such a wide freedom of form is compatible with obtaining evidence of
the existence of the representation or the mandate, beyond the manifestations of the
agent, protected by contractual good faith. Also, it is little
It is understandable that a separate consent is required for the treatment of
your data or a confirmation of the order by the principal, since this
would imply distorting the representation, since it would be absurd that whoever is
appointed to enter into a contract in favor of a third party cannot provide
the data of the person on whose behalf it acts, or that confirmation is necessary
separate from it to authorize said communication, since the need to
addressing the principal directly would make the intervention of the representative useless,
because it would be meaningless. (the underlining is from the entity that formulates
the allegations)

Likewise, and in relation to the possibility that the principal may provide
additional consents to the contract itself, it should be noted that this
possibility may well have been authorized by the principal in a
specific, but by governing the same freedom of form for the granting of this
authority (which the rule does not oblige in any case to have in writing), nor is it
Reliable accreditation is required at the time of contracting.

Certainly, article 1725 of the Civil Code provides that the third party may request the
agent who informs him of his powers to determine if the hiring
is within the perimeter of the same or if you are assuming the risk that the
principal does not subsequently ratify the agent's action. But this regulation
translates into a burden for the president, not for the third party, since the interests
that it is about safeguarding are those of the latter, and not those of the president nor

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

64/136

of the principal. Therefore, it is optional for the third party to ask the agent to
give knowledge of the powers with which it claims to act.

In the vision handled by the AEPD in the Resolution Proposal, this obligation
would be aimed, however, not at protecting the interest of the third party regarding the
object of the contract made by the agent, but to preserve the interest of the
principal in relation to the legitimacy of the president to express the will of the
principal regarding the processing of your personal data by the third party.
However, this consequence cannot be extracted from the regulation of the Civil Code
regarding the mandate contract, in which –as we have just seen– the interest
protect with the exhibition of powers of the representative is strictly that of the third party, and
not that of the principal, which, in the scheme of the Civil Code, is safeguarded
through the power of ratification, whose granting or not is always in the hands of
of the principal.

Therefore, the risks referred to in the Motion for a Resolution (“they can be
generate various risks, being able to mention, by way of example, the one consisting of
a treatment of data of the represented without legitimacy, the risk of impersonation of
identity or economic or other damages that may be caused to the
interested party”) are not such: in the event that the agent has overstepped the
exercise of the mandate, the principal will not be bound by that action, except
his subsequent ratification, from which no harm can really be suffered unless
who accepts – expressly or tacitly – what was done by the president a posteriori

From here, and as optional power of the third party that contracts with the
agent, if and how the third party exercises that power depends on his will and the
hiring circumstances. In this sense, the fact that in contracting in
the channel of own commercial offices EDP ENERGÍA requires the representative a
accreditation of his condition as such, proves absolutely nothing, unlike what
What does the Motion for a Resolution say? Given that EDP ENERGÍA, as a third party that
contracts with the authorized person, has the power to carry out or not that verification, the
who does it on some occasions and not on others, or who does not do it the same way every time.
contracting channels, is not a source of any obligation -which is not imposed or
by law or by contract – but a simple manifestation of the exercise of a permit.

At the doctrinal and jurisprudential level, the exercise of the rights of the
personality through voluntary representation, particularly when it comes to
articulate ad hoc authorization for specific acts of interference. That possibility is
should understand reinforced when the mandate for the exercise of a right of
personality is linked to the power of attorney to enter into a contract, of which said
exercise is a conditioning or complementary element. Thus, the agent or
representative of an artist mandated to celebrate on behalf of his client
a contract for the lease of services to perform in a concert hall or
record a disc, is commonly mandated to authorize the organizer of the
show or the record company for the use of the voice and image of the artist.

Similarly, those authorized to contract with EDP ENERGÍA on behalf of another
person, appear in the first place as mandated subjects for the agreement of the
supply contract, and concomitantly, because it is a factor
inherent to the contract itself, they are also to authorize the employment and

treatment of the personal data of its representatives. In this sense, it is
It is necessary to emphasize that there is no doubt that the treatment of the data of the
represented that is necessary for the execution of the contract of which the represented
becomes a party, it must be considered a fully lawful treatment in light of the
article 6.1.b) of the RGPD.

But in addition, insofar as it can be established that the president enjoys legitimacy to
make all relevant decisions within the framework of the recruitment process for the
that has been empowered, the consent that said representative gives on the
data processing of the represented party and that EDP ENERGÍA collects for one or more
specific purposes within the framework of the contracting process, allows considering

once assumed to act in such a capacity – must be able to provide the same
consents regarding personal data that the interested party himself, if he were

commercial office as if it were held by telephone.
 
 It must be concluded, contrary to what the AEPD indicates in the Resolution Proposal,

(iii)

(ii) EDP ENERGÍA has correctly assessed the real risks and implemented the
appropriate mitigating measures.

Reiterates that the risk assessments provided in this proceeding are
in accordance with the data protection regulations and the AEPD guidelines, in force in the
when the analyzes are carried out, and identify the real risks applicable to the
different hiring processes.

The AEPD, in its Resolution Proposal, alludes to hypothetical or theoretical risks
which he cites, moreover, merely by way of example and of which he does not offer greater detail or
Explanation.
 As explained in the previous point and in the Arguments to the Initiation Agreement,
these risks are non-existent or lack sufficient entity for their

consideration. Thus, it can be affirmed against the list contained in the Proposal for
Resolution–non-exhaustive since the list of the AEPD is a mere title
exemplary–, among others: (i) that there is no risk of identity theft in
so much so that there is representation and mandate, (ii) that there is no economic damage to
those interested insofar as the cost is assumed by EDP ENERGÍA in any case; or (iii) that
there is no risk of lack of legal basis insofar as EDP ENERGÍA can
assume, in accordance with the aforementioned civil legislation and in accordance with the framework
law applicable to these contracts, the existence of authorization to the agent
for data processing and (iv) that, in case of excess, the interests of the
principal are safeguarded by their right to ratify or not what has been done by the
agent outside term limits.

For this reason, EDP ENERGÍA has correctly assessed the real risks inherent
of the various contracting channels in accordance with sound legal analysis
-and supported doctrinally and jurisprudentially- of the figure of the mandate in the
Spanish legal system and has implemented the appropriate mitigating measures
in relation to such risks. The risk analysis carried out is therefore consistent
and it was carried out in accordance with the legal institute of the civil mandate and its jurisprudence.

To the extent that the consistency of the analysis carried out has been proven, the
AEPD must assess the analysis in accordance with these consolidated civil criteria or, if
On the contrary, the AEPD considers that a different legal criterion should be adopted and
Contrary to that of the civil regulations and its established jurisprudence, it must substantiate
its legal basis in some way in order to allow EDP ENERGÍA to understand it
and defense. In any case, the interpretation of the mandate by EDP ENERGÍA
in accordance with the regulations, jurisprudence and civil doctrine -including that relating to
personality rights - must be interpreted in good faith and excludes any
guilt on your part.

  (iii) Recruitment through a representative constitutes a very high proportion
minority of the total contracts made by EDP ENERGÍA

It is essential to point out that contracting through a representative constitutes
a minority of the total contracts made by EDP ENERGÍA. In
Specifically, of the total contracts that EDP ENERGÍA carried out in 2019, less than
16% corresponds to contracts through representatives of which in
less than 1.7% the representative and the principal would not have a relationship of
relationship.

Therefore, when the AEPD states that the EDP contracting procedure
ENERGÍA violates the principle of data protection by design, it does
erroneously, that is to say in strict terms of defence, as if the procedure
contracting in its entirety would violate said principle. Furthermore, at the time of
quantify the sanction, the AEPD refers to the global turnover of EDP
ENERGY to quantify it, when it should be taken into account exclusively, and in its
case, the billing data (volume) generated by the eventual breach
alleged -related exclusively to hiring by representation-.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

67/136

The fact that the volume of business taken into account
consideration by this Agency is that of the year 2018, when it should consider the
turnover for the year 2019, as this is the "previous financial year". Of
In fact, for other topics, the Agency does take into account the 2019 data (for example
for the number of clients, which is also reflected on page 35 of the Proposal) and,
however, for the issue of turnover, consider 2018, in clear detriment
of my client, since the figure for 2018 is more than double that of 2019
(in 2018 the turnover was 1,236,124,000 euros, while in 2019 it was
only 589,929,000 euros).

Bear in mind, furthermore, that, in any case, the AEPD could have invoked the
article 83.2.k) of the RGPD and article 76.2.(c) of the LOPDGDD (“the benefits
obtained as a result of the commission of the infraction”) to graduate the sanction
proposal. Therefore, in the hypothetical and possible event that it is considered infringed
Article 25 of the RGPD, the maximum volume of business obtained by EDP ENERGÍA
to take into account should be approximately 7,650,0002 euros, which is the amount
obtained “as a consequence of the [possible] infraction”, that is, in the contracting
by representation, and not in the overall contracting. In this sense, the volume of
annual business of contracting through a representative would mean 0.11%
(approximately) of the total annual turnover of the entire customer portfolio
of EDP ENERGY.

Likewise, as the AEPD is well aware, of the aforementioned eight (8) claims,
There is only one sanctioning precedent for this entity, and it must take into account
consideration that the AEPD includes in its document a procedure that has not yet
been firmly resolved (PS/00109/2019), to the extent that it is
being subject to the corresponding contentious-administrative appeal before the Chamber of
the contentious-administrative of the PS/00236/2020 Brief of allegations to the
Resolution Proposal 12/37 National High Court. It should also be mentioned that
even more so when, as EDP has repeatedly explained to the AEPD
ENERGY, in the aforementioned case there was an evident use of good faith
contract of this entity, who assumed the cost of some services that had been
enjoyed by the client, who after months of use and payment for them, claimed that they did not
I had hired them.

That the proposed sanction of the AEPD of five hundred thousand (500,000) euros has been
made in the Resolution Proposal erroneously due to attending to a factor not
provided for in the regulations (the volume of business and the status of a large company) and
take into account the volume of contracts and the global profits of EDP
ENERGY -which includes both direct contracting (majority) and contracting by
representation (minority) -, which has nothing to do with "the benefits obtained as
consequence of the commission of the infraction” to which the article expressly refers.
article 83.2.k) of the RGPD and article 76.2.(c) of the LOPDGDD. Therefore, in the form
subsidiary and in the hypothetical case that the AEPD questions the validity of the mandate
for the contracting procedures and declare the infraction committed, the
quantification of the possible sanction should be significantly corrected to have
taking into account the real volume of business generated by contracting by representation
exclusively.

 In an administrative procedure of a sanctioning nature, counting how
the AEPD with objective and sufficient quantifying criteria in relation to the volume
(marginal) that representation entails, compliance with
of the principles of proportionality of the sanction and legality and should, therefore,
have been taken into account: (i) That the part that corresponds to the procedures of
contracting by representation is a small and very limited part of the
global contracting procedure of EDP ENERGÍA, and, therefore, it must be taken into account
account the small magnitude of the contracting that has the use of this type of
hiring at EDP ENERGÍA, being a minority type of hiring. Also,
As stated in the information provided in this proceeding, there are
only eight (8) claims before the Agency during the years 2018-2019
(with respect to a total of 105,606 contracts made through
representative), which reflects the low relevance and materialization of the risks
attributed by the AEPD to the contracting process implemented by EDP ENERGÍA

Failure to comply with the principle of proportionality of the sanction proposed by the
Motion for a Resolution -based on erroneous premises-, being as it is a principle
constitutional and basic in criminal law and sanctioning administrative law,
generates a defenselessness to EDP ENERGY that must be corrected. the huge
difference between the 1,236,124,000 euros taken as a reference by this Agency, or
the 589,929,000 euros, which is the figure that the Agency should have taken into account
(because it is the business volume of the year 2019), and the 7,650,000 euros of volume of
approximate business obtained by EDP ENERGÍA in 2019 as a result
of hiring by representation should have a significant impact -reducing-
of a possible sanction with respect to the one contained in the Proposal.

Lastly, and notwithstanding the foregoing, despite the fact that EDP ENERGÍA does not consider
that their actions deserve any legal reproach, in response to the suggestions
expressed by the AEPD, EDP ENERGÍA informs the AEPD that it has proceeded to
reinforce the hiring process through an online representative with the
protocol that was already provided to the AEPD on July 16, 2020. This protocol,
that was presented to the AEPD voluntarily and before the start of this
sanctioning procedure, was intended precisely to collaborate with this
Agency to reach an agreed procedure on representation and that
satisfies the proposals that the AEPD might have. In the Allegations to the Agreement
of Start, EDP ENERGÍA also responded to the doubts raised by the AEPD in
regarding its content and implementation and confirmed that it is a procedure
with double verification by SMS and in compliance with the best standards of the
market. For these purposes, the AEPD must take into account:

(i) that EDP ENERGÍA proactively contacted in July 2020, without success, with the
AEPD to present a new protocol that proposed changes in the procedure
hiring by representation. Far from being able to be considered, as the
Resolution Proposal, negatively and against EDP ENERGÍA, that
proactivity as a sign of acknowledgment of guilt -the legality arguments have already
previously stated -, the proposal for cooperation with the AEPD should
valued as a sign of good faith and of the firm commitment of EDP ENERGÍA with the
compliance with data protection regulations and the improvement of its processes as well
as an extenuating circumstance in the graduation of the sanction (article 83.2.f) of the
GDPR);

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

69/136

(ii) that despite not obtaining a response other than the opening of this proceeding,
EDP ENERGÍA, in light of the comments of the AEPD in the Start Agreement and the
Resolution Proposal, has eliminated from its contracting procedure by
representation the possibility of requesting consents for marketing purposes
and commercial to which the AEPD refers on pages 107, 108 and 109 of the
Proposal. Attached as Documents No. 1 and No. 2 is an example of a contract and a script of
announcement for the telephone channel that evidence this elimination. As in
EDP ENERGÍA has adopted measures to adjust its procedure to the proposals
of the AEPD, this circumstance, in accordance with article 83.2.c) of the RGPD, must also
be considered as an extenuating circumstance for the graduation of an eventual
sanction, and

 (iii) that EDP ENERGÍA confirms to the AEPD that the new protocol -with the content
communicated in July 2020 - is already implemented for all channels of
recruitment, since last January. Reattached to this writing as

exclusively, the data protection information of the conditions

website and at the following address: ***URL.5; and that likewise, the conditions
general contracts continue to include the clause relating to the treatment
of personal data, so that the interested party has various means to
through which you can access information easily.

  • Secondly, it alleges that the way to provide information on the
second information layer can be diverse and, as such, has been recognized by
data protection authorities. As indicated in the Arguments to the

74/136

Start Agreement, when the hiring takes place, the conditions are sent
general terms of contracting -where the specific clause is included in terms of
Data Protection-; therefore, making this information available to
through the website should be understood as an alternative system and
complementary.

In this sense, the Transparency Guidelines expressly indicate that
“When the first contact with an interested party is through the telephone, this
information [first information layer] could be provided during the call with the
interested party and he could receive the rest of the information required under the
article 13 or 14 by a different additional means, for example, by sending you a
copy of the privacy policy by email or a link to the
online privacy statement/notice of the controller”.

In accordance with the criteria of the competent authorities, including the AEPD, EDP
ENERGÍA would not have committed an infringement of the duty of transparency, as long as
that the complete information on data protection (with the required content
by the regulations) is contained within the general contracting conditions
that are sent to the interested party after contracting. The Transparency Guidelines
further indicate that, depending on the circumstances of the collection and treatment
of the data, a data controller could be forced to use
additionally other possible ways to transmit the information to the
stakeholders applicable to the relevant settings provided that the information in the
first informational layer is transmitted in the first modality used to
communicate with the interested party. For this reason, EDP ENERGÍA complies with its
obligation of transparency when providing the information of the first information layer
by telephone and the second layer of information in writing (either a document
physical or electronic). Also, it is important to note that the most
transparent and suitable that the interested party receives information about the treatment
of your personal data is by including it together with information about the
contracting of the services, inasmuch as this is the circumstance with which
relates the treatment of your data and is, in addition, a document that the
interested party will keep during their contractual relationship with EDP ENERGÍA.

(iii)

Regarding the content of the information provided by telephone and in the
general conditions:

• Specification of the data controller:

The AEPD questions the clarity with which the interested party knows which entity acts
as data controller, however, as evidenced in the conditions
contracting conditions of EDP ENERGÍA (provided as evidence 6) of this
procedure, the client is informed about the identity of the person responsible for the
treatment through the privacy policy in relation to the conditions of
hiring:
  Privacy policy: “the data will be processed by EDP Comercializadora SAU and
EDP Energia SAU”.
Specific conditions of the contract:
“The client contracts, for the indicated supply, the supply of gas with EDP
Comercializadora, S.A.U. and the supply of electricity and/or services

75/136

with EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U., (hereinafter joint and/or
individually, as applicable, referred to as “EDP”) in accordance with the Terms
Specific that are collected below and to the General Conditions in annex”.

As explained in the allegations to the Home Agreement, information is included
on both entities insofar as, depending on the service that is requested by the
interested party (gas and/or electricity), one or another entity will be responsible for the treatment
(or both in case the interested party contracts both services). Therefore, the
interested party -who has full capacity to contract and, therefore, is
presupposes that you should be able to understand the terms and conditions that
govern such hiring, you are aware at all times that, as you hire
the gas and/or electricity supply service, your data will be processed by one or
both entities.

• Purposes and bases of legitimacy

It is alleged that neither article 13 of the RGPD nor any other legal precept requires that the
privacy policy list each purpose specifically indicating the basis of
legitimacy that results from application. Still, when it comes to treatment
Subject to consent, it is expressly indicated what they are.

  In any case, as already indicated in the Arguments to the Initiation Agreement,
in the case of the bases of legitimation of "contractual execution" and "legitimate interest",
It is evident to anyone who contracts the supply services of
EDP ENERGÍA that the treatments closely linked to the execution of the
contract such as "manage, maintain, develop, fulfill and control the
contracting of electricity and/or gas supply and/or complementary services of and/or
gas and/or complementary review services and/or technical assistance and/or program of
points, and/or improvement of the service” find their basis of legitimacy in the execution of the
contract, being the other treatments assignable to the legitimate interest (eg the
carrying out fraud prevention actions or sending communications
commercial). Legitimate interests are clearly exposed and put into
relation to the purposes pursued (that is, fraud prevention and
marketing, in relation to sending commercial communications
personalized) and given that there is an identification between the informed purpose and the
own interest pursued, making a separate allusion would be redundant.

• Profiling

It is stated in the allegations that in the Resolution Proposal, the AEPD considers
that, in relation to "profiling", it is not clear what its purpose is or
the legitimate interest underlying the treatment. In this sense, the AEPD states in
the Motion for a Resolution the following: “In this case, in the opinion of this
Agency, the information requirements described above. EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.,
it limits itself to reporting on “profiling”, but does not offer specific information
about the type of profiles that are going to be made, the specific uses to which they are going to be
allocate these profiles or the possibility that the interested party may exercise the right
of opposition in application of article 21 of the RGPD.”
However, profiling is associated with sending communications
personalized commercial: "they will be treated (...) with the purpose of (...) carrying out

energy consumption, maintenance of facilities and equipment”.

Although the wording could have included “for the shipment of” (that is, the text
outside “as well as creating profiles for sending commercial communications
based on information provided by the Client (...)”), this absence does not
It should be understood that EDP ENERGÍA infringes article 13 of the RGPD.

• Exercise of rights:

It is alleged that in the opinion of the AEPD, it should be expressly indicated which are the
treatments to which the right of opposition applies. However, as already
stated in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement, the obligation to detail the
specific treatments to which the interested party has the right to oppose not only it is not
an obligation contained in the RGPD, the LOPDGDD or any other regulation of
application, but also the AEPD in its guides and tools (among others, the Guide
for compliance with the duty to inform2 or the Facilita tool3 ) does not indicate that
the informative clauses on the right of opposition must specify the
treatments on which the right of opposition applies, not even as an example of
Good practice. In any case, EDP ENERGÍA expressly indicates that the interested party
You can oppose some voluntary treatments such as promotion,
profiling, automated decision-making and
commercial offers.

He points out that the proposed resolution indicated that: “It is imprecise to point out
that the interested party can oppose the adoption of automated decisions of their
personal information. These can only be carried out by the person in charge in the
assumptions provided for in article 22 of the RGPD, based in the present case on the
consent of the interested party, so he must be able to know that he can revoke
the consent given for the adoption of such decisions in any
time, notwithstanding that you are also informed of the rights conferred by the
article 22 to the interested parties.”
  It is alleged that the semantic and technical nuance associated with the terms "opposition" and
“revocation” in the context of the exercise of rights cannot have an impact on the
interested, because with both terms the user achieves the same objective, which is that
treatment specifically identified in the policy ceases to occur. Even more,
the term used by EDP ENERGÍA (opposition) in the context of this type of
treatments is understood in the regulations and by the market itself more broadly
-and therefore more guarantee- since it allows the user to eliminate a treatment is
based on consent, is based on legitimate interest.

• Processing based on consent:
The AEPD considers that information on processing subject to consent
it is not completely clear. However, this part cannot agree with
this interpretation for the following reasons:
 In the first place, the AEPD questions that in point (IV) it is not clear as to what
data refers to the phrase “the results obtained from the aggregation of the data
indicated” and argues the existence of confusion as to whether the aggregated data

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

77/136

are those referred to in point (II) and/or in point (III). However, as stated
in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement, from reading it is clear that "the results
obtained from the aggregation of the data indicated” refers to the data indicated
above, that is, the data referred to in point (II) and (III), since it is evident that
the use of the anaphoric term “indicated” refers to the data referred to in the points
previous.

  Secondly, the AEPD states that the difference in data processing
advertising of this point with the previous points is not obvious. However, the
difference is clear:
the advertising treatment derived from point (I) refers to offers of "services
financial, payment protection services, automotive or related and electronics,
own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or participation in contests
promotions, as well as for the presentation of commercial proposals linked
to the energy sector after the end of the contract”, that is, services offered by
EDP ENERGÍA not related to contracted services but to the sector
energy or other sectors such as finance or the automotive industry, and in addition to
generic - not personalized;
▪ point (II) refers to “personalized products and services”, that is, offers
adapted to the commercial profile of the client; Y
▪ point (IV) refers to “making personalized offers, specifically aimed at
to achieve the contracting of certain products and/or services of EDP or third parties
entities”, that is, to the realization of personalized offers with a
specifically to achieve the sale of certain products or services, being the
customization not only with respect to the client but also with respect to the concrete
service or product offered.
The AEPD's criticism of the granularity offered by EDP ENERGÍA cannot
be understood in the light of its own recommendations and those of the European Committee for
Data Protection, which ask for precisely such detail and granularity.

FOURTH.- COOPERATION AND PROACTIVE ATTITUDE OF EDP ENERGÍA.

EDP ENERGÍA is studying and analyzing the implementation of the measures
timely in order to adopt and adapt to the recommendations, better
practices and the criteria laid down by the AEPD both in this proceeding and
in their guides and publications (in addition to the improvements already implemented that have been
referenced above), in order to improve all of its data protection policies.
data, clauses and general conditions through which information about the
treatment of the personal data of its clients and potential clients

FIFTH.- BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDICTION OF THE
ARBITRARINESS.

It is pointed out that certain recommended practices (and even applied by the AEPD in
their own privacy policies) have served in this case to argue and
motivate the alleged infractions committed by EDP ENERGÍA (for example, the
presentation of the information regarding the exercise of rights of the interested parties
collected in the Second Allegation). These aspects that, a priori, the AEPD recommends
and puts them into practice, considering them examples that are in accordance with the regulations

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

78/136

applicable, are used as infringing elements to justify the alleged
breach of different legal precepts by EDP ENERGÍA.

SIXTH.- LACK OF LIABILITY IN THE ACTION OF EDP ENERGÍA.

By virtue of all of the foregoing, the actions of EDP ENERGÍA cannot
be considered guilty in the possible commission of administrative offenses in
data protection matters imputed to it. In the administrative field
sanctioning it is not enough that the conduct is typical and unlawful (which in this case,
neither is he), but it is also an inescapable requirement that he be guilty, that is,
consequence of an action or omission attributable to the person responsible for intent or negligence
inexcusable, without any sort of strict liability being admissible
exempt the Administration from fully accrediting the requirement of guilt or
intent in committing the offence. (Sentences of the Supreme Court of 9
July 1994, May 16, 1995, December 12, 1995, January 12 and 19,
1996, April 15, 1996, among many others.)

It is also worth mentioning that the appreciation of the subjective element of the
infraction is determined by the degree of foreseeability that it had for the subject
affected that their behavior could be considered typical and unlawful and, therefore,
likely to be penalized. The subjective element of guilt can only
attend when, in view of the situation existing at the time of the
conduct, the subject could reasonably anticipate that he was committing a
infraction Judgments of the Excma. Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of May 8
from 2003 — ref. Aranzadi RJ 4209—, of July 7, 2003—ref. Aranzadi RJ 5832—,
and of January 28 and 27, 2010 — ref. Aranzadi RJ 1362 and 1357.
Likewise, the doctrine of the contentious-administrative courts has excluded the
concurrence of the essential culpabilistic element when the subject who has
objectively committed the offense acted on the basis of a reasonable
interpretation of the legal system.

A reasonable interpretation of the applicable regulations, even when it is not ultimately
considered correct by the courts, excludes guilt, especially in
those cases in which the applicable legal regulations are not clear or unequivocal.

SEVENTH.- SUBSIDIARILY,
  THE PROPOSED SANCTIONS ARE
MANIFESTLY DISPROPORTIONATE AND SHOULD BE ENFORCED
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

In short, analyzing each of the alleged infractions attributed to EDP
ENERGY, one can only interpret that there is an absolute disproportionality in the
interpretation made by the AEPD in the Resolution Proposal, not only because
lacks motivation when considering the alleged infringement to have been committed, but rather
the fact that the proposed sanctions escape any criterion valued with
prior character by the AEPD itself. In this sense, it should be added that the amounts of
previous sanctions imposed in similar events are not comparable
to the proposals in this case.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

79/136

Mitigating circumstances must apply: Indeed, any sanction imposed
imposed on EDP ENERGÍA would have to be set in accordance with articles 83.2 of the
RGPD and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, which contemplate relevant instruments so that the
Administration adapts the proportionality of the sanctions. In the present case, as
as stated in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement, concur
amply the following extenuating circumstances that are summarized here:

• The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement: according to article 83.2.a) of the
RGPD, the assessment of this circumstance must take into account "the nature,
scope or purpose of treatment” (...) and “the level of damages that have
suffered”. In this sense, what is imputed to EDP ENERGÍA is the need to
improve some aspects of its data protection policies, without in any way
case the texts used so far can be understood as having generated
a high level of damages. Likewise, the treatments foreseen in these
policies - which are known to stakeholders - are not particularly
sensitive, neither by the type of data processed nor by the characteristics of the
treatment activities. Therefore, not only is it inappropriate to consider
aggravating circumstance the nature of this infraction but, the foregoing must
be considered as a mitigating circumstance applicable to this proceeding.

• The intention or negligence in the infringement: EDP ENERGÍA has not shown
intention or negligence. The AEPD, in its Resolution Proposal, indicates
that “the defects indicated in the information provided show the lack of diligence
of EDP ENERGÍA in complying with transparency obligations”. By
Therefore, what this Agency seems to be referring to is the absence of all the diligence that,
according to said Authority, it would be expected from EDP ENERGÍA. However, it does not seem that
said statement can be understood as "intention or negligence" in its
action insofar as, as has been stated in the Allegations to the Agreement of
Beginning and in these allegations, EDP ENERGÍA has carefully observed
the guides, directives and tools made available by the AEPD itself and the
European Data Protection Committee for the fulfillment of its obligations of
Data Protection. For this reason, the diligence of EDP ENERGÍA must be taken into
count as an extenuating circumstance.

 • The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal data: EDP ENERGÍA is dedicated, as stated by the AEPD in the Proposal for
Resolution, to the supply of electricity, an activity that is not intensive in the
processing of personal data and that although it is true that the development of
activity of EDP ENERGÍA involves the processing of personal data, this is of
instrumentally without its activity being based on the exploitation of personal data.
In this sense, the low link between EDP ENERGÍA's activity in the treatment
of personal data should be considered a mitigating circumstance.

 • Any measure taken to alleviate the damages: as stated
to the knowledge of the AEPD, EDP ENERGÍA is immersed in the review and
improvement of its procedures and clauses in order to adapt and implement the
recommendations made by this Agency, preventing the occurrence of
any type of damage or harm to the interested parties. Proof of this is that some of
The recommendations of this Agency are already implemented, such as the
improving access to information on data protection, which is already available

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

at the address edp-residentialbytotal.es/rgpd as well as the new protocol of
contracting through a representative, which was already provided to the procedure on
last July 16, 2020 and has already been implemented last January.

 • Degree of cooperation with the authority: EDP ENERGÍA has shown from the beginning
of this procedure a completely collaborative attitude with the AEPD, as
as has been accredited in this writing. In the Allegations to the Agreement of
Home provides more complete information regarding cooperation
displayed by EDP ENERGÍA.

 • Categories of data and impact on the rights of minors: the data subject
treatment are not special categories of data and have not been affected
rights of minors (EDP ENERGÍA customers are always older than
age with capacity to contract).

  • Ongoing nature of the infraction: as has been proven, EDP ENERGÍA,
from the moment it became aware of the improvements that, in the opinion of the
AEPD, could be adopted in its policies, has proceeded to analyze its texts and
procedures. Therefore, it cannot be understood that it is an infringement of
continuous character, although this Agency must understand that in corporate groups
complex processes of change and adaptation of procedures cannot be done
immediately. However, this does not mean that the presumed infraction imputed
should be understood as "continued".

• Status as a large company and its volume of business: the fact that EDP
ENERGY is considered a large company cannot be used as a
aggravating circumstance as it is not a circumstance foreseen neither in the RGPD nor in the
LOPDGDD. In addition, in this sense, the Supreme Court (sentence of 4 of
November 2015, appeal 100/2014) has stated in recent case law but
consolidated that "it is not feasible, in any case, to presume malicious conduct by the
mere fact of the special circumstances surrounding the passive subject of the
imposition (economic importance, type of advice received, etc.) (...). [It
that the public power cannot do, without violating the principle of culpability that
derives from art. 25 CE [see, for all, the Judgment of this Section of June 6,
2008 (cas. rec. for the unification of doctrine no. 146/2004), FD 4], is to impose a
penalty to a taxpayer (or confirm it in the administrative or judicial phase of
appeal) due to its subjective circumstances -although it is a legal person,
has great economic means, receives or can receive the most competent of the
advice and is habitually or exclusively dedicated to the activity taxed by the
breached rule”. For this reason, it is not legal or constitutional to assess the
status of a large company as an aggravating circumstance. Likewise, the AEPD also
refers to "its volume of business" (a fact that is not considered as
aggravating circumstance neither in the RGPD nor in the LOPDGDD). When quantifying the
sanction, the AEPD refers to the global turnover volume of EDP ENERGÍA for
quantify it, when it should take into account exclusively, and where appropriate, the data
of invoicing generated by the eventual alleged non-compliance -in the case of the
Article 25 of the RGPD, relating exclusively to hiring by representation.
In this sense, the AEPD, in its investigation within the framework of the procedure, requested and
obtained specific data on the volume of hiring by representation and the
tiny part that corresponds to EDP ENERGÍA's overall activity, and should

in any case, having taken it into account in the Resolution Proposal, which has not
happened. Likewise, as has been indicated in the First Allegation, the volume
of business derived from contracting with a representative represents approximately
0.11% of the global business volume. On the other hand, with regard to the
sanction associated with the alleged infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, the AEPD does not
had to take into consideration the global turnover of its activity.
Benefits obtained as a result of the infringement: the alleged commission of the
imputed infringement has not generated any type of economic benefit, direct or
indirect, to EDP ENERGÍA. In any case, if this Agency considers otherwise, the
benefit should be calculated according to the criteria that have been indicated in the
Allegation One, taking into account that the volume of business derived from the
contracting through a representative represents only 0.11% of the turnover
and that the proposed sanction supposes a disproportionate amount in relation to
profits made

. • High volume of data and processing: contrary to what this Agency indicates
in its Resolution Proposal, the presumed infractions attributed to EDP
ENERGÍA does not affect “all the data processing carried out by the entity EDP
ENERGÍA S.A.U.”, but only to customer-related processing. In fact, the
The AEPD itself acknowledges in the section on "High number of interested parties" that
"[t]he infraction affects all the entity's natural person clients", but not
indicates no other stakeholder group. Also, as regards the
contracting by third parties on behalf of its owner, it is relevant to point out that said
contracting only affects 0.11% of the business volume of EDP ENERGÍA
so it is evident that the volume of data and processing affected is minimal.
For this reason, the small number of affected treatments, and especially, in
In relation to contracting through a representative, it must be taken into account as
extenuating circumstance.

• Recent acquisition of EDP ENERGÍA: as we have indicated in the allegation
Preliminary to this writing, EDP ENERGÍA has recently been acquired by the
Total Group. By virtue of article 76.2.e) of the LOPDGDD, together with article
83.2.k) of the RGPD, this part understands that this
circumstance at the time of, where appropriate, modulating and mitigating the potential sanction -sanction
that in any case this part understands that it does not proceed. Although the mentioned
precept includes the assumptions in which the structural modification is a merger by
absorption, in application of the principle of teleological interpretation, its regulation must
extend to other structural modifications carried out after the
commission of the infraction and that result in the imposition of sanctions
disproportionate and burdensome to the new entity that did not commit the original infringement

PROVEN FACTS

1. The file shows that EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. use the following channels
to formalize the contracting of their services:

A. Telephone Channel, with partial or definitive closure of the contracting process
through a phone call. Includes the following subchannels:

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

82/136

 

- CAC Inbound: Reception of calls, from clients to EDP. In
In general, they are already EDP clients who identify themselves from the beginning of the call
through a security protocol, although they can also be received
calls from potential clients.
- Telemarketing: Issuance of calls, from EDP to databases
owned by already customers for upselling or abandonment recovery. Used
to make the call the telephone number that appears on the file
of the client, and that has been provided by said person previously.
 
- LEADS: Emission or reception of calls, about users who have
expressed an interest in any platform or web page (sweepstakes,
promotions, offer comparators, blogs, advertising agencies, etc.)
leaving their basic data to be contacted or contacting themselves at
the phone number shown to them. Normally such users still
they do not have active contracts with EDP.

a website and initiates a totally online contracting process, without interaction with
agents.
 
C. Distributors, with face-to-face or digital closure of the contracting process,
including:
 

- EDP's own Commercial Offices. Normally, EDP clients who
proactively come to the office, although they can also be clients
potentials.

make their purchases and are interested in EDP's offer.

 
D. External Sales Forces, with face-to-face closing of the contracting process,

as a pilot test, communication via SMS or e-mail to the principal (in cases of
not related to the representative to study its effectiveness and receptivity.)

B. Distributors:
 
In the case of contracts made at EDP's own Commercial Offices (in
outside stores there is no possibility of contracting in the name and representation of
a third party) the procedure is as follows:
 
1) In those cases in which the user indicates that he wishes to make a contract

completed and signed by both interested parties (representative and owner).
 
C. External Sales Forces:
 
In the case of contracts made by external sales forces (fair stands,
shopping centers and home visits, provided there is a prior request by the
of the interested party), the contract will collect the identification data of the representative,
also requesting the holder's data necessary to formalize the contract.
In the contract, it is expressly specified that the representative declares to have
of sufficient powers to sign the contract on behalf of the client to whom

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

responsible for informing of all the conditions of the same. It is required, on the other
part, of a photocopy of the NIF of the representative.
 
Next, a verification of the hiring is recorded in audio where you are
twice indicates to the representative the fact that he is acting on behalf of the
owner of the supply and the relationship-kinship that links them is confirmed.

To accredit the representation, the hiring stub is formalized where the
representative declares to have sufficient powers to sign the contract in
name of the client who is responsible for informing of all the conditions of
East. Likewise, a copy of the NIF of the representative is provided.

3. The file shows that the documentation used by EDP ENERGÍA,
S.A.U. to accredit the representation of the owner when signing a contract is the
Next:

A. Telephone Channel:
 
In the three subchannels of the telephone channel (evidence 2, 3 and 4, CAC Inbound channels,
Telemarketing and Leads respectively) the representative is requested, during the
recording of the contracting procedure, confirmation of the following aspects:
of their identity and DNI, of their performance on behalf of the owner, of the relationship with
the represented (such as husband, wife, child, proxy, representative); of identity
(name, surnames, DNI) of the represented, and telephone and email. The
supporting documentation of the representation of the holder of the contract consists of the
recordings in which the representative makes the aforementioned confirmations. In
In the case of telemarketing and LEADS channels, the representative is also sent a
sms/email with the following text “EDP Offer: Please, answer with a YES to this
SMS to accept and activate discounts.” (exhibits 10 and 12).

B. Distributors: In the case of EDP ENERGÍA's own commercial offices,
S.A.U. it is requested completed and signed by both interested parties
(representative and owner) an express authorization document containing the
data of both people and copies of their NIF.

In the channel own commercial offices (evidence 5) the representation is accredited
through a document called “representative management authorization template”,
in it the owner (identified with his name and DNI or CIF), in his own name or
representation of the company authorizes the representative equally identified with his
name and DNI to carry out different procedures (registration/deregistration, change of ownership,
change of direct debit and/or other procedures) and must be indicated in the box
adjoining each one of them which are the authorized procedures. Saying
The document requires the signature of the authorizing and the authorized. Also, this document
contains the following warning “TO BE VALID, THIS AUTHORIZATION

C. External Sales Forces: In the case of external sales forces (market stands,
fairs, shopping centers and home visits, provided there is a prior request by
part of the interested party), a document is used to accredit the representation
called sales stub (exhibit 6). In said checkbook, there are
spaces to fill in the details of the contract holder (name, surnames,
telephone and email) and data of the representative (name, NIF and address) and
include several boxes to mark that the representative is in quality of
spouse/registered partner, ascendant/ descendant or proxy) under such
boxes, a text states that “it declares that it has sufficient powers to sign
this contract on behalf of the client who is responsible for informing
all its conditions." A verification recording is made where
confirms with the representative the data of the principal, as well as the relationship or
kinship that unites them (evidence 16)

It is clear from the evidence presented that in the contracting subchannels
By telephone, the representatives are informed that “On behalf of their client, and
after passing an analysis of the risk of the operation, we will take the necessary steps
to activate the access contracts, at which time the
new contract, the previous one being terminated.”

5. It is stated that during the contracting process, in the contracting channels
consent is requested from the representative on behalf of the principal
to carry out other treatments such as sending offers related to the
energy adapted to your profile after the end of the contract or send you at any
moment information on non-energy products or services of companies or
EDP collaborators. (exhibits 2, 3 and 4).

During this process, the consent of the representative is also requested in
name of the represented to complete the commercial profile with base information
data from third parties, in order to send you personalized proposals and the
possibility of contracting or not certain services.

In the channel of external forces, the possibility of rendering such
consents. As evidence 6 shows under the heading
CUSTOMER/REPRESENTATIVE, after noting that the information regarding data protection
data can be read on the back, allows marking the following consents,
checking the box together with each of them:
 I consent to the processing of my personal data once the relationship has ended
contractual, for the realization of commercial communications adapted to my profile
of products and services related to the supply and consumption of energy. Likewise,
I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the term and after the end of the
contract, on non-energy products and services, both of the companies of the Group
EDP as third parties.
  I consent to the processing of my personal data for the preparation of my profile
commercial with information from third-party databases, for the
adoption, by EDP, of automated decisions in order to send
personalized commercial proposals, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting
of certain services.

6. Evidences 2, 3 and 4 show that during the telephone contracting process
The following information is provided to the representative: “Your personal data and those of your
represented will be processed by EDP Comercializadora SAU and EDP Energía SAU to
the management of your contracts, fraud prevention, creation of profiles based on
customer and EDP information, as well as communications
personalized information about products or services directly related to their
contracts, being able to oppose them at any time".

In the telemarketing channel and evidence leads 3 and 4, the following is added “Les

rectification, opposition, deletion, limitation and portability, through any of
the ways indicated in the General Conditions that can be consulted on our website

Said information does not appear in evidence 2 corresponding to the CAC inbound channel.

In the own offices channel, the information provided is as follows (evidence 5)
“The interested parties are informed that the personal data provided in
this form will be treated as data controller by EDP ENERGÍA,
S.A.U. and EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. so that they can be used
for the processing of the authorized management.
The personal data that you provide us will be used, in the manner and with the
limitations and rights recognized by the General Data Protection Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

of access, rectification, deletion, portability, limitation and opposition to the treatment
of these data, proving their identity, by email addressed to ***EMAIL.2 or

EDP Data Protection Delegate, at the same postal address or by email
email ***EMAIL.1, in the event that you understand that any of your rights has been violated
related to data protection, or where appropriate, file a claim
before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection "
 
In the External Forces Channel, the sales stub provides the following
information. On the back of the first page there is a section entitled
“Basic information on Data Protection”: which includes the following:
  “Personal data will be processed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA,
S.A.U. and EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. (hereinafter, jointly, EDP) as

or of the member states.

Article 24.1 of the RGPD provides regarding the responsibility of the person responsible for the
treatment that “Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the

freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the
processing is in accordance with this Regulation. These measures will be reviewed and
They will update when necessary.”

In this case, it is stated that EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U is responsible for the
data processing, referred to in the factual background of this agreement of
start of the sanctioning procedure, since, according to the definition of article
4.7 of the RGPD, is the one who determines the purpose and means of the treatments carried out with

as at the time of the treatment itself, technical and organizational measures
appropriate, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively enforce the
data protection principles, such as data minimization, and integrate the
necessary guarantees in the treatment, in order to meet the requirements of this
Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.”

For these purposes, what is stated in the following recitals of the
GDPR:

74. “The responsibility of the data controller for data processing must be established.
any processing of personal data carried out by himself or on his behalf. In
In particular, the person responsible must be obliged to apply timely and effective measures and
must be able to demonstrate compliance of the processing activities with the
this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures must have
taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment as well as the
risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”

75. “The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, serious and
variable probability, may be due to the processing of data that could cause
physical, material or non-material damages, particularly in cases where
that the treatment may give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation of
identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of
confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social damage; in the
cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and freedoms or are

concerned must be determined with reference to the nature, scope, context and
the purposes of data processing. The risk must be weighted on the basis of a
objective evaluation by means of which it is determined if the treatment operations of
data poses a risk or if the risk is high.”

Therefore, the data controller must carry out an analysis of the
risks that the data processing carried out may have for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, implementing the technical and organizational measures
appropriate to apply the principles of data protection and integrate the guarantees
necessary in the treatment in order to comply with the requirements of the RGPD, and must be able to
demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned standard.

The principles of data protection are contained in article 5 of the
RGPD, the first of them related to the legality of the
treatment. In accordance with article 5.1.a of the RGPD “Personal data will be: a)
processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,
loyalty and transparency"). The second number of article 5 provides that "The
responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions of the
paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

The legality of the treatment implies that the personal data can only be
processed by the data controller when any of the bases
legitimating listed in article 6 of the RGPD.

Taking into account the documentation provided by the data controller,
It should be noted that the contracting of electricity services by EDP
ENERGY, S.A.U. can be carried out through different channels, these being the
following:

A- Telephone, which includes the following subchannels: CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and
leads.
B. Web channel.
C. Distributors, which includes EDP's own Commercial Offices and external Stores.
D. External Sales Forces, which can be: Stands at Fairs, Centers
Commercial, etc., or home visits with prior request.
 
In accordance with said documentation, the contracting of the service can be carried out
with a customer representative, except when it comes to the web channel and subchannel
outside stores where it is not allowed. The review of the procedures
contracting the service described by the person in charge and the documentation provided
show that when the contracting of the service is carried out through
representative is not required to prove the representation that he claims to hold.
This absence of accreditation has a single exception when the contracting of the
The service is carried out in the own commercial offices subchannel in which a
document accrediting the authorization granted for contracting by the
represented together with the presentation of the DNI of the latter (exhibit 5).

In this way, to the extent that a procedure has not been implemented that allows
accredit the representation of the person who contracts on behalf of a
Third, various risks can be generated, which can be mentioned, by way of
example, that consisting of data processing of the represented party without legitimacy, the
risk of identity theft or economic or other damages that may be
may cause the interested party as a result of the change of company
supplier of the service with the consequent cancellation of the contract of origin or the
change of ownership of the contract or the type of contract with the company
supplier, without the interested party having consented to such changes.

Secondly, the documentation provided shows that in the channel of
Telephone contracting (inbound CAC subchannels, Telemarketing and leads) together with the
contracting the service, consent is requested to carry out other
treatments, such as sending offers related to energy adapted to the

customer profile after the end of the contract or the referral at any time of
information on non-energy products or services from collaborating companies or
EDP. This request is made to the representative as follows from the
literalness of the text of evidences 2, 3 and 4 submitted, according to which they ask
this one: “Would you allow us to present your client with offers related to energy
adapted to your profile after the end of the contract, or send you at any time
information on non-energy products and services, Collaborating Companies or
EDP?” (exhibit 2) “Do you allow us to present your client with offers related to
with the energy after the end of the contract, or send you at any time
information on products and services of the financial, insurance and
automotive industry, Collaborating Companies or EDP?” (evidence 3). "Allows us
present you with energy-related offers tailored to your profile after the
termination of the contract, or send you at any time information about products and
non-energy services, Collaborating Companies or EDP? (evidence 4).

In none of the three cases, as can be deduced from the analysis of the
procedures followed by the person in charge in the contracting processes,
requests proof that the representative has been authorized to provide such
consent on behalf of the principal.

Nor is it proven that the representative has been authorized by his client.
to consent to the processing of data for advertising purposes that has been done above
reference, in the event that it does so, when the contracting process is carried out
carried out through the channel of commercial offices owned by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. Already
that such a possibility is not contemplated in the document presented as evidence 5, in
containing the authorizations for various treatments by the
representative, taking into account that it must, where appropriate, be a
specific mandate without it being deduced from a general authorization for other
treatments.

In the case of contracting through the external forces channel, evidence 6, to the
which the person in charge calls sales receipt, contains, in the box titled
“client/representative”, a box to consent to the processing of personal data,
in the following terms: “I consent to the processing of my personal data once
once the contractual relationship has ended, to carry out commercial communications
adapted to my profile of products and services related to the supply and consumption of
Energy. Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the term and after
the end of the contract, on non-energy products and services, both of the
EDP Group companies as well as third parties.” In said contract or sales stub,
as it has been called by the person in charge, it also appears, after the spaces
intended for the data of the representative who "declares to have legal powers
sufficient to sign this contract on behalf of the client to whom
responsible for informing of all the conditions of the same.” Neither in this
The contracting procedure requires an accreditation of the representation that is

Nor in these cases has a procedure been implemented to prove
that the representative had the authorization of the principal to consent to such

treatments, producing the risk of data treatment of the represented without
legitimation, leaving it exposed to receiving publicity even after
termination of the contractual relationship. In the case of the external sales force channel,
increases the risk, since the contract is not even sent to the principal, but
that the copy is given to the representative who is responsible for informing the
represented.
 
Thirdly, it is observed in the documentation in the present proceeding
that at the time of contracting through the telephone channel, in all
subchannels, the representative is asked for permission to “complete the commercial profile of the
represented with information from third-party databases, in order to send you
commercial proposals and the possibility of contracting or not certain services”
(evidence 2, 3 and 4). As in the previous case, it is not proven that the
representative is authorized by the principal to consent to such treatment.

The same can be said when the consent for this treatment is given by
the representative in the channel own commercial offices, since there is no record either
in the document that reflects the authorizations granted to the representative
(Exhibit 5), specific authorizations for the representative to lend his or her
consent to such processing.

In the case of the external forces channel, in the so-called sales receipt, it appears
a box to provide consent, which is formulated as follows:
“I consent to the processing of my personal data for the preparation of my profile
commercial with information from third-party databases, for the
adoption, by EDP, of automated decisions in order to send
personalized commercial proposals, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting
of certain services. Likewise, accreditation of the authorization of the
represented to give their consent to these treatments, considering that
Your statement to that effect is enough. On the other hand, as revealed
above, the risk for the principal is increased since the checkbook of
sales (exhibit 6) it follows that a copy of the document is delivered to the
representative who is responsible for informing the principal.

Nor in these cases has a procedure been implemented to prove
that the representative had the authorization of the principal to consent to such
treatments, leaving the interested party exposed to profiling with
information from third-party databases or decisions are made
automated regarding him without his consent.

In the pleadings to the agreement to initiate this proceeding, it was stated that
freedom of form in the manner established in the Civil Code for the contract of
mandate is incompatible with obtaining evidence of the existence of the
representation or mandate, beyond the statements of the president, protected
in contractual good faith. However, as this Agency has pointed out in the
proposed resolution, nothing prevents one of the parties to a contract from requiring
who acts as agent of the other party the accreditation of the representation that
claims to boast, proof of this is that EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. it requires it in its
contracting procedure in the channel own commercial offices, requiring the
representative a document accrediting the authorization granted for the

contracting by the represented party signed by both to which the
DNI of both the representative and the represented. It is now alleged by said entity
that it is not obliged to carry out with the authorized third parties that contract through the
telephone channel or external sales forces no verification of the existence
and scope of its mandate, on the basis that the possibility of verifying the
powers of the principal constitute a burden for the agent, not for the third party,
since the interests to be safeguarded, within the framework of civil law,
they are those of the latter, and not those of the president nor those of the principal. It is alleged
likewise, that in the power to contract the service through an authorized third party
resides the power to provide the consents inherent to the contracting process,
including those relating to the processing of personal data.
 
This Agency cannot share such arguments, the regulations for the protection of
personal data focuses on the protection of this right of the interested parties,
so that your data can only be processed when there is legitimacy,
without which no data processing can be carried out. In the case that we
occupies the legitimation can derive from the existence of a contract or the provision
of a consent for certain treatments, so that if the contract is
carried out by a third party on behalf of the interested party or such consents are
provided by a third party on behalf of the data subject, the data controller must
act diligently to verify that indeed whoever claims to be
authorized to act on behalf of another, indeed it is and that that
authorization reaches not only the performance of a contract, but also the provision
of consents for other different data treatments that are requested
during the hiring process. In the latter case, all the more reason
doubt the existence of such authorization by the interested party to consent
treatments on your behalf, taking into account that requests for consent
for the sending of commercial communications and the realization of profiles
made during the telephone contracting process, unexpectedly,
so that it is difficult to think that the principal has previously authorized the
representative to give such consents. Similarly, it is doubtful
that in a contracting process in the channel external forces, which must be remembered
refers to the contracting in stands of fairs or shopping centers, there is a
prior authorization to consent to treatments on behalf of the represented party, since such
request is also made during the contracting process, aggravating the
risk for the interested party insofar as the contract is not even sent to him, but rather
gives a copy to the representative who is responsible for informing the principal.

In this way, the first of the risks to assess is precisely the legitimacy for
each treatment, and in particular, and in the event that it is acted through a representative
the risks that the processing of their data has for the interested party without due
legitimacy, in the event that the representative lacks power to allow such
treatments.

to assess the need to carry out Impact Assessments, including

In this regard, it must be taken into account that the obligations established in the
Articles 24 and 25 of the RGPD do not constitute mere formal obligations, but rather
as stated in article 24 "the person in charge will apply technical and organizational measures
appropriate in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the
this Regulation.” And article 25 also reiterates that “the person responsible for
treatment will apply, both at the time of determining the means of treatment
as at the time of the treatment itself, technical and organizational measures
appropriate, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively enforce the
data protection principles, such as data minimization, and integrate the
necessary guarantees in the treatment, in order to meet the requirements of this
Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.” It is also a
dynamic obligation, each modification of the technical and organizational measures must
also be subject to a risk analysis to determine if said modification
is capable of effectively applying data protection principles and integrating
the necessary guarantees in the treatment.

On the other hand, in relation to what is stated in the allegations to the initial agreement, in

Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment based on the

will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

greatest extent possible whether, among other things, the performance of a contract,

It takes into account what is expressed in recitals 32, 40 to 44 and 47 of the RGPD in
in relation to the provisions of articles 6 and 7 above. From what is stated in

despite being appropriate in the specific case, or when the fulfillment of a

even when this is not necessary for such compliance.

It is also appropriate to take into account the provisions of article 6 of the LOPDGDD:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

106/136

“Article 6. Treatment based on the consent of the affected party
1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
consent of the affected party is understood as any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which it accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that
concern.
2. When it is intended to base the processing of the data on the consent of the
affected for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to state
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.
3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the affected party consenting to the
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship”.

In accordance with what has been expressed, data processing requires the existence of a
legal basis that legitimizes it, such as the consent of the interested party
validly.

From the analysis of the gas service contracting procedures established by
EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U, it follows that in the contracting carried out through the
telephone subchannels (CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and Leads) is requested to the
representative permission to “complete the business profile of represented with
information from third-party databases, in order to send you commercial proposals
and the possibility of contracting certain services or not” (evidence 2, 3 and 4).

Evidences 2, 3 and 4 show that the following information is provided to the contracting party
“Your personal data and those of your representative will be processed by EDP Comercializa-
dora SAU and EDP Energía SAU for the management of their contracts, fraud prevention,
profiling based on customer and EDP information, as well as the realization
creation of personalized communications about products or services directly
related to their contracts, being able at any time to oppose them.
more". Next, your consent is requested in the following terms:
"Additionally, so that at EDP we can advise you with the best proposals

data from third parties, in order to send you personalized proposals and the
possibility of contracting certain services or not? [OTHERWISE]"
With regard to the sales channel by external sales forces, in the Checkbook of
sales (Exhibit 6), the following request for consent appears along with a
box to mark the same:
“I consent to the processing of my personal data for the preparation of my profile
commercial with information from third-party databases, for the
adoption, by EDP, of automated decisions in order to send
personalized commercial proposals, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting
of certain services.
It is considered that the consent thus given is not adjusted to the provisions of the
RGPD and in the LOPDGDD. Consent is requested with poor information,
while neither what third-party databases are going to be consulted nor what type of data are indicated

107/136

are going to be collected, so that the interested party is absolutely unaware of what
is consenting. Nor is it determined who will be responsible for the
treatment, a generic reference to EDP is made, without the client who has
contracted a service with only one of the two entities (EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U. or EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.) know if you are consenting
that such treatments are carried out by both entities or only that of which
is client. Nor is it clear what type of services will be allowed to contract or not.
Such deficiencies do not allow the interested party to know the consequences of their
decision and thus assess the convenience of giving or not giving their consent.

Likewise, a single consent is requested for two different purposes, although
both are automated, one of them is the sending of personalized advertising and, the
another, to give permission so that the person in charge determines whether or not to allow him to contract
certain services, so it cannot be considered that such consent is
specific in the terms of articles 4.11 and 6.1.a) of the RGPD and 6.1 of the
LOPDGDD.

Regarding the automated decision regarding "allow or not the hiring of a
service” must also take into account the provisions of article 22 of the RGPD
according to which:
"1. Every interested party shall have the right not to be the subject of a decision based on
solely in automated processing, including profiling, which
produce legal effects on him or significantly affect him in a similar way.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:
a) is necessary for the conclusion or execution of a contract between the interested party and
a data controller;
b) is authorized by the law of the Union or of the Member States that are
applies to the data controller and that also establishes appropriate measures
to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, or
c) is based on the explicit consent of the interested party.
3. In the cases referred to in section 2, letters a) and c), the person responsible for the
treatment will adopt the appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and
freedoms and legitimate interests of the interested party, at least the right to obtain
human intervention by the controller, to express their point of view and to
challenge the decision.
4. The decisions referred to in section 2 shall not be based on the categories
personal data referred to in article 9, paragraph 1, unless
Article 9(2)(a) or (g) applies and measures have been taken
adequate to safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the
interested."

In accordance with the provisions of said precept, to the extent that the decisions
automated will produce legal effects on the interested party or will affect him in a
significant way, the consent must be explicit, so that its obtaining does not
can be done in the same way as to obtain a general consent,
must be obtained in a reinforced way. To this must be added that article 13 of the
RGPD in its letter f) requires that the interested party be provided with significant information
on the applied logic, as well as the importance and foreseen consequences of
said treatment for the interested party. This information is not provided which, furthermore,
may hinder the exercise by interested parties of their rights and especially

that with respect to the absence of identification of the third-party sources or of the
categories of data, such information may be derived from the information
provided to the client in the first layer (by clearly identifying that the treatment
will be made with third-party sources) as in the second layer, whose content
appears in the section called “general conditions of the contract”, whose
content states: "(II) The elaboration of commercial profiles of the Client through the
aggregation of EDP databases with data from databases
of third parties, in order to offer the Client personalized products and services,
thus improving the customer experience. (III) Decision-making

that allow knowing in greater detail the risks associated with contracting. (iii)

It points out that, as reflected in the cited text, EDP ENERGÍA has identified with
extensively detail the types of data that are processed for the detailed purposes, being the
sources consulted for this an obvious derivation of the above. plead last
that being the origin of the data the interested party, it only corresponds to the
Entity inform in accordance with the provisions of article 13 RGPD, a provision that
does not establish, in any of its precepts, the obligation to identify or the source
nor the typology of the data. Only in the event that said treatment had been
carried out, the Entity should have reported such extremes, since
only at that time would the provisions of article 14 RGPD be applicable.

These claims cannot be shared, the double layer system is not foreseen
in the LOPDGDD as a mechanism that may lead to a breach of the
provided for in article 4.11 of the RGPD, according to which consent must be free,
specific, informed and unequivocal. It is worth recalling here what was pointed out by the Committee
European Data Protection in the document "Guidelines 05/2020 on the
consent in accordance with Regulation 2016/679” approved on May 4,
2020, which updates the Guidelines on consent under the Regulation
2016/679, adopted by the Article 29 Working Group and approved
by the European Data Protection Committee at its first plenary meeting. points out
said document in point 3.3.1. Minimum content requirements for the
consent is “informed”:
  “In order for the consent to be informed, it is necessary to communicate to the interested party
certain elements that are crucial to be able to choose. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that
At least the following information is required to obtain valid consent:
Yo. the identity of the data controller,

ii. the purpose of each of the treatment operations for which the consent is requested.
consent,
iii. what (type of) data will be collected and used,
IV. the existence of the right to withdraw consent,
v. information about the use of the data for automated decisions of
in accordance with article 22, paragraph 2, letter c), when relevant, and
saw. information about the possible risks of data transfer due to the
absence of an adequacy decision and adequate guarantees, as
described in article 46.”

In this case, the identity of the person responsible for the
treatment, since it is collected on behalf of EDP, it is a
ambiguous information, since the customer of EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. don't know if he is
consenting to data processing being carried out by EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U and EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. or only for that
entity with which you are contracting. On the other hand, at no time is he informed
what are the third-party databases from which data will be obtained, nor
even in the second layer, being inadmissible that it should be deduced by the
client of the categories of data that it treats. Nor can it be admitted that only
the assumption that the treatment had been carried out should be reported to the
interested in what data will be processed, since only in such a case would it result in
application of article 14 of the RGPD. On the contrary, it is essential that the interested party
know what types of data are going to be collected and used, so that such information,
this is the data from third-party databases that are going to be used and, obviously, which databases
are those, it is an essential element for the interested party to know what they are consenting to.

Claims that consent is specific cannot be shared
because there is a single purpose, such as the generation of a commercial profile,
whose use is limited to two contexts linked to each other: (i) the first, to carry out
carry out the assessment of the possibility of contracting and, (ii) the second, to issue the
corresponding commercial offers to the user in question. Requests for
consent to allow completion of the commercial profile mention two purposes
differentiated, one the sending of personalized commercial proposals, described with
this generic nature, which may include any unrelated commercial proposal
to its services and another, the possibility of contracting or not certain services, entering
the latter, where appropriate, in the field of automated decisions.

Nor can it be admitted, as EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. alleges, that the information regarding
the elaboration of profiles and automated decisions, complies with what is required by the
article 13 of the RGPD, since it informs about the existence of automated decisions,
including profiling and provides meaningful insights into the logic
applied, as well as the importance and expected consequences of said treatment
for the interested party.

In this regard, it is important to take into account what is stated in the Guidelines on decisions
automated individuals and profiling for the purposes of the Regulation
2016/679 adopted by the Working Group on Data Protection of article 29
on October 3, 2017, last revised and adopted on February 6, 2018
and approved by the European Data Protection Committee at its first meeting

plenary, which refers to significant information about the logic applied in the
following terms:

“Significant information about “applied logic”
  The growth and complexity of machine learning can make it difficult
understand how an automated decision-making or profiling process works.
The data controller must find simple ways to inform the data subject about
the underlying logic or criteria used to arrive at the decision. The GDPR requires that the
responsible for the treatment offers significant information about the logic applied, not
necessarily a complex explanation of the algorithms used or the disclosure of all the
algorithm.
However, the information provided must be sufficiently exhaustive for the
interested party understands the reasons for the decision.
Example
A data controller uses the credit score to assess and reject a
a person's loan application. The rating may have been provided by a
credit reference agency, or have been calculated directly from information
held by the data controller.
Regardless of the source (information on the source must be provided to the interested party in
under article 14, paragraph 2, letter f), when the personal data have not been obtained
from the interested party), if the data controller relies on this qualification,
It must be able to explain said qualification to the interested party, as well as the reasons for it.
The data controller should explain that this process helps them make decisions
fair and responsible loans. It must also provide details about the
main characteristics considered when making the decision, the source of this
information and relevance. This may include, for example: • information provided by the
interested in the application form;
• information about the behavior of the accounts, including arrears in payments; and •
information from official public records, such as information about fraud or records of
insolvency. Likewise, the data controller must include information to warn the
concerned that the credit scoring methods used are regularly checked
to ensure they remain fair, effective and impartial. The person in charge of
treatment must offer contact information so that the interested party requests the
reconsideration of rejected decisions, in accordance with the provisions of the
article 22.”

This document also points to the "Importance" and "consequences
planned” that “This term suggests that information should be provided on the
planned or future treatment, and how the automated decision may affect the
interested. In order for this information to be meaningful and understandable, it must be
offer real and tangible examples of the kind of possible effects.”

In the present case, in the opinion of this Agency, such requirements are not met: no
it is reported what type of products or services will be allowed to contract, the
logic to be applied to make said decision, limiting itself to indicating that a
set of data that “allows to know in greater detail the risks associated with the
hiring”, therefore not knowing what type of products or services can be
allow contracting or the logic to be applied to make said decision is not
cannot know its importance or the foreseen consequences.

On the other hand, this Agency does not share the allegation that there is a contest

In this regard, cite the judgment of July 16, 2019 of the National High Court, in which

it is pointed out that “Thus, regarding the existence of a medial contest between the two
infractions, which would determine the imposition of a single sanction, this Court has
declared repeatedly (judgments of January 29 and June 24, 2014
(appeal 562/12 and 141/2013), among others, that both offenses are independent

In the same way, it should be considered that the three violations of articles 6, 13 and 22 of the
RGPD are independent infringements, in this sense it must be taken into account that
information constitutes an essential element of consent, in accordance with
the provisions of article 4.11 of the RGPD, being determinant of its existence, of
so that its absence will result in the consent not being valid, thus being able to
violate both article 6 and, where appropriate, article 22 when the treatment is
based on the explicit consent of the interested party. On the other hand, there is a
principle of general transparency regarding all the treatments carried out
the interested party and that is reflected in the provisions of articles 12 to 14. In this way
It may be the case that assumptions occur, in which, in addition to the
non-existence of informed consent, the principle of transparency is breached
in general for all the treatments carried out by the interested party,
thereby infringing the provisions of articles 12 to 14, without this implying a
medial infringement contest.

EPD ENERGÍA, S.A.U alleges that the treatment related to the creation of a profile
commercial based on the information of third parties for the sending of information
advertising is not, in practice, being carried out, nor at the date of issuance of the
these allegations, nor prior to them. It also alleges that,
despite the fact that EDP ENERGÍA includes the possibility of profiling and adopting
automated decisions, the only profiling carried out is that related to the qualification of
customers in terms of fraud prevention, treatment for which there is
legal authorization and is based on the legitimate interest of EDP ENERGÍA, with
the purpose of safeguarding the good future of contracts made by EDP
ENERGY, as well as to prevent customers, whose sole purpose is to consume the service
energy without paying the bills, become part of the customer portfolio. Without
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the owners of the data are informed that said profiling is
reviewed and finally processed by EDP ENERGÍA personnel, which is why
can be considered as an automated decision in itself, considering in this
literal sense of the concept established by the authorities. In other words,
there is no data processing based on automated decisions, nor is there
any statement about such treatments, since outside of those strictly
necessary to continue with the service and those provided by law, are not
carried out, which is why, not only can it not be considered that there

The purpose of this procedure is at this point the examination of the
consent for the enrichment of profiles with third-party databases
effects of sending advertising communications and possible decisions
automated that produce legal effects or significantly affect the
interested party and that are also based on the consent of the same. So
The profiling made

The investigation of the procedure has not revealed that EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.
has carried out profiling incorporating data from third-party databases or
data processing based on automated decisions that produce effects
legal or significantly affect the interested party who had consented to such
treatments, as requested during the contracting process.
 
This Agency considers that in the event that they intend to carry out the
treatments mentioned in the previous paragraph, these should be adjusted to the
expressed demands and the requirements that make it possible to consider that the
Consent has been given in a valid manner and compliance with all the
requirements required under article 22 of the RGPD.
 
Consequently, it is considered appropriate that due to lack of evidence, taking into account the
principle of presumption of innocence expressly collected for the procedures

October, Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations,
that recognizes the interested party the right "To the presumption of non-existence of
administrative responsibility until the contrary is proven”, it is not considered
attributable to EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. violation of the provisions of articles 6 and
22, considered as possible infractions in the agreement of initiation of the present
penalty procedure.

For its part, article 11, numbers 1 and 2 of the LOPDGDD provides the following:
“Article 11. Transparency and information to the affected party 1. When the personal data
are obtained from the affected party, the data controller may comply with the
duty of information established in article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
providing the affected party with the basic information referred to in the following section and
indicating an electronic address or other means that allows access in a
simple and immediate to the rest of the information.
2. The basic information referred to in the previous section must contain, at
least: a) The identity of the data controller and his representative, in his
case. b) The purpose of the treatment. c) The possibility of exercising the rights
established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. If the data
obtained from the affected person were to be treated for the elaboration of profiles, the
basic information will also include this circumstance. In this case, the
concerned shall be informed of their right to oppose the adoption of decisions
automated individuals that produce legal effects on him or affect him
significantly in a similar way, when this right concurs in accordance with the
provided for in article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

In relation to this principle of transparency, it is also taken into account
expressed in Recitals 39, 58, 60 and 61 of the RGPD.

(39) “All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For the people

interested party is concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that a

be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through
a website. This is particularly relevant in situations where proliferation
of agents and the technological complexity of the practice make it difficult for the
interested in knowing and understanding if they are being collected, by whom and for what purpose,

1 In the first place, when the contracting is carried out through the sub-channels
CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and Leads, the information is provided by telephone from the
as follows, as can be deduced from the evidence provided:

In the CAC Inbound channel, it is indicated to the person who contracts by phone what
following: “Your personal data and those of your representative will be processed by EDP
Comercializadora SAU and EDP Energía SAU for the management of their contracts,
fraud prevention, profiling based on customer information and
EDP, as well as the realization of personalized communications about products or
services directly related to their contracts, being able in any
time to oppose them". (Evidence 2, CAC Inbound channel contracting.)

In the Telemarketing and Leads contracting subchannels, in addition to the information
contained in the previous paragraph, the following information is added: “We remind you
that they may exercise at any time their rights of access, rectification, oppo-
removal, deletion, limitation and portability, through any of the indicated channels
in the General Conditions that can be consulted on our website ***URL.1.” (evi-

Said information is not in accordance with the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD in
in relation to the provisions of article 11 of the LOPDGDD, thus in the first of the

CAC Inbound channel is not informed of the possibility of exercising the rights established
two in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, nor is it indicated to the person who contracts an address
electronically or by any other means that allows easy and immediate access to the rest of the
you information.
It is alleged that at the beginning of the call the following locution is heard “This call

necessary for the execution of the contract and/or the satisfaction of legitimate interests
of EDP, provided that other rights of the client do not prevail over the latter.”
This Agency considers that it is not easy for any person, without
knowledge of the matter of data protection, differentiate what treatments

In this sense, they point out the Guidelines on Transparency under the

Article 13 requires that the interested party be informed of “the purposes of the treatment to which

Transparency is closely linked to the legality of the treatment, article 5.1.a) of the
RGPD indicates as one of the principles related to the treatment the principle of legality,
loyalty and transparency. The legal basis determines the legality of the treatment, so
the person in charge must inform the interested party in each case that there is a legal basis
ca appropriate to carry out said treatment in accordance with article 6 of the RGPD, without
that it is admissible that the interested party has to interpret the privacy policy to
determine what may be the legitimizing basis of each treatment.

This Agency also does not agree with the allegation that “for any person

In this sense, it is worth remembering what was stated in the previously mentioned "Guidelines
ces on transparency under Regulation 2016/679”. They analyze the
scope that should be attributed to the elements of transparency established in article
Article 12 of the RGPD, according to which the controller will take the necessary measures
appropriate to "provide the interested party with all the information indicated in articles 13 and
14, as well as any communication under articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the
treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, with a

that entail an exercise of rights in a different way.
Regarding the information on the legitimate interest that the person in charge attributes,
alleges EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. that they are clearly displayed and placed

cadotecnia, in relation to the sending of personalized commercial communications.
In these cases, he considers it obvious that there is an identification between the informative purpose

whose basis is their legitimate interest, the "profiling" is mentioned with respect to

In this sense, the Guidelines of the Working Group of Article

e) or f).
In this case, in the opinion of this Agency, the information requirements
previously described. EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U., limits itself to reporting on the "carrying out of
profiles”, but it does not offer information on the type of profiles that are going to be carried out,
the specific uses to which these profiles are going to be put or the possibility that the
interested party can exercise the right of opposition in application of article 21 of the
GDPR.
The allegation that profiling is associated with
sending personalized commercial communications. As has been pointed out
when determining the purposes in the first paragraph of the general conditions it is stated
the following: “manage, maintain, develop, complete and control the
contracting of electricity and/or gas supply and/or complementary services of and/or
gas and/or complementary review services and/or technical assistance and/or program of
points, and/or improvement of the service, to carry out actions to prevent
fraud, as well as profiling, personalized commercial communications
based on information provided by the Client and/or derived from the provision of the
service by EDP and relating to products and services related to the
supply and consumption of energy, maintenance of facilities and equipment”
clearly separating the purpose of profiling from that of sending
commercial communications.
In the same way, as evidenced in exhibits 2, 3 and 4 during
telephone contracting process through a representative, the latter is informed of
that: “Your personal data and those of your representative will be processed by EDP Comer-
cializadora SAU and EDP Energía SAU for the management of their contracts, prevention of

In any case, even if it could be taken for granted that the intention of EDP ENER-

of the treatments based on the consent of the interested party:

“revocation” in the context of the exercise of rights cannot have an impact on the
interested, because with both terms the user achieves the same objective, which is that

RGPD, which correlatively requires that the interested party have knowledge of the basis

interested parties the incorrect information provided about the exercise of rights of the
interested.
Consequently, in accordance with the exposed evidence, the facts described
in this Law Ground suppose a violation of the principle of
transparency regulated in article 13 of the RGPD, which gives rise to the application of the
corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

In the event that there is an infringement of the provisions of the RGPD, between
the corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates the
following:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers
listed below:
(…)
d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period;
(…)
i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;".

In the present case, the breach of the principle of
privacy by design established in article 25 of the RGPD, and the principle of
transparency regulated in article 13 of the RGPD with the scope expressed in the
Previous Foundations of Law, which supposes the commission of paths
offenses typified in articles 83.4 and 83.5 of the same rule as under the

the next:

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that "They constitute

For the same reasons, and considering the graduation criteria of the
sanctions indicated below, the request for
imposition of a sanction in its minimum degree.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the
sanctions of a fine to be imposed in this case on EPD ENERGÏA, S.A.U., as
responsible for infractions typified in article 83.4.a) and 83.5.b) of the RGPD,
it is appropriate to graduate the fine that should be imposed for each of the infractions

in article 83.4.a) and classified as serious for prescription purposes in article
73.1.d) of the LOPDGDD:

 
It is estimated that the following factors concur as aggravating factors:

-

-

The nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operations to be carried out
Trafficking: The infringement results from the absence of an effective implementation of
technical and organizational measures to eliminate the risks generated by the con-
treatment of services and obtaining consent for other purposes
des when acting through a representative.
 
 The intentionality or negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction.
Deficiencies in such hiring procedures and obtaining
consent for other purposes should have been advised by a
entity with the characteristics of EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. and avoided when designing
their processes.

 
-

- The continuing nature of the offence. The offense originates from a
incorrect design of contracting procedures through
representative, which have been used since at least 2018, without
these have been modified or corrective measures implemented up to the
month of January of the current year in which a protocol of

The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of
personal data processing. The operations that make up the
business activity carried out by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. What

It cannot be considered as a mitigating factor, as alleged by the person in charge, that

The condition of large company of the responsible entity and its volume of
business. The business volume of the entity according to the information obtained
has been 1,236,124,000 euros in 2018. It is alleged that there have been
taking into account the data of 2018 and not those of 2019, being the volume of business
of said year of 589,929,000 euros.

It is alleged that being considered a large company or the volume of
billing are not circumstances foreseen as aggravating or in the RGPD
nor in the LOPDGDD.

Such an allegation cannot be shared, article 83.1 of the RGPD provides that
“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

administrative actions under this article for violations of the

Article establishes that when deciding to impose an administrative fine and
its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account: (...) k)
any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided,
directly or indirectly, through the infringement.”

For these purposes, as an aggravating factor, it is worth taking into account the
consideration of the entity as a large company which is
linked, among other aspects, to its turnover, to the extent that
that it has greater means to comply with the obligations
imposed by the GDPR.

Regarding the volume of business taken into account in the procedure,
took the one that was available at the time of the startup agreement,
without it having been questioned until now by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.. No
However, even taking for granted that the volume corresponding to the year
2019 is the one that appears in the arguments to the motion for a resolution, as
data does not modify the condition of large company of said entity.

- High volume of data and processing that constitutes the object of the
proceedings. The volume of contracts signed by third parties on behalf
of natural persons rose during the year 2019 amounted to 37,197.

-

Any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment; EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. has been sanctioned in
procedures PS/00101/2018 and PS/00363/2018, for violation of article
6.1 of Organic Law 15/1999, and PS/00109/2019 for the violation of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD.

It is alleged by the person in charge that the AEPD refers to the volume of global invoicing
of EDP ENERGÍA to quantify the infraction when it should take into account
exclusively, and where appropriate, the billing data generated by the eventual
alleged breach -in the case of article 25 of the RGPD, relating exclusively
to hiring by representation, being the amount obtained by hiring by
representation of approximately 7,650,000 euros.

  In this regard, it should be noted that article 83.4 provides that "The
Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global turnover of the previous financial year”, for
Consequently, this Agency understands that the total volume of annual business is that which
operates as a limit on the amount of the infringement, and not the benefit obtained, which
constitutes a further aggravating element. In this regard, it should be noted that the
2% of the billing of said entity during 2019 according to the data indicated,
represents a figure of 11,798,580 euros, so the amount at which the
amount of the fine, very far from such maximum amount, is weighted.

On the other hand, said entity requests that the fact of
that special categories of data, or data of minors, are not processed in this regard
It should be considered that the processing of such data may constitute, in its case, a
aggravating circumstance, but the fact that such data is not processed in itself does not constitute
an extenuating one, without, on the other hand, by the data controller justifying in
in any way because such a circumstance must be taken into account in this sense.

Nor should the fact that the entity has been
object of sale to another company, article 76.2.e) of the LOPDGDD states that it may
take into account “the existence of a merger process by absorption subsequent to the
commission of the infraction, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity”
seeks here an analogical interpretation of this precept so that it extends
this circumstance to other "structural modifications" made after
to the commission of the offence, an interpretation that cannot be admitted, when the
LOPDGDD wants to refer to structural modifications in general, so it does,
while in the aforementioned precept it makes exclusive reference to the merger by
absorption.

It alleges that the measures taken
to alleviate the damage, such as the implementation of a new protocol of
hiring and the degree of cooperation with the administration and the degree of
collaboration with the AEPD. These elements are taken into account so that they are not

is the imposition of measures in the terms provided in article 58.2 of the RGPD.

Considering the exposed factors, the valuation reached by the fine for the
imputed infraction is 500,000.00 euros.

2. Infraction due to non-compliance with the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD, typified
in article 83.5.b) and qualified as minor for prescription purposes in article
74.a) of the LOPDGDD:

 

The following graduation criteria are considered concurrent:

-

The nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction: The deficiencies
appreciated in the information provided to the interested parties affect
substantive aspects of the principle of transparency.

It is alleged that the imputed is the need to improve some aspects of its
data protection policies without in any case the texts used
can be understood to have generated a high level of damage and
damages, which should be considered as a mitigating factor. This allegation
cannot be accepted, these are not simple information defects

manifest in this proceeding.

-

The intentionality or negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction.
The defects pointed out in the information provided show the lack of

diligence of EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. in fulfilling the obligations
of transparency imposed by the RGPD.

The allegation that in his actions he has followed the
guides and directives of the AEPD and the European Committee for Data Protection
which shows his diligence, on the contrary, in the fundamentals of
law contains the numerous aspects in which the guidelines of the
European Data Protection Committee have not been taken into account in its
performance.

-

The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of
personal data processing. The operations that make up the
business activity carried out by EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U. What

treatment of personal data.

general contracting conditions, consents are obtained for

(financial, automotive and related payment protection, electronics...)

- The continuing nature of the infringement, interpreted by the National High Court

as a permanent offense.

-

The condition of large company of the responsible entity and its volume of
business. The business volume of the entity according to the information obtained
has been 1,236,124,000 euros in 2018. It is now alleged that the
turnover for the year 2019 is 589,929,000 euros.

Regarding the allegation that being considered a large company or the
billing volume are not foreseen circumstances as aggravating or
in the RGPD or in the LOPDGDD, this Agency reiterates what is indicated
previously in the determination of the aggravating circumstances of the infraction of the
article 25 before the same allegation.

- High volume of data and processing that constitutes the object of the
proceedings. The infringement affects all data processing carried out
by the entity EDP ENERGÍA, S.A.U.

- High number of interested parties. Violation affects all customers
natural persons of the entity. According to the supervision report of the
changes of marketer, corresponding to the first quarter of 2019, from
the National Commission of Markets and Competition the number of points
supply of the entity in the domestic sphere amounted to 1,129,534
constituting 4% of the total electricity sector in said domestic sphere.

customers. The high number of individual clients of the entity
responsible is sufficient element to consider this circumstance as
an aggravating

As for other factors that the data controller considers should be
taken into account as mitigating factors, such as the fact that they are not treated
special categories of data or data of minors or the sale of all the
shares to another company, we can only refer to what was expressed by this Agency before
the same allegations in relation to the violation of article 25 of the RGPD.

It alleges that the measures taken
to alleviate the damage, such as improving access to information on
data protection, which is already available at edp-
residentialbytotal.es/rgpd and the degree of cooperation with the authority. The alleged
improvement affects only one of the defects indicated in relation to the
transparency of the procedure, whose positive evaluation by this Agency cannot
suppose a mitigation of the sanction taking into account that such measure has been
taken once the present sanctioning procedure has begun.

Considering the exposed factors, the valuation reached by the fine for the
infringement charged is 1,000,000.00 euros

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
