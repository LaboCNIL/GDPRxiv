He denies having contracted and has charged three bills to his bank account.

He states that he filed a claim with MOVISTAR for these facts, put
to his knowledge that she had not made any contract and got them to give
low "telephone numbers on April 27, 2018" although, despite this, they have
continued to collect new bills in your bank account. He adds that the
contracting was by telephone and that MOVISTAR has refused to facilitate the recording of
the hiring that supposedly she would have made.

Complaints- ***LOCATION.1) on 04/25/2018 in which he makes these statements:

person “named B.B.B., who claimed to be her husband, as can be heard on the
recording that they keep about the hiring and that the teleoperator said.”

years, casually calling himself her ex-husband B.B.B.”

On 06/11/2018, the claimant filed a new complaint with the Police
(Office of Complaints- *** LOCATION.1), extension of the previous one, in which it exposes
that, despite having removed the fraudulent lines on 04/27/2018, has received a

THIRD: The facts set forth in the claim are subject to the
provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the
Treatment of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data (RGPD), which
It is effective from 05/25/2018.

It is not an obstacle for the application of the RGPD that the conduct allegedly
offender had been initiated when Organic Law 15/1999 was in force,
Protection of Personal Data (LOPD). In this sense, it must be indicated, for
one party, which the claimant has stated -and the respondent has confirmed in its
response to the request of this Agency, in file E/4627/2018, dated
09/10/2018- that requested the respondent on 04/25/2018 the cancellation of the telephone lines
that had been registered under his name integrated into the “FUSIÓN” product.

On the other, that among the invoices that the respondent issued in the name of the
claimant there is one from 06/01/2018 (when the RGPD was already in force),
invoice ***FACTURA.3, for the service provided by both the fixed line and the line
mobile ***PHONE.2. With the same argumentative purpose, it should be mentioned that in
dated 07/13/2018 the respondent addresses a letter to the claimant informing her of
that it has carried out the “timely steps to cancel the existing debt
corresponding to the lines ***PHONE.1, ***PHONE.2 and ***PHONE.3”.
It is also worth mentioning the document - screenshot - sent by the
claimed with its response during the preliminary investigation actions
(file E/10190/2018) which has the heading "Claim file" and
deals with the claim dated "07/12/2018" of the type "invoicing" for the amount of
€171.29.

The cited documents show that when Regulation (EU) 2016/679
was of effective application (on 05/25/2018), the complainant continued processing the data
claims of the claimant without standing, associated with a debt to which the
claimant was an employee derived, among others, from the services provided by the line
mobile ***PHONE.2.

Although the respondent initiated the processing of the personal data of the
claimant in January 2018 (date on which they were registered associated with their data
the three controversial lines were personal), therefore when the
LOPD, the conduct in which the violation of the protection regulations is specified
of personal data has been maintained over time until, at least, the beginning of July
of 2018, since, as the respondent acknowledges in her letter of July 13, it is then
when it proceeds to cancel the amounts it had billed the claimant for the
lines that he registered in his name, among which was, as indicated,
the mobile line ***PHONE.2.

The infraction for which the claimed party is held responsible participates in the
nature of the so-called permanent infractions, in which the
consummation is projected in time beyond the initial fact and extends during
the entire period of time in which the data or personal data are subject to
treatment. So, even though on the date the conduct began
offender, the applicable standard was the LOPD, the applicable standard is the one that
It is in force when the infraction is consumed.

The Supreme Court has ruled on the rule that should be applied in
those cases in which the infractions are prolonged in time and there have been
a normative change while the infraction is committed.

The STS of 04/17/2002 (Rec. 466/2000) applied a provision that was not
in force at the initial moment of commission of the infraction, but in the subsequent
in which the offending conduct continued. The Judgment examined a case that
dealt with the sanction imposed on a Judge for breach of her duty to
abstention in preliminary proceedings. The sanctioned alleged the non-validity of the
article 417.8 of the LOPJ when the events occurred. The STS considered that the
infraction had been committed since the date of initiation of the
Preliminary Proceedings until the moment in which the Judge was suspended in the fiscal year
of their functions, so that rule was indeed applicable. In the same sense,
pronounces the SAN of 09/16/2008 (Rec.488/2006)

FOURTH: On July 29, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against TELEFÓNICA
DE ESPAÑA, S.A.U., (hereinafter TDE or the claimed party), in accordance with the provisions of
Articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), by the
alleged infringement of article 6.1. of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD.

FIFTH: Notification of the initiation agreement, on 08/26/2019 the respondent presents
allegations and requests the file of the sanctioning procedure for non-existence of
responsibility. In support of his claim, he adduces the following arguments:

- Begins by indicating that there are a series of circumstances that justify
that TDE had processed the claimant's data linked to the line
***PHONE.2. The circumstances described by the respondent are transcribed:



- States that the charges in the claimant's bank account began to
be generated from the moment that D. B.B.B. (hereinafter D.B.B.B. or
the impersonator) makes the address change "supposedly under
verbal command from his wife.
It invokes the "appearance of legitimacy with which it acted" TDE since the data
provided by the impersonator were truthful and there was an appearance that it was
the claimant who gave the consent.

- With regard to the proof of consent of the claimant, load that
corresponds to the claimed entity, states that “As is obvious, and so it is

recording, but it can be accredited by the existence of the payment of
invoices and actions on the line that can only be carried out as the holder”.
Insists on the non-existence of an infringement of article 6.1. GDPR and adds that
“a proof that TDE has acted according to the norm” is “the deception
used and the usurpation of data by the impersonator”.
It invokes the principle of presumption of innocence, given that the
impersonator identified himself to TDE as the husband of the claimant and
correctly provided all the identification data that was requested (name,
surnames and ID). It argues that any sanctioning resolution requires the certainty

Consider reproduced the submitted claim and the documentation attached to it;
the documents and statements obtained both in the informative request process
prior to admitting the claim for processing, which was requested from TELEFÓNICA

by virtue of the informative request that the Data Inspection made to TDE and the

“3.1.- The sound recording - audible - of the conversation held between that
entity and D.B.B.B. on 02/08/2018 in which -as TDE has declared- that
person, “in the name and authorization of his wife Ms. [the claimant] with DNI ****,
request the change of bank details. In the letter of notification of opening of
evidence TDE was informed that the recording that he said he provided with his allegations to the
initial agreement, while it was inaudible, was non-existent for purposes of evidence.

that the claimant either consented to TDE processing her bank details or gave her
representation to D.B.B.B. for the purpose of providing TDE with your data on your behalf

claimant did not celebrate.

3.3.- The document that proves that the owner of the mobile line ***TELEPHONE.2
-BBB - who had requested the portability of this line, of which he was the owner,
from Vodafone to “MOVISTAR” -as evidenced by the recording of the company
verifier that the respondent has sent to this Agency- consented to the change of
ownership of the line in the name of the claimant and she also lent her
consent to said change of ownership.

 A. The respondent evacuated the evidence procedure on 06/11/2020 and responded in the
following terms:
1.- Regarding the evidence requested in point 3.1, TDE replied that the “mentioned
recording was and is audible”. Provides the recording and explains how to access the
sound document. In the annex provided, it includes in point 1 the so-called

- Yes
-We proceed to make the modification. We end the recording...

2.- Regarding the evidence requested in point 3.2 of the notification letter of
evidence, the respondent replied in the following terms:

“In this sense, the recording in which Ms. A.A.A. contact
with the company to formalize the merger contract for the lines ***TELÉFONO.1,
***TELEPHONE.2 and ***TELEPHONE.3, in attached document No. 1 and as section 2.2.
In the same recording, Mrs. A.A.A. expressly authorizes the performance of
the charges in the bank account indicated by it, as stated in the Agreement of
initiation of the sanctioning procedure of reference.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The annex provided by TDE with the response to the tests, point 2.2., includes a
sound document with this rubric: “Document, whatever the support on which it is
stating that it proves that the claimant consented to TDE processing their data

-Yes
-Okay, the recording is done.>>

3.-Regarding the test requested from TDE in point 3.3. of the notification letter
proof that consisted of proving that D. B.B.B. had consented to a
change of ownership of the line ***TELEFONO.2 in the name of the claimant and that the
claimant, had consented to said change of ownership-, responded in the following
terms, referring to the answer to the question in point 3.2.:

“In the document Annex Nº1 and as epigraph 2.2, the recording is attached in the
that Ms. A.A.A. Contact the company to formalize the Merger contract of the
lines ***PHONE.1, ***PHONE.2 and ***PHONE.3.

Also, in Annex No. 1 and in section 2.1. the change of account is attached

charge of the aforementioned lines by D. B.B.B.

In this sense, it is interesting to highlight that the contracting of the mobile line
***TELÉFONO.2 with a prefusion rate was intended to integrate the aforementioned
line in a Fusion contract whose main line was ***TELEPHONE.1 and whose
hiring was carried out by who identified himself as A.A.A. in the recording
provided as Annex No. 1 section 2.2.”

B. The result of the practical tests was as follows:

  1º Despite being required in the testing phase, TDE has not provided any
recording in which the claimant, or who had been supplanting her identity, consented
 ***PHONE.2 that belonged

to D.B.B.B. and that -according to the operator's statement- was subject to portability from
the operator VODAFONE on the same date of 01/14/2018 on which the
claimant entered into the FUSION contract.

2º In the recording of the conversation held on 01/14/2018 between TDE and the
person who identified himself with the name, two surnames and NIF of the claimant and
consented to contracting the Fusion product, they are not mentioned
  line numbers
object of the Fusion contract nor the twenty digits of the bank account.

 

3º In the recording of the conversation held on 02/08/2018 between TDE and D. B.B.B.
in which he requests to change the direct debit bank account for the invoices of the
Fusion product, the account number communicated to the operator belongs to the
claimant. It is the claimant's bank account as stated in her
police report. It is in that account that MOVISTAR sent the invoices, two
charges, for products that had not contracted.

4º In the recording of the conversation held on 02/08/2018 between TDE and D. B.B.B.
in which he requests to carry out a change of the direct debit bank details
of the invoices, there is no recording of the owner's consent for their data to be
banks were treated for this purpose. Nor does it appear, neither on the part of the
operator or by D. B.B.B., a statement that it was acting
in the name and on behalf of the alleged owner, that is, the claimant or in
virtue of verbal mandate (as TDE maintains)

the date on which the suspension of deadlines was lifted (06/01/2020) the calendar days that
remained on the date on which the suspension took effect to end the term of
maximum duration of the procedure (scheduled for 04/29/2020)

          It should be underlined that the addition of days after the lifting of the suspension
of terms is the calendar days that mediated between the date on which the
suspension and the date on which the proceeding should have ended if no
produced the aforementioned suspension. Important nuance insofar as in the proposal for
resolution erroneously indicated that the procedure ended on 07/13/2020
as a consequence of having added only the working days and not the days
natural.

EIGHTH: The proposed resolution was signed on 06/22/2020 and notified
electronically on the same date. Acceptance of electronic notice by
TDE, as evidenced in the file, took place on 06/26/2020, so the

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

The Director of the Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the
RGPD and in the art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.

Yo

II

The RGPD dedicates article 5 to the principles that must govern the treatment of

personal data, provision that provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
a) treated lawfully, loyally and transparently with the interested party (<<lawfulness,

loyalty and transparency>>)

 (…)
2. The data controller will be responsible for compliance with the
provided in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”

Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, specifies in section 1 the

assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
applicable to the data controller;
d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or of
another natural person.
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the controller
of the treatment;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
over said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
in particular when the interested party is a child (...)”

Article 4 of the RGPD, “Definitions”, offers in section 2 a legal concept
of “processing” as “any operation or set of operations performed
on personal data or set of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

15/21

conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling of
access, collation, interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction”.

Likewise, article 4 of the RGPD, section 1, understands “personal data”
“any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (<<the
interested>>); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier,
such as a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The infraction for which the claimed party is held responsible is provided for in the
article 83.5 of the RGPD: “Infringements of the following provisions are
will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000
Eur maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount: a) The basic principles for the
processing, including the conditions for consent under articles
5,6,7 and 9.”

 In turn, the LOPDGDD in its article 72.1. qualifies as a very serious infraction "b)
The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679” and
It adds that this infraction prescribes after three years.

III

TDE is attributed an infringement of the principle of legality, in particular of article
6.1 RGPD, given that it processed personal data of the claimant -name,
surnames, NIF and bank details- linked to the mobile line ***TELÉFONO.2 whose
hiring in the name of the claimant is not accredited. This, despite having
provided a recording in which a person who identifies himself by name,
surnames and NIF of the claimant grants consent to the hiring of the
Fusion product. The mobile line was owned by D. B.B.B. therefore with respect to
this line should have been proven that the claimant had authorized a change of
ownership in his name prior to the time of the recording in which he allegedly
The claimant consents to contracting the Fusion product.

As we will point out later, the defendant entity did not act in this
matter with the minimum diligence required in order to comply with the obligations
imposed by the RGPD.

A. It has been proven in the file that TDE, in its capacity as service provider
of the Fusion service or product that it sells, processed the personal data of the
 ***PHONE.1, ***PHONE.2 and
claimant linked to three lines:
***PHONE.3.

The entity, in order to prove that it was entitled to process its
personal data linked to the contracting of the Fusion product has provided a

recording in which someone identifies himself with the name, two surnames and NIF of the
claimant and consents to contracting this service.

 Without prejudice to highlighting once again -it was already indicated in the initial agreement- that
the sound of the recording is distant and strange, it must be emphasized that in the recording
In no case are the telephone lines object of the contract identified.
Fusion product to which, allegedly, the claimant gave consent.

The recording is dated -as it is heard at the beginning- on 01/14/2018. The
Fusion product, as stated in the invoices issued by TDE, included the line
***PHONE.2. This line belonged to D. B.B.B. and according to TDE he had behaved to
MOVISTAR from VODAFONE on the same day 01/14/2018. That is, on the same day
that the claimant, allegedly, gave her consent to the hiring of her
name of a product that included a fixed line and two mobiles. extreme must
relate to the dates on which, according to TDE, they were registered in the name
of the claimant the services linked to the lines: the fixed line would have been given
high on 01/22/2018 while the mobile line that belonged to D. B.B.B. was discharged
in the name of the claimant on the same 01/14/2018.

According to the information provided by the respondent on 01/14/2018, the line
mobile phone ***TELÉFONO.2 was transferred by its owner from VODAFONE to MOVISTAR. But for
that could be integrated into the Fusion product supposedly contracted by the
claimant necessarily had to have carried out a change of ownership
from the old holder -D. BBB – in the name of the claimant.

TDE, despite the fact that this was requested by the instructor in the testing phase, did not provide
no document in which the claimant gave her consent to the change in her
name of the owner of the aforementioned mobile line. The entity limited itself to responding to
the requested proof reiterating arguments related to the only two
provided recordings. At the request to prove documentary evidence that the
The claimant had consented that the mobile line owned by D.B.B.B. figure out
To his name he replied the following:

“In the document Annex Nº1 and as epigraph 2.2, the recording is attached in the

lines ***PHONE.1, ***PHONE.2 and ***PHONE.3.

Also, in Annex No. 1 and in section 2.1. the change of account is attached

charge of the aforementioned lines by D. B.B.B.

In this sense, it is interesting to highlight that the contracting of the mobile line
***TELÉFONO.2 with a pre-merger rate was intended to integrate the aforementioned
line in a Fusion contract whose main line was ***TELEPHONE.1 and whose
hiring was carried out by who identified himself as A.A.A. in the recording
provided as Annex No. 1 section 2.2.”

The beneficiary operator that had to manage the portability of the line
mobile ***TELÉFONO.2 from VODAFONE was TELEFÓNICA MÓVILES ESPAÑA,
S.A.U., to whom this Agency addressed within the framework of E/4627/2018, in writing
received by the operator on 08/20/2018 with which he was transferred from the
claim. This entity responded to the aforementioned request, warning with character
prior to the fact that the claim was directed against MOVISTAR, a trade name under which

both she and TDE operated and that it was TDE “which provides the service of
telecommunications referred to in the aforementioned claim”.

TDE, in its capacity as data controller of the
claimant as the owner of the various lines for which he allegedly had
contracted the "Fusion" product that this operator markets -among them the line
cell phone of which TME had been a beneficiary operator- had to be able to
to prove that the mobile line ***TELÉFONO.2 was owned by the claimant in that
date. The line was covered to benefit TME by D. B.B.B. on the same date in
that the claimant allegedly contracts the Fusion product by telephone, therefore
that it was necessary for the claimant to consent to a change of ownership in her name
prior to contracting a product or service that included, among others, the aforementioned
line. Extreme on which TDE has not accredited anything.

The RGPD refers in article 5.2 to the principle of proactive responsibility to
under which the data controller is not only responsible for compliance with the
principles listed in article 5.1, which is why legality is of interest here, but
is also "able to prove it."

Regarding the proof that the claimant had consented to a change of
ownership in his name of the controversial mobile line, a charge that corresponds to the
claimed entity, TDE stated in its allegations to the initial agreement: “As it is
obvious, and this is clear from what is stated in the file, it is impossible for my
represented can prove the consent of the complainant without the existence of
the recording, but it can be accredited by the existence of the payment of invoices and
actions on the line that can only be carried out as owner”. (The underlining is from the
AEPD)

The first police report is from 04/25/2018, when the claimed one has passed
the second charge to the claimant's bank account. By then, the affected
has not only filed a police report, but has previously carried out the steps
with the operator, has obtained a copy of the invoices and has tried without
successful (this is stated in the complaint filed with the Police) that TDE facilitated the
Recording of your intended hiring. Nor can it be accepted that there is any
action of the claimant in which she behaves as the alleged owner of the
line that was none other than to manage their withdrawal after having
submitted claims for identity theft to the operator.

Although TDE bears the burden of proof that the claimant consented

previous owner, D. B.B.B., and that the defendant has not provided any evidence to the
In this regard, he adduces in his defense the inexistence of responsibility based on the fact that
acted in accordance with the law and that he has been the victim of the deception of the impersonator who
used the personal data of the claimant.

However, regardless of the deception to which the supplanter could have
lead him, the truth is that the defendant did not act with the diligence that the
circumstances of the case required. As has been indicated, there is no record in the file
document that proves that the claimant -or the third party that has supplanted her
identity- consented to the change of ownership to your name of the mobile line

18/21

***TELÉFONO.2 owned by D. B.B.B., whose service was provided by VODAFONE and
which was covered by MOVISTAR.

The recording in the file in which whoever identifies with the
personal data of the claimant contracts with TDE the Fusion product on date
01/14/2018, does not serve as a legitimizing basis for the processing of personal data of
the claimant associated with the line ***TELÉFONO.2 in which the conduct is specified
offending

As has been indicated, the offending behavior materializes in the treatment of
the personal data of the claimant linked, in particular, to the mobile line
aforesaid In this sense we are referring to a line that already existed -in fact,
the only one that exists at the time of entering into the Merger agreement- and that on that same date
It is the cover of VODAFONE to MOVISTAR by its former owner. For such a line to be
included in the merger contract signed on behalf of the claimant with TDE
Previously, a change of ownership had to be managed. The consent of the
claimant for that change of ownership of the mobile line, so that it appears in his
name, it was a budget for the contracting of the Fusion product by whom
identified himself to the operator with the claimant's personal data (name,
surnames and NIF) will operate as a legitimizing basis for the treatment (section b, of the
article 6.1 RGPD) not only with respect to the remaining lines but also with respect to the
controversial line.

  
The absence of any documentation provided by TDE showing that it acted
in accordance with the requirements imposed by the RGPD is an exponent of its lack of
diligence and prevents, as it intends, from declaring the non-existence of responsibility
due to the absence of the subjective element of the infraction.

B. The documentation in the file also shows that TDE dealt with the
bank details of the claimant violating the principle of legality. The treatment of
Data from the bank account of the affected person in La Caixa is fully accredited.
It was precisely the charges received on his account that led him to formulate
a claim before TDE and later to file a complaint with the Police.

TDE has argued in its defense that in the recording of 01/14/2018 the
claimant provided him with his bank details. However, in the recording provided by
TDE (see Proven Facts and Precedent Six) no account is provided
banking. It only asks for your consent to domicile the payments in the account
that is already in the possession of the operator.

The details of the bank account owned by the claimant in La Caixa
provided by a third party, D.B.B.B., several days after the recording date of the
contracting and requesting for this purpose to make a "change" in the bank details that already
were in the possession of the operator. On the other hand, TDE has recognized in its
allegations to the initiation agreement that from the moment in which D. B.B.B. makes
the change of domicile "supposedly under the verbal mandate of his wife"
they began to refer charges to the claimant.

In the recording provided by TDE in which D. B.B.B. handle a change of
bank account for the collection of product invoices Fusion this person

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

19/21

provides as the direct debit account for the invoices the bank account from which
the claimant owns. However, on the recording you can't hear any
moment to D.B.B.B. state or ask the TDE telemarketer if he was
intervening on behalf of the affected party, whom he says is his wife,
as TDE alleges in its defense.

The respondent invokes that, as evidenced by the recording, the third party, D.B.B.B.,
identified himself as the husband of the claimant and provided her personal data
(name, surnames and NIF) correctly. In the opinion of TDE, it is an exponent of what he did
with the diligence that the circumstances of the case demanded, for which the treatment of
the bank details of the claimant, no matter how unlawful the conduct is,
is guilty and no sanctioning administrative responsibility can be demanded.

Faced with this argument, it is worth remembering the criterion repeatedly maintained by
the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court when the data
personal -as in this case it happens with the bank details of the claimant,
Well, thanks to a phone call made by D. B.B.B. at TDE days after
the supposed hiring whose recording has contributed the claimed, acting in its
own name and identifying himself as the spouse of the claimant, changes the data of
direct debit and provides the claimant's bank account - are provided by
relatives or relatives of the holder.

It follows from the preceding statement that TDE violated article 6.1. GDPR to
have processed the personal data of the claimant -name, two surnames and NIF-
associated with the mobile line ***TELÉFONO.2 as well as your bank details, since you have not
provided no proof of their legitimacy for the treatment carried out.

The treatment of the claimant's data by TDE without legitimation, linked
to the aforementioned mobile line, was maintained until 07/13/2018, date of the letter that
addressed the claimant informing her of the cancellation of the invoices issued to her
name by the three lines associated with their data, among which was the mobile line
cover, and, in any case, until the date of the last invoice issued, on 06/01/2018.

The action of TDE contrary to article 6.1. RGPD is subsumable in the article

83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

In determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD. In turn, according to article
83.2.k RGPD may also take into consideration the circumstances described
in article 76 LOPDGDD.

IV

For the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty of fine that corresponds to impose the
claimed as responsible for an infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the
RGPD, the concurrence is appreciated as aggravating circumstances of the following
circumstances modifying liability:

The scope of the treatment (article 83.2.a, RGPD) since the personal data of
the claimant who have been subject to treatment without legitimacy for it were
several: the name and two surnames, NIF and bank details.

The obvious link between the business activity of TDE and the treatment

of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD in relation
with article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)

The continuing nature of the infringement (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD in relation to
