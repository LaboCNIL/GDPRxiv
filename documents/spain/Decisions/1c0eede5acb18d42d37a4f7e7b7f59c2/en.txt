Attached as Annex I: Emails dated November 18, 2020,
November 30, 2020, December 13, 2020 and January 11, 2021, both
originals as translation into Spanish.

Subsequent to this communication, and without having received the necessary documentation
in order to prove the identity of the complaining party through any channel, on the 20th of
October 2021 Openbank receives a request for information from the AEPD
regarding the request for the right of access of the complaining party to which the
response dated October 29, 2021 where it provides, among other evidence,
copy of the response sent to the complaining party where it is reported that Openbank
has made your right of access available to you since the
identification functions in the AEPD. Likewise, the party is informed again
claimant of the channels through which the interested parties can exercise their
rights in terms of data protection, taking into account that, as of the date of
Openbank response has
moved its main establishment to Plaza de Santa Bárbara 2, 28004 Madrid
(Spain).
 
Attached as Annex II: Email sent by Openbank on October 29
of 2021.
 
As a consequence of said request, a new communication has been received
dated June 29, 2022, where, among other information, it is indicated that on date
August 31, 2021, this Agency has received from the data protection authority
German Brandenburg, among other documentation, "a copy of the letter, with
stamp appearance (two-dimensional barcode) of Deutsche Post with date of
November 30, 2020, addressed to “Open Bank S.A. in Paseo de la Castellana, 24 –
28046 – Madrid (SPANIEN), in which you indicate that you have chosen to send the data by
postal mail for security reasons and gives your email address as a reference
email and your IBAN. Attached to this copy is a copy of the identity document of the
claimant on both sides".

In this sense, it is reported that the Openbank office has confirmed that it does not have
proof of having received a letter whose sender is the complaining party.
Neither has the claimant provided an acknowledgment of receipt justifying the
delivery, nor has the evidence provided by the claiming party in the
claim filed and for these reasons Openbank has not responded to said
letter. As proof of this, the income received from the
date of the claim until the date of the beginning of this file.

Attached as Annex III: List of communications received by post whose
origin is Germany.

OPENBANK highlights that, without prejudice to the fact that it deals with the exercise of rights by
any channel that requests it, offers its clients the possibility of exercising the
right of access in an automated way directly from the private area of
customer. In this way, the user authentication will be carried out with the access key
to the private area (log in) without it being necessary for the Interested Parties to provide
additional documentation. This is reported in its Privacy Policy that is provided

Next, the detail of the steps to follow to request the right is shared
access automatically and autonomously from the private client area.

In light of all of the foregoing, OPENBANK considers that the article has not been violated
15 of the GDPR since the right of access has been made available to the
complaining party once it has been possible to sufficiently prove their identity and
that Openbank offers the possibility for interested parties to exercise their right to
access without the need to provide additional documentation, such as the telephone channel
where the identification is done with keys as well as through the web in the area
private client, as reported in the Privacy Policy that is sent to
Interested Parties after accepting it in the registration process as clients of the
Entity and that is published on its website. Therefore, taking into account that in
At no time was it sought to hinder the exercise of the right of access of the party
claimant but duly guarantee their identity to avoid any breach of
confidentiality in the treatment of your data that could cause access to the
personal data of the complaining party by an unidentified third party, requires this
Agency that resolves the administrative procedure without imposing a sanction against
Openbank since there is no record of having received the request for
right of access by letter and that as soon as the party could be identified
claimant, the information corresponding to his person has been delivered.

Unfortunately, they seem to have mixed things up when answering my

Thank you for your message.

Unfortunately, they seem to have mixed things up when answering my
ask.

I have sent you my aforementioned email, dated 11.18.2020, from my
email address registered with you in connection with my account
***EMAIL.1, see attached. Subsequently, in his email dated 11.30.2020, to

Since your FAX was very unreliable, I sent you this justification immediately by mail.

On 11.13.2020, I sent you a request for information on the control authority
corresponding in your case from my other email address, ***EMAIL.2.
However, this is irrelevant to my request for information.

I've been waiting a month in vain for an answer.

By the way, I can't contact you by phone, because the call is interrupted
immediately if I disagree with the recording.

the confidentiality of sensitive personal data is not guaranteed.

If necessary, provide an encrypted document upload medium on your

Dear ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for your email dated 30.11.2020 in response to my request for
information from 11.18.2020.

I am happy to send you a copy of my identity document. However,
I choose to send it by fax, since sending it by email does not guarantee protection
of sensitive data such as the identity document. Remember that the
identity verification does not extend the time to provide information.

I also want to expressly point out again that the unencrypted transmission of
sensitive personal data by email does not guarantee protection
of this data - you had already received my PGP key with my application
on November 18, 2020. If, contrary to expectations, I receive the information by
unencrypted email, I will inform the competent supervisory authority.

Yours sincerely"

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR,
the processing of personal data is recorded, since OPENBANK
carries out the collection of the following personal data of natural persons: name and
email, among other treatments.

OPENBANK carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller,
given that it is the one who determines the ends and means of such activity, by virtue of article
4.7 of the GDPR. In addition, it is a cross-border processing, since
OPENBANK is established in Spain, although it provides services to other countries in the
European Union.

The GDPR provides, in its article 56.1, for cases of cross-border processing,
provided for in its article 4.23), in relation to the competence of the authority of

Spain, so the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to
act as the main supervisory authority.

For its part, the right of access to personal data is regulated in article 15
of the GDPR.

Article 15 "Right of access of the interested party" of the GDPR establishes:

In the present case, it is clear that the complaining party had requested OPENBANK the
access to your personal data on November 18, 2020 by email
email without having attached a copy of your identity document, which was what
OPENBANK required to facilitate access to such data.

The claimant states that in these communications he requested access to his data
personal and provided a copy of his identity document and gave as
reference your email address and your IBAN account number.
