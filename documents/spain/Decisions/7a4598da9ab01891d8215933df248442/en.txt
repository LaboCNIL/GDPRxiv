FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I.- Competition

Is competent to resolve this Sanctioning Procedure, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection, by virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the
GDPR and arts. 47, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD Law.

II.- On the processing of personal data resulting from the situation arising from the
COVID-19 Virus Spread,

Given the public health emergency situation resulting from the extension of the
COVID19, the Spanish Agency for Data Protection prepared several documents in
related to it to respond to the doubts that arose with the situation that was
lived in the year 2020. Thus, the report of the Legal Office of the AEPD, with N/REF:
0017/2020 indicated, in this regard, the following:

“In the first place, in general, it should be clarified that the protection regulations
of personal data, while, aimed at safeguarding a fundamental right, it is
applies in its entirety to the current situation, since there is no reason
determine the suspension of fundamental rights, nor has said measure been
adopted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the GDPR itself contains the safeguards and rules
necessary to legitimately allow the processing of personal data in
situations, such as the epidemic, in which there is a health emergency of

28001 – Madrid

general. Therefore, when applying said precepts provided for these cases in the
GDPR, in accordance with the applicable sectoral regulations in the field of health
public information, considerations related to data protection -within the
limits provided by law - should not be used to hinder or limit the
effectiveness of the measures adopted by the authorities, especially health,
in the fight against the epidemic, since data protection regulations
contains a regulation for such cases that reconciles and weighs the
interests and rights at stake for the common good.

Recital (46) of the RGPD already recognizes that, in exceptional situations, such as
an epidemic, the legal basis for treatments can be multiple, based both on
the public interest, such as in the vital interest of the interested party or another natural person. (46) The
processing of personal data should also be considered lawful when it is
necessary to protect an interest essential to the life of the data subject or that of another
Physical person. In principle, personal data should only be processed on the basis of the
basis of the vital interest of another natural person when the treatment cannot be based
manifestly on a different legal basis.

Certain types of processing may serve both important reasons of interest
public as to the vital interests of the interested party, such as when the
treatment is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including the control of epidemics and their
spread, or in situations of humanitarian emergency, especially in case of
natural or man-made disasters.

Therefore, as a legal basis for lawful processing of personal data, without
Despite the fact that there may be other bases, such as the fulfillment of a
legal obligation, art. 6.1.c) RGPD, the Regulation explicitly recognizes the two
cited: mission carried out in the public interest (art. 6.1.e) or vital interests of the
interested party or other natural persons, (art. 6.1.d).

The art. 6.1, letter d) RGPD considers not only that the vital interest is a sufficient basis
legal nature of the processing to protect the “data subject” (insofar as this is a term
defined in art. 4.1) RGPD as an identified or identifiable natural person), but
said legal basis can be used to protect the vital interests “of another
natural person”, which by extension means that said natural persons can be
even unidentified or identifiable; that is, said legal basis for the treatment (the
vital interest) may be sufficient for the processing of personal data aimed at
protect all those people susceptible to being infected in the spread
of an epidemic, which would justify, from the point of view of data processing
personal information, in the widest possible way, the measures adopted for this purpose,
even if they are aimed at protecting unnamed people or in principle not
identified or identifiable, since the vital interests of said persons
must be safeguarded, and this is recognized by the regulations of
personal data protection.

Section 3 of article 6 GDPR does not establish the need for the basis of the
treatment for reasons of vital interest must be established by the Law of the
Union or the Law of the Member States applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment, since this section refers exclusively to the treatments
established for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, or for the fulfillment of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/11

a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers, both
referred to in letters c) and e) of said article 6 RGPD, but not for the treatments
included in letter d). c. However, for the treatment of health data it is not enough
with the existence of a legal basis of art. 6 GDPR, but in accordance with art. 9.1 and
9.2 RGPD there is a circumstance that lifts the prohibition of treatment of said
special category of data (including health data).

(...) In a health emergency situation such as the one referred to in the request for
this report, it is necessary to bear in mind that, in the exclusive scope of the
of protection of personal data, the application of the regulation of protection of
personal data would allow the data controller to adopt those decisions
that are necessary to safeguard the vital interests of natural persons, the
compliance with legal obligations or the safeguarding of essential interests in the
field of public health, within the provisions of the applicable material regulations.

What these decisions are, (from the point of view of the protection regulations
of personal data, it is reiterated) will be those that those responsible for the
data processing must adopt according to the situation in which they find themselves,
always aimed at safeguarding the essential interests already so reiterated. But the
data controllers, as they are acting to safeguard said interests,
must act in accordance with what the authorities established in the regulations of the
corresponding Member State, in this case Spain, establish.

Thus, the Spanish legislator has provided itself with the necessary and timely legal measures
to deal with situations of health risk, such as Organic Law 3/1986, of
April 14, of Special Measures in the Matter of Public Health (modified by
Royal Decree-Law 6/2020, of March 10, which adopts certain
urgent measures in the economic field and for the protection of public health,
published in the Official State Gazette of March 11, 2020) or Law 33/2011,
of October 4, General of Public Health.

Article 3 of the first of these regulations states that: [i]n order to control the
communicable diseases, the health authority, in addition to carrying out the actions
general preventive measures, may adopt the appropriate measures to control the
sick, people who are or have been in contact with them and
of the immediate environment, as well as those considered necessary in case of
transmissible risk. Similarly, articles 5 and 84 of the Law
33/2011, of October 4, General of Public Health refer to the previous Law
organic 3/1986, and the possibility of adopting additional measures in case of risk
of disease transmission.

Therefore, in terms of risk of disease transmission, epidemic, crisis
etc., the applicable regulations have granted "the health authorities of the
different Public Administrations” (art. 1 Organic Law 3/1986, of April 14) the
powers to adopt the necessary measures provided for in said laws when
so required by health reasons of urgency or necessity. Consequently, from a
point of view of processing personal data, the safeguarding of interests
essential in the field of public health corresponds to the different authorities
health authorities of the different public administrations, who may adopt the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/11

measures necessary to safeguard such essential public interests in
public health emergency situations.

These competent health authorities of the different administrations will be
public authorities who must adopt the necessary decisions, and the different
responsible for the processing of personal data must follow these
instructions, even when this involves the processing of personal data of
health of natural persons. The foregoing refers expressly to the possibility
to treat the personal health data of certain natural persons for the
responsible for processing personal data, when, by indication of the
competent health authorities, it is necessary to communicate to other people with whom
that said natural person has been in contact with the circumstance of contagion,
to safeguard both these natural persons from the possibility of contagion
(vital interests of the same) as to prevent said natural persons, for
ignorance of their contact with an infected person can spread the disease to
other third parties (vital interests of third parties and essential and/or qualified public interest
in the field of public health).

However, the processing of personal data in these emergency situations
health, as mentioned at the beginning of this report, continue to be treated
in accordance with the personal data protection regulations (RGPD and Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights, LOPDGDD), so all its principles apply,
contained in article 5 RGPD, and among them that of data processing
personal with legality, loyalty and transparency, of limitation of the purpose (in this
case, safeguard the vital/essential interests of natural persons), principle
accuracy, and of course, and special emphasis must be placed on it, the principle of
data minimization.

Regarding this last aspect, express reference must be made to the fact that the data processed
shall be exclusively those limited to those necessary for the purpose
intended, without this treatment being able to be extended to any other data
personal data not strictly necessary for said purpose, without being able to
confuse convenience with necessity, because the fundamental right to
data protection continues to be applied normally, notwithstanding that, as
has said, the personal data protection regulations themselves establish that in
emergency situations, for the protection of essential health interests
public and/or vital data of natural persons, the health data may be processed
necessary to prevent the spread of the disease that has caused the
health emergency.

Regarding the principle of limitation of the purpose in relation to cases of
processing of health data for reasons of public interest, Recital (54)
RGPD is clear, when it establishes that: The treatment of special categories of
personal data, without the consent of the interested party, it may be necessary for
reasons of public interest in the field of public health. That treatment must be
subject to appropriate and specific measures in order to protect the rights and freedoms
of natural persons. […] This processing of data related to health for reasons
of public interest must not give rise to third parties, such as entrepreneurs,
insurance or banking entities, treat personal data for other purposes.

III.- Regarding the excessive collection of personal data to be able to access the pool of
the community of neighbors:

In the present case, the claimant states that, after refusing to present the DNI
to access the swimming pool of his community because he considered that it was excessive
present the DNI to the security guard, because being the owner, with a seniority of more than 15
years, was sufficiently identified. who contacted the president
of the community to denounce the case to which he told him that it was mandatory,
to access the premises, present the DNI and that there was a law of the Ministry of
Health that was well above the Data Protection Law, since, if
If there is an outbreak of covid19, the Ministry forces you to request the DNI to be able to later
locate neighbors in case of contagion.

Regarding the excessive use of personal data, recital 39 of the RGPD
establishes that: “(…) All personal data processing must be
adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are
treated. This requires, in particular, ensuring that their use is limited to a strict minimum.
conservation period. Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing
treatment could not reasonably be achieved by other means. To ensure that
personal data is not kept longer than necessary, the person responsible for the
treatment must establish deadlines for its suppression or periodic review. must
take all reasonable steps to ensure that they are rectified or deleted
personal data that is inaccurate. Personal data must be treated in a
way that guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of the data
including to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data and
of the equipment used in the treatment.

For its part, article 5.1.c) of the RGPD establishes the Principles related to the
treatment, indicating in this regard that: “Personal data will be adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed (“data minimization”);

Well, although in the pandemic situation that was experienced in 2020, the
competent health authorities adopted the necessary measures to stop the
pandemic, and therefore, the different data controllers
personnel had to follow these instructions, even when it meant a
processing of personal health data, if necessary
communicate to other people a possible outbreak in their environment with the aim of
safeguard the health of all, the fact of requesting the personal data included in the
DNI of the claimant, is excessive for the purposes for which they were intended,
because being the owner of a home in the community with an age of more than
15 years old, was sufficiently identified even, only with the indication
of the portal, floor and letter, for example.

Therefore, the exposed facts are clearly constitutive of an infraction,
attributable to the claimed party, for violation of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, by
request the claimant more personal data than is strictly necessary for the
end that was pursued.

In this sense, article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD typifies, for prescription purposes,
as "very serious", the: "treatment of personal data violating the principles and
guarantees established in article 5 of the RGPD”.

This infraction may be sanctioned according to the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the
RGPD, where it is established that: “Infringements of the following provisions are

Regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the
RGPD, allows you to set a penalty of 3,000 euros, (three thousand euros).

IV.- Regarding the lack of information provided to the users of the swimming pool when
asked for the DNI to access the community pool:

According to the claimant, when the owners accessed the community pool and
presented their ID, the security guard noted the personal data of the
person who accessed a blank sheet of paper in view of all, there being no
document together with the security guard that informs about the treatment of the data
personal. Nor were users of the facility informed about the management
which would subsequently be carried out with the personal data obtained from the DNI.

Regarding the information that the person responsible for the processing of personal data
must be provided to the interested parties when they obtain their personal data, the
Article 13 of the RGPD, establishes the following:

"1. When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide you with:

a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, of their
representative;

b) the contact details of the data protection delegate, if any;

adequate or appropriate warranties and the means to obtain a copy of these or
to the fact that they have been borrowed.

2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the data is obtained
personal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
fair and transparent

a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this period;

 b) the existence of the right to request from the data controller access to the
personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation
of its treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability
of the data;

c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or article
9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to its withdrawal;

d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;

e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a
necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to provide
personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not

f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to which
referred to in article 22, sections 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, information
about applied logic, as well as the importance and consequences

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the known facts constitute a
infraction, attributable to the claimed, for violation of article 13 of the RGPD, by not
