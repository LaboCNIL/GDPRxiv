In accordance with the evidence available in this
disciplinary procedure, it is considered that the two posters installed outside
of the premises of the accused, under the heading "area monitored by security cameras",
they lack the mandatory information required by the GDPR. Well, analyzed the
photographs provided by the defendant together with the allegations to the opening agreement,
it was observed that the only data that the badges contain are the following:

-

-

-

"Responsible": Mae West Systems, S.L.

"You can exercise your rights before": empty.

“More information…”: B.70497169

Thus, none of the posters includes all the information required by the
regulations, having to inform about the identity of the person in charge, not only his
name, but also address; the possibility of exercising the rights recognized in
Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR and through which channel, as well as where you can obtain the
interested party the rest of the information required in accordance with the GDPR.

that there is a violation of article 13 of the GDPR.
