“The company BURWEBS S.L., is the owner of different domains in
internet, created with adult content. I understand that reference is made
to one of our web pages, and at this moment we do not know exactly
to which page or domain the Control Authority refers that may fail to comply.
We would need more accuracy to be able to provide more information about
what you request in your letter.

In any case, and in a general way, it should be noted that BURWEBS S.L. does not treat
personal data of minors. 2.- In relation to the commercial
BURWEBS S.L. We only process personal data, in a
specific section "register for free", and to access a username is requested.
USER and PASSWORD, and a MAIL. In order to have access to that
specific section, a form is used to collect basic data from
contact. Not requesting in our data collection forms, any
Sensitive data that can be framed in Art. 9 of GDPR 679/2016.

The link to the web page that includes the section register for free is at https://

cookies policy what they do is an analysis of the visits we receive,
mainly where users browse our pages. Our
business and so we say it is the advertising that they insert on our websites
brands in the adult website market.

The company BURWEBS S.L., has my advice as Delegate of
Data protection, and with a department formed and in charge of supervising
that all our websites provide adequate information and comply with it,
reporting both adult content and the obligation to have more than
18 years.

There is an affirmative click, noting that the website is only for
adults, informing that to enter it is mandatory to have at least
18 years of age and the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you are located, all
this with the purpose of putting an entry barrier in a web of content
for adults.

At the time, it was decided to implement said measure as a control measure
of access or at least notify through this measure that the content is
for adults. We refer even in writing saying "you have to have
more than 18 years to see it ", on our websites, just as we warn that everything
what appears on the website is made by professionals (actors and
actresses) and that they are all over 18 years of age. Fact that we collect in each
one of the contracts we have to record the movies.
Regardless of the mandatory click to enter.

In the case of our website that we have used to answer this letter,
Although the rest are the same way, we post videos from other production companies
with which we have agreements for the exhibition of these, and in no case,
No member data is transferred to these producers, nor are they in charge of the
treatment of these.

In relation to your requirement in POINT TWO AND THREE, at the time
the information that was collected and processed automatically in the
MEMBERS section, and of course, it was verified in relation to the
need to carry out a PIA or EIPD, in relation to the data that
we tried

We thought convenient that the information we stored did not justify the
have an obligation to carry out a DPIA. What if it was done, as indicated by the
legislation on data protection, was a risk analysis in relation to
with privacy and data management and always in relation to obtaining,
treatment, conservation of the data that we attach to you in a document
apart.

DOCUMENT Nº 1 RISK ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER DATA
MEMBERS In relation to the RISK OF ACCESS BY MINORS in
our web pages: At the time, we saw that it could be a problem, but
a problem that should not be in our purview. The Code was analyzed
Civil, and the control that our entity could have over the acts of minors
of age to connect to our website, reaching the conclusion that the
The most drastic and effective measure to take in Spain was to use the electronic DNI
to access web pages, but this a priori effective and possible solution of
implement to all the people who connect to our websites, it is
impossible to implement for several reasons: a) The people who connect
They are not all located in Spain in countries that lack this system of
valid identification. b) In Spain (if we limit ourselves to people who access
from Spain) the possession and use of the DNI is mandatory from the age of 14.

For what was decided at the time, how could it be otherwise, that
according to art. 1903 of the CC, in relation to the responsibility belongs to the
persons who hold parental authority, since they are minors.
We believed that we could not take a risk that we could not control
that the risk was assumable by implementing a control system by our
part where it is remembered that the pages were for adults and have
a banner indicating if the user is older or younger.

Just as minors cannot (by legal capacity) contract a service
of the internet, nor be responsible for what our limitation does, according to
our risk analysis remains at the moment when the parents have a
duty of vigilance and responsibility for what minors do. Art.
154 and 269 of the Civil Code, there is a Responsibility In vigilando being able to
implement in use applications specifically aimed at children that prevent
for the minor to access other types of applications or any of the applications

operators, telephone operators and other companies, such as time control

of device use, blocking access to applications, control of time of
use by application, control of activity in social networks, remote management for
parents and even GPS location of the child.

As an alternative to parental control applications, there are other
Tools that allow you to prevent access to inappropriate content by
the configuration of DNS servers that will filter and not resolve those
requests that may direct the minor to this type of content. Therefore,
We understood at the time that the formula is for parents to apply a
PARENTAL CONTROL, as the AEPD itself, recommends in its
publication "DATA PROTECTION OF THE MINOR ON THE INTERNET" is a
element that makes our risk to these events decrease.

We do not advertise in media, other than for adults, our web pages
content for adults, so it is difficult for regular search engines
of use by minors are announced, if it is not accessed voluntarily.

We deliver the POLICY in a separate document as DOCUMENT Nº 2
OF PRIVACY OF OUR WEBSITE. 6.- In response to your
requirement in point No. 6, and as we have explained in point No. 1,
We indicate again that we have proceeded to hold a meeting between the
Delegate of Data Protection, the Management of the company and the Director of
programming, where the result of it has been to carry out
immediately a check of all web pages owned by the
business affected, to correct the barriers that were agreed to incorporate
in order to protect a minor from accessing adult content.

We have taken from the Guide AEPD sends us ideas such as those
exposed in it, and that it can be a more robust solution to what
we have implemented. Like the YOTI tool that seems like the most
adequate.

In any case, understanding the business is vital to understanding why it is not
that tool implemented. If you need an extension of the
information required, let us know so that we can provide it and be able to
solve this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible.

FIFTH: On 01/12/22, by the Board of Directors of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, the sanctioning procedure against the entity BURWEBS S.L begins,
when appreciating reasonable indications of violation of articles 6.1 GDPR and 22.2 LSSI.

SIXTH: Notification of the agreement to initiate the sanctioning file to the entity
investigated on 01/16/22, the latter by means of a letter dated 01/30/22 formulated, in summary,
the following allegations:

"1.- That effectively and seeing the statement that the Agency notifies us, and
verifying the errors committed that the Inspection shows us, we have
verified that we do indeed have a form with the acceptance
premarked. Therefore, as it cannot be otherwise, we have proceeded to
rectify it immediately, to avoid that we can be imputed in the future
any matter related to obtaining consent in an irregular manner.

2.- In relation to cookies, and the installation of systems that allow granting
or reject the consent prior to the installation of the same, and to the
maybe we have a banner that allows us to give information about the installation
of cookies on the person's computer, we can say little, the Inspection
clearly he is right in his arguments, and the only thing and before we
urge to comply with the legislation, and in order to be able to reduce the sanctions
As much as possible, we indicate that we have proceeded to correct this fact,
placing those banners where they correspond with the functions described by the
statement of the Inspectorate of the Data Protection Agency. Whereby,
We understand that we have complied with the requirement.

28001 – Madrid

7/76

3.- Of course, and having as reference the art. 58.2 of the GDPR, and in the
power that the Agency in its functions has to be able to require the measures
corrective measures, indicate that we have corrected the deficiencies that the
Agency has found when inspecting our website, always with the
purpose of improving what already exists and fleeing quickly from a controversy that
does not help prosper in regulatory compliance. Also, and in the box
which should be blank for people to express their
consent in the data forms, we have proceeded to leave it without
premark.

4.- Indicate, finally, that in relation to the sanctions proposed by the
Agency, they seem excessive to us, not for the amounts that we know could
even be older, if not, because Burwebs S.L. is a small company, without
personal and, therefore, we believe that even having made mistakes, that
we recognize, they have never been produced intentionally or economically,
nor with the will to commit them. In addition, we have corrected them immediately
without the Agency having intervened requiring that rectification.
Pursuant to art. 58 of the GDPR, and within the powers of the Agency,
In order for the Data Controller to comply with
or cease certain behaviors of the latter, it should be noted that, in this case, and for
part of the company, every effort has been made to try to meet
strict with what the regulations impose on us as Responsible.

For all these reasons, we request that the Agency within its power of art. 58, 2
of the GDPR, and seeing everything done by the company as an attitude
proactive, can impose a collected sanction such as the
WARNING, a fact that made it not so
affected in the payment of a high amount of money that could jeopardize
the economy of it. In addition, I think we should take into account the fact
also favorable of never having been penalized. We understand that
may be a reasonable request, in a tight application of the principle of
proportionality, a general principle of public law that upholds the
requirement that any action by the public authorities limiting or
restrictive of rights responds to the criteria of necessity and adequacy to the
end pursued. In a stricter sense, it represents the existence of a
due adjustment between the seriousness of the act constituting the offense and the
sanction applied that can be considered in its normative aspect or in its
application aspect by the Administration or the Courts.

The principle of proportionality has been treated in jurisprudence as a
important mechanism of control before the Courts of the exercise of the
disciplinary power of the Administration when the norm establishes for
an infraction several possible sanctions or indicates a quantitative margin for
setting the sanction imposed. In fact, both in the previous Law 30/1992
As in the current Law 40/2015, such principle is included as one of the
informants of the sanctioning power of the Administration in its aspect
regulations and application. Regarding the discretion of the Administration in
the graduation of the sanction, it should be taken into account that, although the
Administration may use some discretion in grading

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/76

the sanction to accommodate it to the set of concurrent circumstances in the
infringement, it is no less true that the principle of proportionality is
subject to judicial control.

The discretion granted to the Administration must be developed
weighing in any case the concurrent circumstances in order to achieve
the necessary and due proportionality between the alleged facts and the
responsibility required, given that any sanction must be determined in
consistency with the entity of the offense committed and according to a criterion of
proportionality considering the objective circumstances of the fact,
proportionality that constitutes a normative principle that is imposed as a
precept more to the Administration and that reduces the scope of its powers
sanctioning, since to the jurisdictional activity corresponds not only the
qualification to subsume the conduct in the legal type, but also to adapt the
sanction for the act committed, since in both cases the subject is the application
of legal evaluative criteria embodied in the written norm, as they are in
this sanctioning field, those of congruence and proportionality between the
infraction and the sanction, which must be taken into consideration for that
Agency, in view of the concurrent circumstances, described”.

SEVENTH: On 03/12/22, this Agency carried out the procedures
pertinent in order to verify if, as stated in the allegations
presented by the entity to the agreement to start the sanctioning procedure will be
they had corrected the detected irregularities, obtaining the following results

And, in relation to the duration of the treatment of the data of registered users

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

I.- Competition:

 

- About the GDPR:

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.

It is competent to resolve this Disciplinary Procedure, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency, in accordance with the provisions of art.
43.1, second paragraph, of the LSSI Law.

II.- Processing of personal data.

Article 4 of the GDPR, under the heading "Definitions", provides the following:

“1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in
by means of an identifier, such as a name, a number
identification, location data, an online identifier, or one or more
elements of physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,
economic, cultural or social of said person;

2) "processing": any operation or set of operations carried out on
about personal data or sets of personal data, either by means of
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structure-
tion, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction”.

7) "responsible for the treatment" or "responsible": the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines
undermine the purposes and means of processing; if the Law of the Union or of the States
States members determine the purposes and means of processing, the controller
of the treatment or the specific criteria for its appointment may establish
the law of the Union or of the Member States"

In this case, it is clear that BURWEBS S.L. is responsible for the processing
data records referred to in the proven facts of the disciplinary procedure,
since, according to the definition of article 4.7 of the GDPR, it is the one that determines the
purpose and means of the processing carried out for the purposes indicated in its
Privacy Policy.

The entity BURWEBS S.L. indicates in his letter dated 07/12/2022, answering the
information requirement derived from the test process, which is not collected and
save personal data through the website: https://***URL.1.

This is an obvious contradiction with reality:

In the first place, because it admits in that same letter that the IP of the person who accesses it is collected.
yields to the web page (in open) and the IP and the name and email address of those who
are registered in it. It also admits that the data is processed to generate a
tab -the user profile- to be able to add videos and comment on them with other people
nas.

To this we must add that, as proven by proven facts, the
user profile contains more personal data than the user's name, as it per-

28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

allows sharing with the rest of the members the location, sex, age, tastes
through comments and image and voice.

In addition, in the privacy policy they refer, they indicate, "on the data that is
keep”, to that “The data that we keep are those merely collected in the
forms that are available on the web page such as contact information (basic character-
co), such as name, surname, e-mail, telephone, etc. …. Sometimes we collect
browsing data, such as IP data, Wi-Fi, etc.”.

Second, because they are all personal data, despite the fact that the entity
expressly deny that the IP is.

Specifically, and with respect to the IP, it is uncontroversial that we are dealing with data
of a personal nature as it has been considered by the AEPD through its
Reports of your Legal Office 327/2003 or of March 1, 2007 or widely
by jurisprudence (for all, Judgment of the Supreme Court of 16/2014 of 30
January or October 3, 2014 or Judgment of the National Court of September 1,
September 2011 or Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of October 19,
October 2016, case C-582/14).

Finally, we must indicate that, however, the entity asserts in its writ of
04/26/2021 responding to the requirement made by the AEPD that it is mandatory to be
of legal age to enter and use the website - "...informing both the content
adult, such as the obligation to be over 18 years of age. It also has a cli-

of age in the jurisdiction in which you are, all with the purpose of putting
a barrier to the fact of entering a website with adult content"- and that
In general, they do not process personal data of minors, the truth is that it is not
You can affirm that you do not process personal data of minors.

Especially when in its privacy policy it states so by referring to
reference to the fact that "it is prohibited for minors under 14 years of age to put the data in our
data collection forms, since it is contrary to art. 8 GDPR, in case of
need the consent of a minor, you must give it and therefore collect data from
the person who holds the Parental Authority and/or guardianship of the minor”.

In conclusion, the entity BURWEBS S.L. as data controller performs a
processing of personal data through its website https://***URL.1, both
adults and minors.

III.- On the lack of loyalty and transparency.

Article 5.1.a) of the GDPR provides that "Personal data will be: a) processed
lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, loyalty and transfer-
appearance»);».

Recital 38 of the GDPR on loyalty and transparency determines that:

“All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For the people

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

33/76

Physical data must be made completely clear that they are collecting, using, con-
revealing or otherwise processing personal data concerning them, as well
as the extent to which said data is or will be processed. The principle of
Transparency requires that all information and communication relating to treatment
of such data is readily accessible and easy to understand, and is used
simple and clear language. This principle refers in particular to information
information of the interested parties on the identity of the person responsible for the treatment and the
purposes of this and to the added information to guarantee a fair treatment and
transparent with respect to the natural persons affected and their right to
obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them
nan that they are the object of treatment”.

Likewise, recital 60 of the GDPR states that.

“The principles of fair and transparent treatment require that the interested party be informed
informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The responsible-
The data controller must provide the interested party with all the complementary information
necessary to guarantee fair and transparent treatment, given
account of the specific circumstances and context in which the data is processed.
personal coughs”.

Article 12 of the GDPR establishes how the transparency of information is articulated
and the communication to the interested party. And articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR specify the information
specific information that must be provided to the interested party to guarantee loyalty and
transparency.

The principle of transparency is not exhausted in the material concretion of supplying the information
formation of articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, under the terms of article 12 of the GDPR
and 11 of the LOPDGDD.
 
The principle of transparency established in article 5.1.a) of the GDPR is much more and has
ne entity in itself. Linked to the principle of loyalty, it implies effective knowledge
of the precise information on the part of the interested parties that redounds in the power of dis-
position and control that the interested parties have regarding the processing of their data
personal, in the terms provided in the Constitutional Court Judgment
292/2000, of November 30, 2000: "Luckily, without the guarantee that the
right to appropriate information by fulfilling certain requirements
legal requirements (art. 5 L.O.P.D.) would undoubtedly frustrate the right of the interested party
to control and dispose of your personal data, since it is clear that they would prevent you from exercising
other faculties that are integrated into the content of the fundamental right to which
we are referring to”.

In this sense, the Guidelines of the Article 29 Working Group on transparency
reference under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on November 29,
2017 and last revised and adopted on April 11, 2018 (WP 260) prevent
that “10. A fundamental consideration of the principle of transparency outlined in
these provisions is that the interested party must be able to determine in advance the scope
ce and the consequences derived from the treatment, and that you should not be surprised in
a later moment for the use that has been given to your personal data. It is, thus-
same, of an important aspect of the principle of loyalty under article 5, par-
Clause 1 of the GDPR and, indeed, it is related to recital 39…”.
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

34/76

It is useless to formally provide the information required in the articles
13 and 14 of the GDPR if this does not agree with the reality of the treatment established in the re-
record of processing activities or if the information is contradictory, obscure and
does not allow interested parties to really know what the treatment of their
personal information.

Regarding loyalty, CEPD Guidelines 4/2019 related to article 25 Protection
tion of data from the design and by default, adopted on October 20, 2020 dis-
they put that “69. Loyalty is a general principle that requires that personal data
are not treated in a manner that is unreasonably prejudicial, unlawfully discriminatory, unfairly
permissible or misleading for the interested party”. They continue to establish a manifestation of loyalty
will be that "The interested parties must have the maximum degree of autonomy possible
to determine the use made of your personal data, as well as the scope and
conditions of said use or treatment (…) The treatment must correspond to
the reasonable expectations of the interested parties (...) The data controller does not
will abuse the needs or vulnerabilities of the data subjects. (...) The person in charge
ble should not “force” the choice of its users unfairly (…) Those responsible
The data controllers must not transfer the risks of the company to the data subjects.
(...) The information and options for the processing of personal data must provide
act objectively and neutrally, avoiding any kind of language or deceptive design.
mischievous or manipulative (...) The person in charge must appreciate the general effects that
the treatment on the rights and dignity of people. (…)  The responsible
must make available to the interested party the information related to the way in which
personal data are processed, you must act as you have stated that you will, and
not mislead the interested party”.

Thus, first of all, we can observe a clear inconsistency between the content of the
registration of the treatment activities of the clients (of the users not registered).

AEPD on 07/12/22) and the information provided to interested parties through the policy

In relation to the transfer of data, while in the registration of activities
of the treatment of unregistered users and in the registration of the activities of the
treatment of registered users is recorded with respect to the "RECIPIENTS OF
TRANSFER OF DATA" that

"There is no transfer of data, except by legal mandate or exercise of the power
of the courts. State security forces and bodies, in cases of co-
collaboration with them to control crimes in the network”.

However, in the privacy policy it is stated regarding the recipients of the
transfers of data that

“Companies of the same group.
No data will be transferred unless it is necessary to comply with the pres-
requested ration.
No data will be transferred except by legal mandate.

As we can see, what is related to the transfer of personal data is not coincidental.
between the registration of processing activities and the privacy policy,
the latter comprising many more transfers of data not included in the registry
of the processing activities.

While the registration of treatment activities, transfers are prohibited
except legal mandate or collaboration with justice, in the privacy policy it is

To the above we must also add the contradiction regarding the transfers of data
in the privacy policy itself, because although it is stated that data will not be transferred
except by legal mandate, transfers to companies of the same group are foreseen (without determining

service requested), for tax and accounting advice in case of purchase through the
website and transport companies to deliver the purchases made.

On the other hand, there is also vagueness, a lack of specificity and transparency regarding
of the personal data processed and the information provided for this purpose to the users.
rivers.

We will indicate that article 30.1 of the GDPR provides, regarding the content of the registry
of the processing activities the obligation to include on the part of the person in charge
of the treatment "c) a description of the categories of interested parties and of the categories
streams of personal data”.

Neither in the registration of the treatment activities of unregistered users nor in
the registration of the treatment activities of registered users is understood

The entity BURWEBS, S.L. limits itself in its brief of 07/12/2022 to asserting that it

In view of the content of the privacy policy we can see how there are no differences between

However, it is proven by the assertions of BURWEBS, S.L. that

On the other hand, the privacy policy informs the user that a se-

In addition, it is not specifically informed of other personal data that is collected and

Furthermore, it should be noted that, in the privacy policy, when making
mention of the personal data that is collected and stored is used by two
times the abbreviation “etc.” as to their significance. This redounds again
in the lack of loyalty and transparency.

And that, regarding the collection of the IP data, which the company admits is collected
always, the privacy policy clarifies that it is "sometimes", without making explicit to the
users, registered or not, what are those occasions.

However, in the privacy policy, in addition to the fact that it does not differentiate between users
registered and unregistered, in the "basic information on data protection file-
client data collection", in the "Intended purpose" is limited to the "Management of personal data"
introduced in the data collection forms of the web page”.

As we can verify, in addition to the fact that the purpose of the record does not coincide
of the treatment activities with what is stated in the privacy policy, there is
a great vagueness as to what the purpose of the treatment consists of, since the
“management” itself does not determine what the personal data is processed for, since
All processing includes personal data management.

Especially if through the letter of 07/12/2022 that the entity BURWEBS, S.L. refers to
the AEPD briefly explains that "In the case of registration data, the
data solely and exclusively to access and be a member of "the community", generate-

At this moment we simply have to point out that the lack of loyalty and trans-

registered, who do not receive the information in a fair and transparent manner.

In conclusion, the performance of the entity BURWEBS, S.L. lacks loyalty and trans-
transparency, since the information supplied to the interested parties through the policy
Privacy policy of the web page does not correspond to the treatment really
effected. Loyalty and transparency imply that the interested party is perfectly
aware that the processing of your personal data is taking place, with
what purposes and in what way.

For this reason, and in accordance with the evidence presented, the aforementioned facts presuppose
a violation of the provisions of article 5.1.a), which gives rise to the application of the
corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

IV.- Violation

The facts exposed do not comply with the provisions of article 5.1.a) of the GDPR, with the
scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which implies the
commission of an offense classified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which under the
section "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines" provides
the following: “5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, according to
accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000.
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4%
of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting
for the highest amount:

ment according to articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72.1.a) considers as an infraction "very
serious” for prescription purposes “1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years
the infractions that suppose a substantial infringement of the articles
mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

V.- On the limitation of the purpose.

Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data will be "collected with
specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be further treated in a manner
incompatible with said purposes; Pursuant to Article 89 Paragraph 1, the processing
further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, research purposes
scientific and historical research or statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with
the initial purposes ("purpose limitation")".

The purpose limitation principle requires that personal data be collected
both for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes.

Thus, the purposes must be perfectly identified so that the interested party
can determine if the treatment carried out by the person in charge is within such fi-
purposes.

In addition, and linked to transparency, the fact that the purposes are explicit means that the
affected understands what these are, in order to maintain real control over their
personal data and can effectively exercise their rights. To understand which
is the explicit purpose, this must be revealed to the interested party.

Without forgetting that the purposes have to be legitimate, that is, as permitted
by the legal system.

In this sense, Opinion 3/2013 of the Working Group of the Article
29, adopted on April 2, 2013, on purpose limitation.

From all this it can be inferred that personal data processing cannot be carried out
because they may be useful in the future to the data controller. They have to be
linked to the determined, explicit and legitimate current purposes of the same and
about their own treatments.

The entity BURWEBS, S.L. provided in its privacy policy, in relation to the
"recipients of data transfers" that will be transferred for "tax and accounting advice
(in case of purchase through the web)”.

This shows that the person responsible for the treatment carries out a treatment of

In conclusion, everything made explicit supposes a violation of the principle of limitation of

aforementioned Regulation grants the AEPD.

VI.- Violation.

The processing of personal data in accordance with an external purpose, not made explicit to the
interested and willing with the intention of using the data as long as
may be required in the future, fails to comply with the provisions of article 5.1.b) of the
GDPR, with the scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which
supposes the commission of an infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which
under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines"
provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000.

maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the preceding financial year
rior, opting for the one with the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9”.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72.1.a) considers as an infraction "very
serious” for prescription purposes

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the
offenses involving a substantial violation of the articles
mentioned therein and, in particular, the following: a) The treatment of
personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in the
Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

VII.- Conservation of personal data.

Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR establishes that:

"Personal data will be: e) maintained in a way that allows identification;
cation of the interested parties for no longer than necessary for the purposes
of the processing of personal data; personal data may be kept
be stored for longer periods as long as they are treated exclusively with
archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes, in accordance with article 89, paragraph 1, without prejudice
of the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures that impo-
defines this Regulation in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the

when these purposes have been fulfilled.

Adds recital 39 that: "To ensure that personal data is not con-

From all this it can be inferred that the indefinite maintenance of
the personal data of a data subject.

However, the entity BURWEBS, S.L. states in his brief of 07/12/2022, he answered
Based on the requirement of proof made by the AEPD, and in relation to the data

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 72.1.a) considers as an infraction "very
serious” for prescription purposes “1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years
the infractions that suppose a substantial infringement of the articles

violating the principles and guarantees established in article 5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

IX.- Lack of information to the interested party about the revocation of consent, about the
right to file a claim with the supervisory authority and regarding the period of

conservation of data of registered users.

Article 13 of the GDPR establishes what information must be provided when
the personal data is obtained from the interested party,

"1. When personal data relating to him or her is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time they are obtained, will provide you with

to, as well as the right to data portability;
c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter
a), or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw
consent at any time, without affecting the legality
of the treatment based on the consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to file a claim with a control authority;
e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or con-
contractual, or a necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the inter-
resado is obliged to provide personal data and is informed of
the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f) the existence of automated decisions, including the elaboration of
profiles, referred to in article 22, sections 1 and 4, and, at least in
such cases, significant information about the applied logic, as well as
the significance and expected consequences of such processing for
the interested.

3. When the controller plans the subsequent processing of data
personal items for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, provided
provide the interested party, prior to said subsequent processing, information
about that other purpose and any additional information pertinent under paragraph
tado 2.

4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in
to the extent that the interested party already has the information”.

Article 6 of the GDPR provides that:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions: a) the interested party gave his consent for the treatment of his
personal data for one or more specific purposes”.

Regarding the conditions for consent, article 7.3 of the GDPR establishes

to. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to its withdrawal. Before giving consent, the interested party
will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it.

Thus, article 13.2.c) of the GDPR obliges the data controller to provide information

claim before a control authority, an issue that does not appear in any section
of the privacy policy.

In addition, art. 13.2.a) of the GDPR requires that the person responsible inform the interested party about

In the privacy policy and respect for the conservation period, it only appears in the

In conclusion, the performance of the entity BURWEBS, S.L. by not supplying all the information

The rights of individuals regarding the protection of personal data are re-
regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR and 13 to 18 of the LOPDGDD. are contemplated
the rights of access, rectification, deletion, opposition, right to limitation of the
treatment and right to portability.

The formal aspects related to the exercise of these rights are established in the articles
Articles 12 of the GDPR and 12 of the LOPDGDD.

Article 12 "Transparency of information, communication and modalities of
exercise of rights" of the GDPR establishes the following:

"1. The person in charge of the treatment will take the appropriate measures to facilitate
to the interested party all the information indicated in articles 13 and 14, as well as
any communication pursuant to articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the
treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, with a
clear and simple language, in particular any information directed
specifically a child. The information will be provided in writing or by other
means, including, if applicable, by electronic means. When requested by the
interested party, the information may be provided verbally provided that
prove the identity of the data subject by other means.

2. The data controller will provide the interested party with the exercise of their
rights under articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in the
article 11.2, the person in charge will not refuse to act at the request of the interested party
in order to exercise your rights under articles 15 to 22, unless
can demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the interested party.

3. The person responsible for the treatment will provide the interested party with information regarding
its actions on the basis of a request under articles 15 to
22, and, in any case, within one month from receipt of the
application. This period may be extended by another two months if necessary,
taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The responsible

5. The information provided under articles 13 and 14 as well as any
communication and any action carried out under articles 15 to 22
and 34 will be free of charge. When the requests are manifestly
unfounded or excessive, especially due to its repetitive nature, the
responsible for the treatment may: a) charge a reasonable fee based on

8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance
with article 92 in order to specify the information to be submitted to
through icons and the procedures for providing standardized icons”.

For its part, article 12 “General provisions on the exercise of rights”
of the LOPDGDD, in its sections 2 and 4, adds the following:

"2. The person in charge of the treatment will be obliged to inform the affected party about the methods

From the foregoing it can be deduced that the request for the exercise of rights made by the
interested party must be answered in any case, with the person responsible for the proof
ba of the fulfillment of this duty.

This obligation to act is not enforceable when the data controller
can demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the interested party (in cases
referred to in article 11.2 of the GDPR). In cases other than those provided for in this
article, in which the data controller has reasonable doubts regarding
with the identity of the applicant, may require additional information necessary to
confirm that identity.

In this regard, Recital 64 of the GDPR is expressed in the following terms:

“The data controller must use all reasonable measures to
verify the identity of the interested parties who request access, in particular in the
context of online services and online identifiers. The responsible
You should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to respond

Regarding the question related to verification of the identity of rights applicants,
the rules set forth above are clear in pointing out that this verification process

Article 12.6 of the GDPR refers to all requests for rights and admits the possibility of
possibility of requiring, in those cases, "additional information" necessary to
confirm the identity of the interested party. In particular, in relation to requests
of access in the context of online services, Recital 64 of the same Re-
regulation refers to the possibility that the person in charge uses all the "measures
reasonable” to verify the identity of the interested parties.

The rules that regulate the exercise of rights do not establish, therefore, the need

XII.- Violation.

The accredited facts breach the provisions of article 12.2 of the GDPR, with the
scope expressed in the above Fundamentals of Law, which implies the
commission of an offense classified in article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, which under the
section "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines" provides
the following: “5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, according to

Thus, keeping and maintaining the record of processing activities is a

Regarding the obligation on the part of the data controller to describe in

that of minors.

In the GDPR there are specific mentions in relation to minors in care of
the special protection that children deserve, as provided for in recital 38
of the GDPR: "Children deserve specific protection of their personal data,
who may be less aware of the risks, consequences, guarantees and rights

"1. Where Article 6(1)(a) applies in relation to the offer

Complete the previous provision of article 7 of the LOPDGDD that determines that “1.

Article 8 of the GDPR establishes in which cases it is applicable. let's examine
if in the case now examined we find ourselves in this situation.

First, it requires that the treatment be related to services of the society of the
information offered directly to a child.

XVII.- Privacy by design

Article 25 of the GDPR establishes that "Taking into account the state of the art, the
cost of the application and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as
as the risks of varying probability and severity involved in the treatment for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller applies
will be, both at the time of determining the means of treatment and at the time
of the processing itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as the
pseudonymization, designed to effectively apply the principles of protection
data minimization, such as data minimization, and integrate the necessary safeguards into the
treatment, in order to comply with the requirements of this Regulation and to protect the
rights of the interested parties”.

It is complemented by the provisions of recital 78 of the GDPR, which indicates that
“The protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with respect to the
processing of personal data requires the adoption of technical and organizational measures
appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.
glament. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the
controller must adopt internal policies and implement measures that
comply in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by definition.

parity to functions and the processing of personal data, allowing interested parties

tions on data protection. The principles of data protection

public contracts”.

The principle of privacy by design is an example of the transition from reactivity to
the proactivity and risk approach imposed by the GDPR. Clear reflection of the res-
proactive responsibility, imposes that, from the most initial stages of planning
of a treatment must be considered this principle: the person responsible for the treatment
from the moment an eventual data treatment is designed and planned.
personal cough must determine all the elements that make up the treatment,
carried out through an exercise of analysis and detection of risks during
the entire cycle of data processing, with the first and last purpose of protecting
personal data and the rights and freedoms of the interested parties and not only when
treatment actually takes place. This is expressed in Guidelines 4/2019 of the
CEPD related to article 25 Protection of data from the design and by default, adopt-
held on October 20, 2020.

The aforementioned Guidelines indicate in this regard that “35. The "moment to determine"
the means of treatment» refers to the period of time in which the person responsible
ble is deciding how it will carry out the treatment and how it will occur
this, as well as the mechanisms that will be used to carry out said treatment.
In the process of making such decisions, the controller must
assess the appropriate measures and guarantees to effectively apply the principles

such as the risks, the state of the art and the cost of application, as well as the nature

software and hardware implementation and data processing services.

36. Taking PDDD into consideration from the beginning is crucial for the correct
application of the principles and for the protection of the rights of the interested parties.
In addition, from the point of view of profitability, it is also of interest to those responsible

pre-designed treatment goals”.

To do this, when designing the treatment, you must resort to the principles contained in the article
5 of the GDPR, which will serve to assess effective compliance with the GDPR. Thus, the
aforementioned Directives 4/2019 of the CEPD provide that “61. To make the PDDD effective,
Those responsible for the treatment must apply the principles of transparency, legality,
loyalty, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, term limitation
conservation, integrity and confidentiality, and proactive responsibility. These prin-
principles are included in article 5 and recital 39 of the GDPR”.

XIX.- About the Warning of content for adults and the "Policy of the Protection of the

Minor on the Internet”.

Opinion 2/2009 of the Working Group of Article 29 on the protection of
personal data of children (General Guidelines and special reference to the
schools) tells us that: "A child is a human being in the broadest sense of
word. For this reason, you must enjoy all the rights of the person, including
the right to the protection of personal data. Now the child is
in a particular situation that must be considered from two perspectives: static
and dynamic. From the static point of view, the child is a person who has not yet
reached physical and psychological maturity. From a dynamic point of view, it
He is in a process of physical and mental development that will make him an adult. The
rights of the child and their exercise - including the right to data protection - should
express themselves with both perspectives in mind.

Thus, the Article 29 Working Group highlights not only the importance of the
child for the inherent dignity of the child as "a human being in the broadest
sense of the word", but it shows the need for protection of this, also
from the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data, by the
situation of inferiority and risk in which he finds himself by not having reached full
maturity and being in the process of developing towards adulthood.

Recital 39 of the GDPR highlights that "Children deserve protection
specific to your personal data, as they may be less aware of the
risks, consequences, guarantees and rights concerning data processing
personal. Said specific protection should apply in particular to the use of
personal data of children for marketing or profiling purposes
personality or user, and to obtain personal data relating to children
when using services offered directly to a child”.

Regarding the risks, recital 75 of the GDPR exemplifies some of the
present in our society, without prejudice to many others who may at the same time
materialize, harm the rights and freedoms of natural persons. we will call
the attention in which it includes between the vulnerable people to the children, whose
processing of personal data constitutes a risk in itself.

Thus it provides that "The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
of variable severity and probability, may be due to the processing of data that
could cause physical, material or immaterial damages, in particular
in cases where the processing may give rise to problems of discrimination,
identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to reputation,
loss of confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, reversion not

significant; in cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and
freedoms or are prevented from exercising control over your personal data; In the cases
in which the personal data processed reveal ethnic or racial origin, opinions

political, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, and treatment
of genetic data, data relating to health or data on sexual life, or the
criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures; in cases where
in which personal aspects are evaluated, in particular the analysis or prediction of
aspects related to work performance, economic situation, health,
preferences or personal interests, reliability or behavior, situation or
movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; in cases where
personal data of vulnerable people, in particular children, are processed; or in the
cases in which the processing involves a large amount of personal data and
affect a large number of stakeholders.

Not only the processing of personal data of a child as a vulnerable person is a
risk, but in the case of children, the risks that would affect any group
are amplified by their situation of vulnerability, so that the dangers per se are
older than if they affect an adult. This implies that, from the point of view of
risk, a fundamental pillar of the GDPR, it is necessary to enable technical and
organizational security measures to avoid the materialization of very high risk
causing an injury to their rights and freedoms, taking into consideration as
starting point that we find ourselves with the processing of personal data of
children.

Recital 76 supports it by understanding that "The probability and severity of the risk
for the rights and freedoms of the data subject must be determined with reference to the
nature, scope, context and purposes of data processing. The risk should
be weighted on the basis of an objective evaluation through which it is determined whether
data processing operations involve a risk or if the risk is high”.

The risks to which children are affected and their avoidance are based on the
best interests of the child, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on
the Rights of the Child (article 3) and subsequently confirmed by Convention 192
of the Council of Europe (article 6) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
EU (article 24, N.2).

In Opinion 2/2009 of the Working Group of Article 29 on the protection of
children's personal data, it is provided that "The justification for this principle is that
a person who has not yet reached physical and psychological maturity needs
more protection than other people. Its purpose is to improve the conditions of the child and
reinforce the right of the latter to develop his personality”.

Such provision is also contained in Spanish law. Thus, we can cite the Law
Organic 1/1996, of January 15, of Legal Protection of Minors, of modification
part of the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Law or Organic Law 8/2021,
of June 4, comprehensive protection for children and adolescents against violence.

Article 2 of Organic Law 1/1996 determines that "Every minor has the right to
that their best interest is valued and considered paramount in all
actions and decisions that concern you, both in the public and private spheres. In
the application of this law and other regulations that affect it, as well as in the
measures concerning minors adopted by institutions, public or

sedeagpd.gob.es

57/76

private companies, the Courts, or the legislative bodies, the best interests of the
themselves over any other legitimate interest that may arise”.

The same protection is projected in data protection regarding minors.
It is significant that art. 76.2 of the LOPDGDD considers as criteria of
graduation of sanctions the affectation of the rights of minors, which
shows that the Spanish legislator, following in the wake of the law
legal, refers to a vital importance in its protection, in the relevance and in the
sensitivity of minors.

In the case that we are examining, pornography is considered by our
legislator as a specific risk with respect to minors. Article 45 of the Law
Orgánica 8/2021 affirms that it is a risk "the access and consumption of pornography among the
underage population”. Especially in an interconnected world where
minors dive into the internet from ever younger ages.

This is understood in Opinion 02/2013 of the Working Group of Article 29 on
applications of smart devices, which in relation to children
establishes the following: «(...) 3.10 Children. Children are avid users of
applications, either on their own devices or on shared devices (with their
parents, siblings or in an educational institution), and there is clearly a large market
of various applications for them. But, at the same time, the children hardly
understand or know, if at all, the scope and sensitivity of
the data that applications can access, or the scope of the data
shared with third parties for advertising purposes.”

We will also cite the Agreement of the National Markets Commission and the
Jurisdiction of June 16, 2022 in relation to the complaint against a
pornography video sharing platform for the alleged breach of
the obligation to establish age verification mechanisms, in which
specifies the early age of access to these platforms, in the middle of the process of
development of minors: "It must be taken into account that in the Spanish case,
access to pornography on the internet is really worrying since more
50% of Spanish adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 usually watch regularly
pornography on the Internet, that the average age of initiation in the consumption of pornography is
14 years among male adolescents and 16 years in the case of women and
that, however, at least one in four men has started before the age of 13
and the earliest age of access is already anticipated at 8 years.

Pursuant to the aforementioned Agreement of the National Markets Commission and the
Competition, it describes the characteristics of pornography in
internet in relation to the risks to which minors are subjected:

“Among the main characteristics of Internet pornography is that the
It is easily accessible at any time and from anywhere. The
New technologies and the proliferation of devices for personal use have
allowed a practically immediate degree of accessibility to this type of
content by minors.

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

58/76

Another characteristic is that the supply of pornography is affordable, all
time that it is perceived as mostly free, although it is undeniable the
connection that pornography has with the advertising of services or articles
sexual, paid content (live, on request, by catalogue),
paid contacts, among others.

Related to the above, you can find various levels of
end-user interaction, from minimal anonymous interaction
(visualization of videos) to an intense interactivity of a face-to-face relationship
face from distance contact, in a new context of access to
prostitution (paid contacts), going through modalities of diverse
implication.

Another important aspect to highlight is that part of the sexual practices that
displays pornography on the internet displays sexual intercourse in a
stereotyped, the satisfaction of male sexual desire and the
representation of male sexual fantasies. They also include
high-risk practices such as unprotected sex or
those in which there is physical or verbal violence.

Access by minors to this type of internet pornography
especially concerned with the way in which the minor can come to understand
interpersonal relationships and sex.

Indeed, the representation of stereotyped sexual relations, give
foot to the sexual objectification of women, the exhibition of characters with
predefined physical attributes negatively impacts the self-esteem of the
minors (girls feel physically inferior and boys doubt their
virility) and the normalization of certain extreme practices alter the perception
of those on their acceptability.

The characteristics of Internet pornography described above favor and
facilitate that there is a high interest on the part of minors to access
pornographic content. In turn, the consequences of such access and
mass consumption can have an important influence on the formation of the
character of minors, whose protection must prevail”.

As we can see, and being fully applicable to the protection
procured by the GDPR, each of the characteristics defined in this Agreement
pose a clear risk to the psychological development of minors.

Without prejudice to the obligations that the legal system imposes on parents
with respect to minors, under the provisions of art. 154 of the Civil Code in
Regarding watching over them, educating them and providing them with an integral formation, this does not rob the

In this sense, CEPD Guidelines 4/2019 provide for the principle of
loyalty that "The data controllers should not transfer the risks of the
company to interested parties.

The risks to which minors are affected, inherent to their development, must be
be considered by data controllers, and not only by those who
direct services directly and specifically to children, but by all those who
carry out personal data processing aimed at other groups in which the
minors can interact or intervene (in an increasingly technological society) and
see their physical or psychological integrity at risk and their rights and
liberties.

When the service is aimed exclusively at adults, when the
responsible for the treatment limits its treatment to adults, with respect to
services that may pose a risk to minors, then also their
Efforts, derived from their obligations, must be aimed at guaranteeing that only
treat data of adults.

The latter is the case in which we find ourselves, in which BURWEBS, S.L.
repeatedly asserts in its allegations that the content of the web is directed
exclusively to adults and that it is mandatory to be of legal age, despite what
established in their privacy policy regarding minors.

When designing a treatment, the data controller determines, among other things
questions, what are the categories of data subjects and the categories of data
personal concerned in the treatment in relation to the purpose pursued by the
same.

The entity decides that the categories of interested parties are limited to those of legal age,
Therefore, it is up to you to implement the technical and organizational measures
appropriate so that the treatment is carried out only with respect to interested parties
adults. This means that it also implements the technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures so that the data of minors are not processed.

In the case of the website in question, there is a certain risk that minors will access
directly and without limitations to such harmful content for them.

If we observe the limitations or precautions provided on the website, these are
clearly insufficient to limit access to minors, both directly through
the website (non-registered users) how to register on the website
(registered users).

While there are mechanisms in place to “declare” age, none exist to
verify it subsequently, nor any to verify it ab initio, which would constitute
an appropriate measure to avoid the materialization of high risks in the
rights and freedoms of minors who, as we have seen, are present. Amen
that the treatment conforms to what was decided by the person in charge of the treatment
(mandatory to be of legal age) and only data from the categories
of interested parties "of legal age".

In addition, the mechanism to declare the age does not work properly, because even
clicking on the option <<No, I want to leave the site>>, if you click on any
another site on the page, the warning banner disappears and access to the
web content

As stated in the facts proven when entering the web for the first time,
a warning banner appears warning that the website
that you are trying to access contains pornographic material and asks for confirmation of
be of age:

“+ 18. WEBSITE FOR ADULTS: “The site you are accessing
contains pornographic material and its access is for adults. To access
at the same time you have to confirm that you meet the legal age of your country to be able to

access this type of content.

“I am of legal age and I accept cookies <<Enter>>”.

<<No, I want to leave the site>>

<<Legal Notice LSSI>>

<<Configure Cookies>>

However, if you choose to leave the site, clicking on the option <<No, I want to
leave the site>>, the web returns the user to the browser that is being used,
but if you click anywhere else on the page, the warning banner will
appears and access to the content of the web is possible.

In addition, Law 13/2022, of July 7, General Communication
Audiovisual, in which article 89 and, as regards what interests us for the purposes
illustrative and in force since July 9, 2022, in relation to the service of
exchange of videos, measures are established for the protection of users and
of minors in front of certain audiovisual content. It is established that “1.
The providers of the video exchange service through the platform, to
protect minors and the general public from audiovisual content
indicated in the previous article, will take the following measures: e) Establish and
operate age verification systems for users with respect to the
content that may harm the physical, mental or moral development of minors
that, in any case, prevent their access to the most
harmful, such as gratuitous violence or pornography” (emphasis added).

And it is that the entity BURWEBS, S.L. provides a video sharing service to
through the web page in question, since registered users add and
share videos with other users, being forced to establish and operate systems
of age verification as a measure to protect minors. And this in the
terms of the Agreement of the National Commission of Markets and Competition of
06/16/22.

Well, at this point, the data controller, as part of his
proactive responsibility must meet and demonstrate compliance with the provisions
of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD, among which are the legitimacy for the
processing of personal data and the adoption of appropriate security measures
to avoid risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

Article 24 of the GDPR establishes that:

“taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as risks of varying probability and severity for
rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and
be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with this Regulation.
These measures will be reviewed and updated when necessary.

This precept does not limit the adoption of security measures to the subjects subject to the
treatment, but rather, focusing on the risk derived from the treatment considering
the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, imposes the adoption of the
precise technical and organizational measures to guarantee that the treatment is
compliant with the GDPR.

In attention to all of the above, the entity BURWEBS, S.L. must adapt the
treatment of your personal data to the RGPD, so you must adopt measures of
appropriate security by verifying the age of users,
registered or not, who access the web page in question, guaranteeing that they are
adults.

XX.- Measurements

Article 58.2 of the GDPR establishes the corrective powers available to a
control authority. Section d) of the aforementioned precept establishes that it may consist
in "ordering the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period of time.

Likewise, it is appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) of the
GDPR and order BURWEBS, S.L. that, within a month, establish the
adequate security measures to verify the age of users,
guaranteeing that they are of legal age, preventing situations from occurring
similar in the future.

The text of the resolution establishes the facts that determine
the need to adapt to data protection regulations, from which it can be inferred
clearly what are the measures to adopt, notwithstanding that the type of
specific procedures, mechanisms or instruments to implement them
corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is the person responsible for the treatment who
He fully knows his organization and has to decide, based on the responsibility
proactive and risk-focused, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD.

In any case, and for informational purposes only, we will indicate that it is mandatory
implement age verification mechanisms by the entity BURWEBS, S.L.
with respect to the provisions of article 89 of Law 13/2022, of July 7, General of
Audiovisual Communication, such measures can also help the treatment
carried out is in accordance with the GDPR, which, in any case, will have to be assessed by the
responsible for the treatment.

XXI.- Corrective powers of the AEPD

In the event that there is an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, among the pos-
corrective rights available to the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
As control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates:

"2 Each control authority will have all the following corrective powers in-

For its part, article 76 “Sanctions and corrective measures” of the LOPDGDD provides
ne:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulations
Regulation (UE) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria

In this case, considering the seriousness of the infractions verified, the
imposition of a fine and, where appropriate, the adoption of measures.

In accordance with the precepts indicated, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanctions
to be imposed in the present case, it is considered appropriate to graduate the fines from

the case now examined, when the activity of the appellant is of constant

XXIII.- About the "Cookies Policy" of the web:

a).- Regarding the installation of cookies in the terminal equipment prior to the consent:

Article 22.2 of the LSSI establishes that users must be provided with information
clear and complete information on the use of storage devices and
data recovery and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing.
This information must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. Therefore,
When the use of a cookie entails a treatment that enables the
identification of the user, those responsible for the treatment must ensure the
compliance with the requirements established by the regulations on the protection of
data.

However, it is necessary to point out that they are exempted from compliance with the
obligations established in article 22.2 of the LSSI those necessary cookies
for the intercommunication of terminals and the network and those that provide a service
expressly requested by the user.

In this sense, the GT29, in its Opinion 4/201210, interpreted that among the cookies
excepted would be the user input Cookies" (those used to
fill in forms, or as management of a shopping cart); cookies from
authentication or user identification (session); user security cookies
(those used to detect erroneous and repeated attempts to connect to a site
Web); media player session cookies; session cookies to balance
load; user interface customization cookies and some of
complement (plug-in) to exchange social content. These cookies would remain
excluded from the scope of application of article 22.2 of the LSSI, and, therefore, it would not be
necessary to inform or obtain consent about its use.

On the contrary, it will be necessary to inform and obtain the prior consent of the user
before the use of any other type of cookies, both first and second
third party, session or persistent.

In the verification carried out on the web page in question, it was possible to verify that, when

In the case at hand, it has been found that there is no type of banner
that informs in a generic way about cookies that the web page uses, without being its own
and/or third parties and their mission.

c).- Regarding consent to the use of non-necessary cookies:

For the use of non-excepted cookies, it will be necessary to obtain the consent

inactivity of the user, scrolling or browsing the website, will not be considered to be

If for the configuration of cookies, the web refers to the browser configuration

to obtain consent, but not as the only mechanism. Therefore, if the editor
opts for this option, it must also offer and in any case, a mechanism that

as the option to "Save the configuration" disappears, making it impossible to reject
the cookies.

The only way to keep the "save settings" option from disappearing is
by enabling a cookie, but even in this case if a cookie is left enabled and
the others are rejected, it is verified that the "Save Configuration" option is
