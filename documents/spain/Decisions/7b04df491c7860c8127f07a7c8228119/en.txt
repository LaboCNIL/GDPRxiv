By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority
of control, and according to what is established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the legalization of the

treatment of personal data.

For its part, article 5 of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be:

“a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("legality, loyalty and transparency");

b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; according to article 89,
section 1, further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the interest
public, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered
incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for

those that are processed ("data minimization");

d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable for the erasure or rectification without delay of the personal data that is
inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (“accuracy”);

e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties during

exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, scientific research purposes or

the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures imposed by this
Regulation in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the interested party ("limitation of the term
of conservation”);

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against their
accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of technical measures or
appropriate organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality").

The controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions

in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

According to the evidence currently available,
and without prejudice to what results from the investigation, it is considered proven that on the 26th of
July 2017, the claimant proceeded to present the brief containing his
name, surnames and DNI, in his capacity as representative of the BASKETBALL CLUB
TIZONA, S.A.D. before the BASKETBALL FEDERATION OF CASTILLA Y LEÓN, and that
Almost immediately upon its reception by the aforementioned federal body, it began to
circulate on social media.

It is also confirmed that on ***DATE.1, DIARIO DE BURGOS published in its
printed edition and in its digital formats the document object of conflict, with the data
of the claimant, after having been sent by the FEDERATION OF
CASTILLA Y LEÓN BASKETBALL.

In relation to the DIARIO DE BURGOS, it should be noted that in accordance with the provisions of the
data protection regulations, the processing of personal data is considered lawful,
in particular, when it is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the data controller or by a third party, provided that said interests are not
prevail the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected party that
require the protection of such data.

In relation to the dissemination of personal information in the media
communication, it is necessary to take into consideration that article 20 of the Constitution
Española protects, in particular, the right to freely express and disseminate
thoughts, ideas and opinions through speech, writing or any other means of
reproduction and also the right to freely communicate or receive truthful information by
any broadcast medium.

The jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court tends to grant a position
preference to freedom of expression over other constitutional rights when,
Based on the veracity of the information provided, the reported facts are
consider to be of public importance. This relevance is projected not only on those who
carry out a public activity, but also in those who participate in events that
are considered of interest to citizens. The jurisprudence has also
determined that the discussion about the veracity of the published information is not
incompatible with the pre-eminence of the right to information over the right to
Data Protection.

The preferential value of the freedoms of expression and information reaches its
highest level, according to the Constitutional Court, when they are exercised by the
information professionals through the publication of information considered of
public relevance through an institutionalized vehicle of opinion formation
which prevents this Agency from carrying out additional weighting of the
proportionality that, given its organic nature, would necessarily imply a
modality of administrative control over the contents of the published information
by means incompatible with our institutional system.

In relation to the publication of images in journalistic information, it is
It is also necessary to consider that Organic Law 1/1982, of May 5, on Protection
Civil Law of the Right to Honour, to personal and family privacy and to one's own image, in its
Article 8.2, establishes certain limitations in the protection of these rights if the
broadcast images were captured during a public act or in places open to the
public. These limitations also extend to cases in which the image of a
particular person appears as merely incidental to an event or occurrence
public.

It should be noted that the media, in the exercise of their constitutional rights, are
empowered to exercise their right to non-disclosure of their sources, in accordance with
what is included in section d) of article 20 of our Magna Carta, which recognizes the
right to professional secrecy for information professionals, in development of the
recognition provided for in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Humans.

However, those affected may exercise the right of deletion provided for in the
data protection regulations, without prejudice to the rights granted by the aforementioned Law
Organic 1/1982, which can be exercised before the competent jurisdictional instance.

Those affected may also exercise, before the media, the
right provided for in Organic Law 2/1984, of March 26, regulating the right of
rectification, which is referred to in article 85 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
