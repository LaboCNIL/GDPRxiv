FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to
resolve this procedure.

II

The RGPD in its article 5, "Principles related to the treatment" says that "The data
personal will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,
loyalty and transparency»);

b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; according to article 89,
paragraph 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");

d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable to eliminate or rectify without delay the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (“accuracy”);

e) kept in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties during
longer than necessary for the purposes of the processing of personal data; the
Personal data may be kept for longer periods provided that it is
processed exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, research purposes
scientific or historical or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1,
without prejudice to the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures that
This Regulation is imposed in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the
interested party (“limitation of the retention period”);

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

2. The controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

The infraction for which the defendant is held responsible is provided for in article 83.5
of the RGPD that establishes:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/10

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
Total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

a)
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

In turn, the LOPDGDD in its article 72.1.a) qualifies as a very serious infraction,
purposes of prescription, “a) The processing of personal data violating the
principles and guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

In the present case, personal data of the claimant has been revealed, such as the
personal email address and health data to the Public Entity
Empresa de Vivienda-Donostiako Etxegintza, without the consent of the
claimant.

Although the claimed party is recognized as entitled to submit the data
necessary to defend against a sanctioning procedure or the penalties
that could be imposed derived from the breach of a contract
administrative, it should not be forgotten that the RGPD includes health as a category of
specially protected personal data, in accordance with article 9.1 of the
RGPD, where the following is indicated:

“The processing of personal data that reveals ethnic origin or
racial, political, religious or philosophical convictions, or affiliation
union, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data aimed at identifying
unambiguously to a natural person, data relating to health or data relating to
sexual life or sexual orientation of a natural person”.

In this sense, the entity claimed submits a written statement of allegations to the proposal
of resolution indicating that in accordance with article 9.2 f) of the RGPD the data
personal property of the claimant were transferred for his defense against a claim.

It should be noted that the literal tenor of said precept is as follows:

“Section 1 shall not apply when one of the circumstances
following:

f) the treatment is necessary for the formulation, exercise or defense of
claims or when the courts act in the exercise of their judicial function;”

In this regard, it should be noted that although recital 52 of the
RGPD in fine establishes with respect to that exception that “it must also be authorized to
exceptional title the treatment of said personal data when it is necessary
for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims, whether by a

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

6/10

judicial proceeding or an administrative or extrajudicial proceeding”; nevertheless,
It must be taken into account that the use of health data, even when this information is
exception, it is not covered if it violates article 5.1.c) of the RGPD and the data
transferred are excessive in relation to the purpose, since the
the need to specify all vacations, permits and, especially since they are data
of health, casualties with their causes to ensure their defense.

On the other hand, the respondent entity also alleges in its pleadings to the
motion for a resolution that evidence has been rejected by this Body.

In this regard, it should be noted that this Agency has not rejected any evidence
filed by the respondent party, it has only been considered that with the
evidence in this procedure, it is not necessary to require the City Council of
Donostia/San Sebastián the recording of the session included in the session diary of
the Development and Planning Commission of the Territory dated December 9,
2020.

This is so because it has been proven that they have been assigned by the entity
claimed, health data of the claimant, specifically dates of sick leave,
reasons for them and permissions, and therefore, the claimed entity has been
exceeding in the treatment of the personal data of the claimed, even if it has
legitimacy for its internal use in its relations with the worker or claimant, but
you do not have the legitimacy to use them beyond your employment relationship with the claimant,
without your express consent.

In another order of things, it has also been confirmed that in response to the
requirement of the Public Business Housing Entity-Donostiako Etxegintza,
as a result of the complaints filed by the claimant on July 14 and 9
September 2020 due to lack of assignment of human and material resources, the
entity claimed provided the claimant's email address without their
consent.

In this sense, the defendant entity claims to know the email address of the
claimant, because it was the form of company-worker communication, so at
provide the personal email of the claimant, to a third entity, has
exceeded the purpose for which said personal data was provided, thereby violating the
principle of limitation of the purpose, regulated in article 5.1 b) of the RGPD,
indicated in the foundation of law II.

Therefore, when the claimant's health data is transferred (dates of sick leave,
reasons for them and permits with their respective causes, including COVID) and the
claimant's personal email, this Agency considers, on the one hand, that
are processing specially protected data, in accordance with article 9 of the
RGPD (health data), and on the other that personal data is being processed
(personal email) for a purpose other than mere communication between
the worker and the company, in accordance with article 5.1 b) of the RGPD.

All this results in an excessive use of personal data by the
claimed entity, since despite the fact that the data protection regulations require that
the processing of personal data is adequate, pertinent and limited to what is

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/10

strictly necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, such as
consequence of the complaint filed by the claimant against the entity
claimed before the Public Housing Business Entity-Donostiako Etxegintza for
lack of ascription of human and material resources, the claimed entity has
violated the principle of data minimization, by providing said public entity
business for your defense, health data and the personal email of the
claimant, which makes us find ourselves before an alleged violation of the
article 5.1 c) of the RGPD, indicated in the legal basis II.

Therefore, it is considered appropriate to reiterate that it is not considered necessary to require the
City Council of Donostia/San Sebastián the contribution of the recording of the session
incorporated into the journal of sessions of the Development and Planning Commission of the
Territory dated December 9, 2020, as suggested by the respondent entity,
since with the documentation in this file the
facts reported, which are ultimately, an excess of personal data provided
by the entity claimed to justify its action, to the detriment of the
claimant, when dealing with especially sensitive data, and therefore especially
protected, such as health data, in accordance with the provisions of the
article 9 of the RGPD.

IV

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: "Each control authority will have
of all the following corrective powers indicated below:

b) send a warning to any person responsible or in charge of the treatment when the
treatment operations have violated the provisions of this Regulation;
