Notwithstanding the foregoing, and although it is true that the contracting of services

in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in
Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

FIFTH: Notified of the aforementioned start-up agreement in accordance with the rules established in
Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations in which, in summary, he stated: that it is reiterated in the allegations
previously presented and states that it should be noted that all contracts
on behalf of the claimant have been carried out through a procedure of
portability.

On March 25, 2018, the contracting took place in the name of the claimant of the
following services under the JAZZTEL brand: - Fixed line and fiber associated with the
numbering ***PHONE.1. - Rate for the mobile line ***TELEPHONE.2 together with a
mobile terminal.

Contracting in Jazztel is done on the TELEVENTA channel, using an SMS
Certificate that includes attached the proof of sale and the recording of the
recruitment or VPT. Said hiring consisted of two portabilities from
the telecommunications company Vodafone: the fixed line (***TELEPHONE.1) and the
mobile (***PHONE.2). Attached as Document No. 1 the certificate issued by
DIGITEL ON TRUST SERVICES SL as a third party verifier of the contract.

Likewise, on May 25, 2018, the contracting takes place, in the name of the
claimant, of the following services in the ORANGE brand: - Fee associated with the
numbering ***PHONE.2. - Fixed line and fiber associated with ***TELEPHONE.1. It is about,
again, from a contract on the TELEVENTA channel, in this case from Orange. This
contracting also consists of two ports coming from Jazztel. consists
also the proof of sale and the recording of the contract (VPT), since
sent as documentation annexed to the allegations of this party to the request
of information.

Therefore, both contracts derive from portability, so the
procedure, as already mentioned, is stipulated by the regulations
sectorial. In both cases, the personal data was compared with the person
contracting party and identity verification was carried out through third parties (VPT),
scrupulously complying with Circular 1/2009, in the interest of this party
specify that: - It was expressly confirmed with the claimant: the date of the
hiring; Name and surname; home; National Identity Document (in
go ahead, ID); and contracted product. - It indicates that the call is being recorded.

independent verifier.

 The call has sufficient quality to allow the verifier to understand and
the affirmative answers of the contracting party. - It is provided as Document No. 2 the
recording where the contracting party itself is the one that indicates its full name and
DNI, as they appear in the contractual documentation and in the certificates issued

Therefore, it is possible to affirm that the procedure was scrupulously followed
described in the referenced Circular 1/2009.

In the internal records of this company, on July 22, 2019, the
reception of a call for which the owner of the line indicates that she does not recognize the
contracted services claiming to have suffered identity theft. Given this,
Orange explains the need to receive a copy of the complaint in advance
submitted by the claimant to the State Security Corps and Forces, in
the one that exposes the facts object of the supposed usurpation to be able to catalog the
recruitment as irregular and make the necessary adjustments, protocol established in
Orange to detect cases of irregular hiring. This complaint is not
contributes. The claimant does not contact again or respond to the instructions given to her
request in order to proceed to classify the contracts as irregular. This
fact, that Orange applies a previously established security procedure
that requires the documentary accreditation of a possible illicit - through a complaint -
prior to proceeding with the resolution and cancellation of a contract, is the one that the Agency includes in
the Commencement Agreement as an aggravating circumstance. As the Agency will understand, prior to
proceed to a contractual resolution with a consumer, of a service considered
basic in many aspects, Orange must have a minimum guarantee
documentary proof that there is a valid and sufficient motive such as the commission of fraud.
It is precisely because of this obligation of diligence that Orange cannot cancel the
services contracted by the claimant for a mere private manifestation that does not
It is accompanied by evidence or any document. The use of some
statements by an unproven party as an aggravating circumstance of a sanction by the Agency
contradicts legal logic and lacks foundation, and must be said
dismissed argument. The aforementioned has been brought to the attention of
of the claimant by means of communication, a copy of which has been attached as
document attached to the allegations in this part to the information request.

There is evidence of a complaint filed with the General Directorate of the Police dependency
*** LOCATION.1 Center, with certificate no. *** CERTIFICATE.1 dated July 24,
2019. Said complaint is not sent to Orange by the claimant at any time.
The claimant has not provided any documentary evidence to prove the referral to
this part of the said complaint. It has not been proven by the claimant, therefore, the
referral of the complaint to this party: Orange is aware of it with the
AEPD information requirement dated July 12, 2021.

The claimant files, on June 4, 2021, a claim before the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. The claim is directed against ORANGE
ESPAGNE, S.A.U. 9º.- Orange receives the information request from the AEPD
previously mentioned on July 12, 2021, having knowledge of the
commission of fraud at that very moment and not before, as is extracted from the
documentation provided in this procedure. At that time, upon completion
with the requirement of having knowledge of the complaint filed, the
pertinent measures to classify the contract as fraudulent, in accordance with
with the internal protocols that had been informed to the complainant, and not by the
fact that the facts had been brought to the attention of the AEPD.

That is why the protocol is activated and information is requested from the department of
Fraud regarding the reported contracts, the irregularity of the
contracts and they are classified as fraudulent, proceeding to carry out
the economic adjustments and execute the deregistration due to fraud.

It has been verified by Orange that the claimant's data is not registered in
patrimonial solvency files, as has been accredited through the
certificates of non-inclusion in solvency files provided with the allegations of
this part to the information request. The factual account allows us to conclude that
Orange carried out lawful personal data processing, in accordance with the protocol
established and the procedure - mandatory - stipulated by the Circular
1/2009 for portability; as well as that, as soon as he became aware of the
existence of fraud (with the annex to the complaint in the request for information
of the AEPD of July 12, 2021), acted diligently accordingly.

In this case, not only has compliance with the protocol been accredited
established and the applicable regulations, but the existence of a strict
control, before and after contracting, the establishment of measures before and after
posteriori, as well as the existence of specific measures aimed at avoiding
previously these practices (already indicated by this part in the allegations to the
information requirement of the AEPD): - Controls in requests for
registration/portability/flight migration: rules applied in Scoring. Therefore, if before
of the activation is rejected, the registration would not take place. - Daily checks on orders
processed from CCNNPPP (teleshopping and eshop). As in the previous case,
if it is rejected before activation, there is no registration. - Audits on platforms
FIDE suppliers, by supplier analysts, who report at the time of the
detection and weekly. - Periodic checks of unpaid customers or
concentration of bank accounts. - Management of CRMs (systems of the
company) of claims, escalated by different functional groups for
unrecognized lines/orders. - Daily registration validation controls and
identity portability, verifying in the census if the NIE or NIF matches the
name and surname that appear in the application. - Management of claims for
inclusion in patrimonial solvency files. That is why it is not possible
appreciate Orange's guilt in the present assumption of fact, not being
legally valid the assessment made by the Agency of commission of infringement
for this mercantile

Orange has carried out lawful data processing, as long as it has evidenced through
compliance with the protocol provided for in Circular 1/2009 data processing
correctly legitimized in accordance with article 6.1 GDPR.

For all of the above, Orange: REQUESTS the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
that this document is considered as presented, if it is admitted, considers as formulated the
previous allegations and, after the appropriate procedures, issue a resolution through
which indicates the file of the Procedure or completes the procedure by means of a
warning and, ultimately, if it considers that the imposition of a
sanction, moderate or modulate its proposal included in the Commencement Agreement notified to
Orange, based on the arguments expressed in the body of this document
of allegations”.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of article 6
of the RGPD, "Legacy of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the assumptions in which
that the processing of data by third parties is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.
application to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions”.

 The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which considers as such:
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/14

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

to)
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, of Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (U.E.) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

(…)

to)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions
of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

II

In response to the allegations made by the respondent entity, it must be reiterated,
as stated in the proposed resolution that the documentation that works
in the file offers evidence that the claimed party violated article 6.1
of the GDPR, since it processed the personal data of the complaining party without
had no legitimacy to do so. The personal data was incorporated into the
information systems of the company, without having proven that there was
contracted legitimately, had your consent for the collection and
subsequent processing of your personal data, or there is any other cause that
make the treatment carried out lawful.

Well, with respect to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
We must point out that the defendant in its allegations states that <<it
requests information from the Fraud department regarding the reported contracts,
the irregularity of the contracts is confirmed and they are classified as
fraudulent, proceeding to make the economic adjustments and execute the deregistration for
fraud>>. Hence, Orange concludes that the registration was fraudulent that
the reported lines have been classified as fraudulent contracts, and the
debts associated with them have been forgiven.

In this case, although the defendant says that the portability was recorded and that it was
made through a third party verifier, does not provide the recording or elements that
allow verification that the line was ported and that a third party intervened in the portability
checker.

Therefore, in the present case, it is proven that a third party contracted on behalf of
of the claimant a service package with the claimed party, appearing in the
www.aepd.es
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/14

invoices provided by the claimant at an address other than his own. So the
claimed, did not verify the personality of the person who hired, did not take the precautions
necessary for these events not to occur.

It should be noted that it was not until the receipt of the claim transferred by this
Agency when the claimed party reacted and proceeded to catalog the contracting
as irregular, making the necessary economic adjustments so that it does not appear
any type of debt associated with non-payment of contracted services
irregular name of the claimant and verified that her data is not registered in
patrimonial solvency files.

The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in the fulfillment of the obligations
imposed by the personal data protection regulations is, therefore,
evident. Diligent compliance with the principle of legality in data processing
of third parties requires that the controller be in a position to
prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

Based on the available evidence, it is estimated that the conduct
of the claimed party could violate article 6.1 of the GDPR and may be
constituting the offense classified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation
2016/679.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

"(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, either in this Regulation or under other Union law
or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

IV.

The determination of the sanction that should be imposed in the present case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the GDPR, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:
"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative proceedings under this article for violations of this
Regulations indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”
"2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that

have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;

c) any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment to
settle the damages suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the treatment, habi-

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

fications approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,

mind, through infraction.”

 Within this section, the LOPDGDD contemplates in its article 76, entitled "Sancio-
and corrective measures”:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation
(UE) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria
established in section 2 of said article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of data processing.
personal information.

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission

of the offence.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
violation, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) The affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party.

3. It will be possible, complementary or alternatively, the adoption, when appropriate, of
the remaining corrective measures referred to in article 83.2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed on the entity claimed as responsible for a classified offense
in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in this case:

As aggravating circumstances:

-

That the facts that are the subject of the claim are attributable to a lack of diligence
of the claimed party (article 83.2.b, GDPR), the claimed party when it had
knowledge of the fraud did not act and continued to process the claimant's data.

   The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
