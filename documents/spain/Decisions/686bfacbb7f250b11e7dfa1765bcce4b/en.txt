FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that "The procedures processed by the
Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

Erroneous identification of the data controller. Guilt principle.

II

1. Article 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on administrative procedure
of Public Administrations (LPACAP), which specifies the minimum content
of the agreement to start the disciplinary procedure, indicates that it must include the
“Identification of the person or persons allegedly responsible.”

In the agreement to initiate the procedure at hand, the person
physics B.B.B. as responsible for data processing allegedly contrary to the
RGPD materialized in the capture of the image of the claimed and its dissemination in
social networks through the accounts of XXXXXXXXX illustrating the activity of that
Commercial brand.

However, in its allegations to the initiation agreement, the claimed party has reported
of the identity of the owner of the trademark XXXXXXXXX as well as the establishment of
aesthetics with that name and of the accounts opened with the name of XXXXXXXXX in
Instagram and YouTube.

It should be noted that it was not possible to know before the opening of the file
sanctioning the identification data of the legal entity owner of the centers of
aesthetics XXXXXXXXXX and YouTube accounts, "***CANAL.1", and Instagram,
“***PROFILE.1”.

The privacy policy of the web page associated with the name of XXXXXXXXX does not
reported the identity of the "company" that presented itself as responsible for the
processing of personal data: he did not provide his name, nor the NIF, nor the company type

nor any characteristics that would allow it to be identified. In addition, the search in the
Mercantile Registry under the name of XXXXXXXXX and others similar had a
negative result, since no company was found that included in its
denomination of that term or other similar ones and had as its corporate purpose the activity
that takes place in the establishments of XXXXXXXXX. Added to the above is the
circumstance that the defendant did not respond to the transfer of information made by the
Data Inspection Sub-Directorate. If you had responded, you could have clarified
this procedure the identity of the subject allegedly infringing, as has been done
later in the processing of allegations to the opening agreement of this
procedure.

It should be remembered that in the agreement to start this sanctioning procedure it is
He said in relation to this matter, (Fundamentals II) the following:

<<This disciplinary file is directed against the natural person
claimed, B.B.B., as responsible for the processing of personal data
of the claimant that constitutes its object.

Article 4.7. of the GDPR understands by data controller "the person
physical or legal entity, public authority, service or other body which, alone or jointly
with others determines the purposes and means of processing”.

[…] The information collected about the owner of the XXXXXXXXX centers, in
one of which the images of the claimant were recorded, leads us to
conclude that the person who determined the purposes and means of processing was the
natural person claimed.

In this regard, it has been verified that the Mercantile Registry does not contain
registered any company with the name XXXXXXXXX or another similar whose
corporate purpose coincides, at least partially, with the activity claimed
was carried out in the establishment where the claimant received the service
aesthetic. This activity was advertised on social networks from the Instagram profile
“***PERFIL.1” and the YouTube channel “***CANAL.1”. The claimed does not appear
nor in the Mercantile Registry as proxy or administrator of any
society.

On the other hand, the information accessible through the Internet related to the
trade name XXXXXXXXX introduces us to the natural person claimed
as "doctor of medicine and surgery" and "responsible and director" of the clinics
identified with that trade name. An example of this is the social network
Lindekin, in which the claimed party, identified by name and two
surnames, is presented in her profile as "CEO Director - XXXXXXXXX".

Lastly, it should be made clear that, despite the fact that the website
www.XXXXXXXXXXXX.com
informs in its Privacy Policy that the
responsible for the processing of the data of the users of this website is a
"company" called "XXXXXXXXX", in no case informs of the type
nor does it provide the NIF of the supposed company. It reproduces the
following excerpt from that policy:

16/18

 “[...] we inform you that XXXXXXXXX, a company domiciled in Avinguda del
Mar 2-6, local 3, Gavà Mar (Barcelona), and telephone ***TELEPHONE.1 (in
hereinafter, "XXXXXXXXX" or the "Company") is responsible for the treatment of
your personal information. This privacy policy provides the
information about the use that the Company will make of your personal data in
your status as a user of the website (the “Website”).”>>

2. In the process of making claims to the initiation agreement, the claimed party has informed
the AEPD of the identity of the company that owns the beauty centers that operate
under the trade name XXXXXXXXX. This is NEOS YOUTH PARTNER S.L.,
with NIF B67488734.

The defendant has added that this company is also the owner of the profiles on
Instagram and YouTube (“***PERFIL.1” and “***CANAL.1”) through which
spread the image of the complaining party.

The Mercantile Registry (R.M.) informs that Neos Youth Partner, S.L., began its
activity on 08/02/2019 and that on that date there were two joint and several administrators,
one of them the claimant. On 03/01/2022 -months after the
treatment that originates the initiation of this disciplinary file- was registered in the
R.M. an amendment to the Bylaws that, among other changes, affected the
social composition, since the company was constituted as a sole proprietorship being the
sole partner B.B.B. who also became its sole administrator.

3. According to reiterated jurisprudence, the principles that inspire the criminal order are applied,
with certain nuances, to the sanctioning Administrative Law, since both are
manifestations of the punitive order of the State. Among those principles is
special virtuality the element or principle of guilt.

The Judgment of the Constitutional Court (STC) 76/1990, of April 26, (F.J. 8.B)
pointed out that the presumption of innocence has to do with the proof of authorship of
the facts and, furthermore, with the guilt attributable to the one who, where appropriate, carries them out, whether
that any disciplinary resolution, whether criminal or administrative, requires at the same time certainty
of the facts charged, obtained through prosecution evidence, and certainty of the judgment of
guilt over those same facts.

In this sense, and limited to the scope of the disciplinary administrative procedure, it is
cite the judgment of the Supreme Court, Third Chamber, of 06/24/1998 (Rec. 1776/1994),
Legal Foundation 2, which says: "Personal responsibility becomes the basis
on which the punitive system is based, since no one can be sentenced or
sanctioned but for acts that, either by fraud or negligence, may be
directly accused."

Article 28 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public (LRJSP), under the heading "Responsibility" provides in section 1:

"Only those that may be penalized for acts constituting an administrative infraction
physical and legal persons, [...], who are responsible for them by way of
fraud or fault."

4. Based on the allegations made and the evidence provided, the person
person against whom this disciplinary procedure is directed appears exempt from
responsibility, since it was not she who determined the ends and means of the
treatment of the personal data of the affected party, but the legal person NEOS
YOUTH PARTNER, S.L.U.

The intervention of the current defendant in the facts on which the
disciplinary proceedings, in particular the publication of the image of the defendant in
social networks, took place in his capacity as legal representative of the company
aforementioned mercantile.

Thus, the person responsible for the treatment that has given rise to the opening of this
disciplinary file is the sole proprietorship limited company NEOS YOUTH
PARTNER, S.L.U., of which the defendant, the natural person B.B.B., has been since March
from 2022 its sole administrator.

Based on the foregoing, it is reported that, to the extent that the processing of data
that is the subject of the claim, and that is allegedly contrary to the GDPR, does not
prescribed, nothing prevents the AEPD, in relation to the aforementioned treatment, from proceeding
to the opening of a disciplinary procedure against the person responsible, the
company NEOS YOUTH PARTNER, S.L.U.

For this purpose, it should be remembered that the processing of personal data to which it relates
the claim made before this AEPD could constitute an infringement of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD and that article 72 of the LOPDGDD qualifies the infringement of the
Article 6.1 of the GDPR is very serious, for which it sets a limitation period of three
years. Regarding the calculation of the limitation period, article 30 of the LRJSP says
that “it will begin to be counted from the day the infraction was committed. In
In the case of continued or permanent infringements, the term will begin to run
since the offending conduct ended.”

Thus, whenever the processing of the personal data of the party
claimant is not attributable to the natural person against whom this claim is directed.
disciplinary procedure PS/00228/2022, it is appropriate to agree on the file of the
referenced procedure directed against B.B.B..

Therefore, in accordance with applicable law,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: AGREE on the FILING OF THE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE
PS/00228/2022 open to B.B.B., with NIF ***NIF.1, since this individual is not the
responsible for the processing of the data of the complaining party that allegedly
violates the GDPR.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to B.B.B..

THIRD: In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, the
This Resolution will be made public once the interested parties have been notified.

of the LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reversal before the

referred Law.

Finally, it is noted that in accordance with the provisions of article 90.3 a) of the LPACAP,
The firm resolution may be temporarily suspended in administrative proceedings if the

aforementioned Law 39/2015, of October 1. You must also transfer to the Agency the
documentation proving the effective filing of the contentious appeal-

contentious-administrative proceedings within a period of two months from the day following the
