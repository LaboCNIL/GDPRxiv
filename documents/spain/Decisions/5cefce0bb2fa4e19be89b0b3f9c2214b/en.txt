II

The image of a person, according to article 4.1 of the GDPR, is personal data and its
protection, therefore, is the object of said Regulation. In article 4.2 of the GDPR it is
defines the concept of "processing" of personal data.

Article 12.1 of the GDPR indicates that whoever carries out data processing
personal, such as the capture of images through a system of
video surveillance, must provide the interested parties with the information indicated in the
Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR.

In order that the duty of information provided for in article 12 of the GDPR is
complies in a concise and understandable manner for the affected party, the aforementioned article 22 of the
LOPDGDD foresees in relation to video surveillance a system of "information by
layers". Specifically, the fourth section states:

“[…]

4. The duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
shall be understood to have been fulfilled by means of the placement of an informative device in a sufficiently
recently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the identity

In this sense, the first layer must refer, at least, to the existence of the
treatment (video surveillance), the identity of the person responsible, the possibility of exercising the
rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR and where to obtain more
information on the processing of personal data.

placed in a visible public space or in a web address, and must refer to the
other elements of article 13 of the GDPR.

In accordance with the evidence available in this
disciplinary procedure, it is considered that the claimed party has breached its
obligation to provide adequate information about the existence of a security device
video surveillance of those affected. Well, compared to the photographs provided by
both parties, it is noted that at the time of filing the claim the
informative poster of video-surveilled area was not filled; maintaining the sanction
fine for previously captured images without providing the required information
by article 13 of the GDPR.

In view of the foregoing, the facts imply a violation of what is established in the
article 13 of the RGPD, which supposes the commission of an infraction, typified in the
Article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, which provides the following:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

(…)

b) The rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22;

(…)”

serious:

"(...)

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the processing of their data
personal in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law;”.
