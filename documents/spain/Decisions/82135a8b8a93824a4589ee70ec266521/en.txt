through a phone call. Includes the following subchannels:
 
- CAC Inbound: Reception of calls, from clients to EDP. They are generally
and to EDP customers who identify themselves from the beginning of the call through a
security protocol, although calls from clients can also be received
potentials.
- Telemarketing: Issuance of calls, from EDP to own databases of already

the call the telephone number that appears in the client's file, and that has been

2. Copy of the content included in the Risk Analysis or Assessment carried out by the
entity in compliance with article 32 of the RGPD in relation to the processing of
personal data collected in the context of contracting services with EDP

3. Enter the information previously provided by the entity to the AEPD, registered
with the number 001390/2020, it is specified recursively (see evidences 2, 3, 4,
6, 10, 12, 14, 15) that the personal data will be processed for the set of
purposes described, in addition to by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U., by another
legal person (EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U). In this regard, the following is requested
information:
3.1. Reason that justifies that both entities process the personal data collected.
3.2. Detail of the circumstances that determine, if any, that the treatments
carried out on specific personal data are executed by one or the other
entity.
3.3. Details, where appropriate, of the procedures and mechanisms used to
guarantee the separation of the personal data processed by one and another entity of
so that each one only has the possibility of dealing with what corresponds to it according to
of the legitimate purpose pursued at all times.

SIXTH: On June 17, 2020, this Agency has received a written document from EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. in which the following is stated with respect to the last
question raised in the requirement of this Agency referred to in point
previous:

“THIRD.- Among the information previously provided by the entity to the AEPD,
registered with the number 001387/2020, it is specified on a recurring basis (see
evidence 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15) that the personal data will be processed for the
set of purposes described, in addition to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U.
by another legal entity (EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U.). In this regard, the following is requested
information:
 
3.1. Reason that justifies that both entities process the personal data collected.
 
3.2. Detail of the circumstances that determine, if any, that the treatments
carried out on specific personal data are executed by one or the other
entity.
 
As these two questions are directly related to each other, the answer is
joint to them.
In relation to the evidence provided and that correspond to supports that are
used to carry out the contracting through the different channels is made
reference, both to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, and to EDP ENERGÍA S.A.U. (EDP
ENERGY), because the company with which the services are contracted will be one or
another depending on the product and/or service requested, being highly probable that
the same client when requesting the contracting of electricity and gas supply, is
contracting with both companies at the same time.
For this reason, the "dual" contract has been prepared and structured in such a way that a
customer can obtain discounts or additional benefits for hiring
both energies with two companies of the same business group, and in order to

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

21/141

keep updated the discounts in each of the energies and information
derived, it is necessary for both societies to know if the energy initially
contracted with the other Group company remains active in order to maintain and
correctly manage the discounts/advantages applied.
For this reason, and in order to provide the maximum possible transparency to a process
carried out eminently in writing, such as the contracting of services
energy, is why in the clause on data protection it is reported that
The personal data provided during the contracting process will be processed by
both entities, always respecting the functions of each one in accordance with the
contract signed in each case and particularly the type of energy services that
finally get hired.

On the other hand, and regardless of the foregoing, we inform that
Agency that the existence of two companies within the Group with the role of entities
marketers is due to a merely formal issue, a consequence of the
corporate structure and shareholding composition of the companies acquired by the
EDP Group at the time of its establishment in Spain, but not
corresponds to the operational functioning of said marketers, given that
only one of them, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, currently has
employees and management and operational capacity. Thus, in practice, all
Treatments are carried out by said entity, either as the person responsible for the
treatment or as in charge of the treatment of EDP ENERGÍA.

Additionally, indicate that the EDP Group had planned the corporate reorganization
of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA and EDP ENERGÍA and the adaptation of its structure
corporate identity with that of its actual operation and its business operations. Bliss
reorganization has currently been affected by a sale process to TOTAL
in which both companies are immersed, and if it materializes, it could alter or
complete this integration.
 
3.3. Details, where appropriate, of the procedures and mechanisms used to
guarantee the separation of the personal data processed by one and another entity of
so that each one only has the possibility of dealing with what corresponds to it according to
of the legitimate purpose pursued at all times.
 
As already stated, all users with access to the system are employees of
EDP MARKETING.
 
In this way, EDP agents access the personal data of EDP customers.
said entity as data controllers or have access to the
personal data of EDP ENERGÍA customers, in its capacity as Data Processor
Treatment, in compliance with the provision of customer management services of
EDP ENERGÍA that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has entrusted to it, being
managed as the two different roles they occupy by virtue of the
contractual regulation that we make available to this Agency.”

Together with said response, an extract from the Record of Treatment Activities is provided.
which includes the records relating to the activities carried out within the scope of the
contracting of products and/or services and the risk analysis carried out in relation to the

treatments that are carried out in the context of contracting products and/or
services.

exercise rights or service access. Regarding the potential assessment of the risk
inherent, the risk scale has 4 levels: low, with a rating from 0 to 12;
medium rating from 13 to 25; high from 26 to 38 and very high from 39 to 51. The assessment or
weight given to each of the risk factors is from 1 to 4. In the analysis of
risks, a yes or no is marked for each of the sales channels in each of the
15 risk factors listed above. The sum of the weight attributed to each of
the factors for each channel determine the inherent risk. The result of the risk
inherent is average in all contracting channels, except for web channels and
external forces through home visits in which the result of the risk
inherent is low. No risk correction measures are indicated.

SEVENTH: Information is obtained on the volume of sales of the entity being
the results of the turnover during the year 2019 of 989,491,000 euros. The
capital according to the information obtained from the Mercantile Registry is 1,487,895

supervision of the changes of marketer, corresponding to the first quarter of
2019, of the National Commission of Markets and Competition, the number of
supply points of the entity as of March 31, 2019, corresponding to the scope
domestic, amounted to 893,736, constituting 11.4% of the total gas sector in
this domestic sphere.

EIGHTH: On July 16, 2020, this Agency has received a written document from EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U stating that “In the framework of the above procedure
referenced EDP was required by the AEPD to clarify, among other things
extremes, certain information related to the contracting procedures
implanted in EDP carried out with the intervention of a third party authorized by the owner,
as well as address the suggestion made in previous procedures communicated by
part of the AEPD in which modifications were suggested in the way in which
that these types of contracts are made.
 
2. That, for all of the above, EDP has reviewed the procedure to be followed in the
contracting by third parties on behalf of the owner, in order to strengthen said
procedure and reduce the risks of possible identity theft carried out
in bad faith by the contracting party in this type of process, taking into account,
additionally, the particular needs identified due to the state of
alarm decreed last March and that has necessarily required that
All hiring is carried out remotely.

3. That in order to inform the AEPD of the specific actions that are
being carried out in relation to this matter by EDP, in compliance
of your duty of proactive compliance (accountability), we enclose the
"Procedure of contracting by third parties on behalf of the owner", so that they have
visibility on the modifications that are being implemented in said processes
in order to meet your request in this regard, as well as to highlight the
EDP's proactivity regarding its suggestion to adapt said
process."
 
Next, the following aspects are detailed in three sections: purpose,
contracting procedure with third parties and data and interests of those affected.

In the first section, called purpose after exposing the situation, it states the
following proposal: “A contracting procedure that, through correct use
and technology insurance, facilitate the contracting of EDP services by the

agent about your personal data, which will only be treated in accordance with
an adequate basis of legitimacy and in compliance with the principles of the RGPD,
ensuring that they are informed about the treatment and that they can exercise their
rights at all times, as well as act in case of identifying any action
irregular."

In the second section relating to the contracting procedure with third parties,
distinguishes the procedure followed with a representative with the written authorization of the
Followed with agent with verbal authorization. In the first case, the
following steps: the representative is informed, the data and authorization are collected and
contracts on behalf of the client. In the case of the agent with verbal authorization, the
The steps to follow are the following: EDP proceeds to the information to the
representative and collection of data, to contracting by the representative on behalf and
representation of the client, sending the client information about the contracting and
possibility for the client to disavow the contract.

With regard to information to the agent and collection of data consists,

distinguishing between incoming calls to the EDP CAC, in which the
conversation or outgoing calls (telemarketing, making calls by
EDP providers) in which the conversation is recorded, and the contract is sent in
durable support to the president. (It is clarified that the conversations are recorded after
having previously informed the user that the conversation will be recorded.
The following is noted regarding the step relating to sending information to the customer
about hiring.

TENTH: On July 31, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the EDP entity
COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/2016,
regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Treatment of
Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data (General Regulation of
Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD), for the alleged violation of article 25
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) of the aforementioned Regulation; for the alleged
infringement of article 6 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
Regulation; for the alleged infringement of article 22 of the RGPD, typified in the
Article 83.5.b) of the aforementioned Regulation; and for the alleged infringement of article 13 of the
RGPD, typified in article 83.5.b) of the aforementioned Regulation, determining that the
sanction that could correspond would amount to a total of 3,500,000.00 euros, without
prejudice to what results from the instruction.

 : Notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the investigated entity
ELEVENTH
 
presented on August 4, 2020 a letter in which he requested an extension of the term to the
purpose of submitting claims. Granted the extension of the term, they presented
allegations on 08/24/2020 which are mainly the following:

FIRST: ALLEGED BREACH OF THE PRIVACY PRINCIPLE BY
DESIGN IN CONTRACTING PROCESSES THROUGH REPRESENTATIVE.

The AEPD intends to justify the initiation of this disciplinary proceeding in the alleged
non-existence of documentation that has never been requested. In this regard, it must
It should be noted that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has a methodology for
risk identification, analysis and management, both to identify risks
inherent, and specifically to assess the need for the realization of the
Impact Assessments, alleges that it includes as an annex the documentation
justification that amply proves that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA complies
fully and fully with these obligations and that is specified in the following: -
“Risk Analysis Methodology and Impact Assessments” -
“Record of Treatment activities and risk assessment of treatments
related to the contracting of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA” - “Evaluation of
Privacy Impact: Channel of Leads to Convert by Telemarketing” - “Evaluation
Privacy Impact: Telemarketing to clients for upselling or recovery of
dropouts” - “Privacy Impact Assessment: CAC Channel to Clients OR Clients

customers or potential customers (Reactive Sales)” - “Impact Assessment of
Privacy: Outside Stores Channel for sale to potential customers (Reactive Sales)” -
“Privacy Impact Assessment: External sales forces through booths
in fairs and shopping centers (reactive sales)” - “Impact Assessment of
Privacy: Treatment activity: Scoring of B2C Clients prior to
the hiring".
Likewise, and as a consequence of the measures adopted as a result of the
recommendations derived from risk analyzes and impact assessments
carried out by EPD marketer, a large number have been developed by the DPD
of procedures for compliance with data protection obligations
from the design and by default that are provided as Annex 2: Specifically,
include in this Annex 2 the following procedures related to Privacy

from the Design and by Default, which are part of the System of Government, Risks and
Data protection regulatory compliance of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA: •
EDP Data Protection by Design and Default Methodology •
Operational instruction Privacy By Design and Privacy by Default of the commercial area •

It is really striking that the AEPD grants the relevance it grants to the fact
specifically that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA had not taken into consideration in
its risk analysis, the specific analysis of the risks associated with the possibility
contracting through a representative, when the AEPD itself, in its own "Guide
Risk Analysis Practice in data processing subject to the RGPD”
(published on its website (https://www.aepd.es/sites/default/files/2019-09/guiaanalisis-de-
risks-rgpd.pdf) does not contain any direct or indirect reference to the need
to assess the specific risk in relation to data processing, either in
contracting or in other processes, carried out by authorized third parties.

Second, it alleges that all data processing carried out by
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA were analyzed to verify their degree of compliance
of the obligations related to RGPD, proposing measures for its correct
adaptation, regardless of whether assessments were necessary
impact or not. Delving into the specific risk related to the contracting carried out
by third parties, it must be indicated that the content of the analyzes carried out was
updated at the time, taking into account the considerations that the AEPD has
transferred to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in the administrative procedure
related to this issue that began at the end of 2019 and that, we understand,
is the cause of the sanctioning procedure in which we find ourselves in these
moments. Indeed, as we have already had the opportunity to expose in the framework
of said sanctioning procedure previously initiated by the AEPD, the processes
contracting through authorized third parties had not been identified by the
of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA as an inherent risk factor that would be
relevant, taking into account that: 1) The virtual inexistence of claims for
part of customers in connection with this reason. 2) EDP COMERCIALIZADORA does not
Until now, there were no disciplinary proceedings open for this reason.
3) The contracting carried out through a third party as verbal agent is
expressly recognized in the Civil Code of 1889.

Although the potential risks identified by the AEPD are perfectly possible,
the probability of materialization of said risks, in the specific case of EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, was practically nil and that therefore their diligence, in what
regarding the performance of the risk analysis, has been amply accredited.
Specifically, this fact is based on the very low number of claims for
this reason that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has received. Indeed, there is one (1)
single claim with respect to a total of 33,848 contracts made, as
It is stated in the information provided in the file itself, what we understand, that
as the AEPD will surely agree with EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, in
probabilistic terms, it could be considered a value that, objectively, does not

It asserts that the possibility of concluding a contract between two parties through the
intermediation of a third party is an exclusive matter of Civil Law, so the
need, or not, of formalities associated with the accreditation of the representation has
to be governed by the provisions of the Civil Code and, where appropriate, by the provisions of the
consumer protection regulations. In this regard, the requirement by the
AEPD that the representation referred to by the representative is recorded in a medium that
allows its accreditation could be considered logical in an isolated interpretation of
data protection regulations, but it loses meaning when put into context
with the rest of the legal system, more specifically, with the provisions of the Code
Civil, which contemplates, among others, the possibility of contracting by representative
collected in article 1259, or the figure of the “mandate”, regulated in articles 1709
to 1739 of the same and that establish that: "by the mandate contract, a
person to provide a service or do something for the account or commission of another” and
for which total freedom of form is allowed, establishing that «the mandate can
be express or implied" and that, likewise, "acceptance may also be express or
tacit, the latter deducted from the acts of the president. In this case, it does not seem
that such a wide freedom of form is compatible with obtaining evidence of
the existence of the representation or the mandate, beyond the manifestations of the
agent, protected by contractual good faith. Also, it is little
It is understandable that a separate consent is required for the treatment of
your data or a confirmation of the order by the principal, since this
would imply distorting the representation, since it would be absurd that whoever is
appointed to enter into a contract in favor of a third party cannot provide
the data of the person on whose behalf it acts, or that confirmation is necessary
separate from it to authorize said communication, since the need to
addressing the principal directly would make the intervention of the representative useless,
because it would be meaningless.

Likewise, and in relation to the possibility that the principal may provide
additional consents to the contract itself, it should be noted that this
possibility may well have been authorized by the principal in a
specific, but by governing the same freedom of form for the granting of this
authority (which the rule does not oblige in any case to have in writing), nor is it
Reliable accreditation is required at the time of contracting. About this
In particular, it should be noted that to date there have been no assumptions in the
that no type of incidents have been reported by those represented
related to the granting of said consents.

With regard to other risks identified by the AEPD, it should be noted that the
risk of identity theft is very low, since the representative is identified
personally by reliable means when the hiring is face-to-face and
providing your ID data when you do it remotely. However, as well
the AEPD knows the theory of risks, it does not maintain that the existence of a low risk
could be considered a non-existent risk. In this sense, the risks of the existence
identity theft do not differ from those that correspond to the
contracts in their own name, since the same checks are carried out for
avoid it, based on the risks and threats detected in relation to each form
hiring. For all these reasons, it cannot be taken for granted that this risk has not been
taken into consideration by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, nor that they have not been
adopted measures aimed at its mitigation, as will be explained below

in the explanation regarding the contracting procedure. On the other hand, in what
refers to the potential economic damages, although this is a more
linked again to the civil field of contracting than to data protection
personal, it must be indicated that in the cases in which the annulment of the
contracts for any reason, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA assumes the costs of the
services provided, so there would be no economic damage to the
affected, proof of this is that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has not received until
time no claim for the alleged damages put forward by the
AEPD

Regarding the way in which the contracting is carried out, as was already stated and it is
both in the information made available to that Agency and in the Background
de Facto of the Home Agreement, the contracting of the services is preceded by a
series of guarantees that allow identifying the author of the contracts, following the
common practices throughout the supply services contracting sector and
companies of what is known as "Utilities", both in person and remotely,
leaving this information registered, so that, in the event of any
incident there is proof of who is the person who has carried out the
hiring. Contrary to the insignificance that the AEPD intends to grant to the
declaration of the representative, perfectly identified, on his condition of
representative of the person on whose behalf you contract, it should be noted that this
manifestation has binding legal consequences, which, as already stated,
are subject to regulation and are expressly recognized by our
Legal System, and that imply responsibilities, both from the point of
civil view, as criminal, so it is not a "mere demonstration", as the
comes to denominate the AEPD in the Foundations of Law of its writing of initiation of
sanctioning procedure, but rather it is a legal act, such as the
own consent of the owner, defined by the RGPD itself as a "manifestation
of will”. Consequently, it does not appear that a legal defense can be made
discrimination of the relevance of some manifestations compared to others, due to the fact that
that are collected or not within a specific regulation, or manifested in a
form, or another. Similarly, as stated in the factual records, although
later it seems to be ignored in the Foundations of Law, in all cases
in which the contracting is carried out remotely, it is indicated that: "To the holder of the contract,
informative purposes, it is sent to you in duplicate, with a stamped envelope, the
contractual documentation in compliance with the provisions of the regulations of
consumer and user protection. That is why, in any case, the holder
has the possibility of knowing the terms in which the

 Notwithstanding all of the above, as a result of the sanctioning procedures opened in
the year 2019, and following the criteria transferred by the AEPD in the resolution of the
PS/0025/2019 (do not sign on the day of the presentation of this document, due to being appealed)
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has proceeded to identify the risk
related to the intervention of third parties in the contracting, making the
corresponding detailed analysis of this matter and have elaborated
proposals for improvement, in order to comply with the considerations of the AEPD of

the contracting process, nor the possibility of revoking such consents. 4) not
effective dates of implementation of this procedure are indicated.

negatively interpret information whose content is not clear to him. Nope

COMERCIALIZADORA, is to achieve a procedure that allows not only to give
compliance with the different contracting modalities provided for in the Civil Code,
recognized by the consumer authorities and the competent courts in matters

we proceed to clarify what we understand would be the only doubts of the AEPD in
in relation to the modifications to the contracting procedure submitted: 1) The

EDP COMERCIALIZADORA works, including the "Leads" and any other that in the
future implement EDP COMERCIALIZADORA. 2) Regarding the question raised in
around what would happen in the event that the contracting person does not have
none of the means provided to carry out the confirmation of the contract

revoke them, it should be noted that the communication gives access to the
contractual documentation, where each of the consents is stated. The
user, once this information is known, has the possibility of modifying them. Nope
However, following the comment of the AEPD in which it questions the validity of the

this purpose and will obtain the additional consents directly from the owner. 4) In
Regarding the implementation date, it depends precisely on the opinion that
about this procedure the AEPD manifests, since it would not make sense to put it

associated with this implementation, in addition to the resources of time and dedication

 It is alleged that the alleged breach of the obligations of article 25 RGPD, and

It alleges that it is interested in stating that the treatment relating to the creation of
a commercial profile based on the information of third parties for the referral of
advertising information is not, in practice, being carried out, nor at the date of
issuance of these allegations, nor prior to them. For the
Therefore, the treatment that could potentially have been carried out has not had
place in any case, at any time, so that, even if it can be questioned
from the perspective of the other requirements of the RGPD, it is not possible to attribute to EDP
MARKETING COMPANY carrying out an unlawful conduct that may be
punishable derived from the mere obtaining of the consents related to a
data processing that, to date, has been non-existent and therefore has not
generated the alleged damage to the fundamental rights of citizens
wielded by this Agency. The commission of the reference infraction, regulated in the
Article 83.5 (a) RGPD and 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, necessarily requires that
a treatment has actually been caused and that there has been no
identified or the adequate legal basis has not been regularized, stating: “1.

following: (...) b. The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679”.

In relation to informed consent, in the Agreement to Start the Procedure
Sanctioning party to consider that the required consent is not valid, it is based on
the consideration that the information provided to the interested party is not
sufficient, insofar as neither what third-party databases are going to be consulted nor
what type of data will be collected, so that the interested party does not know
absolutely what it is that you are consenting to. And it is appreciated that a single
consent for two different purposes. In this regard, it is alleged that the
information is provided in accordance with the good practices enunciated by the company itself.

through the double layer system, so that the interested party can reinforce
the information provided through the query contained therein, through the
different mechanisms that are granted for this purpose (informative locution, reverse of the
physical document or website of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

In relation to the absence of clear identification of third-party sources or the
categories of data, it should be noted that such information may be derived from the
information provided to the client in the first layer (by clearly identifying that the
treatment will be carried out with third-party sources) as in the second layer, whose
content is contained in the section called "general conditions of the contract",

whose content indicates: "(II) The elaboration of commercial profiles of the Client
by aggregating EDP databases with data from
databases of third parties, in order to offer the Client products and services
customized, thus improving the customer experience. (III) The adoption of
automated decisions, such as allowing the hiring, or not, of certain
products and/or services based on the Client's profile and particularly, on data
such as, the history of non-payments, the history of contracts, permanence,
locations, consumption data, types of devices connected to the energy network, and
similar data that allow knowing in greater detail the risks associated with the
hiring. (iv) Based on the results obtained from the aggregation of the
indicated data, EDP may make personalized offers and specifically
aimed at achieving the contracting of certain EDP products and/or services.”
As reflected in the cited text, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has identified
in extensive detail the types of data that are processed for the detailed purposes, being
sources consulted for this an obvious derivation of the above.

The indication made about obtaining third-party sources is therefore
sufficient content for the user to be fully aware that their
authorization will suppose the possibility that the authorized entity can obtain said
information. It must be remembered that there is no legal requirement that imposes that, in the
At the time of collecting the data of the interested party, the questioned information must
be contemplated directly in the requested consent. That is, being the
origin of the data the interested party, it is only up to the Entity to inform
in accordance with the provisions of article 13 RGPD, a provision that does not establish, in
none of its precepts, the obligation to identify neither the source nor the type of
the data. Only in the event that said treatment had been reached

It should be noted that, in the event that data has been obtained from
a third party, would be the one who, in his capacity as transferor of the data, would be obliged to
legitimize the communication of the data on the basis of the consent of the interested party,
notwithstanding that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA would also do so, in compliance with its
information obligation once obtained data from a third party of
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD. In this sense, such a situation could only
occur, in the event that the interested party, exercising his right to dispose of
the data and with full awareness of it, would have expressed their authorization to
that your personal data travel to another company, such as EDP
MARKETER, who could only make use of them, in the event of
who had also expressed their consent, by marking the
box or the express indication, indicating that "Yes" in case of making
telephonically.

On the other hand, in relation to the alleged accumulation of treatment purposes,
when pointing out that the interested party would authorize the sending of advertising and, secondly, the
use so that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA can assess the viability of the
contracting by said user. In relation to this point, we must

state that the assessment made by the AEPD is based on an erroneous premise,
consider that they are two different treatments, in a case in which
it is clear that it is a single purpose, such as the generation of a profile
commercial, whose use is limited to two contexts linked to each other: (i) the first,
to carry out the assessment of the possibility of contracting and, (ii) the second, to
issue the corresponding commercial offers to the user in question. Thus,
both assumptions are necessarily interrelated, since there is no
doubt that it would be meaningless to design a customer profile, based on the data
provided by the user and those derived from the service provided, for the referral of a
commercial offer that was sent to an interested party who did not meet the parameters
internal of the Entity to carry out a contract at the time of your request.
In relation to this aspect, it is well known by this company that the RGPD requires
that the consents that are collected are specific, as well as it is
unanimous criterion of the control authorities point out that the grouping of purposes
related to each other, as would happen in this case, has a full place in said
concept, without such grouping giving rise to the consideration, per se, that it has not been
specifically obtained consent. In this area, the approach
on which the AEPD maintains the non-compliance attributed to EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, ignores the regulation established by the LOPGDD, in which
Article 6.2 states that: “2. When it is intended to base the processing of data on
the consent of the affected party for a plurality of purposes will be necessary to
It is specifically and unequivocally stated that said consent is granted for
All of them." In light of the above, there is an evident specific regulation that
enables the grouping of purposes that the AEPD is now questioning

As an additional matter, it is indicated by this Agency that the consent obtained
is not in accordance with the regulations, considering that it is not explicit, but
obtained in the same way as a general consent, although there are no
clearly identified the reasons why it would not meet the criteria
issued. For these purposes, the inclusion of the analyzed consent is carried out in a
separate context to the acceptance of the contract itself, so that either
is collected in a box in those contexts in which there is documentary support
for it, or in an informative locution that is read and that must be
expressly ratified by the interested party to understand that it has been provided

determine that a consent deserves to be considered explicit (understood
as a reinforced consent to the one already required by the RGPD), in the aforementioned
Guideline 5/2020 mentions various nuances that help in this clarification. Of
it is extracted that, in addition to meeting the requirements defined in the
article 7 GDPR, the validity of an explicit consent does not require the attention of
exact requirements, which may be valid both in written documents and in
telephone recordings. At this point, it is interesting to emphasize an issue
essential: although there is neither a legal precept nor an opinion from the authorities
of control that clearly determine the requirements to consider that the
consent obtained is explicit, nor the differences that correspond to the
“regular” consent, yes, it is attributed to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, and to
any other entities that act as data controllers, the work
to define at its own discretion in which situations such requirement shall be understood to have been fulfilled.
Said casuistry can only cause serious legal insecurity, which in the
course that concerns us is not solved, not even with the foundation that

It is stated in the document of the Agreement to Start the sanctioning procedure, since in
At no time is it clearly stated what factor, element or action has not been
executed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, to determine that its conduct has
unlawful result and that deserves a sanction of such magnitude. According to
this, the request to the client of an obvious action, such as the verbal indication that
yes consent or the marking of a box, whose content clearly exposes the
purposes for which the data will be used, which is unrelated to any other
acceptance and that is not subject to other purposes, must be considered as a
explicit consent in order to comply with the obligation imposed by the
data protection regulations. In view of the extremes mentioned, EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA complies with all the requirements
legally required, from which it must necessarily be concluded that the work of the
Entity to obtain the consent of the client, in an explicit way, have been
rigorously attended. Proof of this is that, both in telephone channels,
such as those in which they are carried out in writing, obtaining the consent
is carried out differently from the contract itself, it is stated that it is
additional to it and is understood to be collected, only, in cases in which the
client checks the box or clearly states that they do consent. Of all this there is no
more than concluding that the consent collection process has been carried out at the
light of the criteria required by the applicable regulations, being therefore adjusted to
Law.

Thus, the process of obtaining consent that EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA has been using is not something new for the AEPD, who has
had the opportunity to analyze it prior to the start of this file
sanctioning party, in those files (requirements for information and/or
sanctioning procedures) open due to any claim of any
Username. Within the framework of these, the AEPD had full knowledge of the process of
contracting and the type of consent obtained from the interested parties,
as the contracts were provided by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA as evidence
of compliance. Needless to say, the end result of both turned out to be that of the
filing of the same (see the claims with reference E/00915/2019, which neither
was not even admitted for processing, and file E/02714/2019), without any
additional assessments on compliance with the regulations, which leaves no more
to delve into the bewilderment that this party has in the face of the very serious accusations
discharged on EDP COMERCIALIZADORA by this Agency.

Additionally, and without prejudice to the arguments set forth, it is noteworthy that
presumption made in the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure, in which
the valuation relative to the infractions is carried out taking as a premise a double
attribution: (i) the first, derived from the absence of adequate information and, (ii) the
second, as a consequence of the execution of a non-consensual treatment. To these
purposes, it should be noted that, even if the information provided
to the interested party is deficient, this fact cannot lead to the determination of a
infringement of article 6 RGPD, since the treatment that would be carried out takes
as a starting point the adequate legitimizing base. Thus, the definition
made by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA regarding the legal basis that would allow it to

RGPD, in relation to its article 6.

THIRD. - ALLEGED NON-COMPLIANCE IN RELATION TO THE
DATA PROCESSING RELATED TO AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND
PREPARATION OF CUSTOMER PROFILES.

Thirdly, the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure establishes in its
Basis of Law IV a series of alleged breaches linked to the
apparent lack of observance by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA of the
obligations derived from the provisions of article 22 of the RGPD, regarding the
consideration by the AEPD of the existence of an impediment, the
obstruction or repeated non-attention to the exercise of the rights established in
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to decisions
automated and the preparation of customer profiles, typified in article 83.5.b)
RGPD and, qualified as a very serious breach for the purposes of prescription in the
Article 72.1.k) of the LOPDGDD. Specifically, the AEPD maintains that: 1) EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA does not grant the possibility to users to exercise their right
regarding not being the subject of automated decisions, as well as not granting the user the
due information regarding this right, 2) The user is unaware of the possibility of
refuse to make such decisions. Thus, the proposed penalty
by the AEPD starts from the fact that the information provided by EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA to the holders of the data is insufficient and imprecise, without
damage that is recognized by the AEPD that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
facilitates and makes available to users the documents with information related to the
compliance with data protection regulations, both at the time of
contract, as in durable support at the end of the contract.

Firstly, regarding the information provided by EDP
MARKETING COMPANY in relation to the legitimate basis (consent in the
case that concerns us) we must emphasize that the information that is provided to the
users regarding the treatments that, being additional to the contract itself
same, require the consent of the user, is duly provided to the
users. Specifically, in the so-called Evidence 6 presented by EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA during the substantiation of the informative file of which the
This sanctioning file brings cause, it is reflected in the contract model

once the contractual relationship has ended, to carry out
commercial communications adapted to my profile of products and services related to the
energy supply and consumption. Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments
during the term and after the end of the contract, on products and services not

resources, both from EDP Group companies and from third parties. ☐ I consent to the
treatment of my personal data for the elaboration of my commercial profile with
information from third-party databases, for the adoption, by
EDP, of automated decisions in order to send commercial proposals
personalized, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting of certain
services” In this case, and expanding information regarding the processing of data
of users in the general conditions, we find the following information;
“As long as the client has explicitly accepted it, their personal data will be
treated, even once the contractual relationship has ended and provided that no
produces opposition to said treatment, for: (I) The promotion of services
financial, payment protection services, automotive or related and electronics,
own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or participation in contests
promotions, as well as for the presentation of commercial proposals linked
to the energy sector after the end of the contract, (II) Profiling
Customer's business by aggregating third-party databases, with
in order to offer the Client personalized products and services, thus improving the
customer experience, (III) The adoption of automated decisions, such as
allow the contracting, or not, of certain products and/or services based on the
Customer profile and particularly, in data such as the history of non-payments, the
hiring history, permanence, locations, consumption data, types of
devices connected to the energy network, and similar data that allow knowing
in greater detail the risks associated with contracting. (IV) Based on the
results obtained from the aggregation of the indicated data, EDP may carry out
personalized offers, and specifically aimed at achieving the hiring of
products and/or services of EDP or third parties depending on whether the client so
has consented or not, being in any case processed data whose age is not
will exceed a year. In the event that this process is carried out
automated, the client will always have the right to obtain human intervention by
part of EDP, admitting the challenge and, where appropriate, assessment of the decision
resulting.

From these fragments, it can only be concluded that (i) both for the preparation of
profiles, such as for data processing by adopting automated decisions EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA requests the explicit and specific consent of the user, without
that can be interpreted that the adoption of automated decisions is treated under
other legitimizing basis, as well as that (ii) the information related to the preparation of
profiles and automated decisions, complies with the requirements of article 13 of the
RGPD, since it informs about the existence of automated decisions, including the
profiling and provides meaningful information about the applied logic, as well as
as the significance and anticipated consequences of such processing for the
interested. For all these reasons and taking into account the first aspect raised by the
AEPD regarding the alleged breach committed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
in relation to the information provided to users to obtain the
specific consent, there is no interpretation regarding the lack of
confusing information and processing by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, which
includes the information corresponding to the specific treatments, facilitating all the
information required in the RGPD.
 
Secondly, in relation to the information provided to the owners of the data
With respect to

COMERCIALIZADORA expressly informs users of the information that
facilitates its specific right to "oppose" "the adoption of decisions
automated processing of your personal data, requiring human intervention in the
process, as well as to challenge the decisions that are finally adopted by virtue of
of the processing of your data” In this sense, the AEPD considers that EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA fails to comply with its obligation to inform the holders of the data
by the mere fact that the information provided does not appear, expressly and
literal the right to “revoke consent”, appearing in its place the verb that
grants the right of the owners of the data to “oppose” to “the adoption of
automated decisions of your personal data, requiring the intervention
in the process, as well as to challenge the decisions that are ultimately
adopted by virtue of the processing of your data”. We are sure that the nuance
semantic and technical associated with both verbs "opposition" and "revocation", both
experts that the AEPD has, such as those that EDP has
COMERCIALIZADORA are able to differentiate between them, and determine which
It deals with two legal concepts, but that Agency will also agree with us,
than the average user (a concept widely used by that Agency throughout
throughout the procedure that concerns us) will hardly be able to differentiate these
concepts. In the case at hand, what is really important is the effect that
in practice have the user's request, which, ultimately, is the one that is relevant
for the owner of the data, and that generates positive or negative effects on their rights
fundamental, this being what the RGPD really protects, and not the use of
one verb or another, even more so when they can be used as synonyms.

In this case, the only thing that is intended to be used in the information that is provided to the
users the term "opposition" regarding automated decisions, is to be able to
provide the user with a clear, concise and transparent understanding of the information that
is made available to you, and facilitating, in the event that the request of said interested party
complies with the regulatory requirements, the exercise of the different
Rights. Thus, according to the definition contained in the RAE Dictionary, revoking
means "to render without effect"; and to oppose, “to put something against another thing to prevent its
effect”, so except for those who have knowledge in the matter and
can appreciate the nuance that differentiates one from the other, the truth is that, for purposes of
majority of the population, both terms would be synonymous and would suppose, in the
practice, same thing.

Notwithstanding all of the foregoing, we must highlight, by the
relevance that this has in this allegation, the information contained in Clause 16
of the General Conditions of Contract, regarding data protection. In
said clause, in the section corresponding to "Rights of the owner of the data"
expressly refers to the possibility of revoking the consent previously
granted, thus, it is expressly indicated "(VII) Withdraw, at any time,
the consents granted.

It refers to its internal procedure, and states that therefore, not only the
Users are informed at all times of the possibility of revoking the
consents granted, but that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA itself, as
internal procedure and in order that those in charge of managing the
applications have the necessary knowledge in relation to the different
possibilities, expressly express said right, regardless of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

38/141

technical term used, since the main purpose is to inform and that the user
know the possibility of not being subject to automated decisions. Thus, the
internal procedure referenced above even includes models of
response to be able to attend to the different requests in general. All this,
without prejudice to the fact that each one of the requests is treated in a particular way and in accordance
to the specific circumstances affecting the specific case, and it is necessary to
adaptation of said response model depending on the specific casuistry of
each request. Annex 3 provides the procedure related to the management and
answering the exercises of rights.

In view of the foregoing, the AEPD addresses the lack of knowledge of the average user,
as an argument to consider informative clauses as not very transparent,
aspect that nevertheless considers substantially essential when relating only
as a valid exercise the opposition of the interested party. Considering that the right
related to not being subject to automated decisions is collected with
independent and express character in the general contracting conditions,
requiring, where appropriate, the explicit and specific consent of the user, and
being the same duly reporting specifically, as
is justified by the evidence provided, as well as the possibility of opposing
to be subject to automated decisions, it is at least surprising that the
AEPD considers that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA does not comply with article 22 RGPD
for not offering the client the possibility to “revoke consent” literally, it is
that is, a strictly formal and semantic aspect, that an average user without
knowledge in the matter does not have the capacity to understand the difference with the
word “opposition”, understanding that Agency that it is not valid to report the
possibility of “opposing”, as a synonym, such treatment, which is what
effectively carries out EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

In line with the above, it should be noted that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, in
No case has denied the exercise of rights that have not been
requested/drafted with precise character, directing in case of doubt the request to the
user, so that it can be resolved effectively, satisfactorily and without
procrastination

Likewise, as has already been reflected in previous points, in relation to the
automated decisions, the possibility is offered to the client to obtain intervention
human, admitting challenge and, where appropriate, assessment of the resulting decision,
which is why, in addition to informing about the possibility of not being subject to
automated decisions, the client is empowered as an alternative to intervene
human. For all of the above, it cannot be reasonably interpreted that the holder of
the data may, even remotely, be unaware of the possibility or right to
that your data is not subject to automated decisions, nor that EDP
COMERCIALIZADOR places limitations, or does not make available to said
interested parties the necessary mechanisms to be able to make the request, being able to
any time "oppose" such treatment, or better said, "revoke" the
consent given for the adoption of such decisions, as well as to request
human intervention, which on the other hand, in the case of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
always occurs, because although the query of the information is automated,
the final decision is made by an employee after analyzing its content. I know

effects that the AEPD can know, first hand, what kind of rights are
exercised by the holders, in what modality they are received, as well as specifically
how they are duly attended to by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

Furthermore, and in order to address the true scope of the alleged
infraction, despite the fact that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA includes the possibility of
carry out profiling and adopt automated decisions, the only profiling carried out is
the one related to the qualification of clients in terms of fraud prevention,
treatment for which there is legal authorization and is based on the interest

may have been affected by said treatments, so we refer to the
extensive jurisprudence previously enunciated in this section for being of full
application to the case at hand.

 This is enough so that there is no basis whatsoever in order to attribute to my client
any infraction of those typified in article 83.5.b) RGPD in relation to its
cited article 22, however, for dialectic purposes and in the unlikely event that
If the commission of said infraction could be considered proven, we state what

Thus, in relation to the quantification of the specific sanction for the alleged

assess the aspects set forth in this section, and in accordance with the criteria
evaluators collected in the RGPD;
  "The nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction" taking into account the same
criterion "the nature, purpose of the treatment operation in question as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;" As stated in this section, the information
provided to users does not constitute an infringement, since there is no breach by
part of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, being even more decisive, that the
number of people affected by the treatments related to profiling and the adoption of
automated decisions, is null and therefore the damages that may have
be caused, are non-existent. Similarly, by not assuming an illegal action, nor having
materialized it is not possible that it has been dilated in time, reason
for which, and taking into account the specific circumstances, when qualifying the
potential administrative fine to be imposed would be a mitigating criterion.
In any case, it should be remembered that in order to qualify as aggravating the
damages caused to those affected, in addition to materializing, the same
must be accredited and demonstrated, an aspect that in no case has been
proven, nor exposed in the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure.

“The intentionality or negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction;” Just like
It follows from these allegations, neither EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has had
any intention to infringe data protection regulations, or to cause damage or
prejudice to any user, nor has there been any negligence in their actions. to major
abundance, there is no evidence that there may be negligence and much
least one intention on the part of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, which is why
which, the potential applicable sanction should be reduced.

“The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal information;" The main activity of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is not based
in the processing of personal data, but in the energy supply,
assuming the linking of the activity with the performance of the treatment in
question, minimal. Reason for which, said aspect would appear as extenuating,
reducing the potential applicable sanction.
“The continuing nature of the offense;” “High volume of data and processing
which constitutes the object of the file;” and “High number of interested parties;” As
that in other criteria indicated individually, these three criteria remain
subsumed with the one raised in the first place, and from article 83.2 a) of the
RGPD, so its evaluation must be carried out jointly with the indicated and, therefore,
Therefore, do not suppose an additional aspect to the one mentioned for the calculation of the potential
applicable penalty.
 
In view of completing the evaluative criteria, it is convenient to mention the
following:

Note that these procedures are part of the measures and proactive attitude of
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, in no case could the omission of actions be interpreted,
nor passivity of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

  “e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;" It should be noted that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has not been
claimed, nor has he been sanctioned by said precepts at any time, for
there are neither procedures nor previous sanctions, what is more, as we have already
exposed in previous points, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has been implementing
new measures to alleviate any potentially compromised situation, acting
always diligently.

In this case, not only is the rationale embodied in the Agreement of
Start to interpret violation of article 22 of the RGPD -related to decisions
automated individuals, including profiling - but the amount
proposal for the alleged infringement, amounting to 1,000,000 euros, is the point
What has most surprised this part. All this because:
 1) EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has not been sanctioned, has not been involved in
any procedure for infringement of article 22 of the RGPD nor has it received
any claim in relation to an alleged violation of this provision,
2) in the history of procedures published by the AEPD itself, there are no
sanctions covered by non-compliance with the aforementioned normative precept.

  In other words, not only are there no records in which EDP has been a part
COMERCIALIZADORA, but there are also no prior sanctions by the
Control Authority that have been based on the violation of article 22 of the RGPD.
For all these reasons, the fact that the infraction is considered very serious and the sanction
proposal amounts to said high amount, requires that it be substantiated with
exhaustive character, since it escapes from any criterion followed until now
by the AEPD.

COMERCIALIZADORA has acted collaboratively and proactively, contributing in
at all times the information and documentation requested by the AEPD in time and
form. For this reason, said aspect would appear as a mitigating factor, reducing the

Home is neither duly substantiated nor motivated in accordance with the provisions of
regulations, the decision to impose an administrative fine, much less, a

Agreement, since as we have indicated in this section, the arguments expressed
by the AEPD to sanction under the legal precept contained in article 22 of the RGPD
and 72.1 k) of the LOPDGDD, are not given.

In this sense, in addition to informing in accordance with the applicable regulations, and granting
also to users the possibility of exercising their rights, EDP

28001 – Madrid

COMERCIALIZADORA does not carry out treatment based on decisions
automated outside of what is strictly necessary to carry out the prevention of
fraud. Reason for which neither the alleged infraction has been committed, nor are there
sufficient arguments to consider infringed the precepts mentioned in the
this section. Furthermore, throughout this procedure, there has been no evidence of
existence of infringement due to breach of article 22 RGPD, nor has
fully substantiated the seriousness, nor the criteria that allow setting such
high amount of penalty in this case.

FOURTH.- ALLEGED BREACH IN RELATION TO THE DUTY TO
TRANSPARENCY.

The AEPD, in its Agreement to Initiate Sanctioning Procedure, attributes to EDP
MARKETER the infringement of Article 13 of the RGPD, assuming a
breach of duty of information that is proper to him as responsible for the
treatment, typified in article 83.5.b) and classified as mild for the purposes of
prescription in article 74.a) of the LOPDGDD. Specifically, consider the
existence of said infraction due to:
 1) lack of information to the interested parties about the possibility of accessing information
required in article 13 of the RGPD.
2) the web address provided does not lead directly to the required information
in accordance with article 13 of the RGPD, without allowing immediate access to the
information, nor is access easy for anyone. EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA has no other choice but to state, once again, and as it has
fact and demonstrated in the rest of the alleged breaches alleged by this
Agency, which cannot share the assessments made by the AEPD, so
Next, the reasons why he understands that effectively,
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA fully complies with the requirements demanded by the
data protection regulations in terms of transparency in relation to the
information provided to the holders of personal data in the processes of
hiring.

As regards the CAC inbound channel, on which it is stated that the information

rights that attend the interested parties, as well as where to find information

which not only means that this information is provided to them in the call in which they go

make a payment, request an installment or file a claim).

In this sense, it should be noted that the RGPD itself expressly provides in its
point 13.4 that: “The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply

EDP data, at the following postal address: Plaza del Fresno, 2 33007 Oviedo or at
the email dpd.es@edpenergia.es, in the event that you understand that it has been violated
any of your rights related to data protection, or where appropriate,
file a claim with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection in the
address Calle de Jorge Juan, 6, 28001 Madrid"

Next, it is indicated by that Agency that "the provisions of the
Article 11.1 of the LOPDGDD in the other two telephone channels (Telemarketing and
Leads), nor is the interested party informed that they can access all the information required
in accordance with article 13 RGPD at the indicated electronic address. Nevertheless,
such affirmation is made after reproducing the AEPD the texts in which it informs the
clients of the identity of the person in charge of the treatment, the purposes of the treatment,
as well as the rights they can exercise and the website where they can obtain information
additional. Therefore, it does not seem that such a statement corresponds to the reality of the
facts, so we understand that the Agency will see fit to modify and eliminate this
alleged non-compliance in its draft resolution proposal.

The analysis continues by referring to the fact that the general conditions of
contracting to which the information is sent, indicating that those hosted on the web
they are not easily accessible. In this regard, it is interesting to specify that:

1) Article 11 of the LOPGDD refers to the fact that this information must be provided to the
interested "indicating an electronic address or other means that allows access to
simple and immediate way to the rest of the information" and that, in this case, as
informs the interested party in the locution, after contracting a copy of the
contract in which, obviously, the general contracting conditions are included,
therefore, direct access to said information is provided. Complementarily,
This information is available at all times on the web.
2) Faced with the alleged difficulty alluded to by the AEPD in finding the aforementioned
general conditions contrasts the fact that, as exemplified, a simple
search to access them directly, using the search engine
available on the website. Performing the search for "contract conditions"
or "general contracting conditions", the first results are published
documents related to the general contracting conditions that are of
application in both Spanish, Galician, Catalan, and Basque, leaving
clearly identified the documentation that refers directly to the document
in PDF format, as evidenced at the following address:
https://www.edpenergia.es/resources/doc/comercial/2019/09/10/condicionesgenerales-
contracting.pdf

3) Regarding what is required to be "searched in the general conditions (which
include numerous aspects related to contracting) the information related to the
data protection”, it must be made clear that the general conditions
They are composed of four pages, of which practically one of them is
is exclusively dedicated to providing information on the treatment of
personal data made by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, as we are
insurance that the AEPD has been able to verify during the procedure for preparing
your sanction proposal letter.

In relation to this alleged non-compliance, it is worth mentioning the guidelines
provided by the Article 29 Working Group, in which it recommends including the
access to information regarding the processing of personal data through
means in which the interested party can immediately recognize where and how
access this information, (direct links or in the form of an answer to a question
in natural language, in the FAQ section, or pop-ups).

 However, it also states that "depending on the circumstances of the collection
and data processing, a data controller could be forced to
use additionally. [...]”. Other possible ways of transmitting the information to the
interested parties derived from the following different environments of personal data could
include the following modes, listed below, applicable to the
relevant environments. a) On paper, for example, when concluding contracts by means
postcards: written explanations, brochures, information in contract documents,
cartoons, infographics or flow charts; b) By phone: explanations
verbal expressions directly by a person to allow a conversation and the
response to questions, or automated or pre-recorded information with the possibility of
hear more detailed additional information;

The Article 29 Working Group, solely and exclusively provides this information to
recommendation mode, without in any case being considered a bad practice,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

46/141

nor of course a regulatory breach the fact of making the publication to
through a simple method that, taking into account that the service requires the
conclusion of a contract, the essential method and format and therefore that prevails in this
course is the same as indicated in the guidelines of the GT29, through the
medium in paper and telephone support. All this, without prejudice to keeping accessible
through the web for anyone interested who decides to carry out and attend the
content in an intuitive and simple way and without prejudice to the obligation to deliver in
durable support all the contractual information both with the previous information, as well as
with the contract itself. In this sense, we can see that the possibility of
linking "immediately" is likely to be interpreted.

 The AEPD itself on its website makes it the interested party who must "get it right" or
"find out" which of the treatments included in the record of activities of the
entity are those that really affect its relationship with the AEPD, since the
purposes are included within the description of each of them and not in the
privacy policy that is accessed.
 
As far as the identity of the data controller is concerned, the
information already provided after the request for additional information on June 3,
2020 in which EDP COMERCIALIZADORA was required, for this purpose, within the
Information Request E/05549/2019 in which it was explained that the fact of
that information from both entities is included is due to the fact that it is not possible to know
form prior to contracting the services that will be requested by the interested party (gas
and or electricity) nor, therefore, by which of the companies will they be provided, so
this can only be specified when said services are identified by the
own client. highly probable that the same client when requesting the contracting of the
electricity and gas supply, is contracting with both companies.

  For this reason, the so-called "dual" contract of
way that a client can obtain discounts or additional advantages for the fact of
contract both energies with two companies of the same business group, and in order to
keep updated the discounts in each of the energies (electricity and gas)
and derived information, it is necessary for both societies to know if the energy
initially contracted with the other Group company remains active in order to
maintain and correctly manage the applied discounts/benefits.

As a result of the foregoing, in the clause on data protection it is reported
that the personal data provided during the contracting process may be
processed by only one of the entities or both entities, depending on the type of
contracted energy services. Therefore, there is no inconcretion, but
the explanation of who is the specific person responsible for the treatment in each case is
contains literally in the first section of the contract, which identifies the
parties, as stated in Evidence 6 provided in the response to the Request
of Information made to this company during the processing of the aforementioned
informative file of which the present sanctioning file brings cause: "The
customer contracts, for the indicated supply, the supply of gas with EDP
Comercializadora, S.A.U. and the supply of electricity and/or services
with EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U., (hereinafter joint and/or
individually, as applicable, referred to as “EDP”) in accordance with the Terms
Specific that are collected below and to the General Conditions in annex.”

 Therefore, customers know which company will process their data based on the
requested supply (electricity or gas), something that we understand is perfectly
clear and is derived both from the explanations of the sales agents, and from the tenor
literal of the first clause of the contract. In case of being both services, the data
will be treated by both entities.

To date, neither in the field of data protection, nor in relation to any of the
the regulations applicable to the regulated sectors of electricity or gas, or the
referred to the defense of consumers there has been no request for
additional information, claim, or complaint in this regard, nor by the users themselves.
consumers, nor by the multiple regulators that control and
they control the activity of the trading companies, so it seems evident
that the information provided does not create problems for customers or other regulators
of the country, rather than the AEPD itself.

Additionally, we reiterate two essential aspects in the sector's own operations
in which EDP COMERCIALIZADORA develops its activity, whose exhibition is
contemplated in the previously submitted information: 1) The existence of two
companies within the Group with the role of marketing entities is due to a
merely formal matter, consequence of the corporate structure and composition
shareholding of the companies acquired by the EDP Group at the time of its
establishment in Spain, but that does not correspond to the operation
operation of these marketers, given that only one of them, EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, currently has employees and the capacity to
management and operations. Thus, in practice, all treatments are
carried out by said entity, either in its capacity as data controller or as
in charge of processing EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.
2) The EDP Group planned the corporate reorganization of EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA and EDP ENERGIA and the adaptation of their corporate structure
with that of its actual operation and its business operations. This reorganization is
has currently been affected by a sale process to TOTAL in which both
companies are immersed, and that, if materialized, could alter or terminate said
integration.

For all of the above, it understands that transparency is perfectly justified in
in relation to how the information is provided, as well as the fact that it is
perfectly understandable for the average customer.
 
The AEPD continues its analysis referring to the purposes and legitimizing bases of the
treatment. In the first place, reference is made to those treatments reported
whose legal basis is the contract itself -existing contractual relationship- or the
legitimate interest of the company.

On this particular, it is pointed out that "It is not easy for anyone, without
knowledge of the matter of data protection, differentiate what treatments
derive from the contract and which are based on the legitimate interest of the controller”.
This appreciation is debatable, since for any person it can be evident
that treatments such as “managing, maintaining, developing, fulfilling and controlling the
contracting of electricity and/or gas supply and/or complementary services of and/or

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

48/141

gas and/or complementary review services and/or technical assistance and/or program of
points, and/or improvement of the service” are closely related to the execution of the
contract, the others being assignable to legitimate interest. In this regard, we can
compare this information with that provided by the AEPD itself regarding its
treatments when these have diverse bases of legitimacy, as is the case of
called
your website
(https://www.aepd.es/es/laagencia/transparencia/otro-tipo-de-informacion/registro-
activities-treatment aepd/management-hr), in whose information it can be seen that
various bases of legitimacy are identified, without indicating to what specific purpose
refers to each of them.

Therefore, although there is nothing to object to in this part about the fact that the AEPD's criteria
can be a good practice in terms of the level of transparency, it seems
to consider the fact of not having reached this level of management of the
information, cannot be considered a breach of the norm, especially if
We take into account that not even the body that issues the guides of
transparency (and who is now proposing a sanction of nothing more and nothing less
than a million euros for this reason), has considered such a distinction necessary in its
website, as has been duly evidenced.

Regarding the alleged omission by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
to inform of "what is the legitimate interest that the person in charge attributes", it must
It should be noted that they are clearly exposed and placed in relation to the
purposes that are pursued, that is: prevention of fraud and marketing, in
in relation to the sending of personalized commercial communications. In these cases
it is obvious that there is an identification between the informed purpose and self-interest
persecuted, so making a separate allusion to the latter would be redundant.

 Similarly, for illustrative purposes, it should be noted that the direct competitors of
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA uses informative formulas similar to those
implanted in my client, without procedures known to date
against the same

On the other hand, the high number of requests for rights received in the channels
willing to do so demonstrate that customers fully understand the content
of the information and the rights that assist them, and they are perfectly clear about what
is what they want to achieve with their request and EDP COMERCIALIZADORA executes
said requests in all cases, always with a marked character of
compliance with regulations and protection of the fundamental rights of
users.

With regard to the need to report on the weighting carried out to
assess whether the legitimate interest is preponderant in this case, it is relevant to mean that
These two assumptions have been addressed by the legislator himself, who in the
Recital 47 of the RGPD expressly refers to the possibility of carrying out these
processing based on the legitimate interest of the data controller.

Specifically, it is provided that: “the processing of personal data
strictly necessary for the prevention of fraud also constitutes an interest
of the data controller in question. Data processing

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

49/141

personal information for direct marketing purposes may be considered made by
legitimate interest”.

 The AEPD itself has also ruled on the latter in its report 195/2017
indicating that “if the data came solely from the information that
provided by the entity in relation to the products or services contracted by the
client, without it being completed with that originating from other different sources,
certainly the conduct of the entity, consisting of carrying out a profiling
for the referral of offers of products or services to its clients, it would turn out to be
less invasive of the rights and interests of the clients, being able in this case
consider the applicability of the provisions of article 6.1 f) of the Regulation
general data protection.

Therefore, in both cases the weighting of the legitimate interest has already been
carried out, both by the legislator and by the Control Authority and, therefore, the
reason given by the WG29 to recommend its publication so that those affected
can file a claim with said authority when they “doubt whether the
weighing examination has been carried out fairly” would be meaningless in this
case, having to present said claim before the Court of Justice itself.
Justice of the European Union, in order to examine the legality of the provision
introduced in the RGPD, or where appropriate, before the control authority itself and/or
competent national courts. In any case, GT29 itself identifies this
possibility as a good practice and, as stated in the report itself, its
objective is to “indicate the approach that, in the opinion of the WG29, those responsible for
treatment must assume in terms of acting with transparency”. It is not about,
therefore, of a legal obligation whose defective fulfillment may entail
a sanction, as is the case with many other issues that the AEPD is
trying to sanction in this procedure, lacking the slightest principles of
characterization, guilt and evidence, these facts that do not cease to surprise us in what
that we understand that it is an action that should be subject to compliance
full and rigorous by the sanctioning Administration.

The AEPD continues its analysis, stating that the treatments for which it is requested
consent, considering that it is not easy to understand for a person
without specialized knowledge. However, he offers no explanation for
reach that conclusion (beyond a vague reference to point four).
  Contrary to the criteria of the AEPD, we understand that the information is given in a
simple language, understandable for anyone. The information contained in
This second layer must be related to the requested consents.

The first consent says: “I consent to the processing of my personal data once
Once the contractual relationship has ended, to carry out communications
commercials adapted to my profile of products and services related to the supply and
energy consumption. Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the
validity and after the end of the contract, on non-energy products and services,
both of the companies of the EDP Group and of third parties.”

In the second layer this information is expanded indicating which are the sectors to
those belonging to the third parties about which communications can be sent "(I) The
promotion of financial services, payment protection services, automotive or

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

50/141

related and electronic, own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or participation in
promotional contests, as well as for the presentation of commercial proposals
linked to the energy sector after the end of the contract.”
  As can be seen, not a single technical term is used that makes it difficult to
understanding of these texts, and the conditions of consent are fully
clear.

The second consent requested says: “I consent to the processing of my data
personal for the elaboration of my commercial profile with information coming from
third-party databases, for the adoption, by EDP, of decisions
automated in order to send personalized commercial proposals, as well as
to allow, or not, the contracting of certain services.”

 The second layer details the content of this consent, indicating: (II) the
possibility of processing personal data of third parties to be added to your profile (III) the
contractual information used by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in the preparation
of the profile (IV) the detail of the purposes of the aggregation of this information.

 Finally, information is given on the rights that attend the interested parties in the case of
that automated decision-making occurs in these processes. Therefore, the
clear objective of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is to allow interested parties to have a
detailed knowledge of the uses for which consent is requested in the absence of
will or any intent to hide the information. Likewise, the AEPD points out that
There is a lack of clarity in the information provided regarding the
aggregation of third-party information, as it is not distinguished if it is referred to the purpose
regarding point (II) (the possibility of processing personal data of third parties to be
added to your profile) or (III) (the contractual information used by EDP
MARKETER in the elaboration of the profile). In this regard, it seems obvious that
the word aggregation is concise enough, and refers to the sum of both
informations. The word add is in common use in everyday life and, according to
the RAE, means: "to unite or join some people or thing to others". In this case, from
context it is clearly inferred that it would be a matter of joining the data that EDP already has
COMERCIALIZADORA, with which it could obtain from third parties.

Beyond this, it is unknown what is the specific information whose understanding
it can be complex, since no clarification is provided in this regard. EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA has tried at all times to use clear language and
understandable and there are no technicalities that can complicate the reading of the text, something
it seems that now the AEPD considers a negative action that penalizes good
faith of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in relation to compliance with the regulations.
 
Finally, the AEPD refers to the information related to the exercise of rights,
regarding which, as in the previous cases, it does not seem to be enough
for the AEPD the information provided in this regard. Thus, under the heading “Rights
of the owner of the data” EDP COMERCIALIZADORA informs that: “The client will have
at all times with the possibility of exercising freely and completely
free of charge the following rights: i) Access your personal data that is processed
by EDP. ii) Rectify your personal data that is processed by
EDP that are inaccurate or incomplete. iii) Delete your personal data that is
treated by EDP. iv) Limit the processing by EDP of all or part of your

previously granted.

  Likewise, you can contact the data protection delegate of
EDP, at the following postal address: Plaza del Fresno, 2 33007 Oviedo or by mail
email dpd.es@edpenergia.es, in the event that you understand any of the
your rights related to data protection, or where appropriate, file a
claim before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection at the address Calle de
Jorge Juan, 6, 28001 Madrid.”

The AEPD considers the mention made by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA to be insufficient
regarding the possibility of objecting to "certain treatments" without specifying
one by one to which treatments we are referring, to the extent that the AEPD
states that "it must be clear to the interested party what are the treatments that
may be object of opposition.
This party does not share this appreciation, since this supposed obligation that the
AEPD highlights and seems to impose on EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is not required by the
RGPD, nor does it have any legal support, which, as you well know, that Agency is
condition “sine qua non” to be able to sanction

. Moreover, and for greater abundance, this part would like to once again highlight
that the formula used by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is precisely the
recommended by the AEPD itself in its multiple guides and tools related to
duty of information in accordance with the RGPD, and even on the AEPD website itself, something
which, once again, does not cease to surprise this part, since that Agency considers
an infringement of the RGPD, proposing for said infringement a penalty of one million
euros, for an alleged breach in relation to a certain practice that
she herself recommends performing. In this line, it is worth noting

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

52/141

Consequently, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA cannot be criticized for not including
of information that is not even indicated as a good practice in the guides
elaborated for the adequate fulfillment of their obligations by the
responsible for the treatment, and that neither the AEPD itself complies with its Privacy Policy
Privacy and other informative clauses used on its website.

Neither does the reference to “It is imprecise to point out that the
Interested party can oppose the adoption of automated decisions of their data
personal”. It is obvious that the information provided using the word "oppose" is
understood as a right both when the treatment is legitimized in an interest
legitimate as in a consent (in any case the possibility of
object at any time to the consents granted). The proof is that,
When exercising their rights, the interested parties rarely use any of these
terms and are limited to requesting the "unsubscribe" or directly requesting that they stop using their
data for certain purposes, without using formalisms as has been
evidenced in this procedure through the contribution of innumerable examples.

Additionally, it is in this party's interest to show once again that the AEPD
has had the opportunity to analyze both the general contracting conditions,
as the information provided in the different contracting processes of which
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has available during the different requirements of
information and, where appropriate, sanctioning procedures that the AEPD has initiated up to
the moment, without the AEPD having ruled on possible
breaches of the duty of transparency, having proceeded to file the
multiple files in which this documentation was subject to review by the
AEPD.

Therefore, having brought this information to the knowledge of the AEPD and
having been analyzed by it, without having ruled against the
itself, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA continued to make use of these documents and
procedures in the legitimate expectation that this was adjusted to the requirements
regulations, to the extent that the AEPD, having first-hand access and knowledge
hand of these alleged breaches, did not at any time indicate to EDP
MARKETER that there was any irregularity, now proposing a
sanction of one million euros for an alleged non-compliance, of which he would have had
knowledge years ago, but that he did not consider no longer sanctioning but not even
warn EDP COMERCIALIZADORA. In this regard, it should be noted that the
The purpose of this control authority is none other than to guarantee compliance with the
regulations, so that in the absence of legal justification that motivates the opening of
Sanctioning Procedure on some aspects that were previously
known and even subject to an archive, there can be no place for later
imposition of a sanction of the amount that is exposed.
As a conclusion of all the above, it cannot be interpreted that EDP
COMERCIALIZADOR fails to comply with its duties set forth in article 13 of the
GDPR.

In relation to the weighting of the sanction proposed by the AEPD, as
that in the previous points, after evaluating the aspects exposed in the present
section, and according to the evaluation criteria related by the AEPD, although,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

53/141

Without having justified the reason for which they are included, the following are included:
comments regarding its possible concurrence.
  “The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement” to what the RGPD itself
continues with “taking into account the nature, purpose of the operation of
treatment in question, as well as the number of interested parties affected and the level of
the damages they have suffered; As has been stated in the present
section, the information provided to users complies with the legal requirements to which
throughout the entire contracting process and even afterwards, without therefore
interpret that there is a breach by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA. Likewise,
As has been expressed in the previous points, in order to qualify as
aggravating the damages caused to those affected, in addition to materializing,
they must be accredited, an aspect that has not been tested in the
this Procedure.

“The intentionality or negligence appreciated in the commission of the infraction;” The
alleged inaccuracies in the information provided by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
do not imply any breach of the regulations so, in any case, it could be
recommendable some improvement in the way it is embodied, but nothing more.
The intention to inform those affected of all the aspects
related to the processing of your personal data in a transparent manner, therefore
that in no case is it possible to speak of an intention to breach the norm, much less
least negligent or willful behavior.

“The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal information;" As indicated, this is an ambiguous factor. It must be taken into
account of the great deployment of media carried out by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
to allow information to be provided to all interested parties through all channels by
which it is possible to collect personal data.
“The continuing nature of the offense;” “High volume of data and processing
which constitutes the object of the file;” and “High number of interested parties;” As
that in other criteria indicated individually, these three criteria remain
subsumed with the one raised in the first place, and from article 83.2 a) of the
RGPD, so its evaluation must be carried out jointly with the indicated and, therefore,
Therefore, do not suppose an additional aspect to the one mentioned for the calculation of the potential
applicable penalty.
“The status of the responsible entity as a large company and its volume of business”.
As already stated, this is not an evaluation factor for the amount of the
sanctions. Consequently, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA cannot be penalized for
compliance with its duty of transparency, much less in the amount proposed
in the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure to which we replied in the
present writing.

 FIFTH.- ABOUT THE AGREEMENT TO START THE SANCTION PROCEEDINGS AND THE
ASSESSMENT OF THE POSSIBLE PENALTY. LEGAL BASIS AND
PROPORTIONALITY OF THIS.

 .
A. NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDICTION OF ARBITRATION
 
In relation to this principle we must attend to two specific questions:
 1) The recommendations and publications of the AEPD,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

54/141

  2) The amounts of the sanctions that have taken place in previous cases
Similar.
In the first place, certain practices recommended and even applied by the AEPD
regarding the collection of consent and the information to be provided to the
interested parties, have served in this case to argue and motivate the alleged
infractions committed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

  These criteria are expressed both in the form of jointly compiling the
purposes whose legitimating basis is the consent of the user, as collected
in the Second Allegation, as well as in the presentation of the information related to the
exercise of rights of the interested parties collected in the Fourth Allegation. These
aspects, which a priori the AEPD recommends and puts into practice, considering them
examples that are adapted to the applicable regulations, are used as elements
offenders to justify the alleged breach of different legal precepts by
EDP MARKETING.

All of this, and said in strict terms of defence, not only implies that the AEPD
considers insufficient what the Authority itself has incorporated in its clauses
informative, resulting therefore, said insufficient information in accordance with the RGPD,
but the fact of modifying the criterion adopted invalidating aspects without
motivation, nor any justification, implies a clear situation of legal insecurity,
contrary to the constitutional principle of interdiction of arbitrariness contained in the
article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution; principle that implies that the authorities do not
can make arbitrary decisions, understanding by such, those that suppose a
infringement of the principle of equal treatment of the administered before the application of
the law and objectively determined rules.
Secondly, the amounts of the previous sanctions in cases of fact
similar are not comparable, to the proposals in this case.

  Specifically, we must bring up the Penalty Procedure
PS/00097/2019, directed against the entity of the same business group, EDP
ENERGY, in which, after having analyzed the contracting system and the information
provided to each of the parties involved, both the representative and the
represented, the file of the file is dictated, validating therefore all the
documents that accompanied the procedure, that is, the documentation linked
to the hiring process.
Likewise, it should be noted that, last March 2019, EDP ENERGIA, also
received file of actions of the information request E/04707/2018,
initiated after a complaint filed by Mr. ***A.A.A.. In this case, the AEPD resolves
that it is not appropriate to process the claim received, considering, therefore, the
contracting procedure and documentation provided, in accordance with the law.
As in the first section of this point, the proposed sanctions, carried out
without motivation or due justification, they go against legal certainty, a principle
Constitution contained in article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution, as well as against
the principle of legal foundation. In other words, every decision made by
the AEPD must be objective, well-founded and typified.
 In this sense, it is worth mentioning the Judgment of the Supreme Court of the 3rd Chamber
Contentious-administrative, Section 3, Judgment of May 13. 2015, Rec.
28/2013, in which the interested party appeals, stating, among other things,
allegations the infringement of the principles of interdiction of arbitrariness, security

sedeagpd.gob.es

55/141

legal and equality established in articles 9.3 and 14 CE, under article
88.1.d) LJCA and the Court upholds said motivation. From this resolution it is worth noting
the next:
  “c) The constitutional requirement of the motivation of the sentences, included in the
article 120.3, in relation to 24.1, of the Constitution, appears justified, without further
to underline the ends to which it tends to achieve, which, above all, it aspires to do
patents the submission of the Judge or Court to the rule of law and contributes to achieving the
conviction of the parties in the process about the fairness and correctness of a decision
court, facilitating the control of the sentence by the Superior Courts, and operates
as a guarantee or preventive element against arbitrariness.
d) The breadth of the motivation of the judgments has been nuanced by the doctrine of
Constitutional Court, indicating that it does not authorize to demand judicial reasoning
exhaustive and detailed of all the aspects and perspectives that the parties
may have of the matter to be decided, but must be considered sufficiently
motivated those judicial resolutions that are supported by reasons that
allow us to know what have been the essential legal criteria underlying
of the decision, that is, the "ratio decidendi" that has determined that (judgments of the
Constitutional Court 14/1991, 28/1994, 145/1995 and 32/1996, among many others). So
The Constitutional Court itself has recognized this when it refers to the fact that it is not
an exhaustive or exhaustive examination of the arguments of the parties is necessary, and
when it even allows the argumentation by references to reports or other
resolutions. The Judgment of the Constitutional Court No. 122/94 of April 25, affirms
that this right to motivation is satisfied when the judicial resolution
explicit or implicit contains reasons or elements of judgment that allow knowing the
criteria underlying the decision.
As a result of the above, it should be noted that the AEPD identifies as an example of a sanction, the
Sanctioning Procedure with file number PS/0025/2019, file that
it is in a contentious process and therefore, it does not become firm. For all this, you can't
be considered a file that affects the diligence operated by EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, nor can it be considered as a precedent, since
This sanction is not yet final. Analyzed the above, as well as the doctrine and
jurisprudence embodied in this section, we can only conclude that we
We are faced with a series of proposals for administrative sanctions, whose motivation
are separated from the interpretation recently made by this Agency. By
Therefore, it must be understood that the situation caused generates damages derived from the
absence of legal certainty, whose motivation is set out in the sections that
follow.

B. LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY At this point, it should be remembered that the principle
proportionality is a general principle of law. Reason why, the AEPD
should take this principle into account both when determining the criteria
evaluators, as well as when determining the applicable sanction, a principle that, as
It should be appreciated from the procedure, from the beginning of the investigation and that is, in the
strictest sense of defense, has not been applied by the AEPD in the Agreement of
Start of the Penalty Procedure.
It should be noted in this section that the sanctioning capacity of the AEPD is
is limited by the principle of proportionality, a limitation embodied in the
Article 29 of Law 40/2015, of the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (hereinafter,
“LRJSP”). This requires that every sanction be suitable, necessary and adequate to the
seriousness of the act constituting the offence. Therefore, we recall the criteria

evaluators collected throughout the writing, as well as the following fragments of the
article 83.2 of the RGPD that applies jointly.
“k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through the infringement.”
In this regard, of the already mentioned few or non-existent claims in
In relation to the alleged breaches, it can only be interpreted that EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA generally and majority complies with the requirements
collected in the RGPD, a criterion that must be taken into account as a mitigating factor for a
potential applicable sanction.
Firstly, with regard to the alleged infringement of article 25 of the RGPD, the
AEPD, seems to intend to sanction taking for granted the non-existence of
legally required documentation, without the Authority itself having required it.
For this reason, the AEPD in the sanction proposed in the document of the Agreement to Commence
Sanctioning Procedure, is based on a fiction, because the reality of the situation is
that the documents on which non-existence or inaccuracy is alleged comply with
all the obligations associated with data protection from the design and by
defect, providing, as is stated in the corresponding point, of
relevant risk analyzes and impact assessments, including all
corrective measures, having followed both the analyzes and the internal plans
with the criteria indicated by the AEPD.
 Therefore, the proposed sanction is not only disproportionate in accordance with the foregoing
in this writing, but it is not applicable to the facts before which we
we find.

Second, as stated in the second allegation, the alleged
infringement of article 6 of the RGPD, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has not carried out
any treatment related to the realization of a profiling and its subsequent use with
commercial purposes, nor has it provided insufficient information regarding the identification of the
responsible, being the same embodied at the contractual and informative level both in the
first layer, as in the second, an aspect that in any case would affect what was collected
in article 13 of the RGPD. Furthermore, as we have shown
previously, the collection of the purposes jointly, when these are
are subject to the same legitimizing basis, is approved by the AEPD itself.

Therefore, the proposed sanction is disproportionate and contrary to the legal system.
legal since neither the existence of any infraction has been justified, nor has it been
perform the treatment in question.

 Likewise, as we have already explained previously, the AEPD, up to now, has not
sanctioned in any file based on the violation of article 22 of the RGPD,
requiring therefore, a review and detailed and justified justification, so that the
proposed sanction is not considered disproportionate.

Finally, based on what is stated in the fourth allegation regarding the infringement of the
article 13 of the RGPD and in relation to what is included in this section, the
information collected and provided to interested parties complies with legal requirements
required, not being punishable in any case the non-implementation of recommendations
that the AEPD intends to impose on EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, as well as aspects that
even despite being defended and applied by the AEPD itself at one point,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

57/141

are currently arguments to justify the non-existent infringement by
of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA of its duty of information.

  For all these reasons, as has been evidenced and broken down throughout this
written, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA meets both the requirements set forth by the
applicable regulations, as indicated by the guides and legal texts published by
the AEPD itself.

 Likewise, the AEPD considers EDP COMERCIALIZADORA as an entity with a
great business value, assuming said volume a relevant aspect when it comes to
raise the sanction, without proving, however, that the business value is sufficient to
that the widely elevated sanctions can be considered as
proportional.

 Likewise, as has been explained in each point, each and every one of the
alleged infringing actions have mitigating factors that do not seem to be
taken into account, since only criteria are considered that, in addition to
expressed independently of what is included in the articles themselves, increase the
amount of the potential sanction to be imposed.

  These aspects show the total disproportion and arbitrariness of the sanctions
proposals, without there being any basis in the Start Agreement that would allow
the AEPD to motivate the amounts proposed, nor the reasons why some
same facts that until now had not even been sanctioned by the
Control Authority previously - infringement of article 22 of the RGPD-,
thus departing from the considerations of other procedures, as well as from the
evaluative criteria to determine amounts lacking motivation and
disproportionate.
Therefore, the proposed sanction should not be applicable, since there is no
infraction, nor any non-compliance, nor does it meet the criteria covered by the
principle of proportionality.

Added to the above, in the Judgment of October 15, 2012 (JUR/2012/353649),
appeal 180/2010, the Chamber applying the principle of proportionality, attended to the lack
of accreditation of the effects of the conduct as a criterion to reduce the sanction,
pointing out the essential character of the principle, allowing the Chamber to eliminate or reduce the
sanction imposed:
“As the appellant points out, there is no proof that the conduct
anticompetitive had any effect on the market, since there is no reasoning in the
appealed resolution what has been the effect on consumers or users in this
case public hospitals (...) In Spain, the Supreme Court has recognized the
ability of the court to rectify the graduation of sanctions
imposed by the Court for the Defense of Competition. Thus, in a sentence of 5 of
March 2001, May 24, 2004, June 12, 2006, February 14, 2007
points out that "the mentioned principle of proportionality or individualization of the
sanction to adapt it to the seriousness of the act, make the determination of the
sanction a regulated activity and, of course, it is possible in jurisdictional venue not
only the confirmation or elimination of the sanction imposed but its modification to
reduction" or in the judgment of October 8, 2001 "there is no excess in the
exercise of jurisdiction but simply observance of the constitutional mandates

28001 – Madrid

referring to the right to judicial protection (article 24.1) and the control of the legality of the
administrative action (8 article 106.1), when the jurisdictional body, analyzing
one of the reasons for challenging the administrative act, such as the resolution of the
Court for the Defense of Competition, decides what is the appropriate sanction in
application of this principle of proportionality and the provisions that it has for this purpose
established legal norm.

In this sense, it is also worth mentioning the Judgment of the TSJA resolving
through appeal number 795/2003:
“The principle of proportionality has served in jurisprudence as an important
control mechanism by the Courts of the exercise of power
sanctioning of the Administration when the norm establishes for an infraction
various possible sanctions or points out a quantitative margin for setting the
pecuniary penalty. The principle of proportionality or the penal principle of
individualization of the sanction to adapt it to the seriousness of the act and the
personality of the author, make the determination of the sanction a regulated activity.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the admissibility of specifying
the administrative sanctions in contemplation of the infraction committed,
graduating them with the appropriate criterion of proportionality inherent in the principles
computers of the sanctioning law, weighing for this purpose the circumstances
concurrent in the constitutive act of the sanctioned infraction, corresponding to
jurisdictional activity, as stated in the judgment of September 26, 1990,
not only the power to subsume the conduct of the offender in a certain type
legal, but also to adapt the sanction to the act committed, since in both cases
It is about the application of legal criteria embodied in the written rule and
deductible from informative principles of the sanctioning legal system, such as
are those of congruence and proportionality between the infraction and the sanction.”

In short, analyzing each of the alleged infractions that are imputed to my
represented, one can only interpret that there is an absolute disproportionality in
the interpretation made by the AEPD in this Start Agreement
Sanctioning Procedure, not only because it lacks motivation when it comes to
consider the alleged infraction to have been committed, but by the fact that the sanctions
Proposals escape any criteria previously assessed by the company itself.
AEPD. And for this reason, it corresponds at least to the correction by the AEPD, in
case of not considering the due annulment and filing of the proceedings, assuming
therefore a substantial reduction of each potential infraction to its minimum degree,
even reaching a warning, because there is no non-compliance, lack of
motivation and disproportionality.

C. DUPLICITY OF SANCTIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE "NE BIS IN" PRINCIPLE
IDEM"

From the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure an aspect is derived that has
been pointed out at various points in these allegations to the same, and
whose relevance cannot be ignored. Thus, the infractions that are indicated are
repetitions of the same facts, whose estimation would cause a notorious
duplicity in the sanctions imposed, either because they address circumstances
previously examined by the AEPD or because it estimates the concurrence
multiple offenses on the same fact.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

59/141

In the first place, this Agency has pointed out the concurrence of a
infringement derived from the provisions of article 25 RGPD when estimating that they have not been
carried out the appropriate actions, referring to the adequacy of the
procedures that are implemented for contracting by third parties. Without prejudice to
the arguments that have been stated in the corresponding First allegation,
which we refer to for brevity, it is relevant to highlight that the appreciation of the
Commission of infringement derives from events that, prior to it,
have been previously analyzed by the AEPD. This has meant that, taking into account the
casuistry concurrent in it, he was sanctioned in a proceeding that,
the date, is appealed.
From the foregoing it should necessarily follow that the imposition of the
infraction brings cause of the production of new facts that motivate the imposition of
the proposed sanctions. Well, this is not the casuistry that concerns us either,
there have been no new claims or circumstances that have led to the AEPD
to this Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure. Certainly the
imposition of the proposed sanction would mean that, faced with an act that has been
evaluated and solved or punished by the corresponding authority, be it again
examined from the same perspective or, on the contrary, that, in the absence of
materialization of said risk, said sanction would be imposed based on conduct
that could potentially give rise to a breach, but whose production is,
the date, non-existent.

Secondly, the AEPD makes use of different normative precepts to
sanction the same act, for simultaneously constituting the commission of three
infractions, although each of them is based on the breach of the
duty of information regulated in article 13 of the RGPD

In this sense, as has already been advanced in the previous allegations, although the
Agreement to Start Sanctioning Procedure part of the applicability of three
differentiated infractions, corresponding to articles 6, 13 and 22 of the RGPD,
All of them are based on poor information and ignorance of the
user of the object of the consent request. Thus, the argument that
to substantiate your consideration regarding obtaining consent
insufficient, it is stated that: "It is considered that the consent thus given is not
adjusted to the provisions of the RGPD and the LOPDGDD. Consent is requested with
deficient information, insofar as they do not indicate which third-party databases are going to be
consult or what type of data will be collected, so that the interested party does not know
absolutely that is what you are consenting to. Nor is it determined who will be
the data controller, a generic reference to EDP is made, without the
customer who has contracted a service only with one of the two entities
(EDP COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U. or EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U.) know if it is
consenting that such treatments be carried out by both entities or only
the one of which he is a client. Nor is it clear what type of services will be allowed
hire or not. Such deficiencies do not allow the interested party to know the
consequences of your decision and thus assess the convenience of lending or not your
consent." (Page 50 of the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure).

In the same way, regarding the alleged infringement of article 22 RGPD, regarding the
commission of automated decisions, the AEPD in its own written Agreement of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

60/141

Initiation of Sanctioning Procedure, after collecting the aspects related to the
processing of data in which there are automated decisions, collects the following:
 “From all this it can be concluded that the consent given for such purposes does not
is in accordance with the provisions of article 4.7 of the RGPD insofar as it is not
duly informed in general, the requirements are not fulfilled
specific information established in article 13.2 for decisions
automated and is also not specific. The absence of such requirements determines that
the same is not valid so that the treatments based on it lack
legitimation, thus contravening the provisions of articles 6 and 22 of the RGPD.”
(Page 52 of the Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure).

In light of the foregoing, each insufficiency mentioned, derives cumulatively, at the
potential breach of article 13 of the RGPD, regarding the duty of information.

For these purposes, the exposure made by the
that Agency of two infractions derived from the absence of legal basis
sufficient as it is not informed consent and, simultaneously, another infraction
due to the lack of transparency in the information provided. about that, ok
it is known by the AEPD that our jurisprudence has reiterated in many
occasions as a fundamental principle of law, that the same fact cannot be
sanctioned twice.
The application of this non bis in idem principle supposes a manifest impossibility of
impose two or more administrative sanctions for the same act, provided that
produce a de facto identity, be attributed to the same subject and impose
on the basis of a common foundation in what refers to the protected legal interest.

 Therefore, there is no doubt that, if the assessment of the AEPD is applicable
of the commission of an infraction by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA of the
exposed facts referring to the indicated articles, it will require the necessary
competition of applicable laws. In this sense, it is essential to bring up the
provided in article 29.5 of the LRJSP, which states that: "When the commission of
an infraction necessarily derives from the commission of another or others, it must be imposed
only the sanction corresponding to the most serious infraction committed.”
Notwithstanding the scant jurisprudence derived from said precept, as a result of its
previous regulation (Royal Decree 1398/1993, of August 4, approving the
Rules of Procedure for the Sanctioning Power), our Courts
have preached that, for the assessment of the aforementioned contest, the regulations
 “(…) requires, for the application of the media contest, a necessary derivation of some
infractions with respect to the others and vice versa” (Sentence of the Supreme Court of 8
February 1999).

In application of said precept, there are favorable judgments of the Chamber of the
contentious-administrative of the National High Court that, in analysis of the matter that
we are dealing with, stated that: "Accordingly, this Chamber considers that in the case of
there is a direct connection between the violation of article 6 (treatment of
personal data without the consent of the affected party) and the violation of the
articles 4.3 (treatment of inaccurate data), both of the LOPD. connection that is
highlighted by the fact that the processing of the complainant's data without their
consent, is carried out only in the communication by letter (of the
information on the movements of the Cortefiel POS) to his old address, which is

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

which gives rise to the complaint filed by him, and that by not correcting himself (precisely
because said incorrect treatment had no economic or accounting reflection in
said Bank), is maintained in the different communications by letter made. It is
In other words, as indicated by the plaintiff in the lawsuit, it turns out that the treatment that
has consisted, exclusively, in improperly including some data of the affected party in a
report of operations that do not refer to it, can only be produced without mediating its
consent, so the non-consensual treatment of data of article 6.1 LOPD
necessarily derives from the improper or erroneous treatment of the same (Art.
4.3). Therefore, the aforementioned article 4.4 of the Regulations for the
exercise of the sanctioning power, therefore, since both infractions are equal
seriousness, it is appropriate to impose a single sanction of 60,101.21 Euros, which is considered
be in this case the one corresponding to the infringement of the principle of treatment not
consented, in which the infraction of the
principle of data quality, both from article 44.3.d) LOPD.” (Judgment of 19
November 2009, rec 338/2009)

  Based on this, even though the precepts of the
regulations preceding the RGPD and cover a differentiated scenario, there is no doubt that
that the National Court appreciated the origin of estimating the concurrence of
infringements on the basis of a medial contest between the infringements contemplated
in the data protection regulations, when necessarily the commission of a
requires the production of the other. In this regard, said Court states that,
If there is a single action from which two infractions could derive, it can only
be taken into account the most serious. As in the aforementioned case,
in which the improper obtaining of a data necessarily caused a treatment of
inaccurate data, in the case at hand, the consideration by this AEPD of
an illegitimate acquisition for not meeting the principles defined by the RGPD for
determine that the consent is informed and unequivocal, must be subsumed
in the pertinent assessment of the duty to inform, not fitting in any way the double
valuation indicated in the sanction proposal. It does not fit, therefore, as has been
embodied by the AEPD in this procedure, apply different precepts
regulations (articles 6, 22 and 13 of the RGPD) independently, to sanction
about a potential infraction directly related to the performance of duty
of information, and in any case the sanctions proposed in the
Penalty Procedure Agreement.

D. LACK OF CONFIRMABLE EVIDENCE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE INFRINGEMENT
AND CORRESPONDING IMPOSITION OF THE PENALTY.

It is necessary to bring up the inquisitorial principle or the ruling officiality in the
administrative procedure, which implies that it is the administrative authority
obliged to proceed with the verification of the alleged facts through the practice ex
office of the relevant evidence, thus prevailing the principle of material truth. So
Therefore, in the administrative procedure it is an essential requirement that all
statements made are submitted to the confrontation with the facts, falling
on the competent authority the accreditation of the same, in order to guarantee the
legal certainty required for the sole purpose of complying with the purposes of the
Public administration.
 Likewise, it is pertinent to point out the provisions of article 53 of Law 39/2015 of 1
of October, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

62/141

regarding the presumption of innocence and the non-existence of responsibility while
unless the contrary is proven.
  Furthermore, reference should be made to the Judgment of the Court
Constitutional Law 76/1990, of April 26, 1990, Rec/695/1985, which delimits the scope
and respect for the presumption of innocence in the sanctioning procedure and that indicates
the following: “Indeed, there can be no doubt that the presumption of
innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and must be respected
in the imposition of any sanctions, be they criminal, be they administrative in
general or taxation in particular, since the exercise of the ius puniendi in its various
demonstrations is conditioned by art. 24.2 CE to the test game and to a
contradictory procedure in which their own positions can be defended. In
In this sense, the right to the presumption of innocence entails: that the sanction be
based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the conduct
reproached; that the burden of proof corresponds to the one who accuses, without anyone being
forced to prove his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of
the tests, practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, must
result in an acquittal statement.

 Likewise, we cannot affirm that the evidentiary activity carried out by the
Administration can be considered a charge, and, in the event that this body
consider it so, (STS of December 18, 2000- RJ 2000/92) it has been
fully distorted by the statements made by this party, as well as
as well as through the documents attached to this lawsuit.

In the same way, the jurisprudential line followed by
Constitutional Court in its judgment of February 20, 1989, in relation to the
principles and guarantees of the criminal judicial procedure applicable to the procedure
administrative sanction and, which indicates "Our doctrine and criminal jurisprudence have
been arguing that, although both can be considered as manifestations of
a generic favor rei, there is a substantial difference between the right to presumption
of innocence, which develops its effectiveness when there is an absolute lack of evidence
or when those practiced do not meet the procedural guarantees and the principle
jurisprudence in dubio pro reo that belongs to the moment of the valuation or
probative appreciation, and who has to judge when, that activity concurs
indispensable evidence, there is a rational doubt about the real concurrence of
objective and subjective elements that make up the criminal type in question"

Regarding such criteria, the Spanish Agency has ruled, agreeing on the
file of actions (E/04684/2017) and indicating literally the following:

“(…) For this reason, it is necessary to review in relation to the principle of presumption of
innocence that, to the Sanctioning Administrative Law, due to its specialty, are of
application, with some qualification, but without exception, the inspiring principles of the
criminal order, being clear the full potentiality of this principle of presumption of
innocence. In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in Judgment 76/1990, considers
that the right to the presumption of innocence entails "that the sanction be based on
acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the reproached conduct; that
the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without anyone being obliged to prove
his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of the tests
practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, must be translated into a

28001 – Madrid

63/141

acquittal pronouncement. According to this approach, it is necessary to
account that they can only be sanctioned for acts constituting an infraction
administrative the natural and legal persons who are responsible for the
themselves by way of intent or fault" (...) In short, the application of the principle of
presumption of innocence prevents imputing an administrative infraction when it is not
has obtained and verified the existence of proof of charge accrediting the
facts giving rise to this charge. (…)
Finally, review the Judgment dated May 25, 2001, issued on appeal
administrative litigation by this National High Court, number 29/2000,
pronounces regarding the imposition of a sanction based on a presumption
carried out by the Agency, and rules that "(...) the Chamber, as we go on to
reasoning, from the assessment of the evidence contained in the administrative file, arrives at
the conclusion that this integrative fact of the
type, that is to say, it is not proven that the Bank gave Mr.... the respective extract,
raising this concrete fact serious doubts, compared to the required certainty. Y
concludes by stating that without denying that the events could have occurred as indicated by the
complainant, the possibility that the extract was not
delivered to the husband by the Bank, but rather that he obtained it by taking advantage of some
visit to the home or through the action of a family member, said in terms of
pure hypothesis.

  In this same sense, the High Court of Justice of Madrid ruled in
Judgment of 02/21/2001, in which it states that “The only evidence against which the
APD infers the responsibility of the appellant, it is the fact that he was the ex-husband
of Ms... who provided the lawyer with said extract that was contributed to the incident
of modification of measures, and it must be agreed with the appellant that the possession of the
extract, in the opinion of this Chamber, is insufficient circumstantial evidence to destroy its
presumption of innocence since, certainly, said extract could reach the possession of
D... through channels other than direct delivery by the bank, by
Therefore, none of these hypotheses being proven, this reasonable doubt
about how the ex-husband obtained the account statement from the
complainant must always operate for the benefit of the sanctioned party, proceeding, in
Consequently, uphold his claim for annulment of the sanction imposed for lack of
enough proof of the participation of the appellant in the delivery of the bank statement
to a person other than the owner of the account” In short, appreciating the various
criteria taken into account by the competent protection body
of data when carrying out the file of actions in those cases in which
those in which it is considered that there is a lack of evidence and in which the
lines of jurisprudence outlined, this party considers that they have not protected the
legal guarantees that all procedures must respect.

E. LACK OF LEGAL BASIS

 As we have stated throughout this document, the alleged infringements
committed by my client, have not taken place, so it has not materialized,
nor is there any possibility that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has infringed the
mentioned articles following what is alleged by the AEPD in the Agreement to Commence
Penalty procedure.

  It should be noted that all sanctioning procedures and, where appropriate, the sanction
resulting, must be motivated, substantiated, and even more decisive, must meet
with the due principle of legality, typicity. As a result of this aspect it is brought to collation
the Judgment of the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia, number 870/2019,
Rec:454/2016, from which we extract the following:
“The due effectiveness of the principle of typicity in administrative sanctioning matters
whose requirement certainly derives from our administrative system
sanctioning, also in tax matters, as a manifestation of the guarantees
formal and material that are contained in the constitutional principle of legality
sanctioning former article 25.1 of the Constitution, and which was previously included in article 129 of
the already repealed Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the legal regime of
public administrations and the common administrative procedure, applicable to
this case additionally for temporary reasons (and today article 27 of the Law
40/2015), as well as in this specific tax order, article 178 of the Law
58/2003, General Tax, taking into account the implicit content of the aforementioned precept
constitutional (article 25.1 of the Constitution), despite its notable laconism
(Judgment of the Constitutional Court number 34/1996, of March 11), in which
has highlighted the so-called material guarantee of the principle of legality (among others, and
Since the ruling of the Constitutional Court 42/1987, of April 7, the

prohibition of any analogical or extensive interpretation in malam partem

well-established jurisprudential doctrine which teaches that in the exercise of its
sanctioning administrative power the acting sanctioning administration does not
responds, properly, to the exercise of an administrative power of essence or
discretionary tendency but predominantly regulated for the application to each case
of the sanctioning regulatory framework pre-established in general in the
applicable sanctioning legal system, which entails, from the outset, the
requirement of the necessary adequacy and rigor in the qualification of the facts
imputed and in their punctual incardination and adequate subsumption in the offending type
legally defined for its correction, in such a way that the contrary, certainly,

THIRD: That, due to lack of evidence, in application of the principle of presumption of
innocence, is declared not attributable to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U., the
violations of the provisions of articles 6 and 22 of the RGPD.

FOURTEENTH: Notified to the entity EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. the
aforementioned resolution proposal, said entity presented on 03/15/2021 a written
in which an extension of the term to formulate allegations was requested. Granted the
extension of the term, dated 04/07/2021, this Agency received a letter of
allegations, in which it is requested that the file of the procedure be agreed
sanctioning party or, alternatively, the substantial reduction of each proposed sanction to
its minimum amount or its substitution even, by warning, in its case. base
their requests in the considerations that are summarized below:

 ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY SUBJECT TO PENALTIES. With
preliminary and for clarification purposes, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA puts in
knowledge of this Agency that, on December 1, 2020, Total Gaz
Electricité Holdings France (“Total Group”) acquired 100% of the shares of EDP
MARKETER. As a consequence of the above, the
migration of the website www.edpenergia.es to a new transitory domain
(www.edp-residencialbytotal.es) and the email accounts have been modified
that were previously under the domain @edpenergia.es.

FIRST.- ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 25 OF THE RGPD:

(Yo)

The contracting process through a representative is in accordance with the
normative:

The arguments exposed in the allegations to the proposal of
resolution, related to the freedom of form of the mandate contract in accordance with the
provided for in the civil code, in particular it insists that "In this case, it does not seem
that such a wide freedom of form is compatible with obtaining evidence of
the existence of the representation or the mandate, beyond the manifestations of the
agent, protected by contractual good faith. Also, it is little
It is understandable that a separate consent is required for the treatment of
your data or a confirmation of the order by the principal, since this
would imply distorting the representation, since it would be absurd that whoever is
appointed to enter into a contract in favor of a third party cannot provide
the data of the person on whose behalf it acts, or that confirmation is necessary
separate from it to authorize said communication, since the need to
addressing the principal directly would make the intervention of the representative useless,
because it would be meaningless. (the underlining is from the entity that formulates
the allegations)

Likewise, and in relation to the possibility that the principal may provide
additional consents to the contract itself, it should be noted that this
possibility may well have been authorized by the principal in a
specific, but by governing the same freedom of form for the granting of this
authority (which the rule does not oblige in any case to have in writing), nor is it
Reliable accreditation is required at the time of contracting.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

Certainly, article 1725 of the Civil Code provides that the third party may request the
agent who informs him of his powers to determine if the hiring
is within the perimeter of the same or if you are assuming the risk that the
principal does not subsequently ratify the agent's action. But this regulation
translates into a burden for the president, not for the third party, since the interests
that it is about safeguarding are those of the latter, and not those of the president nor
of the principal. Therefore, it is optional for the third party to ask the agent to
give knowledge of the powers with which it claims to act.

In the vision handled by the AEPD in the Resolution Proposal, this obligation
would be aimed, however, not at protecting the interest of the third party regarding the
object of the contract made by the agent, but to preserve the interest of the
principal in relation to the legitimacy of the president to express the will of the
principal regarding the processing of your personal data by the third party.
However, this consequence cannot be extracted from the regulation of the Civil Code
regarding the mandate contract, in which –as we have just seen– the interest
protect with the exhibition of powers of the representative is strictly that of the third party, and
not that of the principal, which, in the scheme of the Civil Code, is safeguarded
through the power of ratification, whose granting or not is always in the hands of
of the principal.

Therefore, the risks referred to in the Motion for a Resolution (“they can be
generate various risks, being able to mention, by way of example, the one consisting of
a treatment of data of the represented without legitimacy, the risk of impersonation of
identity or economic or other damages that may be caused to the
interested party”) are not such: in the event that the agent has overstepped the
exercise of the mandate, the principal will not be bound by that action, except
his subsequent ratification, from which no harm can really be suffered unless
who accepts – expressly or tacitly – what was done by the president a posteriori

From here, and as optional power of the third party that contracts with the
agent, if and how the third party exercises that power depends on his will and the
hiring circumstances. In this sense, the fact that in contracting in
the channel of own commercial offices EDP COMERCIALIZADORA requires the
representative an accreditation of his condition as such, does not prove absolutely anything,
contrary to what the Motion for a Resolution says. Since EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, as a third party that contracts with the authorized party, enjoys the
power to carry out this verification or not, the one who carries it out on some occasions and
in others, or whoever does not do it in the same way in all contracting channels, is not a source
of any obligation –which is not imposed neither by law nor by contract– but simply
manifestation of the exercise of a permit.

At the doctrinal and jurisprudential level, the exercise of the rights of the
personality through voluntary representation, particularly when it comes to
Articulate ad hoc authorization for specific acts of interference1. that chance
should be understood as reinforced when the mandate for the exercise of a right of
personality is linked to the power of attorney to enter into a contract, of which said
exercise is a conditioning or complementary element. Thus, the agent or
representative of an artist mandated to celebrate on behalf of his client
a contract for the lease of services to perform in a concert hall or

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

record a disc, is commonly mandated to authorize the organizer of the
show or the record company for the use of the voice and image of the artist.

Similarly, those authorized to contract with EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in
name of another person, appear first as mandated subjects for the
conclusion of the supply contract, and concomitantly, because it is about
a factor inherent to the hiring itself, they are also to authorize the employment
and treatment of the personal data of its representatives. In this sense, it is
It is necessary to emphasize that there is no doubt that the treatment of the data of the
represented that is necessary for the execution of the contract of which the represented
becomes a party, it must be considered a fully lawful treatment in light of the
article 6.1.b) of the RGPD.

But in addition, insofar as it can be established that the president enjoys legitimacy to
make all relevant decisions within the framework of the recruitment process for the
that has been empowered, the consent that said representative gives on the
data processing of the represented party and that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA collects for
one or several specific purposes within the framework of the contracting process, allows
consider equally lawful the treatment of the data thus obtained ex article 6.1.a)
of the RGPD or any other basis of legitimacy. And it is that, who hires on behalf
of another –once it is assumed that he acts as such– must be able to provide the
same consents regarding personal data as the interested party if
it was the latter who concluded the contract, and this whether the contract is concluded on the spot
in a commercial office as if it were held by telephone.
 
 It must be concluded, contrary to what the AEPD indicates in the Resolution Proposal,
that:
(Yo)

EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is not obliged to carry out with third parties
Authorized employees who contract through the telephone channel or sales forces
no external verification of the existence and scope of its
mandate, nor a fortiori does this verification have to be analogous to the one
eventually do with those who hire through offices

  (ii) in the power to contract the service through an authorized third party
resides the power to give the consents inherent to the process of
contracting, including those relating to the processing of personal data;
and (iii) the legality of the treatment by EDP cannot be questioned.
MARKETER of the personal data of those who contract with
it through an authorized third party, either through commercial offices

be the same as when acting on its own behalf.

(iii)

(iii)

(ii) EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has correctly assessed the real risks and
implemented the appropriate mitigating measures.

Reiterates that the risk assessments provided in this proceeding are
in accordance with the data protection regulations and the AEPD guidelines, in force in the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

71/141

when the analyzes are carried out, and identify the real risks applicable to the
different hiring processes.

The AEPD, in its Resolution Proposal, alludes to hypothetical or theoretical risks
which he cites, moreover, merely by way of example and of which he does not offer greater detail or
Explanation.
 As explained in the previous point and in the Arguments to the Initiation Agreement,
these risks are non-existent or lack sufficient entity for their
consideration. Thus, it can be affirmed against the list contained in the Proposal for
Resolution–non-exhaustive since the list of the AEPD is a mere title
exemplary–, among others: (i) that there is no risk of identity theft in
so much so that there is representation and mandate, (ii) that there is no economic damage to
those interested insofar as the cost is assumed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in all
case; or (iii) that there is no risk of lack of legal basis as EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA can assume, in accordance with the aforementioned civil legislation
and in accordance with the legal framework applicable to these contracts, the existence of
authorization to the representative for data processing and (iv) that, in case of
overreach, the interests of the principal are safeguarded by its right to
ratify or not what has been done by the president outside the limits of the mandate.

For this reason, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has correctly assessed the risks
own real of the different contracting channels in accordance with an analysis
solid legal -and backed doctrinally and jurisprudentially- of the figure of the mandate
in the Spanish legal system and has implemented the mitigating measures
adequate in relation to such risks. The risk analysis carried out is, therefore,
coherent and was carried out in accordance with the legal institute of the civil mandate and its
jurisprudence.

To the extent that the consistency of the analysis carried out has been proven, the
AEPD must assess the analysis in accordance with these consolidated civil criteria or, if
On the contrary, the AEPD considers that a different legal criterion should be adopted and
Contrary to that of the civil regulations and its established jurisprudence, it must substantiate
somehow its legal basis in order to allow EDP COMERCIALIZADORA its
understanding and defense. In any case, the interpretation of the mandate by EDP
MARKETING COMPANY in accordance with the regulations, jurisprudence and civil doctrine
-including the one related to personality rights- must be interpreted in good faith
faith and excludes any culpability on your part.

  (iii) Recruitment through a representative constitutes a very high proportion
minority of the total contracts made by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

It is essential to point out that contracting through a representative constitutes
a minority part of
  of contracts made by EDP
MARKETER. Specifically, of the total contracts that EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA carried out in 2019, less than 13% corresponds to contracts
through representatives of which in less than 1.8% the representative and the
represented would not have a family relationship.

total

Therefore, when the AEPD states that the EDP contracting procedure
COMERCIALIZADORA violates the principle of data protection from the design, which
wrongly, that is to say in strict terms of defense, as if the
contracting procedure in its entirety would violate this principle. More so, at
When quantifying the sanction, the AEPD refers to the global billing volume of
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA to quantify it, when it should take into account
exclusively, and where appropriate, the billing data (volume) generated by the
eventual alleged breach -relative exclusively to contracting by
representation-.

Bear in mind, furthermore, that, in any case, the AEPD could have invoked the
article 83.2.k) of the RGPD and article 76.2.(c) of the LOPDGDD (“the benefits
obtained as a result of the commission of the infraction”) to graduate the sanction
proposal. Therefore, in the hypothetical and possible event that it is considered infringed
Article 25 of the RGPD, the maximum volume of business obtained by EDP
COMMERCIALIZER to take into account should be 2,550,000 euros
approximately, which is the amount obtained “as a consequence of the [possible]
infraction”, that is, in contracting by representation, and not in the global
hiring. In this sense, the annual turnover of contracting through
of representative would mean 0.26% (approximately) of the business volume
annual total of the entire client portfolio of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA. Likewise, the
sanction that this Agency proposes to impose on EDP COMERCIALIZADORA for this
infraction presupposes 20% of the turnover of the contracting through
representative. Since the profit is much lower than the turnover, the penalty
proposal would be disproportionate in relation to the same

In an administrative procedure of a sanctioning nature, counting how
the AEPD with objective and sufficient quantifying criteria in relation to the volume
(marginal) that representation entails, compliance with
of the principles of proportionality of the sanction and legality and should, therefore,
have been taken into account: (i) That the part that corresponds to the procedures of
contracting by representation is a small and very limited part of the
global contracting procedure for EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, and, therefore, it must
take into account the small magnitude of the contracting that has the use of this type
contracting at EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, being a type of contracting
minority. In addition, as stated in the information provided in this
procedure, there is only one claim before the Agency during the years 2018-
2019 (with respect to a total of 33,848 contracts made through
representative), which reflects the low relevance and materialization of the risks
attributed by the AEPD to the contracting process implemented by EDP
MARKETER.

That the proposed sanction of the AEPD of five hundred thousand (500,000) euros has been
made in the Resolution Proposal erroneously due to attending to a factor not
provided for in the regulations (the volume of business and the status of a large company) and
take into account the volume of contracts and the global profits of EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA -which includes both direct contracting (majority) and
contracting by representation (minority)-, which has nothing to do with "the benefits
obtained as a result of committing the offence” referred to
expressly article 83.2.k) of the RGPD and article 76.2.(c) of the LOPDGDD -the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

73/141

which would represent 0.26% of the business volume. Therefore, in the form
subsidiary and in the hypothetical case that the AEPD questions the validity of the mandate
for the contracting procedures and declare the infraction committed, the
quantification of the possible sanction should be significantly corrected to have
taking into account the real volume of business generated by contracting by representation
exclusively.

All of the foregoing makes clear the disproportionality of the sanction proposed in the
Resolution Proposal

Lastly, and without prejudice to the foregoing, despite the fact that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
does not consider that his actions deserve any legal reproach, in view of the
suggestions made by the AEPD, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA informs the
AEPD that it has proceeded to reinforce the contracting process through
representative in line with the protocol that was already provided to the AEPD on the 16th of
July 2020. This protocol, which was submitted to the AEPD on a voluntary basis and before
of the beginning of the present sanctioning procedure, had as its purpose precisely
collaborate with this Agency to reach an agreed procedure in matters of
representation and that satisfies the proposals that the AEPD may have.

In the Allegations to the Start Agreement, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA responded
in addition to the doubts raised by the AEPD regarding its content and
implementation and confirmed that it is a procedure with double verification by
SMS and in compliance with the best market standards. For these purposes, the
AEPD must take into account: (i) that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA contacted
proactively in July 2020, without success, with the AEPD to present a new
protocol that proposed changes in the contracting procedure by
representation. Far from being considered, as the Motion for a Resolution does,
negatively and against EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, that proactivity as
sign of acknowledgment of guilt - the arguments of legality have already been manifested
above-, the cooperation proposal with the AEPD should be valued as a
sign of good faith and of the firm commitment of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA with the
compliance with data protection regulations and the improvement of its processes as well
as an extenuating circumstance in the graduation of the sanction (article 83.2.f) of the
GDPR);

  (ii) that despite not obtaining a response other than the opening of this
procedure, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in light of the comments of the AEPD in
the Initiation Agreement and the Resolution Proposal, has eliminated from its procedure
contracting by representation the possibility of requesting consents to
marketing and commercial purposes referred to by the AEPD on the pages
112, 113 and 114 of the Proposal. Attached as Documents No. 1 and No. 2 example of
contract and speech script for the telephone channel that evidence this elimination.
To the extent that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has adopted measures to adjust its
procedure to the proposals of the AEPD, this circumstance, in accordance with article
83.2.c) of the RGPD must also be considered as a mitigating circumstance
for the graduation of a possible sanction, and

 (iii) that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA confirms to the AEPD that the new protocol -with
the content communicated in July 2020 - is already implemented for all channels

In the contracting process, the following is reported again: “Your data
personal information and those of the represented party will be processed by EDP Comercializadora SAU and
EDP Energía SAU for the management of its contracts, fraud prevention, implementation
of profiles based on client and EDP information, as well as carrying out

Therefore, it is not possible to criticize a lack of information to those interested in the
incoming calls while the information referred to in the first information layer
(i.e., the one provided at the beginning of each call) complies with the information
necessary of article 11 of the LOPDGDD (that is, identity of the person in charge, purposes of
treatment and possibility of exercising rights) and a direct and
easy to access the rest of the information (by accessing the website or
pressing 0). It is important to highlight that the locution of the first informative layer is
automatically plays at the beginning of each incoming call and, therefore,
Therefore, it is a must listen to all interested parties who make a call. By
For this reason, all the interested parties, before reaching the contract, have already been
informed about the possibility of exercising their rights and how to access the
Other information about the processing of your data. Also, before the
recruitment, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA reminds those interested -through a
second phrase- part of the basic information on data protection.

In accordance with article 13.4 of the RGPD, the obligation to inform does not apply
to the extent that the interested party already has the information; in the case that we
occupies, taking into account that the initial speech is played automatically
in each call, it is sufficiently accredited that any interested party who
gets in touch with EDP COMERCIALIZADORA through the CAC Inbound Channel
receives information regarding the protection of personal data. In this sense, the
Article 29 Group (currently known as the European Committee for the Protection of
Data) indicates in its Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU)
2016/67 (“Transparency Guidelines”) that it should be understood that article 13.4
of the RGPD is applicable in those cases in which the information would have
been provided, for example, in the previous six months. As far as the
CAC Inbound channel, not only would have spent a time clearly less than 6 months
but the lapse of time can be measured in minutes, so it is manifest that the
interested party knows, knows and perfectly remembers the information on data protection
data without it being necessary to reiterate this information

(iii)

Regarding the information provided in the Telemarketing channels and
leads

He points out that this Agency questions the means to access the second layer
informative (i.e., the General Conditions available on the website
edpenergia.es) is “simple and immediate”

It indicates that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has accredited in the present
procedure the following: • First, the information on data protection
data (i) is clearly identified within the general conditions of
contracting of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA (in section 16 and entitled LOPD) and
(ii) occupies in length one of the four pages of the document, so its
location has no loss for the interested party.

You inform this Agency that you have created a separate document containing,
exclusively, the data protection information of the conditions
general terms of contracting, which is easily accessible through the
website and at the following address: www.edp-residencialbytotal.es/rgpd; and that
likewise, the general contracting conditions continue to include the
clause relating to the processing of personal data, so that the interested party
has various means through which you can access the information
In a simple way.

  • Secondly, it alleges that the way to provide information on the
second information layer can be diverse and, as such, has been recognized by
data protection authorities. As indicated in the Arguments to the
Start Agreement, when the hiring takes place, the conditions are sent
general terms of contracting -where the specific clause is included in terms of
Data Protection-; therefore, making this information available to
through the website should be understood as an alternative system and
complementary.

In this sense, the Transparency Guidelines expressly indicate that
“When the first contact with an interested party is through the telephone, this
information [first information layer] could be provided during the call with the
interested party and he could receive the rest of the information required under the
article 13 or 14 by a different additional means, for example, by sending you a
copy of the privacy policy by email or a link to the
online privacy statement/notice of the controller”.

In accordance with the criteria of the competent authorities, including the AEPD, EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA would not have committed a violation of the duty of
transparency, while complete information on data protection
(with the content required by the regulations) is contained within the conditions
General terms of contracting that are sent to the interested party after contracting. The
Transparency Guidelines also indicate that, depending on the circumstances
of the collection and processing of the data, a data controller could
be forced to additionally use other possible ways to transmit the
information to data subjects applicable to relevant settings provided that the
information from the first information layer is transmitted in the first modality

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

79/141

used to communicate with the interested party. For this reason, EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA complies with its obligation of transparency by facilitating the
information from the first informative layer by telephone and the second layer
information in writing (either physical or electronic document). That's it
It is important to point out that the most transparent and suitable way for the interested party to
receive information about the processing of your personal data is including it
together with the information on the contracting of the services, insofar as this is
the circumstance with which the processing of your data is related and is, in addition,
a document that the interested party will keep during their contractual relationship with
EDP MARKETING.

(iii)

Regarding the content of the information provided by telephone and in the
general conditions:

• Specification of the data controller:

The AEPD questions the clarity with which the interested party knows which entity acts
as data controller, however, as evidenced in the conditions
terms of contracting of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA (provided as evidence
6) of this procedure, the client is informed about the identity of the person in charge
of the treatment through the privacy policy in relation to the conditions of
hiring:
  Privacy policy: “the data will be processed by EDP Comercializadora SAU and
EDP Energia SAU”.
Specific conditions of the contract:
“The client contracts, for the indicated supply, the supply of gas with EDP
Comercializadora, S.A.U. and the supply of electricity and/or services
with EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U., (hereinafter joint and/or
individually, as applicable, referred to as “EDP”) in accordance with the Terms
Specific that are collected below and to the General Conditions in annex”.

As explained in the allegations to the Home Agreement, information is included
on both entities insofar as, depending on the service that is requested by the
interested party (gas and/or electricity), one or another entity will be responsible for the treatment
(or both in case the interested party contracts both services). Therefore, the
interested party -who has full capacity to contract and, therefore, is
presupposes that you should be able to understand the terms and conditions that
govern such hiring, you are aware at all times that, as you hire
the gas and/or electricity supply service, your data will be processed by one or
both entities.

• Purposes and bases of legitimacy

It is alleged that neither article 13 of the RGPD nor any other legal precept requires that the
privacy policy list each purpose specifically indicating the basis of
legitimacy that results from application. Still, when it comes to treatment
Subject to consent, it is expressly indicated what they are. In any case, as
was already indicated in the Arguments to the Initiation Agreement, in the case of the bases of
legitimacy of "contractual execution" and "legitimate interest", it is evident for
any person who contracts the supply services of EDP

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

80/141

MARKETER that the treatments closely linked to the execution
of the contract such as "manage, maintain, develop, fulfill and control the
contracting of electricity and/or gas supply and/or complementary services of and/or
gas and/or complementary review services and/or technical assistance and/or program of
points, and/or improvement of the service” find their basis of legitimacy in the execution of the
contract, being the other treatments assignable to the legitimate interest (eg the
carrying out fraud prevention actions or sending communications
commercial). Legitimate interests are clearly exposed and put into
relation to the purposes pursued (that is, fraud prevention and
marketing, in relation to sending commercial communications
personalized) and given that there is an identification between the informed purpose and the
own interest pursued, making a separate allusion would be redundant.

• Profiling

It is stated in the allegations that in the Resolution Proposal, the AEPD considers
that, in relation to "profiling", it is not clear what its purpose is or
the legitimate interest underlying the treatment. In this sense, the AEPD states in
the Motion for a Resolution the following: “In this case, in the opinion of this
Agency, the information requirements described above. EDP MARKETING,
S.A.U., is limited to reporting on "profiling", but does not offer a
information on the type of profiles that are going to be carried out, the specific uses to which
these profiles are going to be used or the possibility that the interested party can exercise the
right of opposition in application of article 21 of the RGPD.” However, the
profiling is associated with sending commercial communications
personalized: "they will be treated (...) with the purpose of (...) profiling,
personalized commercial communications based on information provided by the
Customer and/or derived from the provision of the service by the Marketer(s) and
relating to products and services related to the supply and consumption of energy,
maintenance of facilities and equipment.

Although the wording could have included “for the shipment of” (that is, the text
outside “as well as creating profiles for sending commercial communications
based on information provided by the Client (...)”), this absence does not
should be understood as EDP COMERCIALIZADORA violating article 13 of the
GDPR.

• Exercise of rights:

It is alleged that in the opinion of the AEPD, it should be expressly indicated which are the
treatments to which the right of opposition applies. However, as already
stated in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement, the obligation to detail the
specific treatments to which the interested party has the right to oppose not only it is not
an obligation contained in the RGPD, the LOPDGDD or any other regulation of
application, but also the AEPD in its guides and tools (among others, the Guide
for compliance with the duty to inform2 or the Facilita tool3 ) does not indicate that
the informative clauses on the right of opposition must specify the
treatments on which the right of opposition applies, not even as an example of
Good practice. In any case, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA expressly indicates that
The interested party may oppose some voluntary treatments, such as the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

81/141

promotion, profiling, automated decision-making and
making commercial offers.

He points out that the proposed resolution indicated that: “It is imprecise to point out
that the interested party can oppose the adoption of automated decisions of their
personal information. These can only be carried out by the person in charge in the
assumptions provided for in article 22 of the RGPD, based in the present case on the
consent of the interested party, so he must be able to know that he can revoke
the consent given for the adoption of such decisions in any
time, notwithstanding that you are also informed of the rights conferred by the
article 22 to the interested parties.” It is alleged that the semantic and technical nuance associated with
the terms "opposition" and "revocation" in the context of the exercise of rights
can have an impact on the interested party, because with both terms the user achieves a
same objective, which is that treatment specifically identified in the policy
cease to occur.
Furthermore, the term used by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA (opposition) in the
context of this type of treatment is understood in the regulations and by the
market in a broader way -and therefore more guaranteed- since it allows the
user delete a treatment is based on consent, is based on interest
legitimate.

• Processing based on consent:
The AEPD considers that information on processing subject to consent
it is not completely clear. However, this part cannot agree with
this interpretation for the following reasons:
 In the first place, the AEPD questions that in point (IV) it is not clear as to what
data refers to the phrase “the results obtained from the aggregation of the data
indicated” and argues the existence of confusion as to whether the aggregated data
are those referred to in point (II) and/or in point (III). However, as stated
in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement, from reading it is clear that "the results
obtained from the aggregation of the data indicated” refers to the data indicated
above, that is, the data referred to in point (II) and (III), since it is evident that
the use of the anaphoric term “indicated” refers to the data referred to in the points
previous.

  Secondly, the AEPD states that the difference in data processing
advertising of this point with the previous points is not obvious. However, the
difference is clear:
the advertising treatment derived from point (I) refers to offers of "services
financial, payment protection services, automotive or related and electronics,
own or third parties, offered by EDP and/or participation in contests
promotions, as well as for the presentation of commercial proposals linked
to the energy sector after the end of the contract”, that is, services offered by
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA not related to the contracted services but to the
energy sector or other sectors such as finance or the automotive industry, and in addition to
generic type - not custom;
▪ point (II) refers to “personalized products and services”, that is, offers
adapted to the commercial profile of the client; Y
▪ point (IV) refers to “making personalized offers, specifically aimed at
to achieve the contracting of certain products and/or services of EDP or third parties

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

82/141

entities”, that is, to the realization of personalized offers with a
specifically to achieve the sale of certain products or services, being the
customization not only with respect to the client but also with respect to the concrete
service or product offered.
The AEPD's criticism of the granularity offered by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA does not
can be understood in the light of its own recommendations and those of the European Committee
of Data Protection, which ask for precisely such detail and granularity.

  COOPERATION AND PROACTIVE ATTITUDE OF EDP

EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is studying and analyzing the implementation of the
timely measures for the adoption and adaptation to the recommendations,
best practices and the criteria established by the AEPD both in the present
procedure as in its guides and publications (in addition to the improvements already
implanted to which reference has been made above), in order to improve all its
data protection policies, clauses and general conditions through the

Potential customers

FIFTH.- BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDICTION OF THE
ARBITRARINESS.

It is pointed out that certain recommended practices (and even applied by the AEPD in
their own privacy policies) have served in this case to argue and
motivate the alleged infractions committed by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA (for
For example, the presentation of information related to the exercise of rights of
stakeholders collected in the Second Allegation). These aspects that, a priori, the AEPD
recommends and puts into practice, considering them examples that fit the
applicable regulations, are used as infringing elements to justify the

non-compliance with various precepts

legal by

SIXTH.- LACK OF LIABILITY IN EDP'S ACTION
MARKETER-

By virtue of all of the foregoing, EDP's actions
MARKETING COMPANY cannot be considered guilty in the eventual commission of
the administrative offenses in terms of data protection that are imputed to it. In the
sanctioning administrative sphere it is not enough that the conduct is typical and
unlawful (which in this case, it is not), but it is also a requirement
inescapable that he is guilty, that is, the consequence of an action or omission attributable
responsible for intent or inexcusable fault, without any luck being admissible
of strict liability that exempts the Administration from accrediting
fully the requirement of guilt or intentionality in the commission of the
infringement. (Judgments of the Supreme Court of July 9, 1994, May 16,
1995, December 12, 1995, January 12 and 19, 1996, April 15, 1996, between
many others.)

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

83/141

It is also worth mentioning that the appreciation of the subjective element of the
infraction is determined by the degree of foreseeability that it had for the subject
affected that their behavior could be considered typical and unlawful and, therefore,
likely to be penalized. The subjective element of guilt can only
attend when, in view of the situation existing at the time of the
conduct, the subject could reasonably anticipate that he was committing a
infraction Judgments of the Excma. Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of May 8
from 2003 — ref. Aranzadi RJ 4209—, of July 7, 2003—ref. Aranzadi RJ 5832—,
and of January 28 and 27, 2010 — ref. Aranzadi RJ 1362 and 1357.
Likewise, the doctrine of the contentious-administrative courts has excluded the
concurrence of the essential culpabilistic element when the subject who has
objectively committed the offense acted on the basis of a reasonable
interpretation of the legal system.

A reasonable interpretation of the applicable regulations, even when it is not ultimately
considered correct by the courts, excludes guilt, especially in
those cases in which the applicable legal regulations are not clear or unequivocal.

SEVENTH.- SUBSIDIARILY,
  THE PROPOSED SANCTIONS ARE
MANIFESTLY DISPROPORTIONATE AND SHOULD BE ENFORCED
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

In short, analyzing each of the alleged infractions that are imputed to
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, one can only interpret that there is an absolute
disproportionality in the interpretation made by the AEPD in the Proposal for
Resolution, not only because it lacks motivation when it comes to considering the
alleged violation, but by the fact that the proposed sanctions are beyond
any criteria assessed in advance by the AEPD itself. In this sense,
It should be added that the amounts of previous sanctions imposed in cases of
Similar facts are not comparable to the proposals in this case.

Mitigating circumstances must apply: Indeed, any sanction imposed
imposed on EDP COMERCIALIZADORA would have to be set in accordance with the
articles 83.2 of the RGPD and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, which contemplate instruments
relevant for the Administration to adapt the proportionality of the sanctions. In
this case, as stated in the Arguments to the Initiation Agreement,
the following mitigating circumstances that are hereby amply concur:
abstract:

• The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement: according to article 83.2.a) of the
RGPD, the assessment of this circumstance must take into account "the nature,
scope or purpose of treatment” (...) and “the level of damages that have
suffered”. In this sense, what is imputed to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is the
need to improve some aspects of its data protection policies, without
that in no case can the texts used up to now be understood as
have generated a high level of damages. Also, the treatments
foreseen in these policies -which are known by the interested parties- are not
particularly sensitive, neither because of the type of data processed nor because of the characteristics
of treatment activities. Therefore, not only is it inappropriate to consider

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

84/141

aggravating circumstance the nature of this infraction but, the foregoing must
be considered as a mitigating circumstance applicable to this proceeding.

• The intention or negligence in the infringement: EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has not
showed any intent or negligence. The AEPD, in its Proposal for
Resolution, indicates that "the defects indicated in the information provided show the
lack of diligence by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA in complying with the
transparency obligations. Therefore, what this Agency seems to be referring to is
the absence of all the diligence that, according to said Authority, would be expected of EDP
MARKETER. However, it does not seem that this statement can
be understood as "intention or negligence" in its action insofar as, as
has been stated in the Allegations to the Initiation Agreement and in these
allegations, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has carefully observed the guidelines,
guidelines and tools made available by the AEPD itself and the Committee
European Data Protection for the fulfillment of its obligations of
Data Protection. For this reason, the diligence of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA
should be taken into account as an extenuating circumstance.

 • The high link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatment of
personal data: EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is dedicated, as stated by the AEPD in the
Motion for a Resolution, to the supply of gas, an activity that is not intensive in the
processing of personal data and that although it is true that the development of
activity of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA involves the processing of personal data,
this is instrumental without its activity being based on the exploitation of data
personal. In this sense, the low link between EDP's activity
COMERCIALIZADORA in the processing of personal data should be considered a
extenuating circumstance.

 • Any measure taken to alleviate the damages: as stated
to the knowledge of the AEPD, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA is immersed in the
review and improvement of its procedures and clauses in order to adapt and
implement the recommendations made by this Agency, preventing it from
any type of damage or harm to the interested parties. Proof of this is that
some of the recommendations of this Agency are already implemented,
such as improving access to information on data protection, which is already
available at the address edp-residentialbytotal.es/rgpd as well as the new protocol
contracting through a representative, which was already provided to the procedure on
last July 16, 2020 and has already been implemented last January.

 • Degree of cooperation with the authority: EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has shown
from the beginning of this procedure a completely collaborative attitude with the
AEPD, as has been accredited in this writing. In the allegations to
Home Agreement provides more complete information regarding the
cooperation shown by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA.

 • Categories of data and impact on the rights of minors: the data subject
treatment are not special categories of data and have not been affected
rights of minors (the clients of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA are always
of legal age with the capacity to contract).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

85/141

  • Continuous nature of the infraction: as has been proven, EDP
MARKETER, from the moment it has become aware of the
improvements that, in the opinion of the AEPD, could be adopted in its policies, has proceeded to
analyze their texts and procedures. Therefore, it cannot be understood that it is
an infraction of a continuous nature, although this Agency must understand that in
complex corporate groups the processes of change and adaptation of
Procedures cannot be done immediately. However, this does not
alleged infraction that is imputed must be understood as “continued”.

• Status as a large company and its volume of business: the fact that EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA is considered a large company and cannot be used
as an aggravating circumstance as it is not a circumstance foreseen or in the RGPD
nor in the LOPDGDD. In addition, in this sense, the Supreme Court (sentence of 4 of
November 2015, appeal 100/2014) has stated in recent case law but
consolidated that "it is not feasible, in any case, to presume malicious conduct by the
mere fact of the special circumstances surrounding the passive subject of the
imposition (economic importance, type of advice received, etc.) (...). [It
that the public power cannot do, without violating the principle of culpability that
derives from art. 25 CE [see, for all, the Judgment of this Section of June 6,
2008 (cas. rec. for the unification of doctrine no. 146/2004), FD 4], is to impose a
penalty to a taxpayer (or confirm it in the administrative or judicial phase of
appeal) due to its subjective circumstances -although it is a legal person,
has great economic means, receives or can receive the most competent of the
advice and is habitually or exclusively dedicated to the activity taxed by the
breached rule”. For this reason, it is not legal or constitutional to assess the
status of a large company as an aggravating circumstance. Likewise, the AEPD also
refers to "its volume of business" (a fact that is not considered as
aggravating circumstance neither in the RGPD nor in the LOPDGDD). When quantifying the
sanction, the AEPD refers to the global turnover of EDP
MARKETER to quantify it, when it should take into account
exclusively, and where appropriate, the billing data generated by the eventual
alleged breach -in the case of article 25 of the RGPD, relating exclusively
to hiring by representation. In this sense, the AEPD, in its investigation in
within the framework of the procedure, requested and obtained specific data on the volume of
recruitment by representation and the tiny part that corresponds to the overall
activity of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, and should in any case have taken it into
account in the Motion for a Resolution, which has not happened. Also, as has
been indicated in the First Allegation, the volume of business derived from the
contracting with a representative represents approximately 0.26% of the volume of
overall business. For its part, with regard to the sanction associated with the alleged
infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, the AEPD should not have taken into consideration the
global billing of your activity
Benefits obtained as a result of the infringement: the alleged commission of the
imputed infringement has not generated any type of economic benefit, direct or
indirect, to EDP COMERCIALIZADORA. In any case, if this Agency considers the
Otherwise, the benefit should be calculated according to the criteria that have been
indicated in the First Allegation, taking into account that the volume of business
derived from contracting through a representative, represent only 0.26% of the
global turnover and that the proposed penalty (500,000 euros) represents a
disproportionate amount in relation to the benefits obtained

. • High volume of data and processing: contrary to what this Agency indicates
in its Resolution Proposal, the presumed infractions attributed to EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA does not affect “all the data processing carried out by the
entity EDP COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U.”, but only to the treatments related to
customers. In fact, the AEPD itself acknowledges in the section on "High
number of interested parties” that “[t]he infraction affects all clients who are natural persons
of the entity”, but does not indicate any other group of interested parties. Also, in what
that refers to contracting by third parties on behalf of its owner, is relevant
point out that said contracting only affects 0.26% of the turnover
of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA so it is evident that the volume of data and
affected treatments is minimal. For this reason, the small number of
treatments affected, and especially, in relation to contracting through
representative, must be taken into account as a mitigating circumstance.

• Recent acquisition of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA: as we have indicated in the
Preliminary allegation of this writing, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has been
recently acquired by the Total Group. By virtue of article 76.2.e) of the
LOPDGDD, in conjunction with article 83.2.k) of the RGPD, this part understands that
This circumstance must be taken into consideration when, where appropriate, modulating and
mitigate the potential sanction - a sanction that in any case this party understands that
proceeds-. Although the aforementioned precept includes the cases in which the
structural modification is a merger by absorption, in application of the principle of
teleological interpretation, its regulation should be extended to other modifications
structural carried out after the commission of the infraction and that have
As a consequence, the imposition of disproportionate and burdensome sanctions on the
new entity that did not commit the initial violation.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and the documentation
in the file, the following have been accredited:

inherent risk potential, the risk scale has 4 levels: low, with a
rating from 0 to 12; medium rating from 13 to 25; tall from 26 to 38 and very tall
from 39 to 51. The assessment or weight given to each of the factors of
risk is from 1 to 4. In the risk analysis it is marked for each of the

or of the member states.

Article 24.1 of the RGPD provides regarding the responsibility of the person responsible for the
treatment that “Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as the risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the
processing is in accordance with this Regulation. These measures will be reviewed and
They will update when necessary.”

In this case, it is stated that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U is the
responsible for data processing, referred to in the factual background of the
this agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, since, in accordance with the
definition of article 4.7 of the RGPD, is the one who determines the purpose and means of the
treatments carried out for the purposes indicated in the documentation provided
regarding the contracting of their services, so that in their capacity as responsible for the
treatment is obliged to comply with the provisions of the transcribed article 24 of the RGPD and in
with regard to the effective and continuous control of "technical and organizational measures
appropriate in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the
this Regulation”

Likewise, article 25.1 of the RGPD establishes that “Taking into account the state of

treatment for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person responsible for the
treatment will apply, both at the time of determining the means of treatment
as at the time of the treatment itself, technical and organizational measures
appropriate, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively enforce the
data protection principles, such as data minimization, and integrate the
necessary guarantees in the treatment, in order to meet the requirements of this
Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.”

For these purposes, what is stated in the following recitals of the
GDPR:

risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”
75. “The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, serious and

physical, material or non-material damages, particularly in cases where

identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of

involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
interested.”

76. “The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the
concerned must be determined with reference to the nature, scope, context and
the purposes of data processing. The risk must be weighted on the basis of a
objective evaluation by means of which it is determined if the treatment operations of
data poses a risk or if the risk is high.”

Therefore, the data controller must carry out an analysis of the
risks that the data processing carried out may have for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, implementing the technical and organizational measures
appropriate to apply the principles of data protection and integrate the guarantees
necessary in the treatment in order to comply with the requirements of the RGPD, and must be able to
demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned standard.

The principles of data protection are contained in article 5 of the
RGPD, the first of them related to the legality of the
treatment. In accordance with article 5.1.a of the RGPD “Personal data will be: a)
processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,
loyalty and transparency"). The second number of article 5 provides that "The
responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions of the
paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

The legality of the treatment implies that the personal data can only be
processed by the data controller when any of the bases
legitimating listed in article 6 of the RGPD.

Taking into account the documentation provided by the data controller,
It should be noted that the contracting of gas services by EDP,
COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. can be carried out through different channels being
these the following:
A- Telephone, which includes the following subchannels: CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and
leads.
B. Web channel.
C. Distributors, which includes EDP's own Commercial Offices and external Stores.
D. External Sales Forces, which can be: Stands at Fairs, Centers
Commercial, etc., or home visits with prior request.
 
In accordance with said documentation, the contracting of the service can be carried out
with a customer representative, except when it comes to the web channel and subchannel
outside stores where it is not allowed. The review of the procedures

Secondly, the documentation provided shows that in the channel of
Telephone contracting (inbound CAC subchannels, Telemarketing and leads) together with the
contracting the service, consent is requested to carry out other
treatments, such as sending offers related to energy adapted to the
customer profile after the end of the contract or the referral at any time of
information on non-energy products or services from collaborating companies or
EDP. This request is made to the representative as follows from the
literalness of the text of evidences 2, 3 and 4 submitted, according to which they ask
this one: “Would you allow us to present your client with offers related to energy

In none of the three cases, as can be deduced from the analysis of the
procedures followed by the person in charge in the contracting processes,
requests proof that the representative has been authorized to provide such
consent on behalf of the principal.

COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. since such a possibility is not contemplated in the
document presented as evidence 5, which contains the authorizations
for various treatments by the representative, taking into account
that it must, in his case, be a specific mandate without it being possible to deduce from
a general authorization for other treatments.

In the case of contracting through the external forces channel, evidence 6, to the
which the person in charge calls sales receipt, contains, in the box entitled
“client/representative”, a box to consent to the processing of personal data,
in the following terms: “I consent to the processing of my personal data once
once the contractual relationship has ended, to carry out commercial communications
adapted to my profile of products and services related to the supply and consumption of
Energy. Likewise, I consent to the aforementioned treatments during the term and after
the end of the contract, on non-energy products and services, both of the
EDP Group companies as well as third parties.” In said contract or sales stub,
as it has been called by the person in charge, it also appears, after the spaces
intended for the data of the representative who "declares to have legal powers
sufficient to sign this contract on behalf of the client to whom
responsible for informing of all the conditions of the same.” Neither in this
The contracting procedure requires an accreditation of the representation that is
claims to hold to contract or give consent for other treatments in
name of the represented, being the representation merely declared by the
representative.

Nor in these cases has a procedure been implemented to prove
that the representative had the authorization of the principal to consent to such
treatments, producing the risk of data treatment of the represented without
legitimation, leaving it exposed to receiving publicity even after
termination of the contractual relationship. In the case of the external sales force channel,
increases the risk, since the contract is not even sent to the principal, but
that the copy is given to the representative who is responsible for informing the
represented.
 
Thirdly, it is observed in the documentation in the present proceeding
that, at the time of contracting through the telephone channel, in all
subchannels, the representative is asked for permission to “complete the commercial profile of the
represented with information from third-party databases, in order to send you
commercial proposals and the possibility of contracting or not certain services”
(evidence 2, 3 and 4). As in the previous case, it is not proven that the
representative is authorized by the principal to consent to such treatment.

The same can be said when the consent for this treatment is given by
the representative in the channel own commercial offices, since there is no record either
in the document that reflects the authorizations granted to the representative
(Exhibit 5), specific authorizations for the representative to lend his or her
consent to such processing.

In the case of the external forces channel, in the so-called sales receipt, it appears
a box to provide consent, which is formulated as follows:
“I consent to the processing of my personal data for the preparation of my profile
commercial with information from third-party databases, for the
adoption, by EDP, of automated decisions in order to send
personalized commercial proposals, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting
of certain services. Likewise, accreditation of the authorization of the
represented to give their consent to these treatments, considering that
Your statement to that effect is sufficient. On the other hand, as revealed
above, the risk for the principal is increased since the checkbook of
sales (exhibit 6) it follows that a copy of the document is delivered to the
representative who is responsible for informing the principal.

Nor in these cases has a procedure been implemented to prove
that the representative had the authorization of the principal to consent to such
treatments, leaving the interested party exposed to profiling with
information from third-party databases or decisions are made
automated regarding him without his consent.

In the pleadings to the agreement to initiate this proceeding, it was stated that
freedom of form in the manner established in the Civil Code for the contract of
mandate is incompatible with obtaining evidence of the existence of the
representation or mandate, beyond the statements of the president, protected
in contractual good faith. However, as this Agency has pointed out in the
proposed resolution, nothing prevents one of the parties to a contract from requiring
who acts as agent of the other party the accreditation of the representation that
claims to boast, proof of this is that EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. So
it is required in its contracting procedure in the own commercial office channel,

This Agency cannot share such arguments, the regulations for the protection of
personal data focuses on the protection of this right of the interested parties,
so that your data can only be processed when there is legitimacy,
without which no data processing can be carried out. In the case that we
occupies the legitimation can derive from the existence of a contract or the provision
of a consent for certain treatments, so that if the contract is
carried out by a third party on behalf of the interested party or such consents are
provided by a third party on behalf of the data subject, the data controller must
act diligently to verify that indeed whoever claims to be
authorized to act on behalf of another, indeed it is and that that
authorization reaches not only the performance of a contract, but also the provision
of consents for other different data treatments that are requested
during the hiring process. In the latter case, all the more reason
doubt the existence of such authorization by the interested party to consent
treatments on your behalf, taking into account that requests for consent
for the sending of commercial communications and the realization of profiles
made during the telephone contracting process, unexpectedly,
so that it is difficult to think that the principal has previously authorized the
representative to give such consents. Similarly, it is doubtful
that in a contracting process in the external forces channel, it must be remembered
refers to the contracting in stands of fairs or shopping centers, there is a
prior authorization to consent to treatments on behalf of the represented party, since such
request is also made during the contracting process, aggravating the
risk for the interested party insofar as the contract is not even sent to him, but rather
gives a copy to the representative who is responsible for informing the principal.

In this way, the first of the risks to assess is precisely the legitimacy for
each treatment, and in particular, and in the event that it is acted through a representative
the risks that the processing of their data has for the interested party without due
legitimacy, in the event that the representative lacks power to allow such
treatments.

Several impact assessments are provided with the allegations to the initiation agreement,
one for each of the sales channels, in which they are considered as
threats, among others, the following two: “the basis that legitimizes the treatment is not
adequate, is illicit or has not been adequately formulated” and “at the time of the
data collection is not provided the minimum information provided to the person or
no information is provided” In both cases, the probability

indicates the following as control adopted: “Data Protection clause included
in the contract signed with the client with all the information required by the RGPD”.
They are described between the controls in progress for both threats in all channels,
except in the OOCC channel to customers or potential customers, "the implementation of a
new contracting procedure through a representative, incorporating the sending
of an SMS/Email message through which the necessary basic information is provided
in terms of data protection to the owner of the contract.” There is no date on which
incorporated this action in progress into the impact assessments.

EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U alleges that the AEPD intends to justify the start of
this sanctioning file in the supposed non-existence of a documentation that
has never been requested. And he points out that it has an identification methodology,
risk analysis and management, both to identify inherent risks and
specifically to assess the need to carry out the Evaluations of
Impact, including as an annex the supporting documentation that accredits
amply that fully and fully complies with these obligations.

In this regard, it must be taken into account that the obligations established in the
Articles 24 and 25 of the RGPD do not constitute mere formal obligations, but rather
as stated in article 24 "the person in charge will apply technical and organizational measures
appropriate in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the
this Regulation.” And article 25 also reiterates that “the person responsible for
treatment will apply, both at the time of determining the means of treatment
as at the time of the treatment itself, technical and organizational measures
appropriate, such as pseudonymization, designed to effectively enforce the
data protection principles, such as data minimization, and integrate the
necessary guarantees in the treatment, in order to meet the requirements of this
Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.” It is also a
dynamic obligation, each modification of the technical and organizational measures must
also be subject to a risk analysis to determine if said modification
is capable of effectively applying data protection principles and integrating
the necessary guarantees in the treatment.

In this case, regardless of when it was included in each

in order to meet your request in this regard, as well as to highlight the
EDP's proactivity regarding its suggestion to adapt said
process." Said document did not indicate the date of implementation of such measures.

In the allegations to the start-up agreement of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U.,
states that "the proposed contracting protocol has been made known to
of the AEPD on July 16, 2020, presented in any case before receiving the
written Agreement to Start the Sanctioning Procedure, being a Requirement

of control considers that it does not fit their criteria to consider it a
appropriate procedure, taking into account the economic costs associated with this
implementation, in addition to the resources of time and dedication necessary for the
deployment of these measures.

 In the allegations to the proposed resolution it is indicated that the procedure has been
implemented in January 2021. It also adds that it has been removed from its
recruitment procedure by representation the possibility of requesting
consents for marketing and commercial purposes referred to in the
AEPD, attached some documents to evidence this elimination. Without prejudice to

"constitutes the presupposition for the application of the constitutional ban on incurring in
bis in idem, whether substantive or procedural, and defines the content of the rights
fundamental recognized in art. 25.1 CE, since these do not prevent the
concurrence of any sanctions and sanctioning procedures, not even if
these have the same facts as their object, but these fundamental rights
consist precisely in not suffering a double sanction and in not being subjected to a
double punitive procedure, for the same facts and with the same foundation" No
Such an allegation can be admitted, since it cannot be appreciated here that it is the
same facts and basis as in the procedure referred to by EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U., since it was charged with an infraction of the
article 6.1 of the RGPD, for processing the personal data of the claimant without legitimacy.

Consequently, in accordance with the above findings, the aforementioned
facts suppose a violation of article 25 of the RGPD, which gives rise to the
application of the corrective powers that article 58 of the RGPD grants to the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

Number 11 of article 4 of the RGPD defines consent as “Any
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
The interested party accepts, either by means of a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data concerning you”

For their part, articles 6 and 7 of the RGPD refer, respectively, to the “Legality
of treatment” and the “Conditions for consent”:

Article 6 of the RGPD. “1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the
the following conditions:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;
d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the processing
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

to the legitimate end pursued.

4. When the treatment for another purpose other than that for which the data was collected

proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard the stated objectives

if processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which they were collected

a) any relationship between the purposes for which the data was collected

relating to criminal convictions and offences, in accordance with article 10;
d) the possible consequences for data subjects of the envisaged further processing;
e) the existence of adequate safeguards, which may include encryption or
pseudonymization”.

Article 7 of the RGPD.
"1. When the treatment is based on the consent of the interested party, the person in charge

2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written statement
that also refers to other matters, the request for consent will be presented in
in such a way that it is clearly distinguishable from other matters, in an intelligible and
easy access and using clear and simple language. No part will be binding
of the statement that constitutes an infringement of this Regulation.

3. The interested party shall have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The
Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to withdrawal. Before giving their consent, the interested party
will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

4. When assessing whether the consent has been freely given, it will be taken into account in the
greatest extent possible whether, among other things, the performance of a contract,
including the provision of a service, is subject to consent to the processing of
personal data that is not necessary for the execution of said contract”.

It takes into account what is expressed in recitals 32, 40 to 44 and 47 of the RGPD in
in relation to the provisions of articles 6 and 7 above. From what is stated in
These considerations include the following:

despite being appropriate in the specific case, or when the fulfillment of a
contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent,
even when this is not necessary for such compliance.

It is also appropriate to take into account the provisions of article 6 of the LOPDGDD:

“Article 6. Treatment based on the consent of the affected party
1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
consent of the affected party is understood as any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which it accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the treatment of personal data that

2. When it is intended to base the processing of the data on the consent of the

specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.
3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the affected party consenting to the
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship”.

In accordance with what has been expressed, data processing requires the existence of a
legal basis that legitimizes it, such as the consent of the interested party
validly.

From the analysis of the gas service contracting procedures established by
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U, it follows that in the contracting made to
through the telephone subchannels (CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and Leads) it is requested
to the representative permission to “complete the commercial profile of the represented with
information from third-party databases, in order to send you commercial proposals
and the possibility of contracting certain services or not” (evidence 2, 3 and 4).

Evidences 2, 3 and 4 show that the following information is provided to the contracting party
“Your personal data and those of your representative will be processed by EDP Comercializa-
dora SAU and EDP Energía SAU for the management of their contracts, fraud prevention,
profiling based on customer and EDP information, as well as the realization
creation of personalized communications about products or services directly
related to their contracts, being able at any time to oppose them.
more". Next, your consent is requested in the following terms:
"Additionally, so that at EDP we can advise you with the best proposals

data from third parties, in order to send you personalized proposals and the
possibility of contracting certain services or not? [OTHERWISE]"
With regard to the sales channel by external sales forces, in the Checkbook of
sales (Exhibit 6), the following request for consent appears along with a
box to mark the same:
“I consent to the processing of my personal data for the preparation of my profile
commercial with information from third-party databases, for the
adoption, by EDP, of automated decisions in order to send
personalized commercial proposals, as well as to allow, or not, the contracting
of certain services.
It is considered that the consent thus given is not adjusted to the provisions of the
RGPD and in the LOPDGDD. Consent is requested with poor information,
while neither what third-party databases are going to be consulted nor what type of data are indicated
are going to be collected, so that the interested party is absolutely unaware of what
is consenting. Nor is it determined who will be responsible for the
treatment, a generic reference to EDP is made, without the client who has
contracted a service with only one of the two entities (EDP
COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U. or EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U.) know if you are consenting
that such treatments are carried out by both entities or only that of which
is client. Nor is it clear what type of services will be allowed to contract or not.
Such deficiencies do not allow the interested party to know the consequences of their
decision and thus assess the convenience of giving or not giving their consent.

Likewise, a single consent is requested for two different purposes, although
both are automated, one of them is the sending of personalized advertising and, the
another, to give permission so that the person in charge determines whether or not to allow him to contract
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6

112/141

certain services, so it cannot be considered that such consent is
specific in the terms of articles 4.11 and 6.1.a) of the RGPD and 6.1 of the
LOPDGDD.

Regarding the automated decision regarding "allow or not the hiring of a
service” must also take into account the provisions of article 22 of the RGPD
according to which:
"1. Every interested party shall have the right not to be the subject of a decision based on
solely in automated processing, including profiling, which
produce legal effects on him or significantly affect him in a similar way.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:
a) is necessary for the conclusion or execution of a contract between the interested party and
a data controller;
b) is authorized by the law of the Union or of the Member States that are
applies to the data controller and that also establishes appropriate measures
to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, or
c) is based on the explicit consent of the interested party.
3. In the cases referred to in section 2, letters a) and c), the person responsible for the
treatment will adopt the appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and
freedoms and legitimate interests of the interested party, at least the right to obtain
human intervention by the controller, to express their point of view and to
challenge the decision.
4. The decisions referred to in section 2 shall not be based on the categories
personal data referred to in article 9, paragraph 1, unless
Article 9(2)(a) or (g) applies and measures have been taken
adequate to safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the
interested."

In accordance with the provisions of said precept, to the extent that the decisions
automated will produce legal effects on the interested party or will affect him in a
significant way, the consent must be explicit, so that its obtaining does not
can be done in the same way as to obtain a general consent,
must be obtained in a reinforced way. To this must be added that article 13 of the
RGPD in its letter f) requires that the interested party be provided with significant information
on the applied logic, as well as the importance and foreseen consequences of
said treatment for the interested party. This information is not provided which, furthermore,
may hinder the exercise by interested parties of their rights and especially
of those expressly included in art. 22 of the RGPD: right to obtain intervention
on the part of the person in charge, to express their point of view and to contest the
decision.

Alleges EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.AU. that consent is provided on the basis
of the good practices enunciated by the AEPD and ratified by the LOPDGDD, of
way that the interested parties are transferred through the double-layer system, alleges
also that with respect to the absence of identification of third-party sources or
categories of data, such information may be derived from the information
provided to the client in the first layer (by clearly identifying that the treatment
will be made with third-party sources) as in the second layer, whose content
appears in the section called “general conditions of the contract”, whose
content states: "(II) The elaboration of commercial profiles of the Client through the

that allow knowing in greater detail the risks associated with contracting. (iii)
Based on the results obtained from the aggregation of the indicated data,

It points out that, as reflected in the cited text, EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has
identified in great detail the types of data that are processed for the purposes
detailed, being the sources consulted for it an evident derivation of what
previous. Finally, it alleges that being the origin of the data the interested party,
It is only up to the Entity to report in accordance with the provisions of article
13 RGPD, a provision that does not establish, in any of its precepts, the
obligation to identify neither the source nor the type of data. only in the

These claims cannot be shared, the double layer system is not foreseen
in the LOPDGDD as a mechanism that may lead to a breach of the
provided for in article 4.11 of the RGPD, according to which consent must be free,
specific, informed and unequivocal. It is worth recalling here what was pointed out by the Committee
European Data Protection in the document "Guidelines 05/2020 on the
consent in accordance with Regulation 2016/679” approved on May 4,
2020, which updates the Guidelines on consent under the Regulation
2016/679, adopted by the Article 29 Working Group and approved
by the European Data Protection Committee at its first plenary meeting. points out
said document in point 3.3.1. Minimum content requirements for the
consent is “informed”:
  “In order for the consent to be informed, it is necessary to communicate to the interested party
certain elements that are crucial to be able to choose. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that
At least the following information is required to obtain valid consent:

saw. information about the possible risks of data transfer due to the

In this case, the identity of the person responsible for the
treatment, since it is collected on behalf of EDP, it is a

ambiguous information, since the client of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U.
You do not know if you are consenting to data processing being carried out by
EDP COMERCIALIZADORA S.A.U and EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U or only by the former
entity with which you are contracting. On the other hand, at no time is he informed
what are the third-party databases from which data will be obtained, nor
even in the second layer, being inadmissible that it should be deduced by the
client of the categories of data that it treats. Nor can it be admitted that only
the assumption that the treatment had been carried out should be reported to the
interested in what data will be processed, since only in such a case would it result in
application of article 14 of the RGPD. On the contrary, it is essential that the interested party
know what types of data are going to be collected and used, so that such information,
this is the data from third-party databases that are going to be used and, obviously, which databases
are those, it is an essential element for the interested party to know what they are consenting to.

Claims that consent is specific cannot be shared
because there is a single purpose, such as the generation of a commercial profile,
whose use is limited to two contexts linked to each other: (i) the first, to carry out
carry out the assessment of the possibility of contracting and, (ii) the second, to issue the
corresponding commercial offers to the user in question. Requests for
consent to allow completion of the commercial profile mention two purposes
differentiated, one the sending of personalized commercial proposals, described with
this generic character which may include any unrelated commercial proposal
to its services and another, the possibility of contracting or not certain services, entering
the latter, where appropriate, in the field of automated decisions.

Nor can it be admitted, as EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U. alleges, that the
information related to profiling and automated decisions, complies
with what is required by article 13 of the RGPD, since it informs about the existence of
automated decisions, including profiling and provides information
about applied logic, as well as the importance and consequences
provisions of said treatment for the interested party.

In this regard, it is important to take into account what is stated in the Guidelines on decisions
automated individuals and profiling for the purposes of the Regulation
2016/679 adopted by the Working Group on Data Protection of article 29
on October 3, 2017, last revised and adopted on February 6, 2018
and approved by the European Data Protection Committee at its first meeting
plenary, which refers to significant information about the logic applied in the
following terms:

“Significant information about “applied logic”
  The growth and complexity of machine learning can make it difficult
understand how an automated decision-making or profiling process works.
The data controller must find simple ways to inform the data subject about
the underlying logic or criteria used to arrive at the decision. The GDPR requires that the
responsible for the treatment offers significant information about the logic applied, not
necessarily a complex explanation of the algorithms used or the disclosure of all the
algorithm.
However, the information provided must be sufficiently exhaustive for the
interested party understands the reasons for the decision.

A data controller uses the credit score to assess and reject a
a person's loan application. The rating may have been provided by a
credit reference agency, or have been calculated directly from information
held by the data controller.

Regardless of the source (information on the source must be provided to the interested party in
under article 14, paragraph 2, letter f), when the personal data have not been obtained
from the interested party), if the data controller relies on this qualification,
It must be able to explain said qualification to the interested party, as well as the reasons for it.

The data controller should explain that this process helps them make decisions
fair and responsible loans. It must also provide details about the
main characteristics considered when making the decision, the source of this
information and relevance. This may include, for example: • information provided by the
interested in the application form;
• information about the behavior of the accounts, including arrears in payments; and •
information from official public records, such as information about fraud or records of
insolvency. Likewise, the data controller must include information to warn the
concerned that the credit scoring methods used are regularly checked
to ensure they remain fair, effective and impartial. The person in charge of
treatment must offer contact information so that the interested party requests the
reconsideration of rejected decisions, in accordance with the provisions of the
article 22.”

This document also points to the "Importance" and "consequences
planned” that “This term suggests that information should be provided on the
planned or future treatment, and how the automated decision may affect the
interested. In order for this information to be meaningful and understandable, it must be

In the same way, it should be considered that the three violations of articles 6, 13 and 22 of the
RGPD are independent infringements, in this sense it must be taken into account that
information constitutes an essential element of consent, in accordance with
the provisions of article 4.11 of the RGPD, being determinant of its existence, of
so that its absence will result in the consent not being valid, thus being able to
violate both article 6 and, where appropriate, article 22 when the treatment is
based on the explicit consent of the interested party. On the other hand, there is a
principle of general transparency regarding all the treatments carried out
the interested party and that is reflected in the provisions of articles 12 to 14. In this way
It may be the case that assumptions occur, in which, in addition to the
non-existence of informed consent, the principle of transparency is breached
in general for all the treatments carried out by the interested party,
thereby infringing the provisions of articles 12 to 14, without this implying a
medial infringement contest.

third-party databases or data processing based on decisions
automated that produce legal effects or significantly affect the
interested party who had consented to such treatments, as requested during

For its part, article 11, numbers 1 and 2 of the LOPDGDD provides the following:
“Article 11. Transparency and information to the affected party 1. When the personal data
are obtained from the affected party, the data controller may comply with the
duty of information established in article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

indicating an electronic address or other means that allows access in a
simple and immediate to the rest of the information.
2. The basic information referred to in the previous section must contain, at
least: a) The identity of the data controller and his representative, in his
case. b) The purpose of the treatment. c) The possibility of exercising the rights
established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. If the data
obtained from the affected person were to be treated for the elaboration of profiles, the
basic information will also include this circumstance. In this case, the

significantly in a similar way, when this right concurs in accordance with the
provided for in article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

After examining the information offered by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA, S.A.U.,
notes that it does not meet the requirements of article 13 of the RGPD.

1. First of all, when the contracting is carried out through the sub-channels
CAC Inbound, Telemarketing and Leads, the information is provided by telephone from the
as follows, as can be deduced from the evidence provided:

In the CAC Inbound channel, it is indicated to the person who contracts by phone what
following: “Your personal data and those of your representative will be processed by EDP
Comercializadora SAU and EDP Energía SAU for the management of their contracts,
fraud prevention, profiling based on customer information and
EDP, as well as the realization of personalized communications about products or
services directly related to their contracts, being able in any
time to oppose them". (Evidence 2, CAC Inbound channel contracting.)

In the Telemarketing and Leads contracting subchannels, in addition to the information
contained in the previous paragraph, the following information is added: “We remind you
that they may exercise at any time their rights of access, rectification, oppo-
removal, deletion, limitation and portability, through any of the indicated channels
in the General Conditions that can be consulted on our website www.edpener-

Said information is not in accordance with the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD in

CAC Inbound channel is not informed of the possibility of exercising the rights established
two in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, nor is it indicated to the person who contracts an address
electronically or by any other means that allows easy and immediate access to the rest of the
you information.
It is alleged that at the beginning of the call the following locution is heard “This call
can be recorded. The data you provide us will be processed by EDP Energía,
S.A.U. and/or EDP Comercializadora, S.A.U. for the management of your request or query.

the obligation to inform does not apply to the extent that the interested party already
has the information and that in the case at hand, taking into account that the

this second locution, the purposes are extended to those of carrying out surveys and the
participation in raffles, games and promotions, without, on the other hand, being informed of
the legal basis for participation in sweepstakes, games and promotions, but does not contain re-
any reference to purposes other than those mentioned in this paragraph.
In the information provided in the framework of telephone contracting in the channel

This Agency considers that it is not easy for any person, without
knowledge of the matter of data protection, differentiate what treatments

Nor is it indicated what is the legitimate interest that the person in charge attributes. Result

on which the treatment is based, in particular to be able to exercise your right of
opposition to treatment when it is based on the legitimate interest of the

In this sense, they point out the Guidelines on Transparency under the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, adopted on November 29, 2017 by the Group of
Article 29 work that “The specific interest in question must be identified in be-
benefit of the interested party. As a matter of good practice, the data controller
can also provide the interested party with the information resulting from the "examination of

6, section 1, letter f), as a lawful basis for processing, prior to any
collection of the personal data of the interested parties. To avoid information fatigue,
this can be included within a privacy statement/notice structured in ni-

This Agency does not share the argument that neither Article 13 nor any other provision
This legal concept requires that the privacy policy list each purpose, indicating specifically
cifically the basis of legitimacy that results from application, the very wording of the
Article 13 requires that the interested party be informed of “the purposes of the treatment to which
the personal data and the legal basis of the treatment are intended”, that is, the use of the
singular makes it clear that the legal basis of each treatment must be indicated. The
Transparency is closely linked to the legality of the treatment, article 5.1.a) of the
RGPD indicates as one of the principles related to the treatment the principle of legality,
loyalty and transparency. The legal basis determines the legality of the treatment, so
the person in charge must inform the interested party in each case that there is a legal basis
ca appropriate to carry out said treatment in accordance with article 6 of the RGPD, without
that it is admissible that the interested party has to interpret the privacy policy to
determine what may be the legitimizing basis of each treatment.

This Agency also does not agree with the allegation that “for any person

In this sense, it is worth remembering what was stated in the previously mentioned "Guidelines
ces on transparency under Regulation 2016/679”. They analyze the
scope that should be attributed to the elements of transparency established in article
Article 12 of the RGPD, according to which the controller will take the necessary measures
appropriate to "provide the interested party with all the information indicated in articles 13 and
14, as well as any communication under articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the
treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, with a

The allegation that profiling is associated with

when determining the purposes in the first paragraph of the general conditions it is stated
the following: “manage, maintain, develop, complete and control the

position, are those that the person in charge bases on article 6.1.f), that is, in the
existence of a legitimate interest prevailing over the interests, rights and freedoms
of the interested party, and it must be clear to the interested party what these treatments are

Nor can it be shared that with this interpretation the principle of in-

presentation of the information related to the exercise of rights, as presented
in its information constitutes a recommended practice and even applied by the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection in its privacy policy. In this respect

It cannot be shared, regarding this vagueness regarding the exercise of rights,
the allegation that the semantic and technical nuance associated with the terms “opposition” and
“revocation” in the context of the exercise of rights cannot have an impact on the
interested, because with both terms the user achieves the same objective, which is that
treatment specifically identified in the policy ceases to occur and that the
term used by EDP COMERCIALIZADORA (opposition) in the context of this
type of treatment is understood in the regulations and by the market itself in a more

is clear in defining both rights and when they can be exercised in articles 7 and

of the legal basis of the treatment. Thus, it is not possible to justify in an alleged greater guarantee
aunt for those concerned the incorrect information provided about the exercise of
rights of the interested party.
Consequently, in accordance with the exposed evidence, the facts described
in this Law Ground suppose a violation of the principle of
transparency regulated in article 13 of the RGPD, which gives rise to the application of the
corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

In the event that there is an infringement of the provisions of the RGPD, between
the corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, article 58.2 of said Regulation contemplates the
following:

listed below:
(…)
d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of

in a certain way and within a specified period;

principle of transparency regulated in article 13 of the RGPD with the scope

individual infractions typified in articles 83.4 and 83.5 of the same regulation that
under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines”
provides the following:

4. “Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,

It has been 989,491,000 euros in 2019.

It is alleged that being considered a large company or the volume of
billing are not circumstances foreseen as aggravating or in the RGPD
nor in the LOPDGDD.

Such an allegation cannot be shared, article 83.1 of the RGPD provides that

For these purposes, as an aggravating factor, it is worth taking into account the
consideration of the entity as a large company which is
linked, among other aspects, to its turnover, to the extent that
that it has greater means to comply with the obligations
imposed by the GDPR.

- High volume of data and processing that constitutes the object of the

of natural persons rose during the year 2019 amounted to 11,657.

Any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment; EDP COMERCIALIZADORA has been sanctioned in
file PS/00025/2019 for the violation of article 6.1.b of the RGPD,
for having contracted their services through a supposed
representative whose status as such was not accredited.

It is alleged by the person in charge that the AEPD refers to the volume of global invoicing
of EDP COMERCIALIZADORA to quantify the infraction when it should take into account
account exclusively, and where appropriate, the billing data generated by the
eventual alleged breach -in the case of article 25 of the RGPD, relative
exclusively to hiring by representation, being the amount obtained by the
contracting for representation of approximately 2,550,000 euros.

   In this regard, it should be noted that article 83.4 provides that "The
Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global turnover of the previous financial year”, for
Consequently, this Agency understands that the total volume of annual business is that which
operates as a limit on the amount of the infringement, and not the benefit obtained, which
constitutes a further aggravating element. In this regard, it should be noted that the
2% of the turnover of said entity during 2019 represents a figure of 19,789,820
euros, so the amount in which the amount of the fine is valued, very far from
such maximum amount is weighted.

On the other hand, said entity requests that the fact of
that special categories of data, or data of minors, are not processed in this regard
It should be considered that the processing of such data may constitute, in its case, a
aggravating circumstance, but the fact that such data is not processed in itself does not constitute
an extenuating one, without, on the other hand, by the data controller justifying in
in any way because such a circumstance must be taken into account in this sense.

Nor should the fact that the entity has been
object of sale to another company, article 76.2.e) of the LOPDGDD states that it may
take into account “the existence of a merger process by absorption subsequent to the
commission of the infraction, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity”
seeks here an analogical interpretation of this precept so that it extends
this circumstance to other "structural modifications" made after
to the commission of the offence, an interpretation that cannot be admitted, when the
LOPDGDD wants to refer to structural modifications in general, so it does,
while in the aforementioned precept it makes exclusive reference to the merger by
absorption.

It alleges that the measures taken
to alleviate the damage, such as the implementation of a new protocol of
hiring and the degree of cooperation with the administration and the degree of
collaboration with the AEPD. These elements are taken into account so that they are not

has made use of another of the corrective powers that this Agency can use as
is the imposition of measures in the terms provided in article 58.2 of the RGPD.

Considering the exposed factors, the valuation reached by the fine for the
imputed infraction is 500,000.00 euros.

2. Infraction due to non-compliance with the provisions of article 13 of the RGPD, typified
in article 83.5.b) and qualified as minor for prescription purposes in article

The allegation that in his actions he has followed the
