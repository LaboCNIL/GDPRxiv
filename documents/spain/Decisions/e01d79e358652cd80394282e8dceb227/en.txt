FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

II

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality”. The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:

 (…)

  f) Treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing,
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational (<<integrity and confidentiality>>)”

The principle of integrity is developed through articles 32 to 34 of the
RGPD framed in section II of chapter IV which is headed "Security of
Personal information". Article 32, “Security of processing”, provides:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the na-
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of proba-
variable liability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and organizational measures
appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which in its case
include, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and re-
permanent silence of treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data
promptly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness

instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of the
Union or of the Member States. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The infringement of the principles of integrity and confidentiality of which
holds the claimed party liable is typified, respectively, in articles 83.4.a) and
83.5.a) of the RGPD, precepts that establish:

Article 83.4: “The infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned,
in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 10,000,000 Eur as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and of the person in charge in accordance with articles 8, 11,

25 to 39,42 and 43;”.

Article 83.5: “The infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned,
in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000 Eur as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

Regarding the prescription of infractions, the provisions of
Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) whose article 73, g) considers a serious infringement, being
its limitation period of two years, "The breach, as a consequence of the
lack of due diligence, technical and organizational measures that would have been
implemented in accordance with the requirements of article 32.1 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679.”For its part, article 72, 1.i) of the LOPDGDD considers a very
serious, being in this case the limitation period of three years, “The violation of the
principle of confidentiality established in article 5 of this organic law”.

The documentation in the file offers solid evidence that the
claimed processed the claimant's personal data in violation of the principle of
integrity, article 5.1.f) in relation to article 32.1. b) and c), both of the RGPD,
when he managed the change of ownership of a mobile line that had requested the
claimant, as the new owner, and its until then owner, Ms. B.B.B.
Likewise, there is evidence that, as a consequence of such action, the
the principle of confidentiality (article 5.1.f, of the RGPD) since they were revealed to a
third party, also a client of the claimed party, personal data of the claimant, at least
the mobile phone number subject to the change of ownership that the operator linked to
that person.

It is proven that on 11/29/2018 the claimant and Ms. B.B.B. they requested
before a YOIGO distributor he changed ownership in favor of the first of the line
mobile ***PHONE.1 that belonged to the latter. Work in the file copy of the
copy for the client of the document, with the YOIGO logo, of change of
ownership in which the personal data of the old and the new owner are recorded.
Regarding the claimant, in addition to the NIF, name and two surnames, the postal address and
email and the twenty digits of the bank account for the direct debit of the
Bill Payment.

In addition, various extremes show that, on the occasion of the change of
ownership of the line requested by the claimant, the claimed party did not apply the measures
organizational and technical measures necessary to guarantee the security of the data processed.
Neither the availability of their data by the claimant nor the capacity of the
operator claimed to replace the claimant in the availability of data
that concern you quickly, once the entity was
sufficiently informed of the irregularity.

 

In that sense it is accredited through the screenshots of the terminal
mobile provided by the claimant regarding the communications he had with
the SAC of YOIGO, that the respondent merely responded repeatedly
-despite the abundant information provided by the claimant- that the

They also show that the respondent had knowledge of the facts, at least
from 08/12/2018. Circumstance that, together with the declaration of the claimant in the
date on which you file your claim, 12/26/2018, that the operator has not yet
solved the irregularity, shows that it lacked mechanisms to replace
quickly to the affected in the availability of their data, in short, to guarantee
the integrity of the personal data processed.

On the other hand, it is proven that the claimant provided YOIGO's SAC with the
name, surnames, DNI and telephone number of the third party -also a client of the
operator- to which the mobile line number that is the object of the change request was linked.
ownership. Whether these data were visible to the claimant, as stated, or not,
it seems clear that the claimant's mobile phone number was disclosed to the third party
which was the subject of a change of ownership. As the claimant has explained the third
contacted them by phone on 12/03/2018 to inform them that the line
***PHONE.1 had been linked to your personal data.

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the instruction
of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed on the
claimed as responsible for individual infractions of articles 5.1.f, of the RGPD
-typed in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned regulation- and 5.1.f) in relation to article 32.1.b)
and c) -typed in article 83.4.a) of the RGPD-, in an initial assessment, the
following aggravating factors of culpability and/or illegality of the analyzed conduct:

- The circumstance of section b) of article 83.2 RGPD. The defendant acted with a
serious lack of diligence on the occasion of managing a change of ownership of the line
***PHONE.1 in the name of the claimant. The lack of diligence in complying with the
obligations imposed by the data protection regulations to make effective the
principle of integrity was also evidenced in the refusal to react to the incident
caused by unnecessarily perpetuating in time the injury to the fundamental right
of the claimant to guarantee the integrity of their personal data. When the claim
that concerns us entered this Agency, on 12/26/2018, YOIGO had not yet dissociated itself from
the line of the claimant the data of the third party. And that, despite the fact that, as stated
documented, on 12/08/2018 the claimant had already filed his complaint
to the company's customer service.

- The circumstance of article 83.2.e) of the RGPD, "any previous infringement committed by
the person in charge or the person in charge of the treatment”, whose application must be made in accordance with
to the provisions of article 29.3 of Law 40/2015, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector,
that when citing the criteria that will be considered in the graduation of the sanction refers
(section d,) to "The recidivism, by commission in the term of a year of more than one
infraction of the same nature when it has been so declared in a final resolution in via
administrative”. It is worth mentioning the sanctioning resolutions issued by this Agency in the
procedures PS/385/2019, signed on 02/07/2020, in which the acts sanctioned
occurred on 11/05/2018, and in PS/237/2019, signed on 11/19/2019, in which the facts
sanctioned occur on 08/06/2018.

-The circumstance described in section f) of article 83.2., RGPD. The entity has not
responded or to the request for information requested in which it was urged to adopt
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/14

measures to put an end to the incidence -with the clarifications that are made in the Fact
Second- nor to the request made in the course of the Investigative Actions
previous.

- The circumstance described in article 83.2.k) of the RGPD in relation to the article
76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD: the link between the activity of the offender and the treatment of
personal information. Due to its very nature, the activity that the respondent carries out as
telecommunications operator implies the processing of personal data of its
customers.

Therefore, based on the foregoing,

By the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,

HE REMEMBERS:
