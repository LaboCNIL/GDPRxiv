Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

Law 39/2015, of Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
(LPACAP) establishes in its article 89.1 that "the termination of the
procedure, with filing of the actions, without the need to formulate
of the proposed resolution, when in the instruction of the procedure it is stated
I declare that any of the following circumstances exist:

a The non-existence of the facts that could constitute the infraction”.

III

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of Article 6 of the
RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the cases in which
the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

IV

In the case at hand, the data processing carried out by the entity
claimed was carried out using reasonable diligence. In this sense, it has
to take into account that in the systems of the claimed party the data related to
to the claimant.

Likewise, the defendant provides a copy of the telephone recordings through
which consent was granted, on behalf of the claimant, for the
hiring of services. These recordings were made on the 27th of
June and September 21, 2018, where the following information is provided: name
of the claimed entity, as well as name and surname of the claimant, price of the
service, duration, term of revocation and bank account of the claimant and informs of
various aspects of recruitment.

Therefore, the degree of culpability existing in the present must be analyzed.
case. The jurisprudence has been requiring those entities that assume in their
becoming, a constant processing of data from customers and third parties, which in the management of
the same, prove compliance with an adequate level of diligence, due to the
increasing casuistry in terms of fraud in the use of data

personal. In this sense, it is manifested, among others, the judgment of the High Court
National Law of April 29, 2010, establishing that “The question that arises
in the present case, in view of the approach of the claim, it is not so much to elucidate
if the appellant processed the personal data of the complainant without her
consent, such as whether or not you used reasonable diligence in trying to
identify the person with whom the financing contract was signed” or as
included in the ruling of the National High Court of March 10, 2015 when pointing out
that: “therefore, no reproach can be made to the actions of Telefónica Móviles
Spain S.A. in this sanctioning area, because as has already been stated, he acted with the
due diligence, treating the data of the complainant from the appearance of
legitimacy of the contracting of the line in question that was granted by the recording
telephone (...)

In short, it is not possible to assess culpability in the actions of the entity
appellant, so it cannot be charged or sanctioned ex article 130 LRJPAC
for violation of the principle of consent nor, and in correlation, of the
principle of data quality since the prior request for payment was made in the
address that according to the aforementioned telephone recording corresponded to the owner of the line”

According to these criteria, it can be understood that the defendant used a
reasonable diligence, since it took the necessary measures to identify the
person who made the contract.

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
