In the present case, the respondent has not presented arguments or evidence that
contradict the facts denounced within the period given for it.

In accordance with the evidence available and which has not been
distorted during the sanctioning procedure, the defendant has installed a
video surveillance system outside your home, located at ***ADDRESS.1,
*** LOCATION.1, which can capture images of public transit areas.

Based on the foregoing, the facts entail a violation of the provisions of the
article 5.1 c) of the RGPD, which supposes an infringement typified in article 83.5 a)
of the RGPD, which provides the following:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, choosing the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

(…)

For the mere purposes of prescription, article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD qualifies as very
serious:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

(…)

v

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, is established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among
they find the power to direct a warning (art. 58.2 b)), the power
to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD (art. 58.2 i)),
or the power to order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the
treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period (art. 58.2 d)).

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

In the present case, taking into account the special circumstances that concur in the
allegedly responsible for the infringement and making an interpretation
of the criterion inspired by Recital 148 of the RGPD, according to which when the
fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden
A warning may be imposed instead of the sanction of a fine, at this stage of the

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning.

SECOND: ORDER to B.B.B., with NIF ***NIF.1 that, by virtue of article 58.2 d)
