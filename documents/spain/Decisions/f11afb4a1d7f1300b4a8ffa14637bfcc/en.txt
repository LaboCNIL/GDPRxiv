IV.

In the present case, the defendant party has not presented allegations or evidence that

infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, which provides the following:

 Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”.

For mere prescription purposes, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD qualifies as
very serious "The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679; (…)”
