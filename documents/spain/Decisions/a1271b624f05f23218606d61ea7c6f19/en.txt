FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, on Data Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights
(LOPDGDD) the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is
competent to resolve this procedure.

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "Legality, loyalty and
transparency” precept that states:

II

"1. The personal data will be:
a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

(…)”.

Article 4 of the RGPD, “Definitions”, considers treatment “any
operation or set of operations carried out on personal data or set of
personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as the collection,
registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification,
extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any
another form of authorization of access, collation, interconnection, limitation, suppression or
destruction".

Article 6.1 of the RGPD specifies the assumptions that allow the legalization of the

processing of personal data and, under the heading "Legality of processing", indicates:

 "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

conditions:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part or for the application to a request of the latter of pre-contractual measures (...)
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;
d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.
The provisions of letter f of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

III

A. The claimant maintains that the respondent has violated her right to
protection of personal data because you have provided your data to a third person, without
their consent or knowledge, in order for it to manage the certificate of
energy efficiency for a home you own on which you had agreed
with it the exclusive mediation in the sale. He claims that the treatment
made exceeds the object of the contract signed with the claimed party, which operates in the
mercantile traffic with the commercial name of real estate ROYLA HABITATGE.

Indeed, as reflected in the proven facts of this resolution, the
mediation contract in the sale of the home owned by the claimant does not
Mention to an assignment to obtain the certificate of efficiency on your behalf
housing energy. However, it is equally true that under such a contract
The claimant accepted the “exclusive mediation for 6 months in the sale” of her
property in favor of the claimed.

The question that arises is therefore to determine whether - as argued by the
claimed- the treatment of the data of the claimant carried out in order to
obtain the certificate of efficiency of the dwelling on which he had received a
order to mediate the sale has been lawful or not; that is, adjusted or not to the regulations
protection of personal data.

Article 6.1. of the RGPD contemplates among the conditions that must be met to
that the processing of third-party data is lawful that the processing is necessary
for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party (section b)

The mediation contract for the sale of a house that they concluded in
December 2017 the claimant and the respondent entails, as an activity inherent to
its execution, that are provided to third parties, potential buyers, the characteristics of
the house object of the sale and among it, its level of energy efficiency.

Thus, it must be taken into account in order to know if the behavior that is
submitted to the assessment of this Agency was or was not in accordance with the protection regulations
of personal data, what is established in Royal Decree 235/2013, of 5
April, approving the basic procedure for efficiency certification
energy of buildings.
 

B.- Royal Decree 235/2013, which transposed into the internal legal system the
Directive 2010/31/EU, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 05/19/2010, relative
to the energy efficiency of buildings, in its single article, point 2 says:

“When buildings or units thereof are built, sold or rented, the certificate
energy efficiency certificate or a copy of it must be shown to the purchaser or
new potential tenant and will be delivered to the buyer or new tenant, in the
terms established in the Basic Procedure.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Royal Decree 235/2013 approved the Basic Procedure for the certification of
the energy efficiency of buildings. In its article 1.3. offers definitions of
“energy efficiency rating”, “energy efficiency certification” and
“energy efficiency label”:
- “a) Rating of the energy efficiency of a building or part thereof: expression
of the energy efficiency of a building or part thereof that is determined
according to the calculation methodology established in the recognized document
corresponding to the Basic Procedure and is expressed with energy indicators
through the energy efficiency label.”;

itself, and which leads to the issuance of the building's energy efficiency certificate.
cio existing.”

- “m) Energy efficiency label: distinctive that indicates the level of qualification of
energy efficiency obtained by the building or building unit.”

The basic procedure for the certification of the energy efficiency of the
buildings refers in its article 14 to the "Information on the efficiency certificate
Energy”, which provides in its sections 2 and 3:

"two. When the existing building is the object of a contract for the sale of the entire
whole or part of the building, as appropriate, the energy efficiency certificate
obtained will be made available to the purchaser. When the object of the contract is
the lease of all or part of the building, as appropriate, will suffice with the
simple display and making available to the lessee a copy of the aforementioned cer-
tified.

3. The competent body of the Autonomous Community will determine the mode of
inclusion of the energy efficiency certificate of the buildings, in the information that the
The seller must supply the buyer, in accordance with the provisions on trans-
reference and information to consumers in article 83 of Law 2/2011, of 4
March, Sustainable Economy.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In turn, article 12 of the Basic Procedure for the certification of the efficiency
energy science of buildings deals with the “Energy Efficiency Label”
precept that provides:

"1. Obtaining the energy efficiency certificate will grant the right to
use, during its validity period, of the energy efficiency label
gética, whose contents are collected in the recognized document corresponding to the
energy efficiency label, available in the General Registry referred to in the
article 3.

2. The label will be included in all offers, promotions and advertising aimed at selling
rent or lease of the building or unit of the building. It must always appear on the label.
queta, clearly and unequivocally, if it refers to the energy efficiency certificate
of the project or that of the completed building.

3.(…)” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In addition to what has been stated so far, article 18 of the Approved Procedure
by Royal Decree 235/2013 considers infringement in terms of certification of the
energy efficiency of buildings "Failure to comply with the precepts contained in
this basic procedure” and provides that it be sanctioned “in accordance with the provisions of
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

the rules of legal rank that result from application”. It adds that "the breach
of the precepts contained in this basic procedure that constitute infractions
in matters of defense of consumers and users in accordance with the provisions
in sections k) and n) of article 49.1 of the consolidated text of the General Law of
Defense of Consumers and Users, approved by Royal Legislative Decree
1/2007, of November 16, will be sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of chapter
Title II of Title IV of the aforementioned consolidated text.”

 C.- The transcribed provisions show that the defendant -as agent
estate agent who professionally assumed the commitment to mediate in the sale of the
claimant's home - should inform possible buyers
the characteristics of the house for sale; activity that is implicit in their work
professional and, in this sense, was obliged to report on the energy efficiency
of housing through the energy efficiency label and also the certificate
of energy efficiency.

As indicated by the aforementioned legal regulations in "all" "offer, promotion or
publicity directed to the sale” of a unit of the building it is obligatory to include the label of
energy efficiency (article 12). In turn, according to article 14, you can only
hold the right to obtain the aforementioned label if the certificate has not previously been obtained.
energy efficiency certificate. Article 14 of the Procedure regulated by the
Royal Decree 235/2013 says verbatim that obtaining the efficiency certificate
energy "will grant the right of use, during the validity period of the same,
of the energy efficiency label

The scope to be attributed to the obligations imposed by those provisions
This is clearly explained in the Explanatory Memorandum of Royal Decree 235/2013 when
do says that "it establishes the obligation to make available to the buyers-
residents or users of the buildings a certificate of energy efficiency that must include
objective information on the energy efficiency of a building and reference values
such as minimum energy efficiency requirements in order for property owners to
tenants or tenants of the building or a unit thereof can compare and evaluate
its energy efficiency. The minimum energy efficiency requirements for buildings
departments or units of this are not included in this royal decree, since they are established in
the Technical Building Code. In this way, assessing and comparing the efficiency
energy efficiency of buildings, the promotion of high-efficiency buildings will be favoured.
energy efficiency and investments in energy saving.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

The breach by the Real Estate Agent of the aforementioned obligations
das -that when a building or unit is offered, it has the label of
energy efficiency and displayed together with the housing information, as well as
show the potential buyer the certificate of efficiency and deliver the document
payment to the buyer - may constitute an infringement of the rights of the
consumers and users, in accordance with the provisions of article 49.1. n) and k) of
Consolidated Text of the General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users, approved
by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007.

10/11

In addition, the breach of those obligations by a Property Agent
collegiate real estate -condition that meets the claimed- can be translated into liability
disciplinary liability for the Agent. In this sense we must remember, on the one hand,
te, that Royal Decree 1294/2007, of September 28, which approves the
General Statutes of the Official Colleges of Real Estate Agents
and its General Council, when referring to the obligations of the members (article 9),
mentions, among others, “b) Respect and ensure full compliance with the legal
legal act that affects their professional functions, especially ensuring the application
cation of the regulations governing the guarantees legally established for the
receipt of amounts on account for homes under construction. c) Observe the
legal provisions on consumer protection in matters of sale and purchase
real estate leases, insofar as it affects their professional activity”. And by
another, that the General Statutes of the Official Colleges of Property Agents
Real Estate, approved by Royal Decree 1294/2007, consider serious infringement
(article 41.2.c) “The inexcusable negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of their
collegiate activities or duties, which have not caused damage to third parties.” And as a violation
very serious offense (article 41.3. d) “Inexcusable negligence or willful misconduct in the de-
performance of their activities or collegial duties, which has caused damage to a third party.”

D. The previous reflections show that, since the treatment of
the data of the claimant, carried out by the claimed party in its capacity as Agent In-
furniture that had contracted with her in December 2017 the exclusive mediation
in the sale of a home owned by him, consisted of communicating his personal data
to a professional legally authorized to obtain the certificate of efficiency
of the claimant's home (in the present case, the architect D.-
D.D.), and since we consider that this treatment, in the matter analyzed, was
dispensable to fulfill the obligation to mediate in the sale of the home, which derives
of the contract signed between both, the treatment carried out was lawful, being its basis for
legitimacy article 6.1.b) of the RGPD: "the treatment is necessary for the execution
of a contract in which the interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter
of pre-contractual measures”.

IV

In the written claim submitted to the Catalan Authority for
Data Protection the claimant requested that the respondent be urged to
return all the documentation and objects related to his home that he had ceded
to the claimed to be able to advertise the house.

In this regard, it should be noted that the competence of this Agency is
limited to determining whether legal and regulatory requirements have been met
established by the regulations governing the right to data protection
personal for the treatment of the data of third parties, so that the Agency
lacks jurisdiction to rule on whether or not such conduct is in accordance with
Law. All this, without prejudice to the fact that, in order for the competent body to
rule on the legality of these facts, can assert its right before the
competent administrative or judicial body.
