“I am the holder (until now) of my mobile line ***TELÉFONO.1, number used more than 20
years and associated with my last contract until August 10 with Movistar. The facts

He had a mobile, landline and Internet contract with Movistar that expired in August. for this
reason, I decide to switch telecommunications services to Vodafone. dated 31
July, I make effective on-line the new contract with Vodafone of fiber, mobile and landline.

On August 4 they installed the fiber, no problem. On August 10, Movistar makes
potability becomes effective and my mobile line is canceled, the next day I insert the SIM of
Vodafone and the network service is not activated or anything. Given this, I ask via attention to the
customer and I appear at the Vodafone store in Tarragona. The surprise comes when
the clerk verifies data and tells me that such number is registered by Vodafone
dated July 28 with prepayment in the name of another owner.

In the store they don't know what to tell me, only that they are a franchise and they can't do
much more. I start the round of calls to 1444 (VF customer service), in each
query they tell me different things, I only make it clear that there is another holder in prepaid.

On August 13, an operator proposed to me the request for a duplicate of the
SIM and wait if it works, it arrived in later days, but there is still no line, without
network, no service. Seeing that VF (Vodafone) does not solve anything. I ask for retroportability
with Movistar in the hope that they can return my number.

They inform me on August 24 that from VF they have been denied portability
of my number. Being aware that this number will no longer be retrieved, I agree
with Movistar another SIM to be able to have services, which entails a change of
data associated with banking services, etc... I am waiting for the new SIM.

Vodafone gives me an answer, which could be a data crossing or a computer error, but
They don't find the source of the problem. They cannot cancel this prepayment, and the last
What they tell me is to wait for the number to expire.”

The following documentation is attached to the written claim:

response to it in accordance with the provisions of article 65.4 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of personal data and guarantee of
digital rights, ("LOPDGDD").

According to a certificate from the Electronic Notifications and Electronic Address Service, the
request sent to the claimed entity, on 11/13/20, through the service of
notifications NOTIFIC@, was received at destination on 11/16/20.

THIRD: On 02/12/20, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for

have appreciated possible rational indications of a violation of the rules in the
scope of the competences of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

FOURTH: On 03/03/21, this Agency receives a written response from the
entity Vodafone, in which, among others, it indicates:

After carrying out the appropriate investigations, Vodafone was able to verify that the incident
object of claim was due to a technical error, which had led to the
process the registration of a prepaid line whose number coincided with the claimant.

In this way, when the claimant transferred his line to Vodafone, both lines were crossed,
meaning that the claimant did not have telephone service. However, as
has been able to verify, the incident could be resolved prior to the
notification of this requirement by this Agency.

In this sense, Vodafone proceeded to disconnect the "prepaid" line in order to
reconcile the service, leaving the line active only for the claimant and
consequently, leaving the crossing of data duly solved.

However, it has been verified that currently the claimant does not have
of active services in Vodafone systems. Additionally, and as requested by the
claimant, my client has proceeded to send a letter to the claimant in the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/20

that you are informed of the actions carried out by my client to
resolve the incident. Document number 1 is provided as a copy of the letter sent

The claim has taken place because, as my client has been able to confirm,
due to a completely involuntary error in the Vodafone systems, on 28
July 2020, a "prepaid" line was activated with a mobile number owned by
a third client. In turn, on July 31, 2020, the claimant signed, to
through the online channel, a portability of its services to Vodafone.

In this way, the registration of the claimant's postpaid line was processed, coinciding
unfortunately the number of this line with which it had been activated in the
prepaid mode a few days before for the other owner. It is provided, as Document
number 2 copy of the portability contract signed by the claimant.

When two SIM cards with the same number become part of Vodafone, the
service in one of them, specifically the one corresponding to the claimant, was
cancelled, so the service was only maintained on the prepaid line corresponding to the
foreign third party.

When trying, the claimant process the retroportability of the line on date 08/25/20,
this was denied since the SIM card number associated with the line according to the
Vodafone systems did not match that of the application. This is because, in the
systems of my client figured previously that active line, in the
prepaid mode, so it was not possible to complete the portability order of the
service owned by the claimant. It is provided, as Document number 3, the
documentation generated about the rejected retroportability request.

once the facts had been investigated, he was able to verify that the disputed line should
belong solely to the claimant had really belonged to him with
previously, since he had ported it from another telephone company.

Therefore, it was concluded that the previously reported incidence was a high
erroneous, having activated a "prepaid" line with an existing numbering. A
Once my principal was aware of what had happened, he carried out all the steps
necessary to meet the requests of the claimant and resolved this
incident as quickly as possible.

On the other hand, the Agency indicates, in its request for information, that this
incident caused the claimant to be improperly billed for the consumption of
the line made by the other holder, alien to the claimant. In this regard, you want this
party to clarify that, as is well reflected in the documents provided by the
claimant along with his claim, at no time was a charge issued in the name
of this in concept of consumption of services.

In addition, the disputed ownership of the line was associated with a
prepaid contract. Prepaid lines are contracts that are paid
in advance to enable the use of the purchased service, so they do not generate
subsequent invoices. In this way, this party can affirm that a
confusion between the invoices generated to the claimant's ownership and the charges
made to the ownership of the third party.

My client became aware of this incident for the first time on
last August 10, 2020 during the portability process, date on which,
from the technical support department, it was possible to verify that the number
phone was already active in its prepaid modality in the ID of a third party.

Once it was verified that the line corresponded to the claimant, the
pertinent steps, in order to unlink the "prepaid" line from that numbering of
so that the service remains available exclusively to the claimant. of this
Thus, on 09/11/20 the "prepaid" line was deactivated, unlinking it from the ID of the
third party unrelated to the claimant and leaving the reconciled service in the client ID.

In this way, the diligent action on the part of my client is accredited,
the incident having been duly resolved well in advance of the
notification of the claim filed by the Claimant. Without prejudice to
above, once this request has been transferred to the offices of
my represented, from Vodafone the pertinent checks have been carried out in
relation to the matter object of the claim, verifying that the claimant, in the
currently, does not maintain active services with my client, having caused low
on September 25, 2020”.

The statement of allegations presented by the entity Vodafone is accompanied by a copy of
the letter sent by this company to the claimant on March 3, 2021 and where he was
says, verbatim, the following:

"We contacted you as a result of your claim, which has been
transferred by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection in relation to the
information request file E/09079/2020.

Once the appropriate checks have been carried out and the facts described have been analyzed
in your claim, as requested, we inform you that the incident that gave rise to
this claim was due to an inadvertent error in our systems, for which
processed the registration of a prepaid line with the numbering in question, on the 28th of
July 2020, which turned out to be identical to the telephone line whose portability
signed on 07/31/20. According to our systems, the “prepaid” line is
was activated prior to your portability, the service of your line is not
could enable, since the same numbering associated with two ownerships coexisted
different.

However, upon becoming aware of the incident, Vodafone carried out
all pertinent steps in order to resolve what happened as quickly as possible
possible. In this way, once we were able to verify that the line corresponded
only to you, we proceeded to deactivate the "prepaid" line, thus resolving the
incidence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as a result of your claim, we have been able to
verify that, at present, it does not maintain active services in our
company(…)".

SEVENTH: On 06/16/21, the entity TELEFÓNICA sends to this Agency, writing
reply to the request for information, where it states, among others, the following-
tea:

“The claimant was a client of MOVISTAR on 07/31/20. The mobile line was part
of the Fusion Base, an invoice is attached that certifies the assignment of the number and confirms
that portability was requested from the entity Vodafone, being effective on 08/10/20”.

EIGHTH: On 07/27/21, the respondent entity sends to this Agency, a letter of
response to the request made, where it states, among others, the following:

“After making the pertinent queries in the internal systems of my client,
This Agency is informed that the claimant was a customer of Vodafone
in 2015, porting its services to Movistar in August 2018. At this point,
due to a specific failure in the system, despite porting the number to another entity, this
numbering was left free to be assigned to another client.

In this regard, in July 2020 the disputed line was assigned to a prepaid customer,
taking leave in September 2020. In this interim, the claimant, on the 31st of
July 2020, signed, through the online channel, a portability of its services to
Vodafone. In this way, the registration of the Complainant's postpaid line was processed,
unfortunately deciding the number of this line with the one that had been activated in
the prepaid modality a few days before for the other holder.

pertinent steps, in order to unlink the "prepaid" line from that numbering of
so that the service remains available exclusively to the Claimant.

In this way, on 09/11/20 the “prepaid” line was deactivated, unlinking it from the ID of the
third party unrelated to the claimant and leaving the service reconciled with the client.

In this way, the diligent action on the part of my client is accredited,
the incident having been duly resolved well in advance of the
notification of the claim filed by the claimant.

Once this request has been transferred to the offices of my representative,
seated, from Vodafone the pertinent checks have been carried out in relation to
with the matter object of the claim, verifying that the claimant, currently
ity, does not maintain active services with my client, having caused sick leave
date September 25, 2020. Therefore, following the provisions of the allegations
tions presented at the request of the Agency E/09079/2020, the reason for the
which the mobile line from portability of the donor TELEFÓNICA DE ESPAÑA
S.A.U. be released for assignment to a third party in prepaid mode was de-
due to a totally involuntary error in the Vodafone systems”.

NINTH: In view of the reported facts, in accordance with the evidence
that is available, the Data Inspection of this Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data considers that the processing of personal data carried out by the claimant
demanded does not meet the conditions imposed by current regulations on pro-
data protection, for which reason the opening of this sanctioning proceeding proceeds
