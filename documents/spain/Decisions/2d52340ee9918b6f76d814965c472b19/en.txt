The RGPD defines in its article 4:

("the interested"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, an identifier
online or one or more elements of the physical, physiological, genetic,
psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

2) “processing”: any operation or set of operations performed on data

The fundamental right to data protection seeks to guarantee its owner a
power of control over your personal data, over its use and destination, for the purpose of
prevent their illicit and harmful traffic to the dignity and rights of the affected party.

The document presented by the claimant at the Town Hall contains data whose
responsible for management and custody is the City Council, its character and destiny are not the
dissemination for the knowledge of third parties, in a particular FACEBOOK account, but the
attention of the City Council, competent for the management of the matter that the claimant urged.
As ***POSITION.1, in his position, this person, who is also the claimed person, may have
access to said document, but it is proven that it makes a merely private use for
reply to a statement from another political group on your private FACEBOOK account, without
any reference to the City Council or political group.

In addition, the presentation of an instance by an individual so that they undertake
specific actions does not fall within the matters that must be fully exposed
as active transparency, including the personal data of the petitioner, since it is not
proportional to the purpose, adequate, nor pertinent, even if it has a bar or regent a
business open to the public, or known for it. In this case the data was linked to a
instance that is registered in the City Council as it is a matter of competence of this, not for the
use of the claim in a particular medium when it has deemed it convenient, for which
It has no jurisdiction or powers.

  If what the respondent wanted was to reply that the initiative on road action
had belonged to an individual, it is not proportional or adequate, nor does it comply with regulations.
treatment of your data on said platform, and may, for example, have crossed out data
without any identifying element being visible.

The fact that the claimant has an establishment open to the public, or that it is
known in the area, is indistinct for data protection purposes since the claimed
provides your data for a purpose in a specific public matter. The fact is that
These data are subject to the personal reserve conferred by the office of affairs
administrative, not for dissemination and comments with other participants.

The particular use of the claimed party escapes the circle of responsibility of the
City Hall as a public entity. It seems clear that the ***CARGO.1 cannot use the
data from third parties to defend their performance or management in a social network at a particular level,
that has nothing to do with said issue or with the official system of transparency by the
that its activity must be manifested.

It follows that in accessing and disposing of the document obtained and disclosed,
intervened the exclusive will of the claimed, which technically treats it through the
FACEBOOK platform, and thanks to this, a knowledge of third parties of their
data that should not have been given, nor on the other hand was expected by the claimant.

The social network FACEBOOK is an automated data platform, being in the
moment of the events, the defendant was the one who used it as a tool for disseminating
information. The fact that you use the offered platform to enjoy the services
associated with it does not exempt you from complying with data protection regulations such as
responsible for the treatment that has been carried out.

It is concluded that the respondent carries out data processing with an instance that
had input in the town hall on a matter of road safety, and without counting on the
consent of the owner of the data, and with the consequent surprise, he saw exposed his
data, out of any expectation.

 In the present case, the defendant's freedom of expression, which additionally
held the status of ***CARGO.1 at that time, it could have materialized
also without disclosing the complete data of the claimant.

The use of the social platform for informational, political or social purposes does not apply the
“domestic scope” exemption. In this case, the user, the claimed party, assumes full
liability of a data controller that discloses personal data to

6/8

another data controller (SOCIAL NETWORK SERVICE, SRS) and third parties
(other SNS users or potentially even other data controllers)
data that have access to them). In such circumstances, the user would need the
consent of the aforementioned interested party, or other legitimate basis that appears in the
article 6.1 of the RGPD.

In the present case, the expressions in a private capacity of the respondent do not
respond to an action subject to administrative law because it did not act
displaying any competence that comes attributed to it by the norm in that aspect, but
that it does so in an informal way, issuing opinions and judgments, accompanied by the instance
presented in the past by the claimant, making use of it favorably to refute what
manifested another political group. For responding to public interest the installation of the element
road, the object, not for that reason they have to sacrifice and expose the data of the petitioner,
claimant, not being able to prosper the reason for treatment of public interest.

 The claimed party, acting in a private capacity, lacks a legitimate basis for the treatment
that it has carried out, considering it illegal, for not being based on any legitimate basis that is
contain in any of the points of article 6.1.a) to f) of the RGPD

In this sense, the proposal proceeded to vary the imputation to the defendant of the
infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, for not acting the claimed in this case within the framework
local institutional that is required to take security measures, and arise, not
within the competences and organization of the city council, but in a private capacity in the network
social FACEBOOK from your personal account, using your particular profile.

Not proving that the claimant has an enabling title for the treatment
of data under any perspective of article 6.1 of the RGPD, nor specific reason for the
treatment carried out, it is considered that the infringement falls under article
5.1.a) of the RGPD that indicates:

The personal data will be:

a) processed in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,

loyalty and transparency»);

It also contributes to this typification, that in addition, the data of
fair manner when they are presented in a public registry and extracted, publishing them in a
private system such as FACEBOOK, for private uses exercised by the claimed party. The
claimed should have thought about whether the use that was going to be given to said data confronts the
loyalty in the use of the same insofar as they were given with a very specific purpose, without
the invasion of the right of the claimant is justified. The letter presented by the
claimant in January 2018 as a matter to be managed, is likely to identify his
signatory through the data contained, whether on paper or in electronic format.
That document, after nine months, could be that with the matter already resolved or
initiated, is uploaded to a platform such as FACEBOOK, voluntarily by the claimed,
proceeding through it to make themselves known to third parties not interested in the
procedure not only the matter but also the data of its presentation.

The respondent should not use management documents of a public nature to
a particular page and through a platform that can be accessed by anyone
know the data of the claimant.

Regarding the proper use of FACEBOOK, the main rule of use, especially of
a public office is, as a general rule, not to expose personal data on a social network
of a personal nature of citizens referred to the presentation of their applications that identify
identify or make them identifiable.

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles
5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, with administrative fines of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the highest
aunt."

Article 58.2 of the RGPD indicates: "Each control authority will have all the

following corrective powers indicated below:

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the processing operations have violated the provisions of this Regulation-
mint;

d) order the controller or processor that the processing operations
compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, of a de-
completed manner and within a specified time;

Recital 148 of the RGPD indicates that in order to impose the corrective measure
adequate, special attention should be paid to the nature, severity and duration of the
infringement, or to any relevant prior infringement, and to any other circumstance
aggravating or mitigating. For natural persons, instead of sanctioning by means of a fine,
impose a warning. In this case, the disclosure of the data occurs during
scarcely three hours, applying the warning measure.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and proving the existence

of the infringement,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., for an infringement of article 5.1.a) of the RGPD, in accordance with
indicates article 83.5a) of the RGPD, a sanction of WARNING, in accordance with the
article 58.2.b) of the RGPD.
