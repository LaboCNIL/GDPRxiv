Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: The Superior Police Headquarters of ***COMUNIDAD.1 (hereinafter, the
claimant), dated February 4, 2021, sent the notification record of a
alleged infringement of data protection regulations to the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.

The following is indicated in the letter of remission of the Minutes, in relation to the matter of
Data Protection:

“The Unit against Immigration Networks and Falsehoods attached to the Brigade
Provincial of Immigration and Borders of ***LOCATION.1 of the Superior Headquarters of
Police of ***COMUNIDAD.1 have detected, as a result of receiving multiple
claims and complaints both from users and agencies and offices of
lawyers related to the documentary procedures of foreigners, which this
saturation, in addition to the causes exposed, is also motivated by the
practices that are being carried out by those responsible for various establishments
open to the public, mainly booths, and/or individuals who advertise for the
obtaining previous appointments in exchange for different economic amounts and that, in order to
achieve greater profit, saturate the computer platform in such a way that they cause
that users find it very difficult to obtain a free appointment before the
administration and are forced to require their services.

Users have been forced to provide their personal data, both in an
written as providing a copy of their identification documentation, to employees or
people who offer this service so that, with said data, they can reserve the
appointment before the administration, since said appointments are nominal and there is no room for
appearance at the police documentation offices with proof of appointments that
do not correspond to the person who is going to carry out the requested procedure.

This transfer of your personal data is made without any guarantee or identification
of the person in charge of the treatment of the same, as well as without informing or obtaining the
consent of the users in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 3/2018,
Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights, and the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, on your rights of access to your data, rectification,
suppression or limitation of its treatment incurring for it, in the opinion of this Unit
police, in a slight infringement of article 74.a of the aforementioned L.O. 3/2018, without prejudice
that with these behaviors they may also be infringing some other of the
precepts of the L.O. 3/2018.
On 01/14/2021, by police officers attached to this Unit, it was
carried out an administrative inspection in the booth called "*** LOCUTORIO.1",

located at ***ADDRESS.1 of ***LOCALITY.2 (***LOCALITY.1), in which
confirmed the existence of numerous client files (handwritten papers, copies
of documentation, NIE prior appointment receipts), which were stored in said
establishment with the alleged purpose of obtaining prior appointments for the
carrying out different procedures, extending in the place the mandatory act of
inspection whose copy is attached to this document.

Inside the establishment, a precautionary intervention was carried out on 25
documents containing personal data (name, surnames, document, telephone,
etc.) belonging to third parties, in order to carry out the
corresponding police procedures with the holders of that documentation.

[…]

Once the corresponding procedures were carried out, the summons and
subsequent taking of statements from various people whose details appear in the
intervened documentation, which have expressed that they were not informed or
gave any express or tacit consent to the provisions of the
Article 6.1.a of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of April 27, 2016, when providing your personal data to those in charge of the
establishment to obtain an appointment.

[…]

Based on the foregoing, in the opinion of the interveners, the owner of the establishment, both
personally or through its employees, would be infringing one or
various precepts of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights, as well as the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27, 2016, regarding
to the protection of natural persons with regard to data processing
therefore, on 02/03/2021, previously mentioned, he appears in these
dependencies, the owner of the establishment called A.A.A. with NIE ***NIE.1”

SECOND: Prior to admitting this claim for processing, the
The Agency transferred it to the person claimed on 03/01/2021, in accordance with the
Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD). Occurred
a first notification attempt through postal mail, being “Returned to origin
by unknown” on 03/09/2021. Subsequently, on 04/15/2021, a
second notification attempt at the establishment's address, being received by
the one claimed on 04/29/2021, as stated in the Receipt Notice issued by Correos

On 06/03/2021, the respondent submitted a brief of allegations in which he indicates:

“He who signs A.A.A. with nie ***NIE.1 received an inspection from the brigade
province of immigration and borders, which due to the new entry into force of the law
of data protection informed me. That it was mandatory to inform all clients
about the treatment of your personal data, I am sure that it has to be like this,
I have clients who request an appointment, for dgt, social security, sepe, agency
tax, immigration, city hall and more, clients voluntarily as is logical

They give me their personal data to carry out the corresponding procedure, but in no way
moment and under no point of view do I agree with what is indicated in the writing
on the authority that clients were forced to give me their data,
How can you make an appointment without the client not giving their data, it seems to me
something absurd, and for the matter I expose:

Point 1.- From that moment I make the clients sign a document so that they
proceed to the delivery of your personal data.

Point 2.- At this point I was unaware that it was necessary to inform about the law of protection of
data, which is an error without bad faith on the part of the undersigned.

As proof of compliance, I attach an informative document to my clients so that they can
authorize the use of their data for the pertinent management.”

agreement to open the procedure- establishes that if no allegations are made
within the term established on the content of the initiation agreement, when it contains
a precise statement about the imputed responsibility, may be
considered motion for a resolution.

In the present case, the agreement to initiate the disciplinary proceedings determined the
facts in which the imputation was specified, the infringement of the RGPD attributed to the
claimed and the sanction that could be imposed. Therefore, taking into account that
the respondent has not made allegations to the agreement to initiate the file and in
attention to what is established in article 64.2.f LPACAP, the aforementioned initial agreement is
considered in this case proposed resolution.

SIXTH: The agreement to initiate the procedure agreed in the fourth point of the part
