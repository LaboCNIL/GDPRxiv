B.B. acknowledges that you gave him access to the entire XXXXXX program in good faith but that once
seen what happened, the minimum required by law has been left to him.”

“A.A.A. ensures that "most entries have to be seconds."

“About the accusations against A.A.A. of a 'possible misuse' of the XXXXXX program, the
Councilor did not deny the number of entries, although he justified the figure in the access system,
that “it forces you to several entries to get to a document, that is why many of them have
It has to be a few seconds”, he asserted.”

happens in the Town Hall: of complaints or requests from the neighbors, judicial resolutions,
subsidies and a lot of information that the Secretariat is hiding from us as a result of the opening

The RGPD defines in its article 4:
1) "personal data": any information about an identified or identifiable natural person
("the interested"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, an identifier
online or one or more elements of the physical, physiological, genetic,
psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

2) “processing”: any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not,
such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or
modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or
any other form of authorization of access, collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or
destruction;

4) “file”: any structured set of personal data, accessible in accordance with
determined criteria, whether centralized, decentralized or distributed functionally or
geographical;

7) “controller” or “controller”: the natural or legal person, authority
public, service or other body that, alone or jointly with others, determines the ends and means
of the treatment; if the law of the Union or of the Member States determines the purposes and
means of treatment, the person responsible for treatment or the specific criteria for its
appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the Member States;

In the news that appear in the media, the data of XXX XXXXXX, claimant,
with your name and surnames referred to as elected public representative in the corporation,
with public responsibilities.

Due to this condition, it seems that access to a computer application was enabled in its day
that contains the entries and exits of writings of the residents of the town, companies and
any document referring in general to the competences of the city council.

On the possibilities, limits and requirements of access to information that may have the
Councilors, subsidiarily to information containing personal data of the
neighbors, for carrying out their functions, there are reports on the AEPD website, as well
as well as the Basque Data Protection Agency (AVPD). For example, for all
would serve as the AVPD, the Opinion regarding requests for access by Councilors to the
records of entries and exits of the town hall, CN16-006, of 03/31/2016, with the
foreseeable adjustments that should refer to the RGPD and LOPDGDD instead of the LOPD.

However, this procedure is not related to those accesses, although it should
having already accommodated the City Council its proactive behavior some time ago to the limitation of
access to the information that is required for the development of functions, in this case
of the Councillors.

The opinion, in addition, to indicate that access to sensitive data can occur
without a real justification or any need, concludes that by default a certificate is not granted

indiscriminate right to access the entry and exit registry database, and that
the purpose of this is not your access as a general rule or as a means of knowing what
It happens at City Hall.

However, here the modality of access given to the Councilors is not valued, but the
statements made in the press containing personal data of the claimant, therefore
imputed to the claimed City Council, an infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD that
indicates:

1. The personal data will be:

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against their
accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of technical measures or
appropriate organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality").

Obligation specified in article 5 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12, of
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter
LOPDGDD), which specifies:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all persons
that intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality to the
referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the

duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained even when
the relationship of the obligor with the person responsible or in charge of the treatment had ended.

In the present case, what is valued is the constancy in the published news, not the
name and surname of the claimant, associated with his status as XXX XXXXXX of the
City Hall, which had access to XXXXXX, for being a public person. In
In this aspect, it is assumed that your data would yield when treated or referred to in some
information media, offering their public profile, derived from their own performance in the
exercise of their functions, and in a relevant news item of general interest. It's not just about
of that, but to support the news, the City Council, which carried out an audit with
the access logs in the XXXXXX application, exposes in one of the newspapers, the cover of the
audit with the NIF of the claimant, personal data that has nothing to do with their
public position in the debate raised. This is the reason and foundation that supposes the
imputed infraction, without entering to value as it has been said the granted access and its
conditions. Data of a personal identifying nature that is disseminated, unnecessary for the
intended purpose, which could have been crossed out, eliminated or omitted, achieving the
same effect. Data that should have remained secret and unrevealed, and that due to lack of
diligence went beyond the scope of the person responsible.

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles for the
treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and
