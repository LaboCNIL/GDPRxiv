<<Article 23. Advertising exclusion systems.

1. The processing of personal data for the purpose of preventing the sending of
commercial communications to those who have expressed their refusal or opposition
to receive them.

For this purpose, information systems, general or sectoral, may be created in the

systems may also include preference services, through which
affected limit the reception of commercial communications to those from
certain companies.

2. The entities responsible for the advertising exclusion systems will notify

as the way in which those affected can join them and, where appropriate,
assert your preferences.

The competent control authority will make public in its electronic headquarters a list

consent to receive the communication to whoever intends to make it.>>

v

Although the aforementioned article 48 of the LGT does not configure the right of opposition, therefore
we must go to the data protection regulations in which the right is regulated
of opposition: article 21 of the RGPD, (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the Parliament
European and Council, of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons
regarding the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of
these Data) and article 23 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,
Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights).

The infraction is typified as serious in article 77.37 of said rule and may be
sanctioned with a fine of up to 2,000,000 euros, in accordance with article 79.1.c)
of the aforementioned LGT. It should be noted that the claimant line is not only
was registered in the robinson advertising exclusion list of Adigital since the
02/13/2018, but also in the internal advertising exclusion list of the claimed
since 03/07/2019, and the call occurred on 01/14/2020, which violates both the
article 21 of the RGPD as art. 23 of the LOPDGDD.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it appears in this Agency in the reference files
PS/0006/2021 and PS/00257/2021 and both subject to filing, that the responsibility of
the call made to the claimant from the ***TELEFONO.2 line is from
exclusive responsibility of the entity Estradicall SAC of Peruvian origin and, in
Consequently, the GDPR is not applicable. In this sense, there is no evidence that VDF has
contracted in your CRM any product with the claimant through the action
commercial now analyzed.

The exposed facts could also constitute an infraction, attributable to
VDF as controller of the treatment now analyzed, for violation of the
article 28.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4 of said regulation, considered slight
for prescription purposes in article 73.j) of the LOPDGDD, for the following
reasons:

Article 28 of the GDPR states the following:

"Art. 28, Responsible for treatment.

1. When a treatment is going to be carried out on behalf of a person in charge of the
treatment, this will only choose a person in charge who offers sufficient guarantees
