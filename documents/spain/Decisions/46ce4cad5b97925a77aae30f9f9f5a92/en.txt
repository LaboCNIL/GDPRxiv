FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016 on the protection of people
regarding the processing of personal data and the free circulation of these
data (hereinafter GDPR); recognizes each control authority, and as established
in art. 47 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

II

In this case, the defendant reveals data of three of its owners, one of them the
claimant, and not only to these, since the exhibition is made in a place of free transit and
public in the sense that they can circulate not only the owners who would be affected by the
non-payment, but third parties, visits etc.

It must be taken into account that for the exposure of personal data in
Community bulletin board, has to adhere to a number of principles in order to
not violate the data protection regulations.

As a means of personal and individualized notification to the owner, the Law of
Horizontal Property, indicates the assumptions in which the exposure of data of
personal nature related to matters arising from the management of the Community of
Owners. Its article 9. h) indicates as an obligation of the owner "Notify whoever
exercises the functions of secretary of the community, by any means that allows having
proof of receipt, the address in Spain for the purposes of citations and notifications
of all kinds related to the community. In the absence of this communication, there will be
by address for citations and notifications the apartment or premises belonging to the community,
having full legal effects those delivered to the occupant of the same. If you tried one
summons or notification to the owner was impossible to practice it in the place prevented in the
previous paragraph, will be understood to be carried out by placing the communication
corresponding in the bulletin board of the community, or in a visible place of general use
enabled for this purpose, with expressive diligence of the date and reasons for which it proceeds to
this form of notification, signed by the person who exercises the functions of Secretary of the
community, with the approval of the President. Notification made in this way
It will produce full legal effects within three calendar days.

Article 19.3 of the LPH, second paragraph, states: "The minutes of the meetings shall be

will send to the owners in accordance with the procedure established in article 9.”

5/7

In the present case, there is no evidence that the exposed note comes from a
call, meeting or minutes, but rather the desire to want to inform the owners,
although the community board should not serve as a board to notify or inform
when personal data is exposed, if the requirements indicated in each case are not met
for said exhibition and its functions be those of notification or citation.

In the present case, an informative note is being exposed to the owners,
making an exhibition in a space or place of transit, becoming identifiable to a
person by the neighbors who do not own the property, to be able to also include their
name and surnames in mailboxes, claimant to whom the quality of debtor is attributed,
may affect your honor. This note with the data as a means of information, in this
case does not comply with the LPH and violates the claimant's right to data protection,
for not proceeding the exhibition in any of the cases provided for in the aforementioned LPH, nor
contain the requirements contemplated by the LPH.

Therefore, it is considered that the COMMUNITY OF OWNERS R.R.R.,
***DIRECTORATE.1, has committed an infraction of article 5.1. f) of the RGPD that states “1.

of personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing
or illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of
appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality"). It has been
violated confidentiality through exposure on a closed board of ownership and
use by the claimant.

Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles
5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83 of the
aforementioned Regulation, with administrative fines of a maximum of €20,000,000 or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount.

The LOPGDD in its article 5.1 indicates: "Duty of confidentiality":

Those responsible and in charge of data processing, as well as all persons
that intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality to the
referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Its article 72.1.a) considers it: “Infringements considered very serious

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established

in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

a specified manner and within a specified time.

know the claim of which it was informed by this AEPD and the measures adopted,
having to understand from the allegations made that the note with the data of the
claimant was removed from the board, so its removal is not required, notwithstanding that
