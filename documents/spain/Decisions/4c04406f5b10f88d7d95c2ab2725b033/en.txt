III

In the present case, it is appropriate to analyze the alleged illegality of the installation of a
video surveillance system consisting of two cameras placed in the building located
at ***ADDRESS.1 of ***LOCATION.1 and a minimum space outside your property
particular.

The proven facts show the existence of two cameras installed in
the facade of the property that, according to the allegations of the defendant in his
response to the agreement to initiate this procedure, they do not capture the public thoroughfare,
only collects images of the private space of the farm and a minimum space
outside your private property.

IV

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
fundamental subjective in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing
an administrative sanction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
themselves of the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a concrete and determined fact, which obliges in any case to
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), which
establishes that:

"two. In addition to the rights provided for in the previous section, in the case of
administrative procedures of a punitive nature, the alleged
responsible will have the following rights:

[…]b) To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility while
the contrary is proven.”

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26
of April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the
sanction is based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof corresponds to the person who accuses, without
no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely valued by the sanctioning body,
must be translated into an acquittal pronouncement.”

v

Based on the foregoing, it cannot be concluded that the devices subject to the
claim capture images beyond a minimum space outside your property
particular, so that it is not possible to speak of infringing conduct in the field of
