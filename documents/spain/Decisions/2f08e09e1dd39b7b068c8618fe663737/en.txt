In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD grants to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of
December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of rights
(hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve this
procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The physical image of a person, according to article 4.1 of the GDPR, is data
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the GDPR defines the concept of "processing" of personal data:

"processing": any operation or set of operations performed on data
personal data or sets of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;

Article 28.7 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common for Public Administrations (LPACAP, hereinafter) provides: "The
Interested parties will be responsible for the veracity of the documents they present.

It should be noted that individuals can install cameras on their private property
false, although they must be oriented exclusively towards your property,
avoiding intimidating third parties with said devices.

When installing this type of "simulated" device, care must be taken
necessary to avoid intimidating with them third parties who are unaware of the nature
"fictitious" of these, who may believe they see themselves recorded by them, in such a way that they
it must avoid its orientation towards public space.

Pursuant to the foregoing, and by virtue of the allegations and documentation
provided, it is considered that the cameras are simulated, that is, that they do not obtain
any image of an identified or identifiable natural person and, consequently, does not
having produced a processing of personal data, the claimed facts do not
would be subject to administrative sanction by this Agency as they are not
included in its scope of competence.

II

In order to assess the consequences of the death of the claimed party
In the processing of this disciplinary file, it is necessary to analyze in
treatment of this question by the jurisprudence:

5/6

The second legal basis of the Constitutional Court Judgment num.
18/1981, of June 8, establishes:

"(...) the inspiring principles of the criminal order are applicable, with certain nuances,
to the sanctioning administrative law, given that both are manifestations of the
punitive order of the State, as reflected in the Constitution itself (article 25,
principle of legality), and a very reiterated jurisprudence of our Court
Supreme Court (Sentences of the Fourth Chamber of September 29, November 4 and 10,
1980, among the most recent).” (underlining is ours).

Consequently, the analogical application of the extinction criterion of
responsibility for the death of the accused, in application of the penal norms and
from the “mors omnia solvit” principle, to the field of administrative sanctions
pecuniary, considering that these must be understood as extinguished and, therefore,
unenforceable when the interested party dies before they have been effectively
satisfied.

Likewise, it is necessary to refer to the fifth legal foundation of the
Judgment of the Supreme Court of September 20, 1996 (appeal:
3606/1996), reproduced in the third legal foundation of the Judgment of the
National Court of June 10, 2005 (rec. 82/2005), which highlights:

"(...) when it comes to the liability of a natural person derived from
administrative infractions, (...), the non-transferability of sanctions and the extinction
of these for the death of the person responsible, provided for the penalties in the Penal Code
(art. 112.1 of the previous text and art. 130.1 of the current one) and for the sanctions in the
most characteristic sectorial areas of the administrative sanctioning law of
our legal system, it is unavoidable to preserve one of the essential values
on which the exercise of the «ius puniendi» of the State is based, as is the principle of
personality of penalties and sanctions (STS November 8, 1990) and that of the
responsibility that is based on individual guilt, without the sanctions
administrative obligations can be assimilated, for these purposes, to a civil pecuniary obligation,
regardless of whether or not a firm sanctioning resolution has been issued to the
time of the offender's death, since such a circumstance does not undermine his
punitive nature.” (underlining is ours).

In conclusion, the death of the claimed party determines the extinction of
any possible infringing responsibility on the part of the same in the plane
administrative and, consequently, the filing of this disciplinary file.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection

RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure as a consequence
of the death of B.B.B.
