09/02/2019 “before receipt of cash at destination”; who acted in accordance with
the procedure for submitting, processing and resolving complaints and claims
and that MoneyGram informed him that “statements sent from an office are not

file E/11015/2019, by letter dated 11/22/2019, notified
electronically, transferred the claim to the respondent and requested information

addressed to the respondent was made available to him in the electronic office on 11/22/2019 and
that on 12/03/2019 the notification was automatically rejected.

claimant through postal mail that is received on 12/09/2020.

THIRD: On 02/02/2021 the Director of the AEPD agreed to initiate
sanctioning procedure to the one claimed for the presumed infraction of article 6.1.b)
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of April 27, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
protection of natural persons with regard to data processing
data and the free movement of these data and by which the Directive is repealed

FOURTH: On 01/05/2021, a
document sent by the OMIC, signed electronically on 12/23/2020, through which
informs us that the claimant has received the agreement from the AEPD by which
admits your claim for processing, has requested them via email dated

with NIE ***NIE.1.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to the authorities of

of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

The Spanish Constitution (C.E.) guarantees in its article 9.3, among others, the principles
of legal certainty and responsibility. In turn, article 24.2 of the C.E. recognizes
everyone the right to the presumption of innocence, which encompasses both the
imputation of the facts as the requirement of responsibility of the offending subject.

According to settled jurisprudence, there is no doubt of the application to the Law
Administrative penalty, with certain nuances, of the principles that inspire the order
penal, as both are manifestations of the State's punitive system, and
Among them, the element or principle of culpability takes on special virtuality. The
presumption of innocence has to do with proof of authorship of the facts and
It is also related to the guilt attributable to the person who, in his case, carries them out (STC
76/1990, of April 26, F.J. 8, B), since any sanctioning resolution, whether criminal or
administrative requires at the same time certainty of the imputed facts, obtained through
evidence of charge, and certainty of the judgment of guilt on those same facts.

In this sense, and limited to the scope of the sanctioning administrative procedure, it is
cite the STS, Third Chamber, of 06/24/1998 (Rec. 1776/1994), Legal Basis 2,
stating that “Personal responsibility becomes the basis on which
establishes the punitive system since no one can be convicted or punished except by
acts that, either by way of intent or guilt, can be directly imputed to him.” (The
underlining is ours)

Article 28 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public (LRJSP), under the heading "Responsibility" provides in section 1 that
“Only those that constitute an administrative infraction may be sanctioned
individuals and legal entities, [...], who are responsible for them by way of
fraud or guilt.”

III

Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the common administrative procedure of the
Public Administrations (LPACAP) regulates in article 64 the content of the agreement
initiation of the sanctioning administrative procedure and indicates that it must
contain, at least, the “a) Identification of the person or persons allegedly
responsible."

Well, the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, PS/00462/2020,
identified as allegedly responsible for the facts that are examined in it the
entity UNITED ANIF, S.L., with CIF B87319364.

In determining the identity of the offending subject, the
information that the claimant provided in her complaint about the owner of the
establishment "Locutorio ***LOCUTORIO.1" in which the
treatment of your personal data allegedly contrary to the regulations of
Personal data protection. It is added to the above that this Agency is
addressed the respondent in writing dated 11/22/2019 in which he transferred the
complaint and requested information on the measures adopted to put an end to
the irregular situation denounced. This is stated in the certificate issued by the FNMT,

that is in the administrative file, which indicates that on 11/22/2019 the
notification was made available to that entity and that on 12/03/2019 the
automatic rejection of the notification.

However, after the signing by the Director of the AEPD of the agreement of
beginning of sanctioning file PS/00462/2020, there is news of the reception in
this Agency of a letter sent by the OMIC in which it informs that the claimed
has communicated that UNITED ANIF, S.L., was not responsible for the establishment

personal nature object of the claim.

The OMIC states in the document that, on the date on which the events occurred, the
The owner of the establishment is a natural person, E.E.E., with NIE ***NIE.1.

Therefore, article 89 of the LPACAP is applicable, pursuant to which
“will resolve the completion of the procedure, with filing of the proceedings, without
the formulation of the resolution proposal is necessary, when in the instruction
of the procedure it becomes clear that any of the following concurs

liable or appear exempt from liability. [...]”. (The underline is

Thus, in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the file of the
sanction file PS/00462/2020, opened to the entity UNITED ANIF, S.L., for
not be attributable to this entity the facts object of the claim that
determined the opening of the sanctioning procedure that concerns us.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: AGREE to FILE the sanctioning procedure PS/00462/2020,
open to UNITED ANIF, S.L., with CIF B87319364, as it is accredited in the
record that that entity is not responsible for the allegedly contrary conduct
to the RGPD that motivated the opening of the sanctioning procedure.
