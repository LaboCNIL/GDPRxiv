RESOLUTION OF PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on the
following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: The claims filed by two CLAIMANTS, see ANNEX
GENERAL have entry dates 04/10 and 05/13/2019, respectively, in the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. The claim is directed against the STATE AGENCY OF
TAX ADMINISTRATION, with CIF Q2826000H (hereinafter, the claimed one). The
The reasons on which the claims are based are that in the Delegation of the State Agency
of Tax Administration of ***LOCATION.1, located at ***ADDRESS.1 of
***LOCATION.1, it is planned to install an access and time control system for
civil servants and labor personnel based on a fingerprint system.

The complainants state that “it has begun to be required to obtain the signature of
via email." They indicate that an attempt has been made to obtain information regarding
the legality of the transfer of said data as well as the correct treatment of the same and
that the data which the employer intends to obtain constitute data especially
protected (biometric data). Such data is described in article 9.1 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016 on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter GDPR). Article 9.2.b of the RGPD exempts
that prohibition of treatment if this is necessary for the fulfillment of obligations and the
exercise of specific rights of the person in charge of the treatment or of the interested party in the
field of labor law and social security and protection, to the extent that this is the case.
authorized by the Law of the Union of the Member States or a collective agreement with
under the law of the Member States establishing adequate guarantees, not
existing the mandatory evaluation of impact to the protection of data derived from said
treatment violating the provisions of article 35 of the Regulation.

They consider that the implementation of the system is not proportional and does not comply with the law
planned.

Complainant 1, who claims to be an official (file E/5312/2019), provides a copy of a
email “sent to officials” of the respondent, dated 04/10/2019, entitled
“new fingerprint identification system for access control and schedule
in the Delegation of ***LOCALIDAD.1”, in which it is reported:

- The implementation of the system and that employees will be summoned for the

footprint taking. The date on which it is summoned appears.

-The collection system records "certain minutiae of the fingerprint, not its image",
“it is not possible to reconstruct the footprint that they characterize”. “This information is stored

encrypted”

-The AEAT is responsible for the treatment, indicating that article 9.2.1 b) applies as
exception for the aforementioned treatment when understanding necessary for the fulfillment of
obligations and exercise of specific rights of the person in charge or of the interested party in the
field of labor law, to the extent authorized by Union Law or
the Member States or a collective agreement under the law of the Member States
members that establishes adequate guarantees of respect for fundamental rights and
of the interests of the interested party;”, indicating that “it will not require consent, when the
data processing is carried out for the fulfillment of contractual relationships of a
employment, "regardless of whether it is specially protected data or not" From
of taking the fingerprint as each employee must sign in the lathes, indistinctly with
fingerprint or electronic DNI to enter or exit the workplace”

An ANNEX pdf document is attached: "lathe information file" although its
content so it cannot be read.

-A document is also added entitled "new identification system through
fingerprint to control access and schedules in the delegation of ***LOCALIDAD.1”, which
contains information on legal coverage as well as “basic information on
data protection”, purpose, legal basis, responsible, rights and additional information
detailed by clicking the link.

-Copy of the document "Quick guide to use access control of the AEAT" that
accompanies, and in addition to a graphic explanation of the position of the finger and pressure on the
reader, figures that when the fingerprint is entered, “it is being checked against 1,000”, and “it ends
when your ID number appears on the screen”
Complainant 2 (file E/6247/2019), adds that the electronic DNI system of each
worker is used if a fingerprint mechanism error occurs and the system is running.
progressively implemented throughout Spain, and which has not been previously informed to each
worker of the purposes and other mandatory legal requirements for the treatment.

SECOND: Upon receipt of the claim, the Subdirectorate General for Inspection of
Data proceeded to carry out the following actions:

The claims were forwarded to the respondent for analysis and communication to the
complainants of the decision adopted in this regard. Likewise, he was required so that in the
Within one month, send certain information to the Agency:

- Copy of the communications, of the adopted decision that has been sent to the
claimant regarding the transfer of this claim, and proof that the
claimant has received communication of that decision.

- Report on the causes that have motivated the incidence that has originated the
claim.

- Report on the measures adopted to prevent incidents from occurring

- Any other that you consider relevant.

For claimant 2, claim is transferred and responses are received from 07/29 and 10/10/2019.
It is indicated that the processes respond to the need to homogenize the systems of
control of access and presence of staff to the various buildings of the Tax Agency
because in some there are lathes, while in others there are only devices on the wall to
record, considering the fingerprint registration system easier to use than the system
of magnetic stripe card readers, which was a weaker system and generated
many incidences in the management of the life cycle of the cards, including the management of the
loss erase etc. With an environment of more than 26,000 employees and more than 400
buildings, the project began in 2016. This measure was selected due to a series of
guarantees such as the fact that only a few details are kept at the time the transaction is registered.
fingerprint. The minutiae are stored encrypted and kept in a decentralized system
from where they are distributed to building turnstiles when employees are
expressly authorized to access. Each employee is authorized to access the
specific buildings and in the lathes of these the encrypted minutiae are downloaded so that
every time the user wants to enter or exit they can be compared with the fingerprint that is placed
on the reader.

In June 2017, the start of the deployment of the solution was addressed. In a pilot phase,
carried out work by the working group for adaptation to the General Regulations of
Data Protection, of the security and control commission and tax informatics, reaching
to the conclusion of its viability and proportionality on the basis of the legitimacy of the
Tax Agency to control access and hours of its employees.
 
When the RGPD came into force, the existence of biometric data was already contemplated in the
personnel file and in the record of treatment activities.
 
The implementation will be carried out gradually in all the buildings of the Tax Agency.
It has no end date.
 
Information and instructions were distributed to the offices where implementation was to begin
of the system for its distribution among the employees with the information of the system and the
guarantees of each call of the employee to go through staff to carry out the
registration of the fingerprints before starting the integration the offices that have considered it
prompt. They have distributed this information in a personalized way by sending an email
email to each employee. In ANNEX 1 attached in evidence of corporate mail with
the information provided to employees used in the special delegation of
***LOCATION.1.
 
Regarding the questions raised:
 
-They consider that the information provided to the employees of the offices is complete
clear and concise. The legal bases on which the access control is carried out and
the guarantees are explained and the basic information required by the regulation is provided.
 
A link to the Tax Agency intranet was offered and more information is accessed
detailed. You can consult the record of treatment activities

access control. From these minutiae it is not possible to reconstruct the complete footprint and
these minutiae are stored encrypted.

where technical recognition problems arise, the new system will allow
also identification by electronic DNI. In this case the identification is based on
reading the public part of this certificate, which allows you to consult the basic data of
identification (DNI number, name and surname), without the need for the worker to
provide the PIN that protects the use of certificates for authentication purposes
in electronic services or signature processes, nor will the data you may have
archived the DNI chip. In this case, the legal coverage of data processing is
based on article 6.1.b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

Biometric data is closely linked to a person, since they can
use certain unique property of an individual for identification or
authentication.

According to Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies, "Data
Biometrics irrevocably change the relationship between body and identity, since
make features of the human body machine-readable and
subject to further use.

In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that different types of treatment can be distinguished
noting that “Biometric data can be processed and stored in different ways.
Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is stored and processed in

raw, which makes it possible to recognize the source from which it comes without special knowledge;
for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a fingerprint, or a recording of
voice. Other times, the raw biometric information captured is treated in such a way that only
certain characteristics or traits are extracted and saved as a biometric template.”

The processing of this data is expressly permitted by the RGPD when the
employer has a legal basis, which is usually the employment contract itself. A
In this regard, the STS of July 2, 2007 (Rec. 5017/2003), which has understood legitimate the
treatment of biometric data carried out by the Administration for the time control of
its public employees, without the prior consent of the workers being required.

However, the following should be noted:

- The worker must be informed about these treatments.

- The principles of purpose limitation, necessity,

proportionality and minimization of data.

In any case, the treatment must also be adequate, pertinent and not excessive in
relation to said purpose. Therefore, biometric data that is not necessary for
that purpose should be removed and the creation of a database will not always be justified
biometrics (Opinion 3/2012 of the Art. 29 Working Group).

- Use of biometric templates: Biometric data must be stored as
biometric templates whenever possible. The template will need to be extracted in a way
that is specific to the biometric system in question and not used by others
controllers of similar systems in order to ensure that a person only
can be identified in biometric systems that have a legal basis for
this operation.

- The biometric system used and the security measures chosen must
ensure that it is not possible to reuse the biometric data in question for
another purpose.

- Mechanisms based on encryption technologies must be used, in order to avoid the

unauthorized reading, copying, modification or deletion of biometric data.

- Biometric systems must be designed in such a way that the authorization can be revoked.

- You should choose to use data formats or specific technologies that
prevent the interconnection of biometric databases and the disclosure of data not
verified.

- Biometric data must be deleted when they are not linked to the purpose
that motivated their treatment and, if possible, mechanisms should be implemented
automated data deletion.

The interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures.”

The defendant has legitimacy, based on the aforementioned regulations, to carry out the
labor control of its workers, provided that it meets the requirements indicated in the
Second Law Foundation.

The infringement imputed in the initial agreement of article 13 of the RGPD, was for not informing
with all the guarantees of the planned treatment, adoption of the mechanism for the control of
schedule to employees by fingerprint.

  This article determines the information that must be provided to the interested party in the
time of collecting your data, establishing the following:

2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the personal data is obtained,
the following information necessary to ensure fair data processing and
transparent:

a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this period;
b) the existence of the right to request from the data controller access to the
personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation
