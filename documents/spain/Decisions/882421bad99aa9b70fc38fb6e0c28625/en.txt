FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

The defendant is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation of article
5.1.c) of the RGPD, which states that personal data will be “adequate, relevant
and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”).”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/8

This infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) the rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22; […].”

For the purposes of the limitation period of the infraction, it is considered very serious
and prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes
that:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. […]”

III

The present procedure has its origin in the installation of a camera of
video surveillance in the commercial establishment located at the address indicated in the
first antecedent that could be capturing disproportionately via
public.

As regards the possibility of installing a video surveillance system for
of security, article 22 of the LOPDGDD —related to processing for the purpose of
video surveillance - provides that, in order to ensure the safety of people
and goods, images of public thoroughfares may be captured "to the extent that it is
essential", in correspondence with the mentioned principle of minimization of
data. It is reported that the power to capture images on public roads is attributed,
in general, to the Security Forces and Bodies in accordance with the
provided for in Organic Law 4/1997, which regulates the use of
video cameras by the Security Forces and Bodies in public places and their
development regulations. Taking into account the foregoing, in the event that
to guarantee the security of a property in its access or perimeter, the area of public roads
adjacent area that is captured should be minimized.

On the other hand, and even though this point was not part of the imputation, it is
It is necessary to point out that article 13 of the RGPD —in compliance with the duty of
information contained in the preceding article 12 of the same legal text - regulates the
information to be provided when personal data is obtained from the
interested, a situation that occurs in the cases in which images are captured by

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

a video surveillance system. In this sense, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that "The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information".

In relation to the foregoing, the facts proven in this proceeding
revealed that there was a device placed behind an advertising sign of one of the
the facades of the building whose purpose was to monitor one of the entrances to the
establishment and that due to its orientation, it was likely to be capturing
disproportionate images of public roads and of pedestrians and vehicles that
They will pass through it.

However, notwithstanding what is indicated in the previous paragraph, in this case the
commercial establishment makes it up, as is also reflected in the facts
proven, a legal person —*** COMPANY.1.— and it is this company that
would hold ownership of the obligations regarding compliance with the provisions of
the legal system that are related to the development of the activity of the
Comercial establishment. Therefore, it should be considered as responsible for the
data processing that could have been carried out through the device of
video surveillance. This entails the need to file the proceedings of the present
proceeding against the defendant, for the sake of the principle of responsibility applicable to
the sanctioning power and that regulates article 28 of Law 40/2015, of 1
October, of the Legal Regime of the Public Sector.

On the other hand, it is pointed out that even if the sanctioning procedure had been
addressed to the right person responsible, the defendant made a series of statements to the
Local Police about the nature of the device and about the limitation of the area
captured at the threshold of the access door, without reaching public road. In this sense,
Since the device was removed on the day of the agents' visit,
It has not been possible to verify said extremes and, where appropriate, distort what has been stated
for the claimed. In conclusion, and in application of the principle of presumption of
innocence, it would not be possible to impose an administrative sanction when there was no
obtained and verified a supporting evidence of the facts that motivate the
imputation or intervention in the same of the alleged offender.

IV

In accordance with the foregoing, the respondent is not responsible for the treatment carried out
carried out through the installed video surveillance camera and therefore cannot
be considered responsible for the alleged violation committed.
