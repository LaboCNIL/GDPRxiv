RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Ms. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party) dated January 11,
2022 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against DIGI SPAIN TELECOM, S.L. with NIF B84919760 (in
forward, the claimed party or DIGI). The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:
following:

The claimant states that on January 7, 2022 the service of its line
phone ***PHONE.1 did not work, and the claimed party informed him that with his
data a duplicate SIM card had been requested.

After the claimant informed during that call that she had not contacted
DIGI, nor had requested the issuance of a duplicate of its SIM card, DIGI proceeded to
cancel the issuance of the duplicate SIM, and restore the operation of the SIM
original that was in the possession of the claimant.

Well, on January 9, 2022, he again ran out of a mobile line, for having
requested a new duplicate SIM card for your mobile line
***TELEPHONE 1.

Later, he was able to verify how the impersonator had entered his account
bank, making use of it.

He filed a complaint with the Logroño National Police on January 8, 2022 and
their corresponding extensions, in view of the events that occurred on the 9th of the same month
not anymore.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, for
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements established in the regulations of
Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on February 21, 2022 as
It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On March 22, 2022, this Agency received a written response
indicating that they have verified the existence of a duplicate SIM card request

relative to the claimant's mobile line. Said request, made on January 7,
of 2022 was carried out through the channel that the customer service that DIGI
has enabled via WhatsApp.

The aforementioned request was made by a person who identified himself as the claimant,
providing your personal data and overcoming the security challenge established by
DIGI in order to verify the identity of the client.

For security reasons they proceeded to the preventive blocking of the previous SIM card,
since its theft had been alleged. The same day they received a telephone communication from
the claimant alleging that her mobile line did not work, after that communication and the
verifications carried out proceeded to cancel the issuance process
duplicate SIM, and restore the operation of the original SIM that was in
power of the claimant. They proceeded to establish a warning note in the systems
regarding the fact that the claimant could be immersed in a case of usurpation of
identity.

It is stated that for customer service there is an obligation to
Consult customer history to avoid similar cases. It is pointed out that the
The measures adopted were adequate to be able to reject several attempts to
make a duplicate by the usurped.

However, it is stated that on January 9, 2022, in another attempt to obtain
duplicate, there was a human error in the customer service and that despite the
warning note, the necessary numerical code was provided to process the
duplicate SIM.

After a call from the claimant, that same day, they proceeded to deactivate said
duplicate.

The entity declares that it has not disclosed personal data of the company to any third party.
claimant, not knowing how the usurper could know his personal data
to overcome established security controls.

A series of measures were adopted:

Immediate rectification of the element causing the incident, canceling the issue
of the duplicate (on the first attempt because an error was made on the second and the
continuing process ahead).

The measures adopted by the person in charge to deal with situations are detailed.
of this type.

THIRD: On April 6, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the
LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the claimant party was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: The General Subdirectorate of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out
of previous investigative actions to clarify the facts in
matter, by virtue of the functions assigned to the control authorities in the
article 57.1 and the powers granted in article 58.1 of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and
in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of the
LOPDGDD, having knowledge of the following extremes:

RESULT OF INVESTIGATION ACTIONS

(…)

FIFTH: On December 13, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in
Article 83.5 of the GDPR.
SIXTH: On December 27, 2023, DIGI requests the extension of the legal term
conferred to answer said requirement and a copy of the file.

SEVENTH: On January 19, 2023, it is received at this Agency, on time and
form, written by the representative of DIGI in which, in summary, it is argued that
reiterate in the allegations previously presented, first pointing out that
chronological manner in which the events occurred, indicating the security protocol and
the measures adopted for these events, stating that DIGI has not made available
disposition of the alleged criminals personal information of the complainant
different from what they already had before, after having obtained them through
of the email.

Consequently, they point out that it is not possible to associate DIGI with carrying out a
non-legitimized processing of personal data, given that its performance is reduced to
compliance with its processes and obligations.

In other words, during the process of requesting and delivering the duplicate, a
processing of personal data provided to DIGI in order for it to
verify the identity of the interlocutor, first by telephone and later
in person.

In addition, DIGI states that it is proven that identity theft and the
illegitimate access to the claimant's data occurs through a
phone call to customer service, prior to having contact
with DIGI, the alleged impersonator had in his possession the personal data of the
claimant, including his bank account (which also allowed him to access
she).

On the other hand, it points out that the AEPD unequivocally imposes on DIGI a
strict liability, in which, regardless of the diligence and measures
deployed, the entity is found guilty. The AEPD seems to confuse the
concept of proactive responsibility with the obligation of result imposed by the
strict liability. In the present case, the existence of a
strict control, before and after the application of the duplicate, the establishment of
prior and subsequent measures, as well as the existence of measures aimed at
Avoid these practices in advance.

For this reason, the claimed party considers that this Startup Agreement is not
adjusted to law, since it imposes on DIGI an obligation of result, based on
only in the harmful result that is produced by the fraudulent activity of a
third, regardless of the diligence used and without considering the deployment of measures
technically adequate and implemented.

In addition, it indicates that the following extenuating circumstances currently exist
that have not been considered in the appropriate graduation of the sanction:
The absence of previous infringements committed by DIGI (art. 83.2 e) GDPR).
At no time have special categories of data been processed (Art. 83.2 g)
GDPR)
The degree of cooperation of DIGI with the AEPD in order to remedy a
alleged infringement and mitigate its possible adverse effects (art. 83.2 f) GDPR).
The non-existent benefit obtained (Art. 83.2 k).

It requests that a resolution be issued by means of which it indicates the file of the
procedure.

Subsidiarily warning and, ultimately, moderate or modulate the
proposal included in the Initiation Agreement

EIGHTH: On January 19, 2023, the instructor of the procedure agreed
perform the following tests: 1. They are considered reproduced for probative purposes the
claim filed by Ms. A.A.A. and its documentation, the documents
obtained and generated during the phase of admission to processing of the claim, and the
report of previous investigation actions that are part of the procedure.
2. Likewise, it is considered reproduced for evidentiary purposes, the allegations to the agreement
initiation of the referenced sanctioning procedure, presented by DIGI SPAIN
TELECOM, S.L., and the documentation that accompanies them.

NINTH: On February 13, 2023, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
sanction DIGI SPAIN TELECOM, S.L., with NIF B84919760, for an infringement of the
Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, the sanction that
would correspond would be a fine for an amount of 70,000 euros (seventy thousand euros).

TENTH: Once the proposed resolution was notified, the defendant requested an extension
term to formulate allegations that was granted, presented a brief of
allegations on March 6, 2023 in which, in summary, it is argued that it is reiterated in
the allegations previously presented, and that in the report issued by the Agency
of Cybersecurity of the European Union ratifies that, to make a duplicate
SIM fraud, the fraudster needs to have access to some of the data
personal data of the victim, client of the operator. That is, that cybercriminals,
have personal data of their victims prior to going before the
Mobile Network Operator.

He points out that this is what happened in this case, the victim lost control
about your personal data in favor of the impersonator prior to the latter
contact DIGI. That is, it is through the "phishing" attack where the victim

28001 – Madrid

lose control over your personal data, and it is this fact that
triggers and enables the commission of fraud.

Likewise, it states that it must be taken into account that DIGI does not participate in the process
identification of a user before his bank, but rather the latter who determines the way
in which you want to carry out this check, so it is not possible to move the
liability to telephone operators.

Likewise, they indicate that it is for this reason that the defendant considers that the Proposal
is not adjusted to law, since it imposes on DIGI an obligation of result,
consisting of the establishment of infallible measures, when imputing a violation of the
Article 6.1 of the GDPR based solely on the harmful result that occurs
due to the fraudulent intervention of a third party, regardless of the diligence used and without
consider the deployment of technically adequate and implemented measures.

DIGI cannot anticipate or know what the applicable duty of care is.

On the lack of proportionality of the proposed sanction and that prior to the procedures
timely, a resolution is issued by means of which the file of the procedure is indicated
No. EXP202202150.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the documentation
in the file, the following have been accredited:

January 2022, in which it is stated that on January 7, 2022, the service of
the claimant's mobile line was not working, and was informed by DIGI that a request had been made
a duplicate of the SIM card of your mobile line. DIGI canceled the issuance of the aforementioned
duplicate, and proceeded to establish a warning note in the systems on that day
regarding the fact that the claimant could be immersed in a case of usurpation of

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

Breached Obligation

The claimed party is accused of committing an offense for violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR, "Legacy of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.
application to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions”.

Classification and classification of the offense

II

 The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The LOPDGD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, it should be noted
the next:

Regarding the fact that DIGI has not made available to the alleged criminals
personal information of the complaining party other than that already held by those with
anteriority. Consequently, there has been no unauthorized treatment of
personal information.

Indeed, the issuance of a duplicate is not enough to carry out operations
bank accounts on behalf of the holders, certainly, to complete the scam, it is
necessary for a third party to "supplant the identity" of the owner of the data before the entity
financial.

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

What entails a priori, a treatment outside the principle of legality because a
third party is processing data, since it has access to them, without any legal basis, in addition
of the violation of other principles such as confidentiality.

For this reason, this is a process where the diligence provided by the
operators is essential to avoid this type of scam and violation of the GDPR.
Diligence that translates into the establishment of adequate measures to guarantee
that the data processing is in accordance with the GDPR.

Identical considerations deserve the actions of banking entities that
provide payment services, in which area this type of scam starts, since
the third party has access to the affected user's credentials and poses as
this.
 
While these entities are responsible for the processing of the data of their
customers, they are responsible for the same obligations as those indicated up to now for the
operators referring to compliance with the RGPD and the LOPDGDD, and also the
derived from Royal Decree-Law 19/2018, of November 23, on payment services and
other urgent financial measures.

It can be inferred that DIGI has provided a duplicate SIM card to a third party other than the
legitimate owner of the mobile line, after overcoming by a third party the policy of
existing security, which shows a breach of the duty to protect the
customer information.

Denying the concurrence of a negligent act on the part of DIGI would amount to
recognize that their conduct -by action or omission- has been diligent. Obviously not
We share this perspective of the facts, since the
lack of due diligence. It is very illustrative, the SAN of October 17, 2007
(rec. 63/2006), assuming that these are entities whose activity involves
in continuous treatment of customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court comes
understanding that imprudence exists whenever a legal duty of
care, that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, professionalism must be especially considered
or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now examined, when the
The appellant's activity is constant and abundant handling of personal data.
staff must insist on rigor and exquisite care in adjusting to the
legal provisions in this regard.

It is proven in the file that security has not been guaranteed
appropriate in the processing of personal data, taking into account the result that
identity theft has occurred. That is, a third party has managed to access
to the personal data of the owner of the line.

Regarding the fact that criminals have not managed to obtain personal data from
DIGI, so there can be no talk of breach of protection measures,
point out that access to a duplicate SIM card that makes its user identifiable
owner, responds to the definition of personal data in article 4.1) of the GDPR.

Regarding the responsibility of DIGI, it should be noted that, in general, DIGI
www.aepd.es
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/17

processes the data of its clients under the provisions of article 6.1 b) of the GDPR,
as it is considered a necessary treatment for the execution of a contract in which
the interested party is part or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual In other cases, it bases the legality of the treatment on the bases
provided for in article 6.1.a), c), e) and f) of the GDPR.

On the other hand, to complete the scam, it is necessary for a third party to "impersonate the
identity” of the owner of the data, to receive the duplicate of the SIM card. Which
entails a priori, a treatment outside the principle of legality since a third party is
processing data, since it has access to them, without any legal basis, in addition to the
violation of other principles such as confidentiality.

Certainly, the principle of responsibility provided for in article 28 of the LRJSP,
provides that: "They may only be penalized for acts constituting an infringement
administrative authority for natural and legal persons, as well as when a Law
recognize capacity to act, affected groups, unions and entities without
legal personality and independent or autonomous estates, which result
responsible for them by way of fraud or negligence.”

However, the mode of attribution of liability to legal persons is not
corresponds to the willful or reckless forms of guilt that are imputable
to human behavior. So, in the case of offenses committed by
legal persons, even if the element of guilt must be present, it will be

physical.

According to STC 246/1991 "(...) this different construction of the imputability of self-

to, but not the ability to break the rules to which they are subject.

Infringement capacity and, therefore, direct reproach that derives from the good
protected by the rule being infringed and the need for such protection
is really effective and because of the risk that, consequently, the person must assume
that is subject to compliance with said standard" (in this sense STS of 24
November 2011, Rec 258/2009).

To the foregoing must be added, following the judgment of January 23, 1998,
partially transcribed in the SSTS of October 9, 2009, Rec 5285/2005, and of 23
of October 2010, Rec 1067/2006, that "although the guilt of the conduct must
also be the object of proof, must be considered in order to assume the
corresponding charge, which ordinarily the volitional and cognitive elements
necessary to appreciate it are part of the typical behavior tested, and that its
exclusion requires that the absence of such elements be proven, or in its aspect
regulations, that the diligence that was required by the person claiming their
nonexistence; In short, it is not enough to exculpate a behavior
the invocation of the absence of guilt is typically unlawful".

Accordingly, the plea is dismissed. ultimate responsibility
on the treatment continues to be attributed to the person in charge, who is the one who determines the

10/17

existence of the treatment and its purpose. Let us remember that, in general, the
operators process the data of their customers under the provisions of article 6.1
b) of the GDPR, as it is considered a necessary treatment for the execution of a
contract in which the interested party is a party (…). In this sense, DIGI has a
network of sales representatives, points of sale and authorized distributors through a
distribution contract to offer DIGI services. Among these services
offered from their points of sale, is making duplicate SIM cards
corresponding to a mobile telephone line.

Regarding the breach of the principle of proportionality, the GDPR provides
expressly the possibility of graduation, through the provision of fines
subject to modulation, in response to a series of circumstances of each case
individual.

Regarding the imposition of a warning, warning, or the adoption of
corrective measures pursuant to article 58 of the GDPR, a deterrent fine is
one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In this regard, the Judgment of the
CJEU, of June 13, 2013,
  C-511/11,
ECLI:EU:C:2013:386, says:

  Versalis Spa v Commission,

“ 94. Regarding, firstly, the reference to the Showa Denko v Commission judgment,
quoted above, it should be noted that Versalis interprets it incorrectly. Indeed,
the Court of Justice, when stating in section 23 of said judgment that the factor
deterrent is assessed taking into consideration a multitude of elements and not only the
particular situation of the company in question, referred to points 53 to 55 of
the conclusions presented in that case by Advocate General Geelhoed, who
had stated, in essence, that the deterrent multiplier factor
may be aimed at not only "general deterrence", defined as an action
to discourage all companies, in general, from committing the infringement of
in question, but also a "specific deterrence", consisting of dissuading the
particular defendant so that he does not break the rules again in the future. For the
Therefore, the Court of Justice only confirmed, in that judgment, that the Commission did not
was required to limit its assessment to factors related solely to the
particular situation of the company in question.”

“102. According to settled case law, the objective of the dissuasive multiplying factor and
consideration, in this context, of the size and overall resources of the
company in question lies in the desired impact on said company, since the
sanction should not be insignificant, especially in relation to the ability
of the company (in this sense, see, in particular, the judgment of 17
June 2010, Lafarge v Commission, C-413/08 P, ECR p. I-5361, section 104, and the writ
of February 7, 2012, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C-421/11 P, paragraph 82).
We must attend to the singular circumstance of the claim presented, through
from which it can be seen that, from the moment the person
impersonator performs the SIM replacement, the victim's phone is left without
service passing control of the line to the impersonators. Consequently,
their powers of disposal and control over their personal data are affected, which
constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection
as indicated by the Constitutional Court in Judgment 292/2000, of 30
November 2000 (FJ 7). So, when getting a duplicate SIM card,

Under certain circumstances, access to the contacts or the
applications and services that have as a key recovery procedure the
sending an SMS with a code to be able to modify the passwords. Definitely,
may impersonate the identity of those affected, being able to access and control, for
example: email accounts; bank accounts; apps like
WhatsApp; social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, and a long etc. in short
accounts, once the password has been modified by the impersonators, they lose
control of your accounts, applications and services, which poses a great threat.
In short, it is the data controller who has the obligation to integrate the
necessary guarantees in the treatment, with the purpose of, by virtue of the principle of
proactive responsibility, comply and be able to demonstrate compliance, at the same
while respecting the fundamental right to data protection.

In the present case, it is proven that on January 7 and 9, 2022 DIGI
processed the issuance of duplicate SIM cards for line ***TELEFONO.1,
belonging to the complaining party.

However, it should be noted that Sim Swapping is a fraud that allows you to impersonate
identity by kidnapping the phone number by obtaining a duplicate of
the SIM card.

In any case, the operator must be able to prove that for this specific case
have followed the verification protocols implemented when requesting a
duplicate SIM card.

Well then, the result was that the defendant issued the SIM card to a third party who did not
he was the owner of the line.

In view of the foregoing, DIGI is unable to prove that this
procedure.

In fact, according to the identification procedure described by the defendant,
the original of the identification document should have been checked, whereas, otherwise
If this operation had been carried out correctly, the duplicate should have been
denied.

Well, between the two issued duplicates, another authorization attempt was rejected
of duplicates through the channel that DIGI customer service has
enabled via WhatsApp. However, despite the existence of the annotation of
notice the second duplicate dated January 9, 2022 was authorized due to human error
of the manager. In any case, the claimed party has not been able to prove that for

Based on the available evidence, it is estimated that the conduct
of the claimed party violates article 6.1 of the GDPR and may be constitutive of the
infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

"(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, either in this Regulation or under other Union law
or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

Fine sanction. Determination of the amount.

IV.

The determination of the sanction that should be imposed in the present case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the GDPR, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:
"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative proceedings under this article for violations of this
Regulations indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”
"2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:

3. It will be possible, complementary or alternatively, the adoption, when appropriate, of
the remaining corrective measures referred to in article 83.2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.”

Digi requests that the following extenuating circumstances be appreciated:

(I) "the absence of prior infringements" (art. 83.2 e) GDPR).
(II) "At no time have special categories of data been processed" (art. 83.2 g).
(III) "cooperation with the supervisory authority in responding to the transfer of the
claim and having provided the requested information”, article 83.2 f) of the GDPR.
(IV) "The non-existence of benefits obtained through the infringement", article 83.2 k)
of the GDPR and 76.2 c) of the LOPDGDD.

None of the invoked mitigations are allowed.

Regarding (I) and (II), it should be noted that such circumstances can only operate as
aggravating and in no case as mitigating.

The pronouncement made by the National Court in its SAN of May 5, 2021
(Rec. 1437/2020) on section e) of article 83.2. of the GDPR, the commission of
previous violations:

"Considers, on the other hand, that the non-commission should be considered as mitigating
from a previous violation. Well, article 83.2 of the GDPR establishes that
must be taken into account for the imposition of the administrative fine, among
others, the circumstance "e) any previous infringement committed by the person responsible or
the person in charge of the treatment". This is an aggravating circumstance, the fact
The fact that the budget for its application does not meet implies that it cannot be
taken into consideration, but does not imply or allow, as the plaintiff claims,
its application as a mitigation”;

(III) Article 83.2.f) of the GDPR refers to the "degree of cooperation with the
control in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible effects
adverse effects of the offence;”. The respondent's response to the information request
of the Sub-directorate of Inspection did not meet these purposes, so it is not
framed in that mitigation.

(IV) On the application of article 76.2.c) of the LOPDGDD, in connection with the
Article 83.2.k), non-existence of benefits obtained, it should be noted that such
circumstance can only operate as an aggravating circumstance and in no case as a mitigating circumstance.

Article 83.2.k) of the GDPR refers to "any other aggravating or mitigating factor
applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the
losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the breach.” and the article
76.2c) of the LOPDGDD says that “2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 may also be taken into account: [..] c) The benefits
obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.” Both provisions
mentioned as a factor that can be taken into account in grading the sanction
the “benefits” obtained, but not the “absence” of these, which is what DIGI claims.

In addition, in accordance with article 83.1 of the GDPR, the imposition of fine sanctions
is governed by the following principles: they must be individualized for each
particular case, be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The admission that it operates
as a mitigation, the absence of benefits is contrary to the spirit of article 83.1
of the GDPR and the principles governing the determination of the amount of the
fine penalty. If, as a result of the commission of a violation of the GDPR, it is classified as
mitigating the fact that there have been no benefits, the dissuasive purpose that
It is fulfilled through the sanction. Accepting DIGI's thesis in a case such as the one
we are dealing with would mean introducing an artificial reduction in the penalty that truly
it should be imposed; the one that results from considering the circumstances of article 83.2
GDPR that must be valued.

The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the National Court has warned that the
fact that in a specific case not all the elements that
constitute a circumstance modifying liability that, by its nature,
has an aggravating nature, cannot lead to the conclusion that said circumstance is applicable
as a mitigation. The pronouncement made by the National Court in its
SAN of May 5, 2021 (Rec. 1437/2020) -even though that resolution is seen
on the circumstance of section e) of article 83.2. of the GDPR, the commission of
previous infractions - can be extrapolated to the question raised, the claim of the
demanded that the "absence" of benefits be accepted as mitigation, thus
that both the GDPR and the LOPDGDD refer only to "the benefits obtained":

"Considers, on the other hand, that the non-commission should be considered as mitigating
from a previous violation. Well, article 83.2 of the GDPR establishes that
must be taken into account for the imposition of the administrative fine, among
others, the circumstance "e) any previous infringement committed by the person responsible or
the person in charge of the treatment". This is an aggravating circumstance, the fact
The fact that the budget for its application does not meet implies that it cannot be
taken into consideration, but does not imply or allow, as the plaintiff claims,
its application as a mitigation”;

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed on the entity claimed as responsible for a classified offense
in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, are considered concurrent in
the present case the following factors:

As aggravating factors:

-

The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
treatment of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the
GDPR in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).
   The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant

handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite
Be careful to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”

As mitigations:

The claimed party proceeded to resolve the incident that is the subject of the claim
effective (art. 83.2 c).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR, with
regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the
GDPR allows a penalty of 70,000 euros (seventy thousand euros) to be set.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE DIGI SPAIN TELECOM, S.L., with NIF B84919760, for a
