FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of the
article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, regarding the principles of treatment, which provides that the
personal data will be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
for the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimization”).” This article
enshrines the principle of data minimization in data processing

5/8

personal. It assumes that said treatment is adjusted and proportional to the purpose to be
which is addressed, and the processing of excessive data must be restricted or
proceed to their removal.

The violation of this article is typified as an infraction in article 83.5 of the

RGPD, which considers as such:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a)

the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; […].”

However, article 58.2.b) of the same legal text provides for the possibility of

punish with a warning, in relation to what is stated in Considering 148:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, the infraction indicated
in the previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

"According to the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

In this procedure, it is necessary to analyze the presumed illegality of the
installation, by the defendant, of a video surveillance system made up of 3
cameras located outside the house located at CALLE *** ADDRESS.1,
***APARTMENTS.1 - ***LOCATION.1 (SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE), system
that could capture images of neighboring housing areas
disproportionate, as well as an intercom for private use outside the
building, all without the corresponding authorization of the Board of Owners of the
Community.

The facts of this sanctioning procedure show that 2
of the 3 cameras installed by the respondent (the so-called camera 1 and the one visible in
the lower left quadrant of the viewing monitor) clearly capture
disproportionate community areas, neighboring homes and even public roads.
This situation is not covered by the exclusion contained in article 22.5 of the
LOPDGDD because the capture of images that exceed the verification
about the identity of people trying to access a home exceeds the
consideration of treatment "carried out by a natural person in the exercise of
Exclusively private or domestic activities” of article 2.2.c) of the RGPD.
The same reflection must be extended to the video door entry system installed on the exterior wall
community, since due to its location it cannot be compared to the video door entry system installed
at the entrance door of a house.

Likewise, even when the purpose of the data processing carried out with
the video surveillance system was to guarantee the security of the home and the space
exclusive of the claimed —and therefore said legitimizing basis could be asserted
—, the capturing of images should be reduced to this private space, limiting itself
that of common areas to the minimum tangential and essential, without in any case
can reach the gardens of neighboring houses or the public road. is remembered
that, with respect to the latter, the power is generally attributed to the Forces and
Security Forces and that, in any case, the possibility of capturing a portion
essential of the same for security reasons would correspond, for the
characteristics of the building in question, to the community of owners.

Finally, it is noted that individuals who install this type of
devices are responsible for its compliance with current legislation,
must comply with the requirements established in Law 49/1960, of July 21,
on horizontal property (LPH). Thus, the installation of a video surveillance system
by an individual will require authorization from the Board of the community of owners
both when its location is projected in a common area and when, even located
in an area of private use, orient to surrounding common areas and capture —
respecting in any case the principle of data minimization—tangentially
these common areas.

In the present case, when deciding the appropriate sanction to impose,

In particular, the following elements have been taken into account.

That it is an individual whose main activity is not linked to the

treatment of personal data.

 That there is no recidivism, because the commission is not recorded, in the term of a

year, of more than one infraction of the same nature.

 That he has shown a cooperative attitude with this Agency when answering the

request.

For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is
warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

 Certify that the automatic video door entry system installed on the community wall is

found inoperative.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to C.C.C. and REPORT the result
of performances to A.A.A. on behalf of B.B.B.

48.6 of the LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the
LPACAP, the interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration

day following the notification of this resolution, it would end the
precautionary suspension.
