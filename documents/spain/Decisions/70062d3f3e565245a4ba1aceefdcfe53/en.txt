The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed violated article 6.1 of the RGPD every time that it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. The
personal data of the claimant were incorporated into the information systems
of the company, without proving that he had legitimately contracted,
had your consent for the collection and subsequent processing of your data.

effected.

Well, it follows that the contracts provided (Movistar Fusión) where
the claimant appears as the owner, they refer to the numbers ***TELÉFONO.3 as
first line and ***PHONE.1 as the second line. Not stating the type of contract or
place of contracting of the line ***TELEPHONE.2.

That the mobile telephone lines were contracted in the physical store of
Movistar of ***LOCALIDAD.2 located in the street ***ADDRESS.2. These hirings
correspond to the lines ***TELEPHONE.1 and ***TELEPHONE.3, not to the line
***TELEPHONE.2 indicated by the claimant.

The respondent states that the invoices were sent to the address of the
claimant that appears in their systems in the town of Lugo, while it has been
been able to verify that the address that appears in the contracts, and in the impressions
screen of their systems, is the one indicated by the claimant at the time of
present the claim in this Agency, in the town of *** LOCATION.1.

On line debt write-off screen printout
***PHONE.2, it is verified that it has a different NIF identifier from that of the
claimant.

It is noteworthy that the respondent acknowledges said error and states that
it is a transcription error and that it has not been able to locate the contract of the line
***PHONE.2.

The personal data of the claimant were recorded in the files of the
claimed and were treated for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the
claimed person. Consequently, it has processed the data
without having accredited that you have the legal authorization to do so.

However, and this is essential, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy to

the processing of the claimant's data.

In short, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
one that shows that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one who
claimed to hold

Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of the fundamental right
of protection of personal data requires that it be accredited that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. Failure to act in this way -and this Agency, who is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.
