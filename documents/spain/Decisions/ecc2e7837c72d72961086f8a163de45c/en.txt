<<

Procedure No.: PS/00411/2018

AGREEMENT TO START A SANCTION PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Agency for the Protection of

FACTS

FIRST: Dated 04/23/2018 has entry in the Spanish Protection Agency

states that he has been continuously receiving SMS messages on his mobile phone
 VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U., NIF

          Also attached is the letter you received from VODAFONE, dated 07/17/2018. In
She, in addition to explaining that the AEPD had notified her of her claim,
processed within the framework of file E/03011/2018, informs you that after
 has been
perform searches on their systems have verified that your mobile number “
used for testing the sending of messages, as well as for
different quality control processes of the Vodafone online store,
probably because of the characteristics of that number.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)
The operator adds that “This practice is contrary to our processes, which
prohibit the use of actual data for testing. That is why it has
sent a reminder to all those responsible for these processes to prevent
This situation will happen again."

 

SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant, the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out preliminary investigative actions to clarify the facts,
in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation
General Data Protection, hereinafter RGPD).

               Thus, in the framework of file E/03011/2018, information is requested from the
claimed, VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U., having knowledge of these extremes:

- The complainant was a VODAFONE client in the past. The defendant has
explained that, having carried out the pertinent inquiries, it has been verified that
your personal data is blocked in their systems by virtue of the request
of cancellation made by the complainant in May 2015.

- VODAFONE states that "we must rule out that the reason why Mr.
A.A.A. would have received the SMS messages had it been because their data
were visible in our systems or there had been some kind of error
of my client when managing the cancellation”. (The underlining is from
the AEPD)

- He affirms that he has been able to find out that the mobile number of which the complainant
is the owner "appears (...) in different files of different clients as one of the
contact telephone numbers that can be associated with each client”. Also, what has
verified that "within the processes of registering services from the Store
Online this number has been included for carrying out tests of different
nature (both to verify the quality of the process and its correct
operation) given the characteristics of said telephone number, such as
its simplicity and little probability that it belongs to someone…,Finally,
this number has also been used erroneously in the testing process
to send certain communications to customers in order to
verify that they are correct. (The underlining is from the AEPD)
The defendant says that she has adopted the following measures: (i) She has sent
“reminders to all your agents to remember that it is not possible
include information that is not true, invented or that
not owned by the customer
 
 ”. (ii) “Likewise, the elimination of
said telephone number in the files of the clients in which they appear
as contact data” .(iii) “..the pertinent guidelines to the
technical staff (internal and external) who carry out tests in the online store and

level of sending communications to clients to stop these practices, to
all lights, incorrect and that in no case are a consequence of the guideline
some given by Vodafone”. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

- He explains that his processes in the Online Store "always involve using some
specific and already defined test users, not being able to use other data
other than these”. Add as an example that "from Online Store and to
test purposes, the process indicates that a series of NIF of
tests already defined (***NIF.1/***NIF.2) which are automatically canceled
instantly by the system itself, thus preventing any
Communication with the customer. The facts expressed in this request
imply that the process is not being carried out in accordance with the
guidelines implemented by Vodafone”.
The defendant has sent the following documents to the AEPD:
 Screenshots of their systems with the -negative- result of the
data search carried out on the complainant by the criterion of his number
of NIF.

-

 Copy of the letter that, dated 07/17/2018, sent to the claimant
informing him that the AEPD had notified him of his complaint and
measures taken to put an end to the situation caused.

 Copy of two internal emails that VODAFONE sent among its
departments on 07/16/2018 at 6:36 p.m. and 6:41 p.m. in relation
with the number ***PHONE.1. In them remind all users,
“especially the external ones that depend on each one”, who must “launch
the tests in NTOL including yours as a contact mobile number
own, not using other numbers that could cause harm to its owner.

THIRD:
 The facts object of the claim are subject to the
provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council,
of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the
Treatment of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data, which entered into
effective 05/25/2018.
         The claimant filed a complaint with the AEPD on 04/23/2018 -before
therefore after Regulation (EU) 2016/679 entered into force and when it was still
Organic Law 15/1999 on the Protection of Personal Data, LOPD-
in which he recounted the reception of SMS sent by VODAFONE to his mobile line.
However, this behavior was maintained over time at least until 09/24/2018,
as evidenced by the copy of the SMS messages that the complainant sent to
this Agency on 09/25/2018, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 already in force.
                     The infringement for which VODAFONE is held responsible participates in the
nature of the so-called permanent infractions, in which the
consummation is projected in time beyond the initial fact and extends during
the entire period of time in which the data is processed in violation of the
personal data protection regulations. In the present case, despite the fact that
time the infringing conduct began, the applicable norm was the LOPD, the
that is applicable is the one in force when the infraction is consummated,
because it is at that moment when it is understood committed.

               The Supreme Court has ruled on the applicable rule when the
offenses are prolonged over time and there has been a regulatory change while
committed the offence. The STS of 04/17/2002 (Rec. 466/2000) applied a rule that does not
was in force at the initial moment of commission of the infraction, but it was in the
subsequent years in which the offending conduct continued. The Judgment examined a
course that dealt with the sanction imposed on a Judge for breach of
their duty to abstain in preliminary proceedings. The sanctioned alleged the
validity of article 417.8 of the LOPJ when the events occurred. the STS
considered that the offense had been committed since the date of initiation
of the Preliminary Proceedings until the moment in which the Judge was suspended in the
exercise of their functions, so that rule was indeed applicable.
          The SAN of 09/16/2008 (Rec.488/2006) pronounces in the same sense

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of
Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and the Free
Circulation of these Data (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) recognizes each Control Authority and, as established in articles
47, 64.2 and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
this procedure.

II

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "Accuracy". The
precept provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
(…)
d) “accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable to eliminate or rectify without delay the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (<<accuracy>>)”

Article 4 of the RGPD, “Definitions”, offers a legal concept of <<data
personal>> and considers as such “all information about a natural person,
identified or identifiable (<<the interested party>>);
 will be considered a natural person
identifiable person any person whose identity can be determined, directly or
indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a name,
an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or
various elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychic,
economic, cultural or social of that person. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Article 83 of the RGPD, under the heading “General conditions for the

imposition of administrative fines” establishes:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a)

Basic principles for treatment, including
conditions for consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.” (The
underlined is from the AEPD)

III

The documentation in the file shows that VODAFONE
violated the principle of data accuracy since it acknowledges having processed
the claimant's telephone number (***TELEFONO.1) associated with different clients
as well as to carry out quality tests related to the online store and shipments of
communications to customers.

In particular, the defendant has indicated as one of the causes that motivated
the sending of SMS to the claimant "that the number appears in different records of different
clients as one of the contact telephone numbers that can be associated with each client”

 In accordance with the evidence available at the current stage of the
procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the investigation, it is considered that the
behavior described, attributable to VODAFONE, could violate article 5.1.d) of the
RGPD and be constitutive of the infringement typified in article 83. 5.a) of the aforementioned
rule.

At the same time, Organic Law 3/2018 on Data Protection and Guarantees of
Digital Rights (LOPGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”

IV

         The determination of the sanction to be imposed in this case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:

6/12

                 “Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative actions under this article for violations of this
Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

          “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:
a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
applied under articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
treatment;
  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
or indirectly, through infringement.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In order to specify the amount of the sanction to be imposed on the one claimed by
violation of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is essential to examine and assess whether
the circumstances described in article 83.2 of the RGPD concur and if they intervene
mitigating or aggravating the responsibility of the responsible entity.

                    The documentation in the file allows us to conclude that they are
present mitigating the responsibility required of VODAFONE, as they reflect
a minor culpability or unlawfulness of their conduct, the following circumstances:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

7/12

- Section a): “the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into
account the nature, scope or purpose of the data processing operation
concerned as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of
damages they have suffered”.
It is estimated that it operates as a highly qualified mitigating or especially
significant. It is taken into consideration for this that the data processed has been,
exclusively, the telephone number of the affected party; that the operation of
treatment has had no more scope than sending the complainant messages
of SMS text to your line ***TELEFONO.1 and that, regarding the effects of the
treatment, although they have been a serious inconvenience for those affected by the
high number of messages received, have not resulted in damage or
serious damage.

- Section b): “intentionality or negligence in the infringement”.

-

In the conduct of the defendant - which is contrary to the principle of accuracy in the
data processing of the claimant's mobile number - there has been no intent or
intentionality of VODAFONE but exclusively lack of diligence.

d): “the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied in
under articles 25 and 32”.
Although it is obvious and evident that the measures that VODAFONE had
implemented to avoid the violation of the right to data protection
of the claimant were insufficient, it cannot be ignored, in order to assess the
degree of responsibility of the claimant, which, as regards the
evidence of the online store the claimed had planned the use of
specific users and that if company employees had followed
its guidelines, at least as far as the online store is concerned, could have been
infringement of the principle of data quality has been avoided. In this matter in
In particular, the defendant's lack of diligence is specified in the omission of the
necessary controls over its employees to guarantee respect for their
action protocol.
Let us remember that VODAFONE has explained that its processes in the Online Store
“always involve using specific and already defined test users, not
being able to use other data different from these”. Add as an example that
“From the Online Store and for testing purposes, the process indicates that they must
use a series of test NIFs already defined (***NIF.1/***NIF.2) which
they are self-canceled instantly by the system itself,
thus preventing any communication with the client. The facts
expressed in this requirement imply that the process is not being
complying with the guidelines implemented by Vodafone”.

- Section f): “the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to
to remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the
infringement".

In this regard, we must indicate that on 06/06/2018 the Inspection of
Data required VODAFONE to report within a month on
the sending of SMS messages to the claimant and on the measures adopted to
put an end to that situation. VODAFONE responded on 07/23/2018 and
stated that it had taken the following measures:

(i) It has sent “reminders to all its agents so that they remember not to
it is possible to include non-true information in the files of our clients,
invented or not owned by the customer
 
 ”. (ii) “Likewise, it has been requested the
elimination of said telephone number in the files of the clients in the
that appear as contact data” .(iii) “..the guidelines have been remembered
relevant to the technical personnel (internal and external) who carry out tests in the
online store and at the level of sending communications to customers to stop
these practices, clearly, incorrect and that in no case are
consequence of any directive given by Vodafone”. (The underlined
is from the AEPD)

It is also estimated that the following factors, described in the

article 83.2 of the RGPD, which operate aggravating the responsibility of the claimed party:

- Section e) –“any prior infraction”-.

Provision that must be connected to article 29.3.d) of Law 40/2015 of
Legal Regime of the Public Sector. The Law, article 29, mentions among the
principles that must govern the imposition of sanctions
proportionality, which is defined as “due suitability and necessity of the
sanction to be imposed and its adequacy to the seriousness of the act constituting the
infraction", and to make it effective it attends, among other variables, to "The
recidivism, by commission within a year of more than one infraction of
the same nature when it has been so declared by firm resolution in
administrative channel” (section 3.d) (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In this sense, it is worth mentioning some sanctioning Resolutions issued by the
AEPD in the year immediately prior to the claim that have become
firm in administrative proceedings and in which VODAFONE was sanctioned by
infractions of an identical nature to the one examined here: PS/521/2017,
signed on 01/15/2018; PS/194/2018, signed on 06/14/2018, among others.

However, it is important to note that, as well as the behavior that
constitutes the factual budget for the opening of this file
sanctioning party, the offending conduct for which VODAFONE was
sanctioned by the AEPD in the aforementioned procedures do not have a great
relevance, hence, in the present case, it is not appropriate to attribute to the
aggravating circumstance of section e) of article 83.2 of the RGPD a
special significance.

- Section k), in relation to article 76.2 of Organic Law 3/2018, in
which is framed as an aggravating circumstance the continued nature of the offense
attributed to VODAFONE.
