BACKGROUND

 A.A.A.,

filed on 06/07/2018
claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) against the
Town Hall of Casarrubios del Monte, with NIF P4504100A (hereinafter, the

 (hereinafter, the claimant)

The reasons on which the claim is based are that the City Council claimed
has happened to the collection in your bank account, without your authorization -every time you do not
had domiciled the payment of these taxes-, both the IBI 2017 invoice and the rate
of the sewage system 2017. He also invokes as grounds for his claim a
intended transfer of your personal data by the claimed to the Provincial Council
of *** LOCALITY.1 because "the O.A.P Tax Management issues all the rates of the
City Council to the taxpayers' banks whether or not they are authorized to do so”.

Provide the following documents:

- Copy of ID
- Receipt of the IBI 2016 with the mechanical impression accrediting the payment made
through a bank window. The document bears a stamp with the
date 06/29/2019 and the indication “BANKIA” “Charged into account”. In the part
upper left appears a shield and the legend “Organismo Autónomo

It is reported that the voluntary payment period is from 05/01/2016 to

collect the personal data of the claimant (name, surnames, NIF and address
postal) who "requests", by marking the corresponding box with a cross, a
“Change of owner” “of the following Municipal Fees”.

 Only two options appear in the document: the "Garbage" rate and the
"Passage of carriages". Both options are checked. Next is the
tax domicile; the details of the bank account in which the payment is domiciled
of the receipts; the name of the previous holder and the name of the new and current holder
claimant. The document is signed on 09/30/2015.

 
SECOND: In view of the facts exposed, the AEPD, in the scope of the file
number E/4147/2018, by means of a document signed on 07/20/2018, transferred the
claim to the Claimed City Council and requested an explanation about its

performance. This writing was notified electronically through the application
notified. The date of availability was 07/20/2018 and the date of acceptance
of the notification on 07/29/2018.

After the period granted -one month- without receiving a response from the respondent,
reiterates the request for information on two more occasions: The first, through a
written of 11/21/2018, notified electronically and made available in the
notified application on that date. The notice is rejected by the respondent on
02/12/2018. The second, by means of a document signed on 12/10/2018 and notified through
of the Post Office. The delivery certificate issued by S.E. post office and
Telégrafos, S.A., accredits the delivery to the claimed party on 12/18/2018.

The respondent did not respond to any of the information requests that were

they did to him

This Agency addresses the claimant in writing signed on 07/20/2018 in which
acknowledges receipt of your claim and informs you that the person in charge has been requested
notify you of the result of the measures taken.

In accordance with the provisions of article 65.2 of Organic Law 3/2018,
Protection of Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), on the date
01/25/2019 the agreement for admission to processing of this claim is signed.

B. Subsequently, in accordance with article 67 of the LOPDGDD, the Inspection
of Data of the AEPD carries out preliminary investigation actions with the number of
reference E/862/2019.

The Data Inspection made an information request to the claimant who
responded in writing with the date of entry in this Agency on 05/28/2019 in which
makes the declarations and provides the documents that are detailed:

- That he has paid the Town Council of Casarrubios del Monte, "within the
voluntary period” and “in the same receipt for the year 2017” the amounts of
the following taxes: IBI, sewage, passage of carriages and collection of
rubbish.
However, with respect to the 2017 financial year, it has only provided one
document dated 11/10/2017 referring to payment through an office of
BANKIA of 104.79 euros without stating in the document which is the
concept for which he makes the payment. The said document bears the impression
mechanical proof of payment together with a BANKIA seal. In the
heading the legend "Collection Procedure Code:***CODE.1"
(The underlining is from the AEPD)

- Regarding the IBI 2018, it states that the claimed City Council has reused
the direct debit mandate. However, the claimant
substantiate these claims. The only document that provides on the IBI
2018 is not a direct debit receipt but another that justifies having
made the payment at the bank office. The document bears the impression
mechanical that justifies the payment by window with a charge to your account
on 06/28/2018; therefore, within the voluntary payment period according to
the information contained in the document itself.

- States that regarding the "Sewerage, passage of carriages and collection of
garbage (in the same receipt) for the 2018 financial year, the City Council has once again
use the direct debit mandate”, being the Direct Debit Reference

***REFERENCE.1. In addition, he adds, these taxes were paid by the
claimant in the Bank on 10/25/2018.

The claimant provides in relation to these statements the documents
following for the 2018 financial year:
 
a. The document called “Property Tax Receipt
real estate” Town Hall of Casarrubios del Monte. in your corner
top left contains "Provincial autonomous body for management
tax of ***LOCATION.1”. As "period" appears "2018-annual".
Informs that the voluntary payment period is between 09/01/2018 and
10/31/2018.
The subconcepts on which the receipt deals are the rates of
“sewerage”, “carriage passage, ground level entrance Municipality of
Casarrubios”; “garbage collection; living place". The amount of the debt
tax is 70.50 euros. The document incorporates the data
mechanized that accredit the payment in the presentation of the
document in the credit institution and bears a BANKIA stamp with the
billed legend and date 10/25/2018.

a. BANKIA document of "Direct Debit", issued on
11/26/2018, in which the personal data of the claimant appears in his
Right upper corner. The creditor/issuer of the receipt is the
Autonomous Organism of PGT ***LOCATION.1.

C. Examination of the documents attached to the claim and those provided to the
inspection of data -documents the latter that do not coincide with those that were
required to the claimant- it is concluded:

1.The documentation does not offer a proof principle that, as invoked
the claimant, the claimed party would have paid into his account the collection of the receipt of the
IBI for the year 2017.

The claimant has not provided this Agency with his claim any
document that proves it. The one he sent was from the IBI 2016 and what it reflects is the payment
at the Bank over the counter by debiting the account, it bears the stamp of the
credit and the mechanical printing of the payment. Neither with his answer to the
requirement made in previous investigation actions has provided a document
one that shows that, as stated, the defendant had domiciled in
the IBI 2017 receipt counts.

The only documents in the possession of this Agency relating to the payment
of the IBI are from the 2016 and 2018 financial years. Neither responds to a payment
by direct debit into account by the claimed party. On the contrary, both
documents have the mechanical impression that accredits the payment through your
presentation at the credit institution and a BANKIA stamp with the date and legend
charged to account.

2. There are documents showing that the claimant had communicated to the
City Council claimed that the payment of the fees was domiciled in its bank account
of “garbage” and of “passage of carriages”. We refer to the claim form,
“Registration/change of owner -Municipal fees”, signed by the claimant in September
2015, which he attached to his claim brief.

3. The City Council claimed domicile in the claimant's bank account, in

date 10/31/2018, the 2018 sewer rate. On that date the sewer rate
2018 was already satisfied. In the file, on the one hand, is the document that
makes proof of the payment through a window and charges the rate of
sewer 2018 as of 10/25/2018. On the other hand, the document that proves that the
Claimed City Council direct debited payment of the fee to the claimant's account on
10/31/2018.

THIRD: On 06/24/2019, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimant, for the
alleged infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the
GDPR.

FOURTH: The respondent made objections to the initiation agreement in writing
sent by administrative mail on 07/23/2019 that had an entry in the registry of this
Agency on 07/29/2019.

The defendant requests the AEPD to file the file
sanctioning To this end, it alleges that the facts are the result of "an error and in no case
intentional action."

He explains that he has signed a Framework Agreement with the Autonomous Organization
Provincial Department of Tax Management of ***LOCALIDAD.1 (OAPGT) for the management of
municipal taxes.

It acknowledges that “by transferring the data and information of the taxpayer Mr.
[the claimant] mistakenly authorized the OAPGT to direct debit the fees for
rubbish, carriage passage and sewage system” (emphasis is from the AEPD)

It adds that the OAPGT has been informed not to proceed to domicile in the

claimant's bank account sewer fee.

The respondent provides a copy of these documents:

1.Copy of the Provincial Bulletin of ***LOCALITY.1 number ***NUMBER.1 of
03/11/2015, in which the Announcement of the approval of the new
Regulatory Agreement of the delegations agreed by the City Councils of the
Province in the Provincial Corporation regarding the powers, functions and
administrative activities corresponding to the application of certain taxes
premises, as well as the text of the Regulatory Agreement.

2. Document signed electronically on 07/09/2019 by the Mayor of the City Council
claimed whose recipient is the OAPGT and that bears the exit stamp of that
Local Administration dated 07/09/2019.

In this document, the respondent requests the OAPGT of ***LOCALIDAD.1 to
proceed to annul the direct debit order for the sewerage rate as it is not stated in
the City Council any document in which the interested party authorizes it.

It states that the claimant had authorized the City Council in September
2015 to domicile in your bank account the payment of garbage fees and passing of
carriages, but not the sewer; that in accordance with article 38 of the
General Collection Regulations, to proceed with the direct debit is
The consent of the interested party is necessary, consent that regarding the rate of
sewer system is not known to the City Council and that by mistake, that City Council authorized

to the OAPGT of ***LOCALIDAD.1 to pay into the claimant's account also the
sewer fee.

FIFTH: The initiation agreement of PS/222/2019, in point 3 of its operative part
agreed, for purposes of evidence, to include in the sanctioning file the claim
filed by the claimant and its attached documentation, as well as the documents
obtained and generated by the Data Inspection Subdirectorate during the phases
admission to processing and preliminary investigation.

SIXTH: On 02/25/2020, a resolution proposal was formulated in the following
terms:

<<That by the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
sanction the CITY COUNCIL OF CASARRUBIOS DEL MONTE, with NIF P4504100A,
for an infringement of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5.a) of the
RGPD, with WARNING, provided for in article 58.2.b) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679.>>

The proposal was notified electronically to the respondent, being the date of
made available in the electronic office on 02/26/2020 and the date of acceptance of
the notification on 03/03/2020, as evidenced by the FNMT certificate that works
on the record. Consequently, the period of ten working days granted to the
claimed to present arguments to the proposal had to end on 03/17/2020.

Royal Decree 463/2020, "declaring the state of alarm for the
management of the health crisis caused by Covid 19”, published in the BOE on
03/14/2020, in its Third Additional Provision, “Suspension of deadlines
administrative", ordered:

"1. Terms are suspended and the deadlines for the processing of the
procedures of public sector entities. The calculation of the deadlines
will resume at the moment in which this Royal Decree loses its validity or, in its
case, the extensions thereof.

2. The suspension of terms and the interruption of terms will apply to the entire
public sector defined in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure
Common Administrative of Public Administrations.”

This suspension was lifted on 06/01/2020. Royal Decree 537/2020,

published in the BOE on 05/23/2020, establishes in article 9:

“Administrative deadlines suspended by virtue of Royal Decree 463/2020, of 14
of March". “With effect from June 1, 2020, the computation of the deadlines
Administrative procedures that had been suspended will be resumed, or restarted, if so
would have foreseen in a norm with the force of law approved during the validity of the
state of alarm and its extensions” (Underlining is from the AEPD)

When the suspension of deadlines occurred by virtue of Royal Decree 463/2020,
There were two business days left before the expiration of the ten-business-day period granted to the
claimed by the LPACAP to make allegations to the proposed resolution, therefore
that the aforementioned period ended at 24 hours on 06/02/2020.

As of 06/06/2020 there is no news in this Agency of the entry of the
arguments to the resolution proposal, for which, having fulfilled the term amply
granted for the referred procedure, the procedure continues the course foreseen by the
LPACAP.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to
resolve this procedure.

II

Article 58 of the RGPD, “Powers of Attorney”, says:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
this Regulation;

 (…)”

Article 83.7 of the RGPD indicates that "Without prejudice to the corrective powers
of the supervisory authorities within the meaning of Article 58(2), each Member State
may establish rules on whether and to what extent fines can be imposed
administrative authorities and public bodies established in that State
member".

Under the authorization that the RGPD (article 83.7) grants to the States
members, our LOPDGDD, in article 77, under the heading "Regime applicable to
certain categories of data controllers or processors” provides:

  "1. The regime established in this article will be applicable to

treatments for which they are responsible or in charge:

(…)
c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the

autonomous communities and the entities that make up the Local Administration.

(…)
2. When the managers or managers listed in section 1
committed any of the offenses referred to in articles 72 to 74 of
this organic law, the data protection authority that is competent will dictate
resolution sanctioning them with a warning. The resolution will establish
also the measures that should be adopted to stop the behavior or correct it.
the effects of the infraction that had been committed.

The resolution will be notified to the person in charge or in charge of the treatment, to the
on which it reports hierarchically, where appropriate, and to those affected who have the
condition of interested parties, if any”. (The underlining is from the AEPD)

Therefore, our legal system (see article 77 LOPDGDD) provides that
when the person responsible for data processing typified in articles 72 to 74 of
the LOPDGDD -which deal with very serious, serious and minor infractions- is a
local entity -as it happens here- the sanction to be imposed will be a warning
provided for in article 58.2.b, of the RGPD, and may also adopt measures to
put an end or correct the effects of the infractions in which it had incurred.

III

Article 5 of the RGPD, “Principles related to treatment”, refers in the
Section 1.a) of “lawfulness”: “Personal data will be: a) processed lawfully,
loyal and transparent in relation to the interested party (<<legality, loyalty and transparency>>)

Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", specifies in section 1

When is the treatment of data of natural persons considered lawful:

“The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the

interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;

c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
applicable to the data controller;

d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or of
another natural person.

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the controller
of the treatment;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
over said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
in particular when the interested party is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to

treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

The infraction for which the defendant is held responsible is provided for in article

83.5 of the RGPD that establishes:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

At the same time, it should be noted that, for prescription purposes, the LOPDGDD typifies
in article 72.1.b) as a very serious infraction “The processing of data
without any of the conditions of legality of the treatment
established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

IV

The claimed City Council is charged with an infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD,
precept that relates the different legal bases on which the
treatment of personal data being the concurrence of any of them condition
necessary to respect the principle of legality provided for in article 5.1.a of the RGPD.

The treatment that the claimed City Council made of the data of the account
claimant's bank account in order to domicile in it the payment of the
sewage system cannot rely on any of the legitimating principles provided for
in article 6.1. of the GDPR.

Recital 40 of the RGPD says: "For the treatment to be lawful, the data
personal information must be treated with the consent of the interested party or on any
other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation
or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States referred to in the
this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the

responsible for the treatment or the need to execute a contract in which it is a party
the interested party or in order to take measures at the request of the interested party with
prior to the conclusion of a contract.
           
           The bank account number of a natural person is a character data
personnel being able to cite for this purpose the doctrine of the National High Court reflected, among
others, in the SSAN of 01/30/2014, Rec. 554/2012, and of 11/3/2015, Rec. 333/2014. The
account number has in this case allowed the Bank to identify the claimant as
holder and make in it the charge ordered by the claimed party as payment of the
sewer fee.

         The legal basis that legitimizes the processing of personal data of the
tax obligations that the City Council needs to carry out for the management of the
own taxes is part of article 6.1.c) of the RGPD: "the treatment is
necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the person in charge of the
treatment".
 

Article 6.3. of the RGPD specifies that the basis of the treatment indicated in the
paragraph 1, letters c) and e) must be established by Union Law or the
Law of the Member States that applies to the data controller. By
As far as Spanish law is concerned, such an obligation must be established in a standard
with the formal status of law. Article 53.1 of the Spanish Constitution requires that the
regulation of the exercise of the rights recognized in the second chapter of the Title
I, including article 18.4, which includes the right to protection
of personal data, is made by a rule with the force of law.

         Both the provision of article 6.3 RGPD and the requirement that in the Law
Spanish the obligation referred to in letter c) of article 6.1. GDPR is established in
a norm with the rank of law have been transferred to the LOPDGDD whose article 8 says:

 "1. The processing of personal data can only be considered based on the
compliance with a legal obligation required of the person in charge, in the terms provided
in article 6.1.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, when so provided by a standard
of European Union Law or a rule with the force of law, which may determine
the general conditions of the treatment and the types of data object of the same as well
as well as the transfers that proceed as a result of compliance with the
legal obligation.(...)".

The local estates are nourished by various resources, among others from the "tributes
own" of which the fees are part (article 2.1 of the Royal Legislative Decree
2/2004, which approves the Consolidated Text of the Law Regulating the
Local Treasury) The local entities have attributed by law, in addition to the
regulatory power to create taxes, the competence for management,
collection and inspection of their own taxes, without prejudice to the delegations that
may grant in favor of local entities of superior scope or of the
respective Autonomous Communities and the forms of collaboration with other entities
local authorities (see article 106 of Law 7/1985, Regulating the Bases of the Regime
Local)

Article 12 of Royal Legislative Decree 2/2004, which approves the
T.R.L.R.H.L., establishes that the management of local taxes must adjust to the
provisions of the General Tax Law and the other regulatory laws of the State
of the matter, as well as the provisions dictated in its development. Therefore, between
the rules to which the management of local taxes must submit is the
Royal Decree 939/2005, of July 29, approving the General Regulation

Collection (RGR), issued in development of Law 58/2003, General Tax.

         Article 34.1 of the RGR provides that the payment of tax debts may be
do, always, through the means detailed therein, among those mentioned,
section d) “bank direct debit”.

Article 38 of the RGR regulates the "Payment by direct debit" in the

following terms:

 
"1. The direct debit must meet the following requirements:

a) That the party obligated to pay is the holder of the account in which the payment is made by direct debit and that

said account is open in a credit institution.

In the terms and conditions in which each Administration establishes it, the payment
may be domiciled in an account that is not owned by the obligor, provided that
the holder of said account authorizes the direct debit.

b) That the person obliged to pay communicates his direct debit order to the

of the Administration according to the procedures established in each case.

2. Payments shall be understood to have been made on the date of charge to the account of said
direct debits, considering proof of income the one issued for this purpose by the
credit institution where the payment is domiciled, which will incorporate as
minimum the data established in the corresponding ministerial order.

3. (...)” (The underlining is from the AEPD)

In accordance with the transcribed precept, the treatment by a local entity
of the bank account of the taxpayer in order to domicile in it the
payment of a tax is subject to certain requirements, among them that the person obliged to
payment “communicate” your direct debit order to the local Administration bodies
according to the procedures established in each case.

An example of this communication can be found in the form that the
claimant completed in 2015 (described in Proven Fact 2), in which
The header contained the name of the City Council and the legend “Registro General
Registration/Change of Holder-Municipal Fees”. Form that only dealt with
garbage and carriage fees. Through this form the claimant
opted for the direct debit of the only two rates contemplated in the
document -rubbish and carriage passage- and included the details of the bank account in
which the charges should be made.

The claimed City Council did not receive any communication from the claimant
ordering direct debit payment of the sewerage fee. communication that is
a requirement demanded by article 38.1.b) of the RGR. Despite this, the City Council
claimed paid into the claimant's account the sewerage rate.

  In its allegations to the initial agreement, the claimed City Council has
recognized that the claimant did not notify the direct debit order
regarding the 2018 sewage rate and has provided documentation that proves the
adoption of measures to put an end to the illicit treatment carried out. has been contributed
copy of the document signed electronically on 07/09/2019 by the Mayor of
Casarrubios del Monte, whose addressee is the OAPGT, which bears the stamp of
departure from that Local Administration on 07/09/2019, through which the
Claimed City Council requests the OAPGT of ***LOCALIDAD.1 to proceed to annul

the direct debit order for the sewerage rate, as it is not recorded in the Town Hall
no document in which the interested party communicates such address (Proven fact
5.ii).

        The treatment that the claimed City Council made of the personal data of the account
claimant's bank account in order to charge it the amount of the
sewage system for the year 2018 did not meet the requirements of the RGR, standard
regulation referred to in article 12 of Royal Legislative Decree 2/2004, which
approves the T.R.L.R.H.L., which requires that the management of own taxes conform to
the provisions of the General Tax Law and its regulations on
developing.
          The authorization to process the personal data of the taxpayer who, in
principle, grants the letter c) of article 6.1. GDPR presupposes that the City Council
responsible for data processing necessary for the management and collection of
their taxes act in compliance with the rules imposed, directly or by referral to
other development regulations, by the regulation with the rank of law from which the base derives
law that protects the processing of personal data of taxpayers.

Thus, being accredited in the file that the City Council claimed
processed the bank details of the claimant for the collection of the sewage rate of the
fiscal year 2018 without meeting the requirements that article 38 of the RGR requires for the
direct debit of the payment, cannot operate as a legitimizing basis of the treatment the
compliance with a legal obligation (letter c, of article 6.1 of the RGPD)

 
It is concluded from the foregoing that the processing of personal data of the
claimant who is the object of assessment in this sanctioning file is not
covered by none of the legal bases of article 6.1. GDPR. Violation of
article 6.1 of the RGPD that is subsumable in the sanctioning type of article 83.5.b) of the
GDPR.

v

The claim that gave rise to the opening of this sanctioning file
also raised another issue: the alleged infringement of the protection regulations
of data derived from the fact that the claimed City Council had communicated
the personal data of the claimant without their consent -including bank data-
to the provincial autonomous body of Tax Management, dependent on the Diputación
Province of ***LOCALIDAD.1, through which the City Council had been collecting the
taxes to taxpayers.

However, there is no infringement of data protection regulations in the
described behavior: the communication of the personal data of the affected by the
City Council to the Provincial Council in order to manage, through the aforementioned
autonomous body, the collection of taxes without the consent of the
tax debtor.

In accordance with article 6.1 of the RGPD, the legality of the treatment can be based
in the condition described in section e): “the treatment is necessary for the
fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of powers
data conferred on the data controller”.

Article 7 of the Law Regulating Local Treasury, Consolidated Text
approved by Royal Legislative Decree 2/2004, indicates that in accordance with article 106.3
of Law 7/1985, regulating the Local Regime Bases, local entities
may delegate to other local entities in whose territory they are integrated, the
faculties of management, liquidation, inspection and tax collection that this law
grants. Indicates that this agreement must be adopted by the plenary session of the local corporation

establishing the scope and content of the delegation and must be published in the Official Gazette
from the province.

Work in the file provided by the City Council claimed a copy of the B.O.P.
of ***LOCALIDAD.1 number ***NUMBER.1, of 02/11/2015 in which the
Announcement of approval of the new "Regulatory Convention of the delegations
agreed upon by the Provincial Councils in the Provincial Corporation regarding
to the faculties, functions and administrative activities corresponding to the
application of certain local taxes” and the text of the Regulatory Agreement.

Law of Local Entities and the General Collection Regulations, creates the
autonomous provincial tax management body (OAPGT) that has
entrusted among its functions the exercise of its own powers and functions
that the Provincial Council of ***LOCALIDAD.1 entrusts to it and those that the entities
premises within the territorial scope of that Provincial Council delegate to the aforementioned
Diputación among others, in the following matters: management and inspection and collection
