following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

IV

a company to take charge of its website and states that it gave them instructions
precise that they should anonymize the sentences before uploading them to the web but

processing of personal data, a violation of the principle of confidentiality.

Web.

classified as a very serious infringement for prescription purposes in article 72.1.a)
of the LOPDGDD.

the violation by the respondent of the principle of confidentiality could be
sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with article 58.2.b) of the RGPD, by not
be linked the main activity of the claimed with the treatment of data of
personal character and consider that the administrative fine that could fall with
in accordance with the provisions of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD would constitute a burden
disproportionate for the defendant, who is not aware of the commission of any
previous breach of data protection.

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE D. B.B.B., with NIF ***NIF.1, for a violation of Article
