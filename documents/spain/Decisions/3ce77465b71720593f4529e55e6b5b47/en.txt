acknowledgment of receipt that works in the file.

On 12/02/2021, this Agency received a written response from FAC-USO
indicating that the complaining party had already claimed its right of suppression to the
Trade Union Section in 2018. You are aware that you cannot send communications to the
claimant.

(...) sends through an internal mail, similar to an intranet, to all the groups
trade unions, federations and provincial directorates, lists of all users who
there, updated. Received this list, the Trade Union Section remakes the entire list, it is
that is, it copies all the data, of the entire generic list, independently, in
another place, to be able to separate the contacts by lists
individualized and to be able to do manual searches of the contacts that have
requested that informative communications not be sent to them. It is a very
laborious, costly and excessive, which the Trade Union Section carries out in order to comply with
the rights of suppression of the interested party, but that escapes on many occasions to the
control of the USO Trade Union Section itself.

USO shows its willingness to review the protocols and assess alternative channels
for sending informative communications electronically.

THIRD: On January 5, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the
LOPDGDD, the claim filed by the claimant was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: On 05/05/2022, the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of Data agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the USO entity, in accordance with the
provided in articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP, for the alleged violation of article
6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, in
hereinafter RGPD), typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation; and qualified
as very serious for prescription purposes in article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD.

In the opening agreement it was determined that the sanction that could correspond,
attended the existing evidence at the time of opening and without prejudice to what
resulting from the instruction, would amount to a total of 3,000 euros.

Likewise, it was warned that the imputed infractions, if confirmed, may
entail the imposition of measures, according to the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD.

FIFTH: Having been notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the entity claimed submitted a written
dated 05/20/2022, in which it states that the entity FAC-USO acts in a
independent on the facts giving rise to the claim. On this basis, it requests that
the USO entity is exonerated from responsibility and the claim is transferred to
the responsible entity FAC-USO. He bases his request on the following considerations:

. The claim is produced by the sending of informative emails to the
claimant, (...), by FAC-USO, which is a trade union federation
independent with its own CIF, which manages, works, collects and treats data of
independently of USO.

. The claimant formally requested the deletion of his personal data and

I file a claim for lack of attention to this right, which gave rise to the file
TD/02466/2017, in which a resolution was issued that was notified to a person in charge of the
wrong data processing, USE.

. The emails that gave rise to the claim were sent from FAC-
USO, by a trade union section that is part of said Federation, to which
It is up to you, as the data controller, to give the necessary arguments
regarding this claim.

This can be seen in the legal notice inserted in one of the emails, which indicates:

“Copyright © 2016 FAC-USE. All rights reserved. Federation Attention to the
Citizenship of the Unión Sindical Obrera… Complying with Spanish legislation on
data protection and our strict privacy policy, your email address is
included in a personal data file owned by the Federation Attention to the
Citizenship of the USO (Unión Sindical Obrera), created for the distribution of information
related to union activity. If you do not want to receive more information, you can unsubscribe
sending an email to: ***EMAIL.1 or in writing at any of our
provincial delegations.

. FAC-USO, collects data with its own responsibility, generates its own databases
data and sends its own communications.

. USO understands that the complaining party directs its claim against USO, understanding
wrongly that this entity encompasses everything that has to do with all
union sections, but each one is responsible for the actions carried out
independently.

. In the emails provided by the complaining party, the general logo of the USO and the
of FAC-USO, a fact that could also have generated the confusion.
 
. The case that occurred could be transferred to similar cases in which companies
holding company or parent companies have as their corporate name, the commercially known names
for the client or associates and their affiliated companies use the name for purposes
promotional, but are legally represented independently.

SIXTH: On 05/25/2022, the instructor of the procedure agreed to open

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD, grants to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection.

processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II

Prior to examining the substantive issue, it is appropriate to analyze the exception
alleged by USO, on the lack of passive standing.

The aforementioned USE understands that the responsibility for the facts denounced must
imputed to the FAC-USO, as it is the entity responsible in its field of
action, in this case, the General Administration of the State, with capacity and
autonomy to organize their activity.

It has been accredited that FAC-USO is a professional federation integrated in the
confederal organization USO, but it takes the legal form of a “union” and, as such,
has its own legal personality and full capacity to act, in accordance with
established in article 4.1 of Organic Law 11/1985, of August 2, on Freedom
Union, according to which:

“The unions established under this Law, to acquire legal personality and
full capacity to act, must deposit, through their promoters or leaders, their
statutes in the public office established for that purpose.

Regarding the "Responsibility of unions", article 5.1 of the aforementioned Law
Organic sets:

“The unions constituted under the protection of this Law shall be liable for the acts or
agreements adopted by their statutory bodies in the sphere of their respective
competencies”.

The USO Confederal Statutes themselves establish that it is made up of
Professional Federations and Territorial Unions, which "will be endowed with Statutes and
Own regulations that must be registered. In accordance with the provisions of the Law
Organic Law 11/1985, of August 2, on Freedom of Association, will have legal personality
own. They will define the corresponding objectives, structure and operation, according to
its characteristics and specificities.

In the same way, the FAC-USO Statutes indicate that with this denomination "the
constitutes a trade union organization that declares itself autonomous within the scope of the
Spanish territory, integrated in the Trade Union Confederation of the Workers Trade Union,
subscribing to its fundamental objectives and assuming the rights and duties
arising from these Statutes”, which “is constituted under the protection of the
current legislation".

On the other hand, FAC-USO is the entity responsible for the personal data collected
and treated in their area of responsibility.

It is the FAC-USO itself, and not the USO trade union confederation, that is responsible for sending
of the emails object of the claim, and FAC-USO is the entity to which
the claimant party expressed its opposition to the receipt of such emails and the cancellation of
your distribution lists.

Thus, the exception alleged by the USO confederal organization regarding the lack of
Passive standing must be estimated.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: DECLARE the file of the actions, in relation to the imputation to
the entity UNION SINDICAL OBRERA, with NIF G28567402, of a possible
violation of the provisions of article 6 of the RGPD.
