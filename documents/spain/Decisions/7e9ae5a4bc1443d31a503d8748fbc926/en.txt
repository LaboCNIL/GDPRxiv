functioning.

I filed a claim with the telecommunications organization in which it comes to
recognize in the resolution that "Mas Móvil" had breached the contract for not giving
voice line by not having activated the fixed voice service in breach of the period of
time of supply referred to in the contract, without anything proving to the contrary "More

provided by the claimant, the General Subdirectorate for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out actions for its clarification, under the powers of
investigation granted to the control authorities in art. 57.1 of the GDPR. So with
Date 01/17/20, information requests are directed to the entity claimed,

SEVENTH: Once the initiation agreement has been notified, the entity claimed, by means of a letter of
dated 04/06/20, made, in summary, the following allegations to the initiation:
“The claimant signed a contract for the provision of telecommunications services
dated May 19, 2017, being discharged since May 24, 2017.
Specifically, it was a convergent contract that included the provision
of landline services, 3 mobile phone lines and Internet access,
circumstance that has been accredited before this Agency by the claimant.
Of the contracted services, the only one that did not work correctly for a
time (until June 2017) was the fixed telephony service, but not the rest of
services, which were provided normally from the beginning.
As has been proven, the interested party complained to the SESIAD, facilitating the
RC reference ***FILE.1. This body resolved, in what refers to the service of
fixed telephony, dated October 4, 2017, as reproduced by this Agency in its
initiation agreement in the following terms: “Estimate the claim,
recognizing the right of the interested party to request cancellation of the contract effectively
immediately as well as not to pay the billing issued by MAS MOVIL TELECOM 3.0
SL corresponding to the fixed telephony service during the period in which the service
contracted is not actually provided”.
We are not aware that there was an incident in the fixed telephony service on the date
after June 2017, in fact, this service was used without incident until
July 2018, as can be verified in the invoices issued by this party, in
which it can be verified that there was traffic of calls in transmission until July
2018, which we provide as documents No. 1 and 2
As the interested party herself has proven, the right to request withdrawal recognized by
the SESIAD was not exercised until July 11, 2018, having used the services
of mobile, fixed and fiber telephony to date, which worked correctly,
as it is accredited in the already referenced documents no. 1 and 2.
However, prior to that date, the mobile lines were ported to other
operators in April 2018 and June 2018, leaving as the only active service the
fiber and fixed telephony in July 2018, billing this service in August 2018
(document #2).
On September 21, 2018, my client proceeded to pay €299.21
in favor of the claimant and proceeded to cancel the services maintained until
time by the claimant, although the fixed telephone service was not deactivated at that time.
moment, presumably due to an error when managing the cancellation of the service
Internet access.
Finally, on January 28, 2019, the claimant received a letter
requesting the payment of 197.01 euros (corresponding to the landline telephone service),
warning that in case of not paying the amounts claimed, it could be included in
ASNEF and BADEXCUG files. This circumstance is reported to me
represented by burofax on January 29, 2019 proceeding to the cancellation
of the debt dated 01/31/19.
As proven by both the claimant and this party, the contract
It included a convergent offer of mobile telephony (3 lines), landline and fiber. This contract
was modified in successive moments: in April the line ***TELÉFONO.3 was ported and

in June the lines ***TELÉFONO.2 and ***TELÉFONO.4. Later, in July,
terminated the Internet access service through burofax of the interested party and
router return.
These successive changes and the continuous separation of services from the contract
convergent presumably motivated the fixed telephony service not to be
successfully deregistered, so it continued to be billed and, upon reaching the limits
contractually foreseen in November, the debt was claimed in
January. Given this claim, the interested party sent us a burofax on January 29,
proceeding at that time my represented, reviewing the case and realizing the
situation, to cancel the debt on January 31.
At no time has the claimant's data been communicated to
Common asset solvency files. The details of the claimant consist of
blocked since January 2019.
This Agency attributes to my client an infringement of article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of April 27, 2016, regarding
to the protection of natural persons with regard to data processing
data and the free movement of these data and by which the Directive is repealed
95/46/CE (General Data Protection Regulation, or RGPD).
As explained in the first allegation and verified by this Agency, the
The claimant had a contract to provide telecommunications services
with my client since May 19, 2017, requesting its resolution in July
2018, when the claimant sent a burofax to my client, and resolving the
telecommunications contract in September 2018, the date on which they were settled
amounts in favor of the claimant.
As we have explained, due to an error when canceling the telephone service
fixed, motivated by the successive modifications in the object of the contract,
continued incorrectly billing this service until November, claiming the
debt in January. At that time, the claimant sent us a burofax on January 29
and dated January 31, acting diligently being aware of what happened,
My client proceeded to cancel the debt, lower the service of
fixed telephony and data blocking.
In this sense, in accordance with section b) of article 6.1 of the RGPD, the treatment of
data of the claimant was necessary for the execution of the contract for the provision of
telecommunications services that it has maintained with my client until
September 2018 (erroneously extending to January 2019, as we have
explained) and therefore, it is a legitimate treatment.
The existence of a SESIAD resolution recognizing the interested party's right
to request termination of the contract in October 2017 is irrelevant for these purposes, since
the claimant having exercised such right until July 2018 (9 months later) and
have enjoyed the services, including fixed telephony, up to that time,
as can be verified through the consumption of fixed telephony services in the
document no. 1 and 2.
Among the obligations derived from the contract, is the payment of the
services received and the claim for such payment is covered by the interest

Considering that the request to cancel the service occurred in July 2018,
correctly billing the last services in August, as can be seen
in document no. 2, settling amounts in favor of the claimant at the end of
September 2018, we do not appreciate the continuing nature of the infringement, as we do not
Not even 6 months have elapsed between the resolution and the claim. especially when my
represented proceeded to block the personal data of the interested party within the period
48 hours from when he became aware of the inadmissibility of the claimed debt
in January.
It is also worth mentioning that my client also has the obligation to
keep the data of the interested party, in a blocked way, in order to attend
legal obligations of various kinds, such as tax, accounting or
responsibilities arising from the processing of data, such as this one, this being
Legitimate treatment in accordance with the provisions of article 6.1.c) of the RGPD.
Therefore, in the opinion of this representation, there is no violation of the
art. 6 of the RGPD nor violation of article 5.1.a), of the RGPD, which establishes that: “The
personal data will be processed lawfully, loyally and transparently in relation to the
interested party”, having acted in any case under a contract signed with the
interested, keeping the data in a blocked form from January 31, 2019 to
the mere effects of meeting legal obligations.

Subsequently, two other invoices were issued, in November and December, after which it was
They stopped issuing invoices, proceeding with their claim in January.
Insofar as the January claim refers to four invoices, two of the
which, September and October, would have been issued on data processed
legitimately, my client is presumed to have a legitimate interest in claiming them,
in accordance with article 20 of the LOPD-GDD, not appreciating illegality in the treatment of
data to carry out this claim. Therefore, only the issuance of invoices for
November and December could be considered, where appropriate, illicit data processing
personal.
Continuing with the description of the facts, this Agency indicates that “On 01/28/19, the
claimant receives a letter from the claimed entity in which they are required to pay
197.01 euros with the warning, in case of not paying the claimed money, to include-
it in ASNEF and BADEXCUG files, although it has not been verified that the data

Well, with respect to this matter, we affirm that the claimant's data was not

data on January 31, 2019, after XFERA became aware of the situation, without the need
of complaint, requirement, or notification, which we consider very relevant in the
description of the facts that occur in this procedure.
This Agency affirms that “although the treatment was legitimate until 09/21/18, it was not

nica in the name of the claimant, therefore processing personal data in an unlawful manner,
because they were treated continuously and without consent, since the contract was
terminated months earlier.”
Once again, we find ourselves in the need to qualify this statement. First
a line was not billed in the name of the claimant other than her, but the same line

The process has continued under the terms provided therein.
Also, certainly the number of invoices issued was four, corresponding
to the months of September, October, November and December.
***INVOICE.1 51.19 € ***INVOICE.2 51.19 € ***INVOICE.3 51.19 €
***INVOICE.4 €43.44
The one for the month of September refers to services in August and the one for October
reference to September services, so when unsubscribing the service at the end
of September, the issuance of these invoices cannot be considered a treatment of
illicit data since the contractual relationship was not resolved. This just leaves us
the invoices corresponding to the months of November and December as the only ones
allegedly issued illegally.
Regarding this particular we do not appreciate illegitimacy in the treatment of data

As the error was detected, we proceeded, without delay, to cancel the invoices issued after

between the parties, but the responsibilities derived from that contract remain,
Therefore, the data processed within the framework of the same, provided that they are processed in the
terms and for the purposes of the contract itself cannot be understood as illegal.
A different question would be that my client had treated the data of the complaint-
provided on the occasion of the contract for a purpose completely unrelated to
her, or she would have communicated them to a third party, which she has not done.
So we understand that the existence of a technical error in the cancellation of one of
the services cannot be cause for considering the treatment as illicit, for-
that the processing of the claimant's data was not unlawful in origin, nor is it to date
today. In this sense, we understand that the treatment should have been cataloged
as inaccurate by improperly staying in time, but not illegal because
the contract on which it is based does not become illegal after its termination. For this reason the proposal
of resolution we understand that it is not formulated on the correct type and therefore,
should proceed to file actions by formal default in the typification of the
attributed infringement.
Once the factual and legal foundations of the proposed resolution have been analyzed,

principle of proportionality by which the sanctioning law must be governed, both
criminal as well as administrative, constitutes a limit to the discretion that the laws

Proportionality is reflected, among other things, in the establishment of circumstances

The way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, that is by
complaint. However, it should be mentioned that the complainant's data had been
blocked and the debt canceled almost a month before Mrs.
A.A.A. filed a complaint with this Agency.
With regard to the possible continuing nature of the offense mentioned above,
lately in the motion for a resolution, only to mention that in order for the infraction to be
can be considered as continuous requires the occurrence of a plurality of infractions

conclude, subsequently, that they should be considered, jointly, as a
single continuous infraction, which is not mentioned at any time.
Likewise, the continued infringement requires fraud in the commission of the infringements that
are grouped into a continuing offense. This has been recognized, in a special way,
cially illustrative, in the Judgment of the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the
National Court, of June 10, 2013. In the case at hand, it is not appreciated

However, regarding the allegations presented by the entity complained against, it must be
qualify the following:
The entity claimed stated that, after receiving the burofax from the claimant, the day
07/11/18, with the resolution of the SESIAD and the indication by it, to rescind
the contract with the company, dated 09/21/18, proceeded to the payment of €299.21, in
favor of the claimant and to cancel her from the services maintained up to the moment
with them, but admits that, "the landline service was not deactivated in that

moment, presumably due to an error when managing the cancellation of the service
Internet access".
Well, as the company acknowledges, on 09/21/18 it should have removed the data from the
claimant of their systems but that, "due to an error when managing the cancellation"
this did not occur.
Well, the personal data of the claimant was in the possession of the company
from that date inappropriately outside or not due to an error in its management.
But even more serious was the fact that, 4 months later, on 01/28/19, the claimant
received a letter from the entity, requesting the payment of 197.01 euros, and warning it
that, “in the event of not paying the amounts claimed, it could be included in the files
ASNEF and BADEXCUG”, and therefore, making an illegitimate treatment of the data
claims, even if it were only the fact of using them to
send the request.
Given this situation, the company alleges that, "due to the existence of successive
changes in the management of the claimant's lines presumably motivated
fixed telephony service was not terminated correctly, so it continued
being invoiced and, upon reaching the contractually established limits in November,
proceeded to claim the debt in January. Faced with this claim, the interested party
sent us a burofax on January 29, proceeding at that time to review the case
and become aware of the situation, to cancel the debt on January 31”.

Well, from 09/21/18 to 01/31/19, 4 months and 9 days, the company had in
his power and I treat some personal data without legitimacy for it, even if he is right
in its allegations when it indicates that it has, "the obligation to keep the data of
the interested party, in a blocked way, in order to meet legal obligations of
diverse nature, such as tax, accounting or responsibilities
arising from the processing of data (...)”, but not so, for the purpose for which
were finally treated and that it was, as has been verified, to continue billing
the fixed line not canceled on the day and for sending the payment request.

Regarding the amount of the sanction, the sanction of 60,000
euros due, as stated in the opening of the file, to the duration of
the infraction, 4 months and 9 days and its continuous nature; to unintentional negligence
Of the same; to the category of data illicitly processed and managed; to the way
that the control authority was aware of the infraction and above all to the
linking the activity of the offender with the performance of data processing
personal, since the company is a large company that manages and treats a
enormous amount of personal data, special diligence must be required in the
treatment of customer data.

In view of the foregoing, the following is issued:
