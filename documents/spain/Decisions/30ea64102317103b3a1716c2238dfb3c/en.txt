During these proceedings it was verified that the claimant had provided the
corporate address from Mapfre to BBVA. Likewise, it was concluded that the defendant
forwarded the claimed email to mailboxes other than the claimant.
After twelve months without being able to conclude the proceedings
necessary to clarify the possible responsibilities of the claimed facts,
dated December 3, 2019, in procedure E/00730/2019, the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to file the proceedings and open
these investigative actions, attached to file E/11745/2019.
Requested from BBVA the specific service contract maintained with OPPLUS, with
date of July 8, 2020 is received in this Agency, with registration number
023874/2020, the required service provision contract submitted by this entity.
Information requested from the MAPFRE entity on the causes that led to the error
of delivery to the claimant of the mail sent from "...***EMAIL.1" and information and
purpose of mailboxes “***EMAIL.5” and “***EMAIL.4”, the latter belonging to another
company, where it is requested that a copy of the message be sent in case of error, with
date of July 8, 2020 is received in this Agency, with registration number
023956/2020, brief of allegations stating that the claimant does not keep
any relationship with this entity and urging this Agency to address the request for
information to the entity MAPFRE TECH, as this is, possibly, the entity
responsible for processing the data of the claimant in the facts referred to
your claim.
The same information indicated in the previous paragraph was requested from the MAPFRE entity
TECH, dated October 22, 2020, is received in this Agency, with the number of
registration ***REGISTRATION.1, brief of allegations sent by this entity
stating the following aspects:
- Regarding the delivery error of the mail sent by “garsa.opplus.bbva.com” that
triggered the facts claimed, this was due to the transfer, dated
April 1, 2018, by MAPFRE TECH to IBM GLOBAL SERVICES ESPANA, S.A. (in
hereinafter, IBM GSE) of the productive unit in which the claimant lent his
services, for which the claimant ceased to be an employee of MAPFRE TECH passing
to be an employee of IBM GSE, maintaining their labor rights and obligations in
the legally regulated terms. Being already an external employee of MAPFRE, he was
I assign a new email account (...***EMAIL.6) with the domain
designated for external personnel of other companies that provide services to
MAPFRE, programming the delivery error message in your old mailbox
received by GYAR. They add at this point that the email provided by MAPFRE to its
employees is for exclusively professional use as expressly indicated
in the informative clause of access to its computer systems that all users
You must accept in order to continue with the system boot process:

“You are accessing an Information Processing System
owned by MAPFRE. Access to and use of this system is permitted.
exclusively to authorized persons and for strictly
professionals."

As in the confidentiality clause that establishes the obligation of employees
regarding this matter that was accepted by the claimant:

"Computing resources, such as email and the Internet, are a
work tool provided by the MAPFRE Group to its employees, therefore

[…]”

- Regarding the function of the mailbox "***EMAIL.5" they state that it is a mailbox
internal MAPFRE TECH created for the correct transition from MAPFRE TECH to
IBM GSE of the services covered by the outsourcing contract to ensure that they do not
there were unanswered service requests. They add that they do not know why
that BBVA sent a message to this mailbox despite the fact that in the mail returned with an error
The delivery box expressly identifies that it is a service mailbox.
Finally, they indicate that six MAPFRE employees have access to this mailbox
TECH in charge of the supervision and control of the adequate transition of the
outsourcing services from MAPFRE to IBM GSE.
- Regarding the function of the mailbox "***EMAIL.4" it is an operational mailbox of IBM
GSE with the same function and purpose as in the previous case but managed by the
receiving company of the outsourcing that is also expressly identified in
the delivery error return mail, which is a service mailbox. add
that this mailbox has access to ten IBM GSE employees responsible for the
supervision and control of the proper transition of outsourcing services.

The statement made by the claimant that the email address
provided to BBVA is only the one corresponding to "gmail.com" is not correct as
it was demonstrated within file E/00730/2019.

The use of computer media provided by Mapfre was accepted
by the claimant as for professional use only, thus excluding the
function of Mapfre's email address as a means of contact for other purposes.

The statement made by the claimant that the mail indicated in the
claim had been spread to about three thousand people, it is not correct. It has been
verified in the present investigative actions that this email had
six people from Mapfre Tech with operational functions and ten people from
IBM GSE with same functions.

The entity GYAR, sub-processor contracted by OPPLUS, carried out
sending e-mail about the claimant's financial situation to mailboxes
that clearly did not correspond to the claimant.

From the email that has motivated the claim, and that provides the
claimant, it is verified that one of the IBM GSE employees with access to the
service mailbox “***EMAIL.4”, did not forward the personal email to
claimant, but to a third person from MAPFRE TECH.

THIRD: On January 25, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed, for the
alleged infringements of articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the RGPD, typified in articles

establishes that in the event of not making allegations within the period established on the
content of the initiation agreement, it may be considered a proposal for
resolution when it contains a precise statement about the responsibility
imputed, reason why a Resolution is issued.

In application of the previous precept and taking into account that no

III

The defendant is charged with the violation of articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the RGPD.

The RGPD establishes in article 5 the principles that must govern the treatment

of personal data and mentions among them that of “integrity and confidentiality”.

The article notes that:

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)

 
f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

In turn, the security of personal data is regulated in article 32

of the GDPR.

Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/10

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
 
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the
treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration shall be given to
taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct under article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
guarantee that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and has access to personal data can only process said data
following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article 83.4.a)
of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge pursuant to articles 8,

11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.

(…)”

For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Violations, states that:
“The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

7/10

5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law.

And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as "Infringements

considered serious”:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

(…)

g) The violation, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

III

The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as
“all those violations of security that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to such data”.

From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications of
that the claimed party has violated article 32 of the RGPD, when there was a breach of
security in their systems since it is received in several mailboxes
email, even in another company's mailboxes, mail from
“***EMAIL.1” addressed to the claimant to contact BBVA at
relation to a financing that it maintains with that entity.

Therefore, there is no doubt, given the applicable legislation, the lack of measures
organizational or technical measures established by the defendant, and may have determined
a protocol that tells employees that they cannot do it or some mechanism in
the email itself notifying that the email is being sent to several
recipients before it is sent, that prevent the confidentiality of
the data, which in turn entails the infringement 5.1 f) of the RGPD.

It should be noted that the RGPD its article 32 does not establish a list of the
security measures that are applicable according to the data that are subject
of treatment, but establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved
the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of probability
and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

Likewise, the security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the detected risk, pointing out that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational information must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

8/10

resiliency, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the level of security,
particularly taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, such as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from violating the provisions of
this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must evaluate the risks
inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These
measures must ensure an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
regarding the risks and the nature of the personal data that must be
protect yourself. When assessing the risk in relation to data security,
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data
transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or access is not
authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

IV

Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that “according to what is established
Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and
Infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after three years.
of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

However, article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each authority
of control will have all the following corrective powers indicated below:
continuation:

(…)

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
this Regulation;

(…)”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/10

Therefore, the RGPD, without prejudice to the provisions of its article 83, contemplates
in its article 58.2 b) the possibility of going to the warning to correct the
processing of personal data that do not meet your expectations.

According to the available evidence and the
documentation provided shows that the respondent sent the mail
email about the claimant's financial situation to mailboxes that are clearly not
corresponded to the claimant, violating the duty of confidentiality, which
constitutes, on the part of the defendant, two infractions, one against the provisions of the
article 32 of the RGPD and another against the provisions of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs
the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the
proactive responsibility of the controller to demonstrate its
compliance.
     

These offenses are sanctioned with a warning. According to
article 58.2.b) of the RGPD, and considering that the administrative fines that could
fall in accordance with the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a
disproportionate burden for the claimed.

Likewise, for the purposes provided in article 58.2 of the RGPD, the measure
corrective measure that could be imposed on the respondent would consist of requiring him to proceed to
adopt the necessary measures to stop the behavior that is the subject of this claim,
that has caused the reported security breach, so that the effects are corrected
of the infraction committed and its adequacy to the requirements contemplated in article
32 of the RGPD, as well as the provision of accrediting means of compliance with the
required.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency

Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE Management and Administration of Receipts S.A. with CIF
A83052621:





for an infringement of article 32 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4 a) of the
RGPD a sanction of warning and require you to inform the AEPD
of the measures adopted, within a period of one month, to correct the
effects of the offense committed and its adaptation to the requirements
contemplated in article 32 of the RGPD.

for an infringement of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a)
of the RGPD a sanction of warning.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to Management and Administration of Receipts
S.A. with CIF A83052621.
