The information contained in the information systems is as follows:

Once the claim is received, the AEPD carries out the following actions:

- On December 1, 2020, it is executed, using the search engine of
"Google", a search of the name and surnames of the delimited complaining party

European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free

established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the AEPD is
competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

the processing of personal data, since PHARMA
TALENTS carries out, among other treatments, the collection, registration, consultation, of data
information of natural persons, such as: name, telephone number, address of
email etc

PHARMA TALENTS carries out this activity in its capacity as responsible for the
treatment, since it is who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue
of article 4.7 of the RGPD.

Article 4 paragraph 12 of the RGPD defines, in a broad way, the "violations of
security of personal data” (hereinafter security breach) as “all
those breaches of security that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
accidental or illicit of personal data transmitted, conserved or processed in another
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

does not imply the imposition of a sanction directly, since it is necessary to analyze
the diligence of those responsible and in charge and the security measures applied.

The security of personal data is regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the
RGPD, which regulate both the security of the treatment, the notification of a violation
of the security of personal data to the control authority, as well as the
communication to the interested party, respectively.

confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it is stated that the personal data of the complaining party, as well as
those of other people, in the PHARMA TALENTS database, were
unduly exposed to third parties, violating the principles of integrity and
confidentiality.

instruction, it is considered that the known facts could constitute a
