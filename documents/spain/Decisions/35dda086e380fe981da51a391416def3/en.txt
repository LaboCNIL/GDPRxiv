

The respondent states that the reason for carrying out the above
calls was to attract new clients for the claimed company, according to
in the contract for the provision of teleshopping services between them in the
condition of the person in charge of the treatment. The respondent provides a copy of said
contract signed by you and that of the investigated for the purpose of providing your
services in the telephone acquisition of clients for the claimed.

The investigated identifies the making of commercial calls from her
branch located in Tetouan, Morocco.

The respondent informs that the only data of the claimant that she has is her
phone number (***PHONE.1), found in the database
received from the claimed (a total of 36,992 contacts), via email
electronically on 01/03/2020 in a compressed and password-protected file,
to be contacted within the framework of the recruitment services contract
customers subscribed between them. The investigated provides a copy of the aforementioned email
containing the database in question.



The investigated literally determines that:

“The parameters of the campaign were established by Vodafone.

This company provides us with a BB.DD. with the registries to contact, in which
Only the phone number appears. The database is generated from
of random ranges, respecting the pertinent time of three (3) months for their
possible previous use and filtering it previously with the active clients in
the company and the Robinson listings in effect on the date of shipment.”



The investigated literally establishes that:

“It is Vodafone that in the first instance compares telephone numbers
randomly generated that make up the BB.DD. with the Robinson List with
the objective of eliminating the matching numbers, making Atento a
additional and subsequent comparison to this, using for it a list of
exclusion periodically sent by Vodafone.

In the case of the telephone number under review, this was communicated by
Vodafone in the exclusion list sent on 02/05/2020.”

The investigated provides a copy of said email in which they are updated
the telephone numbers registered in the Robinson List so as not to make calls to them
commercial.

THIRD: On February 9, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimant, with
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,
LPACAP), for the alleged violation of art. 48.1.b) of the LGT in relation to art. twenty-one
of the RGPD and 23 of the LOPDGDD, typified as serious in article 77.37 of the aforementioned
LGT, and for the alleged infringement of art. 28 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a)
of said norm.

FOURTH: Having been notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the respondent submitted a written
pleadings in which, in summary, he stated the following:

1.- ATENTO's activity focuses on the provision of services through
call centers, call centers, in order to carry out management and
telephone service to customers and users of the services marketed by
third parties.

These third parties - ATENTO clients - dictate the rules and guidelines that govern the
contacts made with end users, since the perception of these
latter is, in all cases, that the telephone call is made
directly by the entity for which ATENTO provides services.

There are no cases in which ATENTO identifies itself as the caller, nor in
which it is carried out within the framework of a work of obtaining or exploiting
of personal data for which it is responsible for the treatment.

Within the framework of said activity and as indicated in the response sent to the
initial information requirement, ATENTO is a service provider of the group
company VODAFONE (hereinafter, “VDF”), from which it follows that, by virtue of
the agreements reached, only the personal data of users that are well
maintain a contractual relationship with VDF or on which said entity is
is enabled to carry out contacts.

In the indicated context, on the date of the events that gave rise to the claim,
ATENTO provided services to VDF, to carry out telephone contact with
end users, for the purpose of offering them a VDF product.

The dynamic followed between both entities for the service provided has been exposed
by ATENTO previously; VDF provides ATENTO with a database that
contains phone numbers that should be targeted by the compromised campaign. Yes
it is true that the business relationship between the two is based on the premise of
that these phones are randomly generated, if they had a different origin
(for example, that it was a list of potential clients of the VDF itself), the
followed operational would not be affected, nor in the commitments
acquired by VDF, with regard to the legitimacy of said data. For the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.agpd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/14

Therefore, it is always VDF that carries out the filters related to the exclusion of clients
who have opposed the reception of commercial communications.
In relation to this issue, VDF has referred in its attention to the requirement of
information formulated by this Agency, that there are two different cases in
the execution of commercial campaigns: one, in which it is she herself who
provides the databases; another, in which its suppliers are the ones that generate
and process the data on their own behalf.

Without prejudice to the fact that this party does not doubt that said differences concur, it is
relevant to state that the procedure followed by ATENTO is circumscribed,
exclusively to the first casuistry. Therefore, there is no casuistry in which
ATENTO processes data that is not provided by VDF.

Consequently, all the databases provided by VDF have to be
be subjected to a purification process before sending it to ATENTO, both with its
own list of internal exclusions, as with the one contained in Adigital. this end
It is corroborated by the VDF itself, stating that: "For campaigns
made by the teleshopping platform, it is Vodafone who provides the database
object of the campaign and is the entity in charge of previously filtering it through the lists
Robinson, both from ADigital and from Vodafone itself” (Page 24 of the file
administrative of this procedure).

As regards the specific circumstances giving rise to the claim, the
January 3, 2020 VDF sends ATENTO by email a database
with the telephone numbers to which it gives instructions to call, referenced as
Document No. 1. Said database, which according to the procedure
mentioned above should be previously filtered with the lists of
internal and external advertising exclusion, includes the telephone number of the
claimant, registered on the Robinson List since November 29, 2019.

ATENTO calls on behalf of VDF to the claimant's number twice on January 16
2020, and twice on January 22 of the same year, without the last two calls
are answered. Next, on February 5, 2020, VDF sends ATENTO
by email a file containing data that ATENTO must exclude from the
database sent to him on January 3, for being included in the Robinson List,
among which is the number of the claimant. This email and its
attachments are provided as Document No. 2. As of that date, ATENTO has
VDF instructions not to impact, and therefore do not impact, the claimant.

Therefore, from the above it follows that the lists that were used by
ATENTO for the provision of its services and from which, as a result, the
facts that motivated the present procedure must have been filtered by
VDF, by virtue of the agreements contractually reached, without ATENTO having
power to process the data to carry out any crossing of the information
with any other databases (internal or external). That is, the data that
are subject to treatment by ATENTO are exclusively those that, in the
specific case, it provides you with VDF. Which, according to the agreements
contractually reached, they had to be duly filtered and be
legitimate for the treatment of the same for the provision of services
agreed.

2.- The attribution of the infraction to ATENTO seems to be based on the
breach of the obligations assumed in his role as manager, due to the fact of
transfer data outside the European Union, at the discretion of the AEPD, without
the requirements defined in GDPR are met.

3.- Thus, the present administrative file contains a copy of the
regularization of international data transfer (pages 188 to 196)
(Reference TI/00052/2018), in light of the standard contractual clauses for the
transfer of personal data to those in charge of the treatment established in
third countries, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and
of Council.

FIFTH: On 04/19/2021, the examining body agreed to open a practice period
of tests, agreeing to practice the following:

<1. The claim filed by the
claimant and his documentation, the documents obtained and generated by the
Inspection Services before ATENTO TELESERVICIOS ESPAÑA, S.A., and the Report
of previous inspection actions that are part of file E/09378/2020.

2. Likewise, it is considered reproduced for evidentiary purposes, the allegations to the agreement
of initiation PS/00019/2021 filed by ATENTO TELESERVICIOS ESPAÑA, S.A., and
the accompanying documentation.

3. Incorporate into the file the resolution of the AEPD referenced TD/00052/20218,
regarding the authorization to make an international transfer to Morocco in the
within the data processor contract with Vodafone ONO according to the contract
identified as 2017MA007124 and between Atento Teleservices Spain, S.A. branch office
in Morocco, reference 2017MA007315, provided by Vodafone ONO. The
The result of these tests may lead to the performance of others>.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of the LGT, the competence to
initiate and resolve this Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of
the Spanish Agency for Data Protection.

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to
resolve this procedure.

II

Article 89.1.c) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common of the Public Administrations, indicates the following:

<Article 89. Resolution proposal in sanctioning procedures.

1. The investigating body will resolve the completion of the procedure, with a file of the
actions, without it being necessary to formulate the resolution proposal,
when in the procedure instruction it becomes clear that there is any
of the following circumstances:

c) When the proven facts do not constitute, in a manifest way, an infringement
administrative.>

In the present case, the provisions of art. 89.1.c) cited above, as
reasons on the following rights foundations, so it is appropriate to resolve the
present sanctioning procedure.

The facts detailed in the background could constitute an infraction,
attributable to the defendant, for violation of article 48.1.b) of Law 9/2014, of 9
May, General de Telecomunicaciones (hereinafter, LGT), included in its Title III,
That points:

III

<<Article 48. Right to the protection of personal data and privacy in relation
with unsolicited communications, with traffic and location data and with
subscriber guides.

1. Regarding the protection of personal data and privacy in relation to the
unsolicited communications end users of communications services
electronic will have the following rights:

9/14

(…)
b) To oppose receiving unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes
that are carried out through systems other than those established in the previous letter and
be informed of this right.>>

Although the aforementioned article does not configure such a right, so we must go to the
data protection regulations in which the right of opposition is regulated: article
21 of the RGPD, (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the
Treatment of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of these Data) and article 23
of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights).

Notwithstanding, of the instruction of the present procedure and especially of the evidence
practiced in it, the allegation made by both the by the
claimed as by the one investigated in the allegations phase regarding the fact that the
alleged violation of art 48.1.b) of the LGT was due to a specific error of the
Numbering filtering system with the Adigital Robinson list not existing
culpability in his behavior, since it was due to a change in the system of
filtering of Adigital's Robinson numbers during the period between the
year 2020 and February 2021 beyond their control, as stated by the entity
in charge of the treatments of the information system róbinson of Adigital.

In this regard, it is clear that the inclusion of the claimant's line in the list
Robinson of Adigital is dated 10/29/2019, so the Robinson record of Adigital
of exclusion of advertising calls, according to its own regulations, it was not
updated with the line of the claimant until 12/29/2019 (two months from the
inclusion according to the old ADigital robinson listing access system).

It is also stated that on 12/12/2019 the respondent took from the Robinson list
of Adigital the number of the claimant and provided it to the person in charge of the treatment
(Investigated), therefore, since the period of two months has not elapsed since its
inclusion the claimant's line did not appear in the list.

Once the data has been crossed with the Adigital Robinson list and the campaign has started
customer acquisition with the investigated, the claimed sent by email
dated 01/03/2020 the list of numbers to the person in charge of the treatment
(investigated) which in turn sent it to its branch in Morocco, who proceeded in the
framework of the customer acquisition services contract signed to carry out
materially the commercial action in the name and on behalf of the claimed party.

It is proven that due to the changes that were imposed by the
ADigital in relation to the query system of the official Robinson list -which went from
a system of downloads of the complete databases to a system of consultations of
databases- the entities have had to develop specifically under the
requirements imposed by Adigital an API and, once detected that the SQL applied to
the database in question was not correctly updating all the
Robinson, the defendant identified the incident in order to update the applied SQL,
completely correcting the incident and updating the databases daily
(new access system to Adigital's robinson list).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.agpd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/14

Therefore, the respondent sent on 02/05/2020 an updated list to Atento
SUC-MOROCCO, correcting the error of the inclusion of the telephone number of the
claimant.

Consequently, the defendant, before knowing the incidence in the downloads of the
Adigital's Robinson listing, proceeded to diligently correct that error, as
deduces from the chronology of the events and the content of the administrative file,
reason why the conduct initially imputed to the defendant lacks
volitional element of guilt as a result of an error of others and in
Consequently, the person under investigation lacks responsibility for the events
initially charged.

In this sense, the SAN dated 02/26/2021 pronounces:

< THIRD.- We proceed to analyze the question regarding the existence
of guilt, invoked its absence by the plaintiff. It is said by society
appellant that in order to be attributed the responsibility foreseen by the
legal system for the commission of an administrative infraction, a
double imputation title: (i) the objective imputation, that is, that it can be attributed
from the point of view of the material accusation, and (ii) the subjective imputation, that is,
volitional attribution. It is not enough, then, with the pure worthlessness of the result or
with the objective injury of a protected legal interest, the impairment of
the action for the intentional or negligent commission of the conduct. The simple disregard
can be understood as referring to a norm, but the objective non-observance of the norm does not
alone justifies the imposition of the penalty.

Thus, it is known that liability can be incurred for the infraction that
we are examining both intentionally or maliciously or negligently (art. 28 of the
Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector-). and proceeds
now remember that, as indicated by the Supreme Court in the Judgment of January 23
of 1998, "... although the culpability of the conduct must also be proven,
must be considered in order to assume the corresponding load that
ordinarily the volitional and cognitive elements necessary to appreciate
they are part of the typical behavior tested, and that their exclusion requires that
the absence of such elements is proven, or in its normative aspect, that it has been
used the diligence that was required by the person who alleges its non-existence; not enough, in
sum, for the exculpation in the face of a typically unlawful behavior the
invocation of the absence of guilt".>

In the present case, it is clear that the respondent, once she had knowledge of the
errors that were occurring in the data crossing with the Róbinson list of
Adigital acted with due diligence correcting the error detected by sending
date 02/05/2020 a new list corrected to the investigated and incorporating into its
internal list the numbering object of claim, ceasing henceforth the
calls to the claimant. Consequently, the investigated element is not appreciated
volitional guilt in the initially imputed conduct.

Known facts could also constitute an infringement, attributable to
the one investigated as the person in charge of the treatment now analyzed, for
violation of article 28.3.h) in fine of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4 of said
norm, considered minor for prescription purposes in article 74.j) of the LOPDGDD,
for the following reasons:

Article 28 of the GDPR states the following:

"Art. 28, Responsible for treatment.

1. When a treatment is going to be carried out on behalf of a person in charge of the
treatment, this will only choose a person in charge who offers sufficient guarantees

protection of the rights of the interested party.

2. The person in charge of treatment will not resort to another person in charge without prior authorization
in writing, specific or general, of the person in charge. In the latter case, the manager
will inform the person in charge of any change foreseen in the incorporation or
replacement of other processors, thus giving the controller the opportunity to oppose
to these changes.

3. The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract or other legal act with
under the law of the Union or of the Member States, binding the person in charge
with respect to the person in charge and establish the object, duration, nature and
purpose of the treatment, the type of personal data and categories of interested parties, and the
obligations and rights of the controller. Said contract or legal act shall stipulate, in
particular, that the person in charge:

a) will process personal data only following documented instructions of the
responsible, including with respect to transfers of personal data to a
third country or an international organization, unless required to do so under
of the Law of the Union or of the Member States that applies to the person in charge; in
In such a case, the person in charge will inform the person in charge of that legal requirement prior to the
treatment, unless such Law prohibits it for important reasons of interest
public; b) will guarantee that the persons authorized to process personal data
have undertaken to respect confidentiality or are subject to an obligation

c) take all necessary measures in accordance with article 32;

d) will respect the conditions indicated in sections 2 and 4 to resort to another
treatment manager;

e) will assist the person in charge, taking into account the nature of the treatment, through
appropriate technical and organizational measures, whenever possible, so that this

can comply with its obligation to respond to requests that are intended to
the exercise of the rights of the interested parties established in chapter III;

f) will help the person in charge to guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations
established in articles 32 to 36, taking into account the nature of the treatment
and the information available to the person in charge;

g) at the choice of the person in charge, will delete or return all personal data once

part of the person in charge or of another auditor authorized by said person in charge.

In relation to the provisions of letter h) of the first paragraph, the person in charge will inform
immediately to the controller if, in his opinion, an instruction violates this
Regulation or other provisions on data protection of the Union or of
the member states. (the underlining is from the AEPD).

4. When a person in charge of the treatment resorts to another person in charge to carry out
certain treatment activities on behalf of the person in charge, will be imposed on
this other manager, by contract or other legal act established in accordance with the
Law of the Union or of the Member States, the same obligations of
data protection than those stipulated in the contract or other legal act between the
responsible and the person in charge referred to in section 3, in particular the provision
of sufficient guarantees of application of appropriate technical and organizational measures
so that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of this
