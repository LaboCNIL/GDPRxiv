RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in
based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 02/23/22, Mrs. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) filed
claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

The claim was directed against the entity MARINA MARIOLA SL., with CIF.:
B29695327, owner of the web page ***URL.1, (hereinafter, the claimed party), for the
alleged violation of data protection regulations: Regulation (EU)

actions provided for in the aforementioned regulations for cases of
non-compliance, in accordance with the investigative and sanctioning powers of
the agency.

verified that the website: ***URL.1 , still did not comply with the regulations in
matter of data processing by presenting the same deficiencies and use of
data inconsent that were the subject of a complaint on our part.

communicated that "... on August 31, 2022, the

been rejected in previous notification attempts.”

THIRD: On 03/08/23, by the Board of Directors of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, a sanctioning procedure is initiated against the claimed entity, at
assess reasonable evidence of violation of the provisions of article 13 of the
GDPR due to the lack of information in accordance with current regulations, on the
treatment of personal data when obtained through the website of
its ownership by referring to a repealed LOPD, with an initial sanction of
5,000 euros (five thousand euros) and for the violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI for the
deficiencies detected, regarding the cookies policy, on the web page in
question, (the use of cookies that are not technical or necessary; the impossibility
to reject them or to manage them in a granular way and the non-existence of information
on the use of cookies) with an initial penalty of 5,000 euros (five thousand
euro).

In addition, to the foregoing, and in application of article 58.2 of the GDPR, it was indicated that, if
Once the infringement is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the controller the adoption of
adequate measures to adjust its performance to current regulations, in what
with respect to the provisions of article 13 of the GDPR.

FOURTH: On 03/22/23, the respondent entity submits a written statement of allegations to
the initiation of the file, in which, among others, it states the following:

FIRST. – FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS.

1.- The claimant filed a claim with the AEPD on the 23rd of
February 2022 against Marina Mariola S.L. was followed in the file with
reference EXP202206270, stating that the person in charge of the website
***URL.1 has published on said website, in the news section (***URL.4) data
personal data of two people (name and surname of both and, in addition, a
photograph of him) without his consent and accusing them of having occupied a
property and not having paid the price corresponding to the rent.

The complaining party also stated that they do not appear on the page ***URL.1
the data of the owner of the website, a fact that is true. In view of this claim,
Marina Mariola S.L. submitted allegations dated July 8, 2022.
Attached as document No. 2 said statement of allegations and proof of
presentation.

2.- A second proceeding was carried out against Marina Mariola, whose
file has reference EXP202206119, which dealt with the infringement of
the web page in question, of the Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy.

Given this notification, Marina Mariola S.L. presented allegations on the 23rd of
September 2022, with the same rationale as in the first
proceedings. Attached as document number 3 is the document presented in this
file and proof of presentation.

SECOND. – THE FACTS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE NOT
ATTRIBUTABLE TO MARINA MARIOLA S.L.

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/16

As you can see, in the brief presented we already explained the impossibility of
Marina Mariola S.L. to comply with the regulations of the LOPDGDD and LSSI,
since Marina Mariola S.L. is not the creator of this website or
no other and, therefore, is not the owner of the ***URL.1 web domain.

Therefore, Marina Mariola S.L. It is not who has published the personal information
of the claimants and not being the owner of the page has no control or the
possibility to delete such published personal data; just like neither
has no control or possibility to modify the infractions committed with respect to
the cookie policy and privacy policy.

THIRD.- ATTEMPT TO PROVE THE NON-OWNERSHIP OF THE MARINA
MARIOLA S.L. REGARDING THE WEB DOMAIN.

As we have seen, the AEPD accessed the web page ***URL.1
  for
verify the points expressed by the claimant. Yet we see
that it has not responded to the request for verification of ownership that this
part he stated to him in his 2 previous writings, since nothing is said in the
agreement to start disciplinary proceedings.

Therefore, it can be seen that the AEPD has assumed that by the mere fact of
that the domain name of the web page is ***URL.1 must be of the
owned by the company that bears the same name, Marina Mariola S.L.
We reiterate that this is not the case. Nowadays, you can buy a domain in
any hosting company, without asking for any type of accreditation or
prerequisite to acquire a specific domain.

Anyone has been able to acquire the domain that included «Marina
Mariola» and write on the page that the owner company is Marina Mariola S.L.
posing as said legal person.

It is vitally important that the AEPD not only verify the facts that the
claimant expressed in his brief, but the facts that this party also
manifest, so that they can go against the true owner of the
web domain, which is who will be able to meet your compliance requirement
of the LOPDGDD and the LSSI.

For this reason, we reiterate the arguments already presented in the two writings that
we present in the 2 files opened against Marina Mariola for these
questions (EXP202206270 and EXP202206119): 1.- Willing to try
that, indeed, Marina Mariola S.L. is not the creator of the web page in
question, we contacted the company OVHCloud -thanks to which it was possible to
acquired the domain ***URL.1 and the one that, therefore, has the data of the holder of
said domain - to request some type of certification or justification that
Marina Mariola S.L. is not the creator -it is not the owner- of said website and, therefore,
Therefore, it is not the one that has published the personal information of the claimants nor
has breached the LSSI.

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/16

This contact was unsuccessful, since we were denied such a certificate
by phone and they answered the email with a generic email
automatically generated.

We attach as document number 4 the email and its corresponding response.
2.- Because the previous evidentiary route has not been possible due to external causes
At this point, there is another second possibility of demonstrating that Marina Mariola
S.L. and the creator of that web page are different people. If we agree to
the page ***URL.1 , appears several times on the web and, more
specifically, in the Contact section, the telephone number +34 661 869
811.

We attach a screenshot as document no. 5. Next, if
we access the web ***URL.5 we can see that the mobile phone number
contact is the same, ***PHONE.1.

We attach a screenshot as document no. 6. This company,
Highcliffe Estates Marbella S.L. has a single administrator, who is a person
other than the sole administrator of Marina Mariola S.L.

For this, we attach simple notes from the company Highcliffe Estates Marbella
S.L. and Marina Mariola S.L. as attachments no. 7 and 8,
respectively. That is, it is clear that the person who created the page
web ***URL.1 is not the company Marina Mariola S.L.

FOURTH.- INVESTIGATION REQUEST BY AEPD OF DATA OF THE
WEB DOMAIN OWNERSHIP.-

Despite being evidenced by the evidence previously provided that
Marina Mariola S.L. is not responsible for the facts that motivate the 3
files directed against Marina Mariola S.L., this party requests the AEPD
that, through the appropriate channels, verify with the appropriate means
the identity of the person who owns the web page ***URL.1 , based on the
Articles 51 and following of the LOPDGDD Law.

Thus, the collaboration of OVHCloud is mandatory, for the
Obtaining data from the owner of the web page ***URL.1 that requires the
AEPD - collaboration that was denied to this party - according to article 52.1
LOPDGDD. Specifically, the AEPD may obtain from OVHCloud the
necessary information because they are facts carried out through the use of a
information society service, as permitted by article 52.3,
in its section b), which establishes the following:

3. When you have not been able to make the identification by other means, the
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection may collect from the operators
that provide electronic communications services available to the public and
of the service providers of the information society the data that
in their possession and that are essential for the identification of the
allegedly responsible for conduct contrary to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and
to this organic law when it has been carried out through the

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/16

use of a service of the information society or the performance of
an electronic communication. For such purposes, the data that the Agency
Española de Protección de Datos may collect under this section
are the following: […] b) When the conduct was carried out through the
use of a service of the information society: 1. Identification
of the Internet protocol address from which the
the conduct and the date and time of its completion. 2nd. If the conduct had been
carried out by email, the identification of the address of
Internet protocol from which the email account was created and the date and time
in which it was created. 3rd The name, identification document number
and address of the subscriber who has been assigned the Protocol address
Internet to which the two preceding paragraphs refer. These dates
must be transferred, prior reasoned request of the AEPD,
exclusively within the framework of investigative actions initiated as
consequence of a complaint filed by an affected person regarding a
conduct of a legal person or regarding the use of systems that
allow unrestricted disclosure of personal data. […]´´.

For all of the above, this party requests the AEPD to request the
protocol address identification - more commonly known as
IP address - which created the web page ***URL.1 and, therefore, which violated the
LOPDGDD and the LSSI, and the data (such as name, document number
identification and address of the person) associated with the IP address
previously referred to.

FIFTH - ARCHIVE AND DISMISSAL OF ALL FILES
DIRECTED AGAINST MARINA MARIOLA S.L. AND THE NON-IMPOSITION OF
PROPOSED SANCTION.

We are not going to analyze the facts and their legal basis, since it has been
proven that this party does not have passive standing to be part of the
proceedings. After verification by the means provided by this party, together with
with relevant investigative procedures to confirm the
separation between the owner of the web domain in question and Marina Mariola
S.L., it is pertinent to request the filing and dismissal of this file
sanctioning and all the files directed against Marina Mariola S.L. and
the non-imposition of the proposed sanction of 10,000 euros, since it is not the
creator of the web page in question and, therefore, is not the person who has
published the personal information of the claimants.

SIXTH - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PERSONALITY IN THE
SANCTIONING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE.

Due to the nature of this disciplinary file, we cannot forget
that the principles that should govern it are those characteristic of law
administrative sanction, among which is the principle of
personality of sorrows Regarding this principle, it should be noted that it is
included in article 25.1 of the Spanish Constitution, which means that
against its violation, it is possible to file an appeal for amparo before the Court
Constitutional.

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

12/16

There is extensive jurisprudence on this principle that makes clear the
concept and its consequences: thus, only the sanction can be imposed
to that subject who has committed the acts that originate the sanction that is
intends to impose This principle has the consequence that
verify that the acts giving rise to the sanction have been committed by the person
to whom the disciplinary procedure is directed, as well expressed in the Judgment
of March 9, 2017 issued by the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court,
"Only the offender is the one who has to pay the sanction, since it is about
a repressive measure that he has to face as compensation for
the commission of an infraction, which leads us to the extinction of the
responsibility derived from infringements and tax sanctions.”

The AEPD has directed the procedure against Marina Mariola S.L. for the mere
fact that the web domain that has committed the infringements has the name
of the company and that on the website it appears written that the owner of the website
is Marina Mariola S.L. However, let us remember that today you can
easily impersonate anyone by electronic means.

The AEPD must be clear that the only manifestations that proceed
truly from Marina Mariola S.L. are those expressed in this and in the
2 other documents presented previously -as you will be able to verify in the
power that is attached that it is so - and in which we have reiterated that that page
web (***URL.1) has not been created by Marina Mariola S.L.

Thus, the STS of May 3, 1988 considers that "being common to the criminal order
and to the sanctioning administrative the principles on which the power rests
punitive of the State - article 25 of the Constitution, it is necessary to state
clearly the authorship of the infraction to be able to impose the sanction, and this
authorship does not appear at all in the present case in which what appears is
that the sanctioned Promoter used construction professionals to
carry out the work (professionals, contractor), being evident that it is not possible to
sanction without further ado the Promoter of the work as if he were responsible, for
the mere fact of having been the Promoter, due to the vices or defects that appeared
in it, since what is unavoidable in these cases is to purify its possible eventual
responsibilities." As we see in the Judgment, it cannot be taken for granted
fact that Marina Mariola S.L. is responsible for the infringing conduct
without further ado, for the mere fact of having the same name as the domain and some
statement that it puts on the web page, without checking if it truly
is the responsible subject, despite the fact that this party - Marina Mariola S.L. - has
requested so on several occasions.

SEVENTH.- NOTIFICATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE WEB PAGE
***URL.1 TO THE OVHCLOUD HOSTING SERVICE.

The hosting service that allowed the creation of the web page ***URL.1 allows
send them notifications about infractions and illegal content established in the
web pages created through your company. That is why, for older
in addition to the above and in order to prove that Marina Mariola S.L. it's not
neither the creator nor the owner of this web domain, we have presented said notification

before OVHCloud. We attach as document no. 9 the proof of
presentation. For these reasons, I REQUEST V.S., that, having
presented this writing, along with the accompanying documents, deigns
admit it, considering the allegations formulated in due time and form
contained in the body of the same, and prior to the timely processing
(including the verifications that this party has requested and that the Agency
The Spanish Data Protection Agency deems appropriate to carry out to know the
Ownership of the web page ***URL.1.

FIFTH: This Agency has verified that there is a second
