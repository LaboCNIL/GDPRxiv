services associated with the claimed person.

SEVENTH: Attached as an Annex is a list of documents in the
process.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

The Director of the Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the
RGPD and in the art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the
assumptions in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”

 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

 The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

5/12

"1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (U.E.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in
particularly the following:

            (…)

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

III

The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it carried out the treatment of the
personal data of the claimant without their consent. The personal data of the
claimant were incorporated into the company's information systems, without
has accredited that he had his consent for the collection and treatment
later of your personal data.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
persons who contracted on behalf of the claimant.

It should be noted that the defendant acknowledges the existence of impersonation

of identity for the lines object of the claim.

 Well, on the part of the defendant, its distributors are required to request

the following documents:

  Photocopy of National Identity Document, expression of the Number of
Tax identification of the signatory, photocopy of the Passport, Residence Card and
Personal Identification Number for Foreigners, if the signer is a foreigner.

Photocopy of National Identity Document; or of the Passport, Card of
Residence and Personal Identification Number of Foreigners, if you are a foreigner, of the
holder of the bank account charged, as well as his signature on the Payment Order
Banking, in the case of being a different person from the one who appears as a client.

Photocopy of National Identity Document; or of the Passport, Card of
Residence and Personal Identification Number of Foreigners and Power of Attorney
enough in favor of the signatory, in case of being a different person from the one that appears as
client.

Documents accrediting the collection data (receipt, bank statement,
etc…) in which the owner or owners of the account and the 20 digits
of the Customer Account Code (C.C.C.).

Likewise, it is pointed out that the distributors are responsible for the veracity
of the information that it incorporates and with which the Subscription contract is completed. In
the moment of contracting, the Distributor must inexcusably verify the
personal identification data of the client and, where appropriate, those of the signatory, with the
original documents.

On the other hand, they state that in no case will they proceed to request discharge
for a client whose data and documents present any doubt about their veracity
or authenticity.

   For all the above, it is confirmed that the contribution of the recording is not
enough, not having been sufficiently accredited that the treatment of
personal data has been made in accordance with the precepts indicated
previously; having verified that the respondent has associated the data
personal information of the claimant to the registration of four telephone lines that he denies having
hired.

    The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National High Court, in
assumptions such as the one presented here, has considered that when the owner of the
data denies the hiring, the burden of proof corresponds to those who affirm their
existence, and the third-party data controller must collect and
keep the necessary documentation to prove the consent of the holder.
We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Basis of Law
Fourth.

The personal data of the claimant were registered in the files of the
claimed and were treated for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the
claimant. Consequently, it has processed personal data without
that has proven that it has the consent of the latter for its treatment, nor
that has the legal authorization to do so.

However, and this is essential, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy to

the processing of the claimant's data.

In short, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
one that shows that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one who
claimed to hold

Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of the fundamental right
of protection of personal data requires that it be accredited that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. Failure to act in this way -and this Agency, who is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations
it is therefore evident. Diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the data controller be in a position
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

IV

In accordance with the provisions of the RGPD in its art. 83.1 and 83.2, when deciding the
imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case will be
taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in the article
indicated, as well as any other that may be applicable to the circumstances of the

                 “Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

         “Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of

treatment;
  f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
remedying the breach and mitigating the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
case, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question
in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct
or indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,

“Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

          "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person in charge or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in article 83.5.a) of the
RGPD for which the claimant is responsible, the following are considered concurrent
factors:

As aggravating criteria:

In the present case we are dealing with an unintentional negligent action, but

-
identified significant (article 83.2 b).

Basic personal identifiers (name, a number of

-
identification, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).

It must be considered that the respondent estimated the existence of impersonation of
identity, canceled the existing debt, stopped any collection action, requested the exclusion
of the data of the claimant of the patrimonial solvency files.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 6, it allows setting a
sanction of 50,000 euros (fifty thousand euros), typified as "very serious", for the purposes of

           In view of the foregoing, the following is issued
