maras, adopting a minimum protocol of access to the images in case of being
necessary, remembering the restrictive nature of access to them.

III

In accordance with the ample “evidence” available in this pro-
sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the claimed party has proceeded to the
installation of a video-surveillance camera system without the proper
informed authorization of the rest of the owners of the property.

Regardless of the obligations of the President of the Community of
owners, whose alleged willful / negligent action we remember is subject to
responsibility, the Community must ensure that the installed system conforms
to current legislation, without prejudice to falling on the figure of the main
representative, the consequences of an action that causes damages to
the same.

The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the content of art. 6 GDPR.
