FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

II

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in art. 47 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

The joint assessment of the documentary evidence in the procedure brings to
knowledge of the AEPD a vision of the performance of the claimed entity, which has
reflected in the facts declared proven.

From the documentation in the file, sent by the claimant, it is offered
clear indications that the respondent violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles

related to treatment, in relation to article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty to
confidentiality, when disclosing to a third party the personal data of another person.

The duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must be understood as
Its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not consented to by
their owners.

Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that falls not only on the
responsible and in charge of the treatment but to anyone who intervenes in any
phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

In this sense, the National High Court pronounced itself in a judgment of 01/18/02, in
whose Second Law Foundation, stated: "The duty of professional secrecy
which is incumbent on those responsible for automated files, ..., implies that the
responsible –in this case, the recurring banking entity- of the data stored
-in this case, those associated with the complainant- cannot reveal or make known their
content having the "duty to keep them, obligations that will subsist even after
to end their relations with the owner of the automated file or, where appropriate, with the
responsible for it... This duty of secrecy is essential in societies
increasingly complex, in which advances in technology place the
person in risk areas for the protection of fundamental rights, such as
intimacy or the right to data protection set forth in article 18.4 of the
EC. In effect, this precept contains an "institution to guarantee the rights to
privacy and honor and the full enjoyment of the rights of citizens who,
moreover, it is in itself a fundamental right or freedom, the right to freedom
in the face of potential attacks on the dignity and freedom of the person
from an illegitimate use of mechanized data processing (STC 292/2000)
…”

For all these reasons, the lack of diligence in sending documentation to the
applicant by the entity VODAFONE ESPAÑA SAU, since I provide data
personal data of a third party.

III

Thus, the known facts are constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the
claimed, for violation Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD establishes that: "the data
personal data will be treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss,
accidental destruction or damage, through the application of technical measures or
appropriate organizational

For its part, and after the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase and
throughout the instruction of the procedure, it is appropriate in this case to attend to what
