RESOLUTION OF PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Ms. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) dated 12/10/2020
filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against ENDESA ENERGÍA, S.A.U. with NIF A81948077 (in
hereafter, the party claimed). The reasons on which the claim is based are: that
produced an identity theft to request the portability of the contract of
one electric company to another, using false documentation through the
distributor E-REDES Distribución Eléctrica (hereinafter E-REDES), which gave
lowers the contract he had with the electric company EDP in which he had to return
to register with said company.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party for
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set forth in the regulations of
Data Protection.
On 05/24/2021, this Agency received a written response from the claimant
noting that in relation to the CUPS that appears indicated in the claim,
was associated with two contracts carried out by a third party.
The first of 10/07/2020 in which he requested that a
electricity supply contract for the home located at ***ADDRESS.1, Oviedo
(Asturias), confirming that the CUPS associated with said address was ***CUPS.1. And that,
although the teleoperator that attends to him asks him if the address of the point of
supply is ***DIRECCION.2, 33012 de Oviedo (Asturias), and Mr. B.B.B. notes that
is ***ADDRESS.1, 33012 of Oviedo (Asturias), the truth is that it confirms that the
CUPS is ***CUPS.1, digitally signing the contract in your name where the
previous CUPS, being in force a period of twenty-one days.
The second, and as can be deduced from the recording held by the entity, with
date 02/09/2021, that same third party shows that he wants to give again
the electricity supply is discharged, since he does not know the reason for which he was discharged
October contract. For that reason, that same day he again requested that the
register, in your name, the supply of the house located at ***ADDRESS.1, 33012 of
Oviedo (Asturias), once again associated with CUPS ***CUPS.1. Contract
digitally signed, where the CUPS ***CUPS.1 is also linked to the
address located at ***DIRECTORY.1, 33012 of Oviedo (Asturias), was in force eleven
days.

The invoices that were issued for the time that the contracts were in force were paid.
referred contracts
There was no impersonation of the claimant's identity, nor was there any
register a contract in your name. Therefore, there is no documentation linking him to
an electricity supply contract, nor has any invoice been issued where it appears
as a contract holder. Although, as a result of the described facts resulting from the
contracts made by a third party, whose CUPS refers, precisely, to the
number ***CUPS.1, the electricity supply was registered in his name.

lack of guilt in his actions and, subsidiarily, in the event that he does not
the arguments put forward were taken into account, the penalty was lessened or reduced
initially proposed.
SIXTH: On 12/21/2021, the instructor of the procedure agreed to open
a period of practical tests, agreeing on the following:

The respondent requested on 04/25/2022 an extension of the term granted to present
allegations and a copy of the file, which were attended by the instructor of the
process.

The respondent filed a brief on 05/11/2022 in which he reiterated the allegations
discharged during the procedure and also that in the transferred Proposal no
makes any reference to the fact that the third contracting party signed through a mechanism
digital the particular contracting conditions; that the Agency in its report on
the "Ex officio Inspection Plan on Distance Contracting in Operators of
Telecommunications and Energy Marketers”, recognizes this procedure
to prove the identity of the contracting party and guarantee of the contracts made
by telematic means, considering that we are facing a case of
inconsistency on the part of the Agency when assessing the facts; the absence of
liability in the events that occurred and, subsidiarily, the reduction of the
amount to impose.

EIGHTH: Of the actions carried out in this proceeding, they have been
accredited the following:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST. On 12/10/2020 there is a written entry in the AEPD of the claimant; the
The reasons on which the claim is based are that it has been the subject of an impersonation
of identity to request the portability of the electricity supply contract from a
electricity company to another, using false documentation through the
distributor E-REDES, terminating the contract it had with the company EDP,
having to re-register with said company later.

SECOND. A copy of the claimant's DNI has been provided.

THIRD. The claimant has provided an electricity supply contract signed with the
company EDP, dated 05/27/2013, for the address belonging to the claimant

FOURTH. On 11/05/2020, the claimant sent an e-mail to the distributor E-
REDES indicating that: “The portability of the contract I had with
EDP for my address by an unknown third party who is neither the holder of the contract nor the
owner of the house, I request the name, documentation provided to carry out the
management and company to which the portability has been requested, as indicated in
EDP, said company will invoice the contract days that it has had, I do not know if the
current account charge will be the same as the one in my contract or another one will have been provided.
(…)”
E-REDES responded on 11/25/2020:
“In response to your request with Nº ***REQUEST.1, we inform you that, for
data protection regulations to be able to give you information about the address that we
request you must send us documentation that proves you as the owner of the farm,
deed or, failing that, rental agreement.

We are available for any questions or clarification on our website
www.eredesdistribucion.es or on the customer service telephone number 900.907.003”

There are successive and repeated requests for information made by the claimant
about the identity of the person who had requested the change of marketer with
change of ownership from EDP to another marketer without, according to E-REDES,
will come to reliably prove their legitimacy to access the information
requested.

FIFTH. The claimant filed a claim with the CNMC for the same facts; in
response to the request made by the aforementioned organization E-REDES manifested
that:

“(…)
1. On 10/08/2020 E-Redes received a request from the respondent, nº ***REQUEST.2 for
process on the referred CUPS, a change of marketer without change of owner, to
name of D... (the contractor).
Said request was rejected because the owner of the supply point did not coincide with the
holder in whose name the request for change of marketer was made.
(…)
2. On 10/22/2020, a request was received from the respondent No. ***REQUEST.3 for a change of
marketer with change of owner, in the name of the contracting party, which was activated with

3. On 11/05/2020 the claimant contacted E-REDES by phone to inquire
by the person who requested the change of marketer with a change of owner on the
CUPS ***CUPS.1.
In said call he was informed of the impossibility of providing him with the data required in
compliance with current regulations on data protection.
4. On the same day, the claimant sent an email with the following text:
(reflected in fact 4).
5. On 11/12/2020 E-REDES received a request from EDP ENERGIA, S.A.U., no.

Mrs…. (the claimant), which was activated on 11/15/2020.
(…)”
SIXTH. E-REDES in writing dated 02/18/2021 has stated that: “…which is not E-
REDES who receives the request for change of marketer and ownership, but
that it is the incoming marketer who receives it and who transmits it to me

to be processed."
SEVENTH. The respondent in writing dated 05/24/2021 has indicated that “…that no
There are personal data associated with the claimant in the commercial systems of the
company... That is, a contract has not been registered in your name and, therefore, no
No phishing has occurred.

Although, in relation to the CUPS that appears indicated... as confirmed by the
Responsible for Treatment, it was associated with two contracts carried out
carried out by a third party (that is, they were not associated with the claimant).

Specifically, as is credited…Don B.B.B. (***NIF.1) requested that it be given
registration, in your name, an electricity supply contract for the home located in
***ADDRESS.1, 33012 of Oviedo (Asturias)…”

EIGHTH. There are recordings related to the contracts carried out, in
those that the teleoperator in the contract verification process, when
refers to the address of the supply in the particular domicile of the contracting party, it is
interrupted by it indicating the correct address:

“(…)
Teleoperator: “And we are going to contract for the address ***ADDRESS.3, 33012-
Oviedo (Asturias), the temporary open day rate with CUPS ***CUPS.2.
Then, for the address ***DIRECTION.3, 33012-Oviedo (Asturias), we will contract

owner, the owner of said bank account, right?
C: Yes

In the second of the recordings provided, the contracting party wishes to re-register
discharge in the supply of electricity, not knowing the reason for which it was discharged
the previous contract in force since 10/24/2020.
And in the third of these recordings provided, hiring of 02/09/2021, it happens
the same as in the first (here there is no information on CUPS), figuring the

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that:

 "The
procedures processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed
by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the
regulatory provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they are not
contradict, in the alternative, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures.”

The facts claimed are specified in the impersonation in the contracting of the
electricity supply located at the domicile of the claimant, the true owner of the
home where the CUPS was located, as it was linked to the address
from a third party who had nothing to do with the claimant.

II

Article 58 of the RGPD, Powers, establishes in its section 2:
"two. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or in
instead of the measures mentioned in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case;

(…)”

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of accuracy, pointing out
that:

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)

d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable to eliminate or rectify without delay the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (“accuracy”);

(…)”

What is stated in the aforementioned rule must be put in relation to article 5,
Accuracy of the data, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, of
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter
LOPDGDD), which establishes in section 1 that:

"1. In accordance with article 5.1.d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data will be

accurate and, if necessary, updated.

(…)”

In relation to this principle, in recital 39 of the GDPR, among other

issues it is stated that:

“(39) (…) to ensure that personal data is no longer kept
time than necessary, the data controller must establish deadlines for its
deletion or periodic review. All reasonable steps must be taken to
ensure that inaccurate personal data is rectified or deleted.

And recital 71:

“(71) (...) in order to guarantee a fair and transparent treatment regarding the
concerned, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which
process personal data,
 the data controller must use
appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for profiling,
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure, in particular, that
the factors that introduce inaccuracies in the personal data are corrected and
minimizes the risk of error, secure personal data in such a way that it is

prevent, among other things, discriminatory effects on natural persons for reasons
race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or belief, union membership,
genetic condition or health status or sexual orientation, or treatment that results in
to measures that produce such an effect..." (the underlining corresponds to the AEPD).

III

1. From the documentation in the file it is evident that the
claimed has violated article 5.1.d), principle of accuracy, in relation to the
Article 5 of the LOPGDD, Accuracy of the data, by causing the cancellation of the contract of
electricity supply that the claimant maintained with the company EDP from the
05/27/2013, for the domicile owned by the claimant located at
***ADDRESS.2, in Oviedo (Asturias) and CUPS ***CUPS.1, associating the aforementioned CUPS
to the address of a third party that had nothing to do with the claimant, linking the
CUPS prior to the domicile of the third party located at ***ADDRESS.1, in
Oviedo (Asturias), being used by the claimed party to register the supply
electrical in the latter direction.

Therefore, the obligation derived from article 5.1.d) establishes the need to
that the personal data collected is accurate, and must be adopted in all
time reasonable steps to ensure that the data is not
inaccurate, being those responsible for the treatment who have to answer for the
fulfillment of this obligation.

In this sense, the National High Court indicated in its sentence of
02/27/2008, Appeal 210/2007, <<… The principle of truthfulness or accuracy has great
relevance, insofar as it is not only necessary that the data be collected for its
treatment according to a series of criteria (principle of proportionality) and that
they are used for purposes compatible with those that motivated the collection
(principle of purpose), but also requires that whoever collects and processes personal data
personal character guarantees and protects that the information submitted to treatment is not
inaccurate and up-to-date.

Non-compliance or violation of the principle of truthfulness may have
important consequences for the affected…>>. In relation to the aforementioned article and
its updating (which would be the manifestation of the principle of accuracy that could
understood as non-compliant), requires that "reasonable measures be taken to ensure that
Delete or rectify without delay the personal data that is inaccurate with
regarding the purposes for which they are processed”.

In this regard, article 5.1.d) does not impose the adoption of disproportionate measures
to update the data, but the reasonable ones, taking into account the available means and the
purpose for which the data is used. This is also expressed in recital 39 of the
GDPR.

2. The claimed by the activity that develops, knows the importance of
correctly associate CUPS with the supply contracts it formalises, as well as
the effects that derive from the inaccuracy of this data, for which a
special care about it.

The Supreme Court (Sentences of 04/16 and 04/22/1991) considers that
guilty element follows "... that the action or omission, qualified as an infraction
punishable administratively, must be, in any case, attributable to its author, for
intent or recklessness, negligence or inexcusable ignorance.”

For its part, the National Court, in Judgment of 06/29/2001, in matters of
protection of personal data, has declared that "... the simple
negligence or breach of the duties that the Law imposes on people
responsible for files or data processing to exercise extreme diligence...”.

The Supreme Court has understood that there is imprudence whenever
disregards a legal duty of care, that is, when the offending subject does not
behave with due diligence. Diligence whose degree of demand will be determined
in attention to the concurrent circumstances, such as the special value of the good
legal protection and the professionalism required of the offender. In this sense, the judgment
of 06/05/1998 requires professionals in the sector “...a duty to know
especially the applicable regulations. In similar terms, the
Judgments of 12/17/1997, 03/11/1998, 03/02 and 09/17/1999.

Applying the previous doctrine, the National High Court, in several sentences,
among others, those dated 02/14 and 09/20/2002 and 04/13/2005, requires entities to
special diligence operates in the data market when carrying out the use
or treatment of the same, since it is the protection of a right
of the people to whom these refer, so that their custodians
They must be especially diligent and careful when carrying out operations with
the same and must always opt for the interpretation that is most favorable to the protection
of the legal goods protected by the norm.

In this regard, ENDESA failed to comply with the legal mandate that the data
respond accurately to the situation of those affected, violating the principle
enshrined in article 5.1.d) of the RGPD.

3. It should be noted that the contracting of electricity supply by the
claimed can be carried out through different channels: telephone, Web channel,
distributors, which includes its own sales offices and external stores, security forces
external sales (stands at fairs, shopping centers, etc., or home visits with
prior request), etc.

In the present case, on 10/07/2020, it was requested through the channel
telephone the registration in the electrical supply for the home of the contracting party who was
processed as registration with change of marketer and owner, in accordance with
what is contained in Resolution C2-CNMC.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/18

It should be noted that in accordance with the specific regulations of the electricity sector, the
change of owner and marketer procedure is carried out
exclusively with the intervention of the new marketer (in this case,
ENDESA) since it is the latter that interacts with the new client, manages the change of
owner and marketer and is obliged to collect from the new client the
supporting documentation of being the effective user of the home as well as
keep it at the disposal of the distributor and the Supplier Change Office
(OCSUM)

This matter develops various legal standards, among which it is worth mentioning
Royal Decree 1955/2000, of December 1, which regulates the activities of
transportation, distribution, marketing, supply and authorization procedures
of electrical energy installations, whose article 83 deals with the “Transfer and
subrogation of tariff supply and network access contracts” ; the real
Decree 1011/2009, which regulates the Supplier Change Office, by
entrusted to him among his functions (article 3) the verification of the cash
consent of the consumers to the change of supplier. also the royal
Decree 1435/2002, which regulates the basic conditions of acquisition contracts
of energy and access to low voltage networks, which dedicates its article 7 to the
“Information system of points of supply that must be maintained by the distributor”, the
Third Additional Provision of Royal Decree 1074/2015 and Resolutions of the
National Commission of Markets and Competition.

The protocol for managing a change of marketer with a change of
holder attributes to the incoming marketer the condition of sole interlocutor of the
client and the responsibility of executing all the necessary actions
for change management.

Transferring these considerations to the present case in which
initially blamed E-REDES, this entity did not intervene in the
infringing conduct attributed to him by the claimant.

On the contrary, it is the conduct of the defendant that led to the violation of the
article 5.1.d) of the RGPD, causing the withdrawal of the owner of the electricity supply,
the claimant, who had signed a contract with the company EDP for her home
(ELECTRICITY CUPS ***CUPS.1), registering a third contracting party who lived in
the same building but at a different address, assigning it the same CUPS.

As regards the CUPS number of the claimant's home, this
data is not linked to a person but to a specific dwelling and, furthermore, works in
power of attorney of the area distributor (along with the name, surnames, NIF and address
user of the home) as provided for in Royal Decree 1435/2002, in
its article 7.

The respondent himself in writing on 01/05/2022 has stated that "As
was exposed in the arguments to the Agreement presented on October 28,
2021, the particular gift … requested through the telephone channel, and up to two

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/18

occasions, that the electricity supply was registered in your name, for the CUPS
***CUPS.1 (corresponding to the home of Mrs.
 the claimant
 

 ) …”

 

In addition, the facts also show that on 10/08/2020 E-REDES received the
first request of the respondent to process, on CUPS ***CUPS.1
corresponding to the claimant's home, a change of marketer without
change of owner, in the name of the contracting party and it was rejected for not matching
the owner of the supply point with the owner in whose name the request for
change of vendor.

So. the action contrary to article 5.1.d) of the RGPD must be attributed to
ENDESA, violation of the principle of accuracy that states that the data must be
accurate and up-to-date; infringement of the aforementioned principle that caused CUPS to
linked to the claimant's home was used to register the contract of
supply linked to the home of a third party located in the same building, a fact that
was not exact, which was the reason for the cancellation of the contract that the claimant had signed and
PED in 2013.

4. As it appears in the recordings provided by the respondent regarding
contracts made, it is recorded how the teleoperator refers to the address
of the supply in the private address of the third party and is interrupted, in both cases,
by the contracting party indicating the correct address:

“(…)
And we are going to contract for the address ***ADDRESS.2, 330112-Oviedo

(Asturias).

Contracting: center no, center no, left
Energy Advisor: Left?, ahh okay
C: 7th, left.
AE: It appears as the center, well I'll put it to you like, it's perfect then

i check this, it looked like the one you had before as center

For the address ***DIRECTION.1, 330112-Oviedo (Asturias) we hired the

rate there are 50 hours for CUPS ***CUPS.1

C: very good
AE: and the account number in which we are going to charge the receipts..., from which

you are the owner, the owner of said bank account, right?

C: Yes
(…)”
And in the hiring of 02/09/2021:
T: …and the rate that we are going to contract is the happy 50 hours for the direction

***ADDRESS.2, in Oviedo (Asturias) thirty-three thousand...

C/ Jorge Juan, 6

C: no center no, left door
T: Left?, okay
C: Yes, it's not center, it's left.
T: Here they have you as a center,
C: The same is that error for what they changed ehh?, but it is left
T: It shouldn't because these are data from the distributor
C: Yes, but I'm telling you because there is center left and left only
T: Ok, and yours is left alone
C. That's right
T: Okay, well, then for the direction... that I'll change that for you, I won't
worry, ***ADDRESS.1, in Oviedo (Asturias) 33012 and, then, the number of
account in which we are going to load the receipts…

(…)”
As we pointed out previously, the number of CUPS is a piece of information that is
linked to the home, so the teleoperator at that moment in which
they were verifying the data to proceed with the contracting of the electricity supply
with the contracting party, it should have been diligent, adopting the necessary precautions and guarantees and
pertinent to prevent the CUPS of the claimant's home from being associated with the
contracting party's home because it should be informed that if you changed the address of the
supply, the CUPS number assigned to it had to be different.

It follows from all of the above that the defendant violated article 5.1.d) of the
RGPD that indicates that the data must be exact and, if necessary, updated
(principle of accuracy), basic principle of the data protection regulations of
personal character.

The defendant himself has claimed to recognize that CUPS is a sequence
alphanumeric that is difficult to memorize, as it is personal data
associated with the electricity or gas supply of each home and it is possible to access
to it because it is one of the fields that must always appear in the
invoice; therefore, if the claimant, as can be deduced from the recording, did not have the
bill in front is difficult to understand, as the respondent states that the
teleoperator asked the contracting party to confirm the CUPS ***CUPS.1 and that he
He confirmed it with a “very good”.

Such statement is not true and suffers from excessive voluntarism in light of
the transcript of the recording; nor does it appear that the teleoperator requested
to confirm the other two CUPS that appear in the recording for the address
***ADDRESS.3, 33012-Oviedo (Asturias), ***CUPS.2 and ***CUPS.3, open tempo rate
day and gas rate respectively whose contracts were also formalized.

Moreover, if it is already difficult to memorize a single one of those sequences
alphanumeric letters that CUPS consists of, memorizing three should be considered homework for
chosen.

The respondent has argued that the Proposal does not mention that the third
contracting party signed through a digital mechanism the particular conditions of
contracting and that the Agency in its report on the "Ex officio Inspection Plan
on Distance Contracting in Telecommunications Operators and
Energy Traders”, recognizes this system to accredit contracts
carried out by telematic means, considering that we are facing a case of
inconsistency on the part of the Agency when assessing the facts that here
occupy.

It is true that the Agency has emphasized the need to verify the
procedures used in the telecommunications and energy sectors to
identify the interested persons with the aim of avoiding the impersonation of
identity and the corresponding frauds, as well as the way in which companies
prove the contracting of their services.

However, in the present case the question that is elucidated is the violation
of the principle of accuracy, that is, whether reasonable measures were taken to
ensure that the data was not inaccurate; No if in the contracting carried out
accredited the identity of the interested person, guarantees of
identification of the contractor before carrying out the contract or systems were used
with additional guarantees, etc. but that the conduct of the defendant entailed the
Violation of the regulations on the protection of personal data,
article 5.1.d) of the RGPD, causing the withdrawal of the owner of the electricity supply,
who had a contract with the merchant company EDP for his home (CUPS for electricity
***CUPS.1), registering a third contracting party who lived in the same building but
in a different address, assigning it the same CUPS, so it cannot
allege lack of responsibility for the events that occurred.

The defendant also invokes the reduction of the amount of the sanction

 
reducing it.

In this regard, it should be noted that, taking into account that it is a
infraction classified as very serious and that in accordance with article 83 of the
RGPD can be sanctioned, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount", for which a significant reduction is already applied
Of the same. The STS, Chamber 3, of December 16, 2003 (Rec. 4996/98) already
pointed out that the principle of proportionality of sanctions requires that "the
discretion granted to the Administration for the application of the sanction is
develop weighing in any case the concurrent circumstances, in order to

achieve due proportionality between the alleged facts and the responsibility
required".

Principle of proportionality that is not understood to have been violated, considering
provided the sanction proposed to the entity for the proven facts and
weighing the concurrent circumstances.

Otherwise, the specific circumstances that have been taken into account for the
graduation of the amount of the sanction are detailed in Basis VI of this
resolution.

The infraction that is attributed to the claimed one is typified in the
article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, which considers that the infringement of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the
sanction to be imposed in the present case for the infraction typified in article 83.5.a
of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible, in an initial assessment,
the following factors are considered concurrent:

Aggravating circumstances are considered:

- The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement: the facts considered
tested seriously affect a basic principle relating to data processing
of a personal nature, such as the accuracy and updating of data, if, as the
damages caused as a result of interference in the sphere of
privacy of the claimant because we must not forget that we are facing the
infringement of a fundamental right to the protection of personal data; the
claimant was forced to contact the distribution company as a result
of the leave produced and being deprived of the contractual relationship that it had with its
supplier company since 05/27/2013, in addition to having to process the
high in it; file a claim with the National Commission of Markets and
of Competition and before the AEPD for the same facts (article 83.2, a) of the
GDPR). .

- The way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

the extent to which this has been through the claim of the affected party.

- The degree of responsibility of the claimed party and the measures implemented to
to prevent similar incidents from occurring, because despite the fact that the claimed
declares to have a procedure that regulates the updating of the data that
come from the SIPS (Supply Points Information System) specifically
of the CUPS of the houses, has not been able to avoid events such as those that have given rise to
to this claim with the damages caused to the claimant (article
83.2, d) of the GDPR).

- The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the
data processing of both customers and third parties. In the activity of the entity
claimed, it is essential to process the personal data of your
customers so, given the volume of business of the same, the importance of the
conduct object of this claim is undeniable (article 76.2.b) of the
LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

- Although it cannot be argued that the defendant has acted
intentionally, there is no doubt that there is a serious lack of diligence in
his performance. Connected to the degree of diligence that the data controller
is obliged to deploy in the fulfillment of the obligations imposed by the
data protection regulations, the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited. Although it was
dictated before the validity of the RGPD, its pronouncement is perfectly
extrapolated to the case we are analyzing. The ruling, after alluding to the fact that the
entities in which the development of their activity entails a continuous treatment of
customer data and third parties must observe an adequate level of diligence,
specified that “(...) the Supreme Court has understood that there is imprudence
whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

17/18

behaves with due diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence,
especially weigh the professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that,
in the case now examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and
abundant handling of personal data, it must be insisted on the rigor and
exquisite care to comply with the legal provisions in this regard” (article 83.2,
b) of the RGPD).

- The volume of business of the claimant is one of the leading companies

within the Spanish market, due to its business purpose (article 83.2, k) of the RGPD).

- The continuing nature of the infringement: it should be noted that the infringement of the
principle of accuracy, as a consequence of contracting for the point of
supply linked to the claimant's home occurred on 10/07/2020, but the
02/09/2021 the electricity supply for the residence of the
contracting party, incurring the same error, proceeding to contract (article
76.2.a) of the LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

Extenuating circumstances are considered:

- Only one person has been affected by the offending conduct.

Based on these factors, it is considered appropriate to propose a sanction of

€50,000.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE ENDESA ENERGÍA, S.A.U. with NIF A81948077 for a
