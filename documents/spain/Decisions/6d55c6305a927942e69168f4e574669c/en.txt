identifiable, not only with respect to such professionals but also for the rest of the
citizens who can access this information as long as it is not about

III

In this proceeding, the defendant is charged with the failure to apply
technical and organizational measures necessary to guarantee a level of security
adequate to prevent the violation of the principle of confidentiality in the treatment
of personal data of the citizens who are attended, in offices and spaces
of shared use, by professionals of the department of social services of the
CDCH.

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:

(…)
b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

c) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and

of the duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

3. The obligations established in the previous sections will remain
even when the relationship of the obligor with the person in charge or person in charge had ended

In this case, it is accredited that the information of a nature
personal and intimate that has been treated in offices or spaces of use
shared by CDCH professionals, and concerning natural persons
applicants or beneficiaries of the social services provided in said center, has
result accessible to third parties present in those shared spaces in
their condition, also, as users of such services. In this way the attention
simultaneously to citizens in offices shared by several professionals has not
guaranteed the confidentiality of personal information concerning
users of those services, since their personal data, together with information
referred to aspects of his intimate and family life, have been accessible to the rest of
people served in these spaces of common use.

Notwithstanding the existence of difficulties arising from the lack of
availability of sufficient facilities to be able to serve in offices
individuals the increase in the demand for social services produced in recent
years, as well as the incidence that the lack of resources poses on its resolution.
economic, there is no doubt that in the offices or spaces shared by
professionals of the CDCH there has been a treatment of data concerning the
natural persons requesting or receiving social services that has violated the
principle of confidentiality, and that brought cause of the lack of adoption and
implementation by the respondent of the necessary security measures
to prevent the personal information processed by the professionals of the
center in said dependencies, including aspects that affected privacy
personal or family members of the citizens served, could be known by third parties
users of those services present in those shared spaces.

The respondent, in his capacity as responsible for said treatment, should
have applied, proactively, the technical and organizational measures that
were appropriate to assess and guarantee an adequate level of security for the
probable risks of diverse nature and seriousness linked to the types of

principle of confidentiality. For these purposes, it is recalled that articles 24.1 of the
RGPD establishes the following regarding the obligations to be fulfilled by the person in charge
of the treatment:

freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply measures

processing is in accordance with this Regulation. These measures will be reviewed and
They will update when necessary.”

It is also stated in the procedure that this common use of spaces by
various professionals has been taking place in said center, as can be deduced from
the reports submitted to the procedure, at least in the last four years, and has
continued happening until the second fortnight of July 2019, moment from
of which, and taking advantage of his return from vacation, the incorporation of
six professionals from the CDCH to the center located in c/ Fuente Nueva. East
move, in turn, will facilitate the redistribution of spaces in the CDCH, allowing
transform offices for common or shared use into spaces for individual use
once the painting tasks and replacement of the pavement of the center have been completed,
early September 2019, without prejudice to the fact that said individual use
of dispatches has already been taking place at the CDCH since the beginning of July
taking advantage of the greater availability of the same due to the enjoyment of the period
holiday by the professionals who provide services in the center.
