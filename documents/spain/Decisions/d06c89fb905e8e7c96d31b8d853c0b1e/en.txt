complete the "Privacy Policy" of its web pages with the inclusion of the
required information as established in article 13 of the RGPD.

evidence available at that time, it was considered that it did not contradict

SIXTH: Notified to the respondent party, the initiation of the file on 12/13/21, to
today's date, there is no record that the respondent has made any kind of
allegations to the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure.

In this sense, article 64.2.f) of the LPACAP -provision reported by the
claimed in the agreement to open the procedure- establishes that, "if no

vacidad” and its “Cookies Policy”:

a).- On the non-existence of an acceptance box, which generates a record
of consent in the forms of the websites.

Once the personal data has been entered in the "contact" form, there is no
chair of acceptance of the privacy policy, being able to send personal data
directly by clicking on <<send>>, therefore, there is no possibility of realizing
consent through a clear affirmative act or the possibility of carrying out
a specific consent for each treatment purpose.

b).- About the “Privacy Policy” of the websites:

In the three claimed web pages, personal data can be obtained from the
users through the “contact” tab, such as name and email,

consulted pages, being able to send personal data directly by clicking
in <<send>>. Nor is there, on this page of the form, any link that
can redirect the user to the "Privacy Policy".

About the "privacy policies", on the pages: ***URL.1 and ***URL.2 there is a

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I.- Competition:
 

- About the "Privacy Policy":

It is competent to initiate and resolve this Sanctioning Procedure, the Director of
the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, by virtue of the powers that art 58.2
of the RGPD and arts. 47, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD Law.

- About the Cookies Policy:

It is competent to initiate and resolve this Sanctioning Procedure, the Director of
the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of the
art. 43.1, second paragraph, of Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Services of the
Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI).

II.- On the non-existence of an acceptance box, which generates a record of the con-
feeling in the web forms.

Article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, establishes, on the legality of data processing
personal, that the treatment of these will only be lawful if at least one of the
the conditions indicated in point 1, among which are: a) the interested party
gave your consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more
specific purposes (…)”.

Before providing personal data and giving consent to their processing,
It would be desirable that the interested party be recommended to read and understand the privacy policy.
emptiness Also, it would be considered good practice to remind the user of their choice
of permissions and request a confirmation of your consent, in the same way that
many times a second confirmation is requested when the user unsubscribes from
an online service or advertising communications.

Thus, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation”.

This infraction may be sanctioned according to the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the
RGPD, where it is established that: “Infringements of the following provisions are
shall be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000
EUR maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount: a) the rights of the interested parties to
tenor of articles 12 to 22”.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed,
by violating the provisions of its article 6.1 of the RGPD, it allows to set a sanction of
1,000 euros, (one thousand euros).

paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, significant information about the logic
applied, as well as the importance and expected consequences of said treatment
for the interested party”.

Privacy” therefore, in accordance with the evidence obtained, the facts
exposed suppose the violation of article 13 of the RGPD.

Regarding this, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers it very serious, for
of prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment
of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed
by violating the provisions of article 13, allows a fine of 1,000 euros to be set,
(a thousand euros).

Therefore, in accordance with the criteria set out in the previous points, the sanction
total to be imposed is 2,000 euros (two thousand euros), for infractions of the articles,
