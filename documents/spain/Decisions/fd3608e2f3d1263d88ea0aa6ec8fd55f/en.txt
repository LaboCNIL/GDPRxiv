FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

FIRST: By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

SECOND: Before going into the substance of the matter, the formative question must be resolved.
poorly raised by the investigated entity in its pleadings brief.

The investigated entity alleges that it is completely defenseless with respect to
the facts and reasons that have supported the opening of this proceeding
sanctioning party, since they were not aware of the challenge to the file of
proceedings, that is, the appeal for reversal filed, the extension writ
of the aforementioned appeal dated February 12, 2021 and its corresponding resolution
dated February 26, 2021, in order to allege what he would have deemed convenient.

In the first place, as the reiterated jurisprudence of the Supreme Court indicates (for all
das, Judgments of the Supreme Court of October 17, 1991 and October 21,
1980) and the doctrine of the Council of State (Opinions 6,175/1997, of February 19
from 1998; 1/1998, of May 21; 3,170/1998, of July 30, and 2,301/1998, of July 10,
September, among many others), the mere omission of a procedure, even if it were mandatory
tive, it does not necessarily constitute by itself a vice of nullity in its own right.

Not even the simple omission of the hearing procedure gives rise, "always and autonomously"
tomatic”, to nullity for this reason; in this regard, the Supreme Court, in Sen-
judgment of October 17, 1991, demanded “to weigh, in each case, the consequences
produced by such omission to the interested party, the lack of defense that really
originated and, above all, what could have changed the original administrative act.
in case the omitted procedure has been observed”.

This is how the Council of State has ruled in its Opinions 6,175/1997, of 19
February 1998, 1/1998, of May 21, 1949/2000, of June 22, 2132/2000, of
July 20, 612/2001, of April 5, and 1,224/2001, of June 7, among others. In certain
undermined circumstances, when a careful examination of the file makes it possible to exclude
that the omission of the hearing procedure has caused defenselessness to the interested parties,
such omission may not give rise to a nullity defect.

In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in Judgment 144/1996, of September 16,
he states that "in an administrative procedure what is truly decisive
is if the subject has been able to allege and prove what he deems convenient in the as-
essential aspects of the conflict in which it is immersed”.

As the Supreme Court Judgment of February 27, 1993 warns, "There is no
claim the nullity of the act because the lack of notification, even if it had existed
does not affect the validity of the uncommunicated decision, but exclusively its effectiveness
with respect to the specific recipient of the notification procedure and this on condition, for
certain, that from the omission or formal defects when practicing it, a
effective defenselessness for the same; nor would the act be null, according to
that other article invoked, when the procedure is totally dispensed with.
established procedure for making the decision; not to notify her."

Thus, notification constitutes a requirement for the effectiveness of administrative acts and does not
of validity, so it is unfounded to advocate the invalidity of administrative acts.
nistrative due to defects in the notification of those (For all, the Opinions of this
Advisory Council 429/2014, of September 18, or 251/2018, of July 11).
In the specific case under examination, it is known that there has been the opening of a
sanctioning procedure, without a hearing procedure having been given to the entity
investigated, by not having given notice of the motion for reversal filed, in order to
allege what he would have considered convenient, as determined in article 118 of the
Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP), which states the following:

“Article 118. Hearing of the interested parties.

1. When new facts or documents not collected must be taken into account
in the original file, the interested parties will be made clear so that, in
a period of not less than ten days nor more than fifteen, make the allegations and present
present the documents and supporting documents that they deem appropriate.

They will not be taken into account in the resolution of appeals, facts, documents or
arguments of the appellant, when having been able to contribute them in the process of
tions have not. Nor can the practice of tests be requested when your
lack of performance in the procedure in which the appealed decision was issued was
attributable to the interested party.

2. If there are other interested parties, they will be given, in any case, transfer of the resource to

that, within the aforementioned period, they allege whatever they deem appropriate.

3. The appeal, the reports and the proposals do not have the character of documents
new for the purposes of this article. Neither will those who are interested
already contributed to the file before the contested resolution was handed down.”

In view of the actions in the file, it is concluded that
in the case under examination, the investigated entity did not receive the transfer of the
replacement filed, depriving him of the possibility of formulating allegations, and
Given that such data is essential in order to defend the interested party, it is appropriate,
in accordance with the provisions of article 119 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations, annul the
actions carried out and replace them at the time the defect occurred
procedural; however, taking into account that the alleged infringement would be
prescribed two years after its alleged commission, given that the procedure
sanctioning party in this case has not interrupted the limitation period, it is appropriate
archive this procedure, in order to comply with the principles of
efficiency, rationalization and agility of administrative procedures, in accordance
with article 3 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector
Public.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
