PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: Dissemination of the email addresses of each member of the
staff meeting of the claimant's workplace, by sending emails with the certificate of
meetings of the board to corporate emails of unions and collectives without
legitimation for its reception, as well as to third parties that do not belong to the board of
staff.

SECOND: The defendant alleges the non-existence of the infraction as it belongs to the
claimant to a trade union organization, and treat such emails as
labor sphere.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

Yo

Article 4.11 of the GDPR defines the consent of the interested party as "all
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
The interested party accepts, either through a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data concerning you”.

In this sense, article 6.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes that "in accordance with the
provided in article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent is understood to
of the affected party, any manifestation of free, specific, informed and incompetent will.
equivocal by which he accepts, either by means of a declaration or a clear action
affirmatively, the processing of personal data concerning him”.
For its part, article 6 of the GDPR establishes the following:
"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
nes:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person;
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;
 f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said interests
the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party do not prevail.
that require the protection of personal data, particularly when the interest
sado be a child
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

II

In the present case, the complaining party denounces the defendant party because of
emails have been repeatedly forwarded to other members and
non-members of the staff board of which he is a member and to corporate emails of
unions and collectives without legitimacy or consent on the part of the claimant.

It has entry in the AEPD, a document presented on behalf of FSP-UGT,
where two aspects are revealed, on the one hand the corporate nature of the
email account object of this assumption (***EMAIL.14), which means that its use is
is strictly related to the professional scope of the personnel board
from the workplace”.

Second, it is alleged that the emails denounced by the claimant
have been sent from an email account (***EMAIL.15) that is not
property of FeSP-UGT, and it is indicated that this aspect had already been warned to the
UGT workers.

Printing of a "Reminder to workers" dated January 15,
2020 which indicates, among other things, the following:

"Therefore, any email that is sent by any of the
workers of this Federation from an unauthorized or unofficial address not
will be considered the responsibility of this body, and measures may be adopted
individuals that correspond against the issuers.”

This being the case, it seems that the FSP-UGT is exempted from all responsibility, but it is not
the one claimed, since the issuance of emails on the 16th and 17th of
February 2021 and March 16, 2021, despite the claimant's request that
stop forwarding your email address to third parties.

The defendant in the brief of allegations of June 30, 2022, requests retroaction of
the actions for not having received the information request dated 2
February 2022.

In this sense, we must indicate that the actions carried out in the month of February
These are preliminary actions that are carried out in accordance with article 65.4 of the
LOPDGDD, carried out prior to the start of the disciplinary procedure.

For this reason, defenselessness can only be considered in the event that once the
initiation agreement, and not before, the defendant would not have been able to exercise the rights
that Law 39/2015 of common administrative procedure confers on it in all
disciplinary procedure, such as the right to know the facts that are
charged and to be able to present arguments and evidence, or exercise their right to
audience.

As we are not in any of these cases, retroaction does not proceed
of the performances.

Secondly, the defendant resorts to article 9 of the GDPR, justifying that the
Data processed is union affiliation and was disseminated in a workplace.

However, it is considered that the processing of the personal data of the claimant
has been excessive because the emails that are the subject of this claim were
they also referred people outside the personnel board, and more when possible
its omission with the use of tools such as blind copy, when it has been required
by the owner of that personal data that it is not used when expressing
expressly that you do not consent to the processing of your email, in the exercise of
your right to object.

Therefore, it is considered that we are dealing with an illegal processing of personal data,
by sending emails to other members and non-members of the board of
personnel of which the claimant is a member, and to corporate emails from unions and
collective, incurring in a violation of article 6 of the GDPR, indicated in the
basis of law II, since the personal data have been processed without counting
with no legitimacy.

IV.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to impose we must take into account article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, where
indicates that "violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to
according to paragraph 2, with administrative fines of EUR 20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount:

  a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

after three years, the infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the
articles mentioned therein and in particular, the following:

b) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

"Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
