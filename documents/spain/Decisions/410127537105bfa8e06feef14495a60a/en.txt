the largest amount: (...)

b) The rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22;”.
For its part, article 71 of the LOPDGDD establishes that "They constitute
infractions the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
this organic law.”, establishing in article 72.1.h) of said Law that:

In the case at hand, a sanctioning procedure was initiated for
warning to the defendant for installing a camera for traffic control purposes to
the height of the road of that City Council that is cited in Proven Fact First without
place an informative sign of an area subject to traffic video surveillance, whenever
that the documentation available at that procedural moment revealed
that the aforementioned camera, apparently, collected images of the license plates of the
vehicles circulating in the area controlled by the camera, conduct that could
constitute an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.b) of the
GDPR.

However, the defendant in his pleadings brief disputes that
produced a treatment of personal data through the camera object of study
that entailed the obligation to signpost the video-surveillance area by means of posters
informative. Affirms that the actual operation of the technical device and the purpose of
capturing images “was only to record the flow of traffic by counting it in order to
prove to the regional authorities the need to split the
regional highway ***CARRETERA.1 as it passes” through the town.

In support of its statements, it provides a technical report issued on the date
November 22, 2018 by the company LECTOR VISION, S.L., in which it is indicated
that the device under test “TrafficEye” was installed in order to perform the latest
adjustments with real traffic of its new product “TRAFFICGUARD”, whose objective “is the
development of complex algorithms based on artificial vision in order to carry out
efficiently carry out the counting and classification of vehicles by type (motorcycles,
cars and trucks/buses) in adverse weather conditions”.

This report indicates that for each transit an ".xml file" is generated to
based on the analysis carried out with vehicle counting and classification data
from the captured images, which are deleted 24 hours after
your pick up. The document incorporates a capture printout of a “.xml file”
generated on October 23, 2018 as a result of the analysis carried out with the data
collected from the transit of a vehicle that was captured at 12:24
minutes and 36 seconds of that day, and among which the license plate is not found
of the vehicle, (Fifth Proven Fact of this resolution).

Starting from the purpose for which the aforementioned camera was used until 11
February 2019, the date on which it was withdrawn, and without prejudice to the various functionalities
that the device under test "TrafficEye" can develop in relation to the control
and traffic management, it should be noted that of the actions carried out in the
In this sanctioning procedure, no evidence has been obtained that
allow to certify, irrefutably, that the camera integrated in the device
installed in the aforementioned place has captured images containing

information regarding the license plates of the vehicles circulating on said road,
information, which, moreover, was not necessary to obtain for the purpose of counting
and classification claimed by the respondent.

The foregoing must be connected with the validity in our
Sanctioning Administrative Law of the principle of presumption of innocence
recognized in article 24.2 of the Spanish Constitution, so that the exercise of
The sanctioning power of the State, in its various manifestations, is
conditioned to the game of evidence and to a contradictory procedure in which
can defend their own positions. The principle of presumption of innocence
prevents imputing an administrative infraction when it has not been obtained and verified
a charge evidence that proves the facts that motivate the imputation or the
intervention in the same of the alleged offender.

The Constitutional Court (SSTC 131/2003 and 242/2005, for all) has
pronounced in this sense when indicating that one of the requirements inherent to the right
to the presumption of innocence is that the sanction is based on acts or means
evidence of charge or incriminating of the imputed behavior and that falls on the
