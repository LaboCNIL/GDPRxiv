mobile, although my NIF appeared on both invoices, they were in the name of another person and
other address: 28-c820-753850 and 28-c820-798362 and corresponded to mobile lines
of a new contracted fusion rate (I enclose a copy of both). Before hiring
this rate, movistar had all my personal data, since both the fixed line and
the mobiles had been in my name for years. Another invoice issued that month,
corresponding to my fixed line and internet of the same fusion product, if I had my
correct data. It seems that Movistar crossed my data with the data of another
subscriber, who mistakenly included in my invoice, therefore, not only the invoices
were incorrect, but personal data of another subscriber was transferred to me. In view of

authorized for such access. Once I detected it I made the corresponding
claim before Telefónica and this was NOT duly attended to. I made the
corresponding claim before Telefónica that was NOT duly attended to.

Contrary to its claims, Telefónica has reoffended months after it was detected
and reported the incident. In his telephone answer he refers to the claim for
my filed before the OMIC of the Town Hall of Torrelodones, and that in its answer to the
06/22/18 to the same already claimed the correction of my data. However, in my
response to the OMIC I already reflected that this was not true, for example, on 10/12/18 (7
months after the error occurred and my first complaint to Telefónica) the
data that appeared on the web continued to be incorrect.

Nor do I consider Telefónica's answer to be true, since, although I have received
through the organizations before which I have filed my claim, a copy of the
payment invoices that would mean the beginning of the aforementioned cancellation. are you from
new had an incorrect name and mailing address as of issue date 08/16/18,
so YES that the error was repeated. 5 months after detection and
claimed the incidence, have been sent to the wrong person and address that
appears in them, communicating again my personal and billing data
to an unauthorized person. Present two invoices, with the following information:

the four invoices issued does not correspond to the personal data of the
recurrent".

SEVENTH: In view of the reported facts, in accordance with the evidence
that is available, the Data Inspection of this Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data considers that the treatment of personal data that is carried out by the
