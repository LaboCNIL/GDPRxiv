FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

II

The defendant was charged with the commission of an infraction for violation of article
5.1.c) of the RGPD, considering that it has installed at least 5 cameras, in various areas
around what would be an access service in STREET ***ADDRESS.1 next to
***DIRECTION.2 thus capturing images of this and exterior areas.

Article 5 section 1 of the RGPD “Principles related to treatment” provides that:
“Personal data will be:

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed (“data minimization”).

This article establishes the principle of data minimization in the treatment of
personal information. It assumes that said treatment is adjusted and proportional to the

purpose to which it is directed, and the treatment of excessive data must be restricted
or proceed to delete them.

The relevance in the processing of the data must occur both in the field of
collection of the data as well as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out on them.

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems
installed comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with
all the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory sign
informative, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment in your case of the data
of a personal nature.

Article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that:

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
understood fulfilled by placing an informative device instead
sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information."

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding
intimidate neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as control areas
transit of the same without just cause.

Nor can images of public spaces be obtained with this type of device,
as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards a private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, which are seen
intimidated by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install sections for obtaining images
of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

This infringement is typified in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, a provision that establishes:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, choosing the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

III

On 01/28/2022, a written statement of allegations is received from the respondent, which denies the
facts, arguing that the video surveillance system "is installed in
private space, in the accesses or entrances, facade and in private space / land of
private property”, an end that is documented.

Likewise, it indicates that “it is not capturing disproportionate images, they are
proportionate insofar as it is confined to the private sphere”. Proof of this is the
screen print of what the cameras capture, where you can see that
focus on the private space of the claimant. Well, two of them are masked,
that prevents the capture of images of the adjoining farms.

It should be noted that article 28.7 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (LPACAP, in
forward) provides: "The interested parties will be responsible for the veracity of the
documents they present.

On the contrary, it has not been proven that there is currently a service of
access that runs through the land indicated by the claimant.

IV

Based on all of the above, it can be concluded that it has not been proven that the facts
object of transfer constitute an administrative infraction in the matter that we
occupies. The defendant has documented that the security cameras
video surveillance are not only installed on land owned by you, but,
In addition, they are addressed to their private space and have masks of
privacy that make it impossible to capture images of the adjoining farms.

Therefore, according to the above,
 
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure as there is no
accredited the commission of the administrative infraction object of claim.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the claimant and the respondent.
