FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authori-
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the Organic Law
3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights
(LOPDGD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is responsible for
te to start and resolve this procedure.

II

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must preside over the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality”. The provision provides:

"1. The personal data will be:
 (…)
  f) Treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing,
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational (<<integrity and confidentiality>>)”.

Article 5.2. RGPD establishes: “The data controller will be
responsible for compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and capable of

demonstrate it (<<proactive responsibility>>)”

The principle of integrity established in article 5.1.f) RGPD is developed through
through articles 32 to 34 RGPD, framed in section II of chapter IV that
It bears the heading “Security of personal data”. Article 32, “Security of the
treatment," he says:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the na-
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of proba-
variable liability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and organizational measures
appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which in its case
include, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and re-
permanent silence of treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data
promptly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness

III

The conduct of the respondent that determined the opening of this file
sanctioning is the omission of the security measures necessary to guarantee the
confidentiality of the personal data subject to treatment, given that,
in the “LOPDGDD Infringement Act” that the claimant has sent us, the officials
acting officials verified that in a local of the claimed association there were numerous
rous documents with personal data - photocopies of DNI, passports and cards

any user or partner”.

This behavior of claimed evidences that it did not adopt the organizational measures

do 39 of the RGPD when it says "...Personal data must be treated in a way that
guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of personal data, including
sive to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data”.

In the same sense, Recital 74 of the RGPD indicates that "It must be
established the responsibility of the person in charge of the treatment for any treatment
of personal data made by himself or on his behalf. In particular, the
sable must be obliged to apply timely and effective measures and must be able to
show compliance of processing activities with this Regulation,
including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures must take into account the nature

In accordance with the evidence available in this sanction file,
tion, the known facts constitute a violation of article 32.1.
RGPD, in relation to article 5.1.f) RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) RGPD,
which states:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 10,000,000 Euros or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a)

the obligations of the person in charge and of the person in charge in accordance with the articles
8,11, 25 to 39,42 and 43;”.

The art. 77 section 5 of Law 39/2015 (October 1) provides the following:

"5. The documents formalized by the officials who are recognized as
condition of authority and in which, observing the corresponding legal requirements,
teeth the facts verified by those are collected will prove them except
that the contrary be proven” (*bold belongs to this body).

A copy of the Inspection Report dated 02/07/21 is provided (Annex I claim)
where in the “Observations” section it is stated, in the opinion of the acting force, the
presence of various documents with personal data that do not meet the
security measures required for this type of data, being easily
“observable” by any person who enters the establishment subject to
research.

Regarding the statute of limitations for this infraction, we will have to be at the
provisions of the (LOPDGDD). Article 73, f) LOPDGDD qualifies as a serious infringement
“The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that are appropriate
to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of treatment in the

terms required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”. Article 73
LOPDGDD provides that serious infractions will have a statute of limitations of
two years.

v

Article 58.2 RGPD attributes to the control authorities the following powers:

corrective res:

“(...)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

c)...
d) order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period;

(...)
i) Impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of
of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of
each particular case;

(...)”

Despite the sanction of a fine that article 83.4 RGPD sets for infractions
pified in said precept, Considering 148 of the RGPD indicates: “In case of in-
minor fraction, or if the fine likely to be imposed constituted a burden
disproportionate for a natural person, instead of sanctioning by means of a fine,
impose a warning. However, special attention must be paid to the nature
nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction, its intentional nature, the measures
taken to mitigate the damages and losses suffered, to the degree of responsibility or to
any previous relevant infringement, to the way in which the supervisory authority has
had knowledge of the infraction, to comply with the measures ordered against the
responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of conduct and any other cir-
aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

It is recalled that a new finding of any "irregularity" in
of data protection, may lead to the opening of a new sanctioning procedure.
