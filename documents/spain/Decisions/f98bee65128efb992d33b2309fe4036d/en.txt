 The image is a personal data

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the RGPD defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

The images generated by a camera or video camera system are data from
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to the protection regulations
of data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the reported video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the legalization of the
treatment of personal data.

III

 alleged infringement

Regarding the treatment for video surveillance purposes, article 22 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out the processing of images through camera systems or video cameras
in order to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as their
installations.

The processing of personal data is subject to the rest of the principles of the
treatment contained in article 5 of the RGPD. We will highlight the principle of
minimization of data contained in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD that provides that the
personal data will be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
for the purposes for which they are processed”.

This means that in a specific treatment only the data can be processed.
timely personal, that come to the case and that are strictly necessary
to fulfill the purpose for which they are processed. The treatment must be adjusted and
proportional to the purpose to which it is directed. The relevance in the treatment of
data must occur both at the time of data collection and in the
subsequent treatment of the same.

In accordance with the above, the processing of excessive data must be restricted or
proceed to their removal.

The application of the principle of data minimization in the field of video surveillance
entails that images cannot be captured from public roads, since the
treatment of images in public places, unless authorized
governmental, can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Bodies.

On some occasions, for the protection of private spaces, where
installed cameras on facades or inside, it may be necessary to ensure the
security purpose the recording of a portion of the public highway.

That is, cameras and video cameras installed for security purposes may not
obtain images of public roads unless it is essential for that purpose, or
it is impossible to avoid it due to their location. And in that case

Installed cameras cannot get images from third-party proprietary space
and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can they affect
the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the area.

It is not allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of
neighbors with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without cause
justified.

Nor can images be captured or recorded in spaces owned by third parties.
without the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the people who

Likewise, it is disproportionate to capture images in private spaces, such
such as changing rooms, lockers or worker rest areas.
 

 Video surveillance obligations

IV

In this sense, article 22 of the LOPDGDD provides in relation to video surveillance
a system of “layered information”.

The first layer must refer, at least, to the existence of the treatment

provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD and where to obtain more information about the
treatment of personal data.

This information will be contained in a device placed in a sufficiently

Second layer information should be readily available in one place
accessible to the affected party, whether it is an information sheet at a reception, cashier, etc...,
placed in a visible public space or in a web address, and must refer to the
rest of the elements of article 13 of the RGPD.

4.- The treatment of images through the installation of camera systems or
video cameras must be lawful and comply with the principle of proportionality and that of
minimization of data, in the terms already indicated.

5.- The images may be kept for a maximum period of one month, except in

reference article 30.1 of the RGPD.

7.- The person in charge must carry out a risk analysis or, where appropriate, an evaluation

of the video surveillance system, assess them and, where appropriate, adopt the measures of
appropriate security.

cameras for security purposes, whenever there is a risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, you must notify the AEPD within a maximum period of
72 hours.

A security breach is understood as the accidental or accidental destruction, loss or alteration of
illicit of personal data transmitted, conserved or treated in another way, or the
unauthorized communication or access to said data.

9.- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
