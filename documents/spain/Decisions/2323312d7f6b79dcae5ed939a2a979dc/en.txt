allegations indicates that he stopped exercising the activity, the vehicle continued under said
ownership, remembering that even this was not an obstacle for him to pay the sanction

It must be taken into account that in the registry of vehicles accessed by the Forces and

2016/679.”
In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of a fine
to impose in the present case for the infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, of
which the defendant is held responsible, are considered concurrent as aggravating the
following factors that reveal greater unlawfulness and/or culpability in the conduct of the
reclaimed:

-Article 83.2.b) GDPR. “Intentionality or negligence in the infringement”: Aspect that is
evidenced by the responses of the local police in evidence, and that relates the
execution of the action with the subject, in the sense of not only imputability of the infraction to
responsible, but the fact of being able to aggravate or reduce the sanction according to the degree of
culpability. In this specific case, the defendant has denied to this AEPD that he is the author of the
identification, but when the agents asked for explanations, the sanction was annulled
claimant and the procedure was started again in which he identified himself as
driver of the vehicle at the time of the offence, denoting an open
intentionality in giving these data consistent in that he did not have a qualifying title to designate
the data of the claimant as driver of the vehicle and author of the infraction when providing
your data to the Police to manage the fine.

As a mitigating factor:

-Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD: "The link between the offender's activity and the
carrying out personal data processing.”, since due to the corporate purpose of the
claimed, no habitual, continuous or important treatment is assumed for
amount or type of data handled.

As a balance of the circumstances, it is considered that the amount of the penalty is 4,000
euros.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the graduation criteria
of the sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE MACASVER S.L., with CIF B09416306, for an infraction of the
article 5.1.d) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, and in 72.1.a) of the
LOPDGDD, a fine of 4,000 euros.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to MACASVER S.L.

THIRD: Warn the sanctioned person that he must make the imposed sanction effective once
that this resolution is enforceable, in accordance with the provisions of art. 98.1.b)
