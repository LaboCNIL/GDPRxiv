manifest the attack carried out by the Group ***GRUPO.1 to the servers of the page
VOX website and access to data of some 30,000 users.

In the news it is reported that the La Nueve group has posted on its Twitter account
(***ACCOUNT.1) the attack on the VOX website and the information to which it has had access,
On the other hand, VOX has also published on its Twitter account (***ACCOUNT.2) the
existence of the attack and that it has been brought to the attention of the Forces and Bodies
of State Security.

TWO.- On 12/13/2018, the Data Inspection verified the
existence of a "tweet" signed by ***ACCOUNT.1 where access to
30,000 VOX registrations and a page with the name and surname data is published
partially anonymized.

THREE.- VOX proceeded to disable the attacked equipment and report the incident
to the AEPD, on 12/13/2018 and to file a complaint with the Civil Guard on
December 14th.

FOUR.- On 12/14/2018 at 8:36 p.m., a message was communicated to all its members
indicating the attack suffered on the web.

FIVE.- In the S21Sec Report that VOX commissioned to analyze the causes that
caused the security incident, the following is indicated:
  A basic automated security scan has been done and 22
vulnerabilities in total, being 1 of a serious nature and 2 of a medium nature, which have
been forwarded to their managers for correction.

• A basic analysis of the source code of the server application has been carried out,
finding several serious confirmed vulnerabilities that need to be fixed and
that in general have to do with the validation of input parameters, and that
must be corrected as soon as possible.

• Some security deficiencies have been detected, which are included in the
section of recommendations, and which are considered particularly important
articulate as soon as possible, since the server's profile is considered high risk.

One of the vulnerabilities that has been ruled serious “could allow a
attacker recover username and password by intercepting an existing connection”.

The report describes the vulnerability as “application does not check parameters
of entry and can be used to infect users and for session theft”.

•S21Sec concludes that, although it has not been possible to guarantee one hundred percent the
tools used by the attackers, consider that it could have been a
SQL injection via system vulnerabilities and possible directory access
www.aepd.es
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es

6/13

of the old web server in which backups of the web could have been dumped with
data to which the attackers had access.

•S21Sec recommends a series of technical measures and perform an analysis in
depth of the web since it considers that it will continue to be the target of campaigns
hacking and espionage.
SIX.- On 06/13/2019, VOX provides a document containing the measures
adopted in the wake of the S21Sec report.
SEVEN.- On 10/12/2019, VOX presented two reports from the HADOQ entities
IT, S.L, and SERVYTEC NETWORKS, S.L., which show that they have
the detected vulnerabilities have been solved and an optimal level of
security.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

The Director of the Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the
RGPD and in the art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.
II

Article 4.12 of the RGPD establishes that it is considered “violation of the security of the
personal data”: any breach of security that results in the destruction, loss
or accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or
otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.
Article 33.1 of the RGPD establishes the following:

In case of violation of the security of personal data, the person in charge
of the treatment will notify it to the competent control authority in accordance with
Article 55 without undue delay and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after
who was aware of it, unless it is unlikely that such violation
constitutes a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical. If the notification to the supervisory authority does not take place within the period of 72
hours, must be accompanied by an indication of the reasons for the delay.

From the actions carried out, it can be deduced that VOX informed this
Spanish Agency for Data Protection, the day after the violation occurred
of personal data, complying with the provisions of article 33.1 of the
GDPR.

Article 32 of the RGPD establishes the following:

1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:

 a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
 b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

  c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

 d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness
of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.
2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration shall be given to
taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data. (The underlining is from the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.)

From the actions carried out, it has been verified that the security measures
that the investigated entity had in relation to the data that it submitted to
treatment, were not adequate at the time of the data breach,
because, according to the report provided (...) several serious vulnerabilities were found
confirmed that they must be corrected and that in general have to do with the
validation of the input parameters, and that they must be corrected as soon as possible.
brevity.(…)

The consequence of this lack of adequate security measures was the
public exposure on the internet of the personal data of subscribers for the
receipt of information related to the activity of the person in charge. That is, the
affected have been deprived of control over their personal data.

IV

Article 28 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

1. Those responsible and in charge, taking into account the elements
listed in articles 24 and 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, will determine the
appropriate technical and organizational measures that must be applied in order to guarantee and
prove that the treatment is in accordance with the aforementioned regulation, with this law
organization, its implementing regulations and the applicable sectoral legislation. In particular
They will assess whether it is appropriate to carry out the impact assessment on the protection of
data and the prior consultation referred to in Section 3 of Chapter IV of the aforementioned
regulation.

2. For the adoption of the measures referred to in the previous section, the
controllers and processors shall take into account, in particular, the
greater risks that could occur in the following cases:

a) When the treatment could generate situations of discrimination,
identity theft or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage,
loss of confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, reversal not
authorized pseudonymization or any other economic, moral or social damage
significant for those affected.

b) When the treatment could deprive those affected of their rights and

freedoms or could prevent them from exercising control over their personal data.

c) When the treatment is not merely incidental or accessory
of the special categories of data referred to in articles 9 and 10 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 9 and 10 of this organic law or related data
with the commission of administrative offenses. (...) (The underlining is from the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.)

v

Recitals 51 and 75 of the RGPD establish the following:

(51)

 Special protection deserves personal data that, due to its
nature, are particularly sensitive in relation to the rights and freedoms
fundamental, since the context of your treatment could entail important
risks to fundamental rights and freedoms.

(75) The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of
variable severity and probability, may be due to the processing of data that
could cause physical, material or immaterial damages, in particular
(...) in cases where the treatment may give rise to problems of
discrimination, identity theft or fraud; in cases where it is deprived
interested parties of their rights and freedoms or are prevented from exercising control over
your personal information; in cases where the personal data processed reveal the
ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, (...) Emphasis is from the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

Contrary to what VOX indicates in its allegations made to the agreement
from the beginning, this Agency is not considering the personal data subject to
the security breach, as ideological data that deserves to be subsumed under the
art umbrella 9 of the RGPD that under the heading "Special categories of data",
includes as such personal data that reveal (...), political opinions (...), but
than the type of data that has been exposed and the specific type of
exposure, that is, on the internet, a certain risk is revealed that there is
to take into account, as indicated below.

The data in question deals with the subscription to a newsletter of the
activity of the political party, and that, although it does not necessarily imply data of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

9/13

ideological character, public exposure through the Internet of this information,
can lead to the realization of certain combinations with other
information - also published on the internet or by other sources, such as comments
in social networks, participation in forums, monitoring of certain profiles of
user in social networks, etc., - and place their holders in a certain
position in that sense.

On the possibility of combining information referring to a holder of
personal data, Opinion 4/2007 of the Working Group can be brought up
of Article 29, “On the concept of personal data” that although it analyzes the
possibilities of identifying someone through combinations with other
information, are very clear, when we refer to the risk of attributing
a certain political ideology, based solely on the data of a subscriber
to the information of said party, and combining it with another.

Specifically, it indicates the following: (...) when we speak of "indirectly"
identified or identifiable, we are referring in general to the phenomenon of
"unique combinations", be they small or large. In cases where,
At first glance, the available identifiers do not allow a person to be singled out
determined, it can still be "identifiable", because that combined information
with other data (whether the data controller is aware of them
as if not) will allow to distinguish that person from others. This is where the Directive
refers to "one or more specific elements, characteristic of their physical identity,
physiological, psychic, economic, cultural or social. Some of those features
are so unique that they allow effortless identification of a person (the "current
President of the Government of Spain»),
 but a combination of details
belonging to different categories (age, regional origin, etc.) can also be
quite conclusive in some circumstances, especially if you have access to
additional information of a certain type. This phenomenon has been studied
widely by statisticians, always ready to avoid any
breach of confidentiality (...) Thus, the different pieces that
make up the personality of the individual in order to attribute certain
decisions.(…)

As indicated above, in this case the internet search,
for example, the name, surnames or email address of any of the
affected can offer results that, combining them with the subscription to
receive news about the activity of the political party, that is, those who have been
of the security breach, reveal to us, a certain political ideology, whose
disclosure does not have to have been consented by its owner.

This possibility represents a risk that must be assessed when treating
certain data with this characteristic and that increases the requirement of the degree of
protection in relation to the security and safeguarding of the integrity and
confidentiality of these data.

This risk must be taken into account by the data controller and in
function of the same to establish the measures that would have prevented the loss of control

sanction.

Regarding the possible causes that caused the security violation, in the

The report of the entity S21Sec stated the following: […]

Regarding computer attacks through techniques such as injection
SQL, this Agency has pronounced itself in other resolutions, please cite by way of
example the relapse in Sanctioning Procedure No. PS/00187/2017, where
it stated the following:

(…)The intruder used a technique called “SQL Injection” to
gain access to the Planet Vtech system environment hosted on the Amazon service
Web Services. SQL injection is a type of attack known at least since
2003. Has been on the list1 of the 10 most used vulnerabilities between the years
2003 and 2011 and has affected hundreds of thousands2 of websites around the world to
despite the fact that its solution is known and simple to implement.(...)

(…) There are vulnerabilities associated with SQL injection techniques
documented since 20023. According to the OWASP14 classification, attacks
based on this type of techniques have been among the 10 most relevant since 20044.
(…)

Likewise, the lack of consideration of the risk that the
unauthorized access by third parties to data of subscribers of related information
with a political party, and its subsequent public dissemination, aggravates the guilty reproach
and sanctioning the conduct carried out by VOX.

From what has been indicated so far, the lack of diligence of VOX in the
time to implement security measures Taking into account the state of the
technique, the costs of application, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as risks of variable probability and severity for the rights
and freedoms of natural persons (art. 32 RGPD), which gives content to the element
culpabilistic of the typical and unlawful action.
