of a gas supply contract that these companies manage with the
end users. Therefore, Madrileña Red de Gas cannot provide them with a copy of the

supply.
For the CUPS provisioning point from which information is requested in the call

entity claimed sends a letter to this Agency, informing that:
“After reviewing the code that they provide us with numbering ***REFERENCE.1 we have
found a record associated with a supply point. in which the owner of
contract was Ms. A.A.A. until 10/22/18 and the system records the registration of a
email received in the attention.usuarios@madrilena.es mailbox, in April 2018
requesting consumption information from a supply point. Specifically, said
The request referred to the history of readings of Ms. AAA, indicating that the DNI of the
applicant was ***NIF.1. After verifying that the person who claimed to request the
information, he actually had an active contract that corresponded to the DNI

68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), for the infringement of the

3/13

article 5.1.f) of the RGPD typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and considered very
serious, for prescription purposes, in article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD, argued
in the same as: it has been verified that, the reference number of the query that
figure in the complaint is associated with a supply point owned by the
claimant until 10/22/18. The query, nº ***REFERENCE.1 was made by mail
email to the address atencion.usuarios@madrilena.es, in April 2018,
indicating as the DNI of the applicant, that of the holder of the contract.
Although the claimed entity provides the reply email to request no.
***REFERENCE.1 and states that it is the same as that of the sender of the request,
verifies that the data does not correspond to that of the owner of the contract of
supply, since in said address E.E.E. appears as recipient. < ***EMAIL.3
>. Nor does it provide the email through which the information is requested and in which
supposedly the data of the claimant was indicated.

EIGHTH: Once the initiation agreement was notified, the claimed entity, MADRILEÑA RED DE
GAS (MRG), in a letter dated 07/10/19, formulated, in summary, the allegations
already set out in the motion for a resolution.

NINTH: On 08/09/19, the test practice period began,
remembering: a).- to consider reproduced for evidentiary purposes the complaint filed
by the complainant and her documentation, the documents obtained and generated that
are part of file E/00242/2019 and b).- consider reproduced for purposes
evidence, the allegations to the initiation agreement of PS/00188/2019, presented by
the reported entity.

 : On 09/02/19, the sanctioning resolution proposal is notified
TENTH
 
consisting in that by the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data is sanctioned to the entity claimed for infringement of art 5.1.f) of the RGPD,
typified in article 83.5.a) of said regulation and considered "very serious" for the purposes of
prescription, in art. 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD, basing it on the fact that, according to
the existing documentation in the file follows: “from the email
***EMAIL.2, belonging to the tenants of the house located at ***ADDRESS.1,
from September 2017, an email was sent, using the data
personal data of the owner of the home, (your name and ID number), to the email address
of the entity, MADRILEÑA RED DE GAS SAU, atencion.usuarios@madrileña.es,
to request the gas consumption made in the home during the years 2011 and
2012.

The entity complained against, considering that the requestor of said information was
duly identified with the data provided, forwarded to the email address
electronic data of the tenants the consumption data of the dwelling in the years 2011 and
2012 of the owner of the house.

The lack of diligence in the accreditation of the identity of the
applicant by the entity, since it did not require sufficient evidence for the
correct identification as a client, even more so, when in the "sender" field, of the
e-mail of the request, another person appeared different from that of the holder of the
contract, shows that the entity does not guarantee compliance with the RGPD at the time
to verify that the data of the person who contacts them is the one who
says to be

It must be reiterated that this sanctioning procedure opened against MADRILEÑA RED
DE GAS SAU, refers to the processing of personal data that
manages the company and the lack of diligence in taking appropriate measures
that guarantee compliance with the RGPD, in this case, in relation to the
misappropriation of customer identities and the fraud that this may give rise to, without
enter to assess here, that the data offered later by the company were or were not
protected by the RGPD (article 4 and recital 30)”.

ELEVEN: Once the proposed resolution has been notified, the entity claimed submits
allegations to the proposal in the period granted for this purpose, based on
essence, the following:

“In the FIRST point of the PROVEN FACTS section of the letter of the
PROPOSAL, a rental contract is collected between the claimant Ms. A.A.A. and its
tenants D. B.B.B. and Ms. C.C.C.. Said contract establishes a link between
tenants and mail ***EMAIL.2. However, MRG is not aware of
any type of the existence of such a contract, much less of the data of the
tenants, so you cannot link said email to a third person in a
that she is aware that it is not an email of the contract holder that she is using
to communicate with MRG. From our point of view, what shows said
contract is the following: a) That the holder provides his personal data to his
tenant for the purpose of managing the contractual relationship between the parties,
relationship demonstrated by said contract. Therefore. tenants have the
information necessary to identify themselves on behalf of the holders of the contract of
gas supply. Whether or not this use is improper, we cannot determine by not
know the terms of the contract or what was agreed between the parties. b) remains
demonstrated that, as MRG argued in the response to the sanction proposal dated
06/27/19, Ms. A.A.A. breached its obligations by not making a transfer of its
gas contract to the tenant or formally communicate it to MRG. By not complying with this
requirement, MRG cannot in any way be aware of said situation.
In addition, since the tenant has the identification data of the owner. made in
practice very complicated to reliably identify the information requester
as the contract holder.

We insist that, according to article 21, 1, c) of Royal Decree 1434/2002 that regulates
activities of transport, distribution, marketing. supply and
procedures for the authorization of natural gas installations, the
obligation to the owner of the supply point, in this case to the claimant, "That the gas
natural resource is destined for its own use”, a legal obligation that is infringing the
claimant by allowing the gas to be used by a different person. in this case the
tenant.

In addition, article 36.2 of this Royal Decree 1434/2002 establishes that: 2. The
The supply contract is personal, and its owner must be the actual user of the
fuel, which may not be used in a place other than the one for which it was contracted, nor
give it up, nor sell it to fear. Being able to be transferred to third parties under the conditions
established in art. 39. 1 of said Royal Decree 1434/2002: 1. For a point of
supply, the consumer who is up to date with payment may transfer his contract to
another consumer who is going to make use of it, under identical conditions. The owner the

will inform the distribution company by means of a communication that
allows for proof for the purpose of issuing the new contract.

In point 2 of the PROVEN FACTS, it is stated that the emails requesting the
Consumption information is made from ***EMAIL.2. The same is stated in
the FOUNDATIONS OF LAW. However, this is not correct. How I know
can check in the emails that were provided to the file, the emails are addressed
from the account ***EMAIL.3 which does not seem to be the one that appears in the contract between
the owner and his tenant. We want to point out that this error is not the first to be
produced in the processing of this procedure.

Previously, in the first communication addressed to MRG. was requested by
part of the AEPD information about a supply point that was not
related to this case. Subsequently, and as explained by the AEPD in its own
written sanction proposal and includes in its ANNEX, have been sent
communications notifying this file to MADRILENA SUMINISTRO DE GAS,
totally unrelated company MRG, on several occasions. In this regard, in his previous
writing it was implied that MRG had not replied to the communications of the
AEPD when, in reality, those notifications were addressed to another recipient
improperly by the AEPD itself, not correctly identifying the
addressee. In the response to the Proposal for a sanctioning initiation agreement sent
Previously, MRG tried to provide as evidence a recording of a call
where the caller is identified as A.A.A., provides the contact email

implemented by the AEPD does not allow attaching voice files, so it could not be

circumstance requesting an alternative channel to send this file. we want to leave
proof that MRG has not received a response from the AEPD so far, for
so this document could not be sent. We believe that this call brings
information on how in communications with MRG, the owner of the contract,
reports the user's email ***EMAIL.2 as communication email with MRG.
The operator consults various data from the file to identify the owner. If the
caller is misusing the data, it cannot be attributed to
MRG this responsibility, even more so when in our opinion, this situation comes
motivated by the breach of the owner in the change of the contract and allow
there is a holder other than the consumer. A copy of the
document through which a communication channel is requested from the AEPD
alternative for this voice file and a transcript of the conversation contained
in this voice file.

In the BASIS OF LAW it is stated that 'the lack of
diligence, in the accreditation of the identity of the applicant by the entity
claimed, since it did not require sufficient evidence for the correct identification
as a customer. As well as, later in the same section, it says. “lack of diligence
in the adoption of adequate measures that guarantee compliance with the RGPD, in
this case, with regard to usurpation of customer identities and fraud
that this may give rise to". The point of the RGPD for which it is proposed to sanction MRG
is the one collected in Article 5.1.f) 1. Personal data will be: treated in such a way
manner that ensures adequate security of personal data, including the
protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against loss, destruction

or accidental damage, through the application of technical, organizational
appropriate (integrity and confidentiality).

In light of that article. we understand that MRG must take steps to identify
to the applicant within the existing possibilities, as it has done in the present
case. but that it falls to MRG to prevent in any way an usurpation of
identity or avoid damage, when it is the complainant herself who fails to comply with her
obligations established in the legislation (cited) on the supply of natural gas and
provides your personal identification data to third parties so that they can usurp your
identity, we consider that it exceeds the provisions of the mentioned article. Nope
we can agree that MRG has not exercised due diligence to
prove the identification of the information requestor. On the contrary. have been requested
the identification data necessary to see that the request came from the owner.

In the BASIS OF LAW it says 'in the "sender" field of the email
e-mail of the request appeared another person other than the holder of the contract. A
In this regard, we want to clarify that the name that appears related to a
email address, in no case can it be taken as an identifying data. The
changing that name on the account is trivial. simply with the holder of a
account edit your profile you can put the text you prefer, identifying yourself,
a third party, or with any text. This change can also be done in
any moment. not only when the account is designed. In fact, the name
displayed in the mail is E.E.E., not D.B.B.B. nor Dª C.C.C.. Therefore, the mail
electronic, when its function is to establish a channel of communication, it cannot be
a piece of information to consider to identify the applicant since there are no guarantees that
certify neither their ownership nor their use by the interested party. Therefore, the suspicions
should have awakened the E.E.E. mail, according to the interpretation of the Proposal
of Sanction, is a little objective criterion.

It should also be taken into consideration that the distribution companies and
gas marketers are obliged by Royal Decree 1434/2002 to maintain
a telephone channel available to customers. Identification through these channels
It must be done by contrasting identifying data, since at this time there is no
technology to make a more secure identification. require another type of
identifications (verification of telephones, emails, passwords) at this time, by the
consumer profile and socially extended technical means, would carry with it the
inability to provide the service. As we explained in the previous writing, in the
Resolution of April 12, 2011, of the General Directorate of Energy Policy and
Minas, which approves the framework procedure for telephone contracting,
electronics and telematics for the natural gas market, the email does not appear as one
of the data to identify the owner, using name and DNI to identify the
person. The email channel, in this sense. It is similar to telephone. I know
can verify that the sender presents the necessary identification data
(Name and DNI), but others, such as email, we have already verified that they do not
It can be an identifying data due to the null guarantees it offers. Require a holder
addressed MRG always from the same email would be as much as forcing
always be called from the same phone number and that it was the one that had
registered the distribution company to be able to serve the user. we want to leave
proof that MRG has always acted in good faith, considering that the
applicant was duly identified with the data of the holder (Name, Surnames

and ID). If the tenant, or another person, has misused the data of the holder of the
point of supply (data that has NOT been provided by MRG), supposedly
impersonating it without its authorisation, Madrileña Red de Gas is NOT, nor can it be,
responsible for the inadequate and illegal behavior of this person, and
which the claimant, as the owner of the supply point, has had to provide its
identification data (name, surname and ID).

However, the claimant has not complied with its obligations to notify the
distributor the change of contract when formalizing the lease, which leaves MRG in a
situation of defenselessness since it provides its data to a tenant but MRG does not
You can find out about this situation. In accordance with the regulations set forth, it turns out that MRG
If I request all the identification data of the owner of the supply point to
ensure adequate security of personal data before facilitating the
consumption information; the data of the owner of the supply point (Name.
Surnames and DNI), to verify the identity of the petitioner, in a way that
ensure adequate security and confidentiality of personal data,
including to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data and equipment
used in the treatment, so it has NOT violated recital (39) of the
RGPD, nor has it breached any precept of the RGPD, nor has it incurred any infraction
of the RGPD, nor of article 5.1.f), nor of any other, so it is inadmissible
any penalty.

We also believe that it should be taken into consideration that MRG has in this

by phone as well as by email. However, this is the first case of a
claim for improper identification of the interested party. We believe this supports
than the procedures followed, always susceptible to error and improvement. are
adequate and achieve the adequate identification of the interested parties. On the other hand. Y
having proven that, in violation of the regulations set forth, the claimant
maintains ownership of the supply point in its name, although it is intended for the
use of third parties, such as the lessee, is also not accredited that the
consumption data provided by the gas distributor MRG correspond to the
claimant or any other third party, for example, tenants. that they use the
Property. This situation. by itself, renders this file without purpose,
proceeding to remember your file. 7) Regarding the data provided by MRG,
as is accredited in the file, they ONLY refer to gas consumption
natural in a given period for a given supply point, without
further details or additional information. so it is not accredited that
have revealed personal data of the holder not already known by the applicant of the
information. 8) In the Sanctioning Procedure, there is no answer to the answer that
was given to consideration as an aggravating circumstance of the fact of not having notified
proactive advocacy by Madrileña Red de Gas. We insist on this
that MRG was not aware of the situation until it received the request for
information from the AEPD, and that, in any case, Madrileña Red de Gas was subject to
deception to obtain this information. if you really didn't ask for it
claimant, since otherwise it would not have been sent. 9) Finally, we understand
that. in case the Sanction Resolution is maintained for not taking into account the
arguments of MRG, the fact that the owner of the
contract has not fulfilled its obligations to change the owner at the time

of renting the house, as this creates the identification problems seen in
this case.

We understand this assumption to be adjusted to what is included in the LOPD in its Art 76.2 d) Art
76. Sanctions and corrective measures. 2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k)
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 may also be taken into account: d) The possibility
that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission of the offence.
In any case, MRG is going to study whether the identification of the holder can be reinforced
of the point of supply in requests for information. expanding the information
contribute by the applicant without violating his intimate and personal sphere. For all the above, and
NOT having violated MRG the recital (39) of the RGPD, nor breached any
GDPR provision. nor incurred in any violation of the RGPD. nor of art 5.1.f), nor of
any other, any sanction is inadmissible and the AEPD is requested to agree on the
archive of this sanctioning procedure”.

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

PROVEN FACTS

Of the actions carried out in this procedure, of the information and
documentation presented by the parties, the following have been accredited:

1º In the lease contract presented by the claimant, it is appreciated that the
It is celebrated on 09/16/17. The rented house is located in the
***ADDRESS 1. The owner of the same is, Ms. A.A.A. with DNI ***NIF.1 and the
tenants are, D. B.B.B. and Mrs. C.C.C.

It is also noted that, in the twentieth point of the contract, "Notifications",
indicates as email of the tenant for the purposes of notifications,
“***EMAIL.2” and telephone number ***TELEFONO.1.

2º With dates April 4, 6, and 7, 2018, three emails are sent from the
address: E.E.E., ***EMAIL.3 (Apple email used when using a
device of this company), to the address: atencion.usuarios@madrileña.es, with
Subject: “A.A.A Reading History.” and with the text: “Good afternoon, with DNI ***NIF.1,

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in art. 47 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this
process.

Yo

The joint assessment of the documentary evidence in the procedure brings to
knowledge of the AEPD a vision of the performance of the claimed entity, which has
reflected in the facts declared proven.

II

However, in the present case, regarding the arguments presented by the
entity claimed to the resolution proposal, clarify that, when in the proposal
of resolution, in the section of "proven facts", it is indicated that, "of the actions
practiced in this procedure, of the information and documentation
presented by the parties, the following have been accredited "... , it is indicated that
The facts listed below are asserted as a result of the
investigations carried out by this Agency, and for the documentation provided by the
parts. These are facts that the Agency takes as true to make the proposal for
resolution. Thus, in point 1 of the proven facts, it has been verified, from the
lease contract that the tenants of the property in question have as
email ***EMAIL.2 (or “@icloud.com” account, when using systems
iOS or macOS operating systems, on Apple-branded devices). Mail address
email, from which they contacted the MRG entity to request
consumption data of a third person.

Regarding the call transcribed by the MRG entity, indicate that it was
performed on 08/06/18 and was to give a meter reading. The same entity,
letter sent to this Agency on 03/06/19, indicates: “(…) the system records the
registration of an email received in the mailbox atencion.usuarios@madrilena.es, in April
2018 requesting consumption information from a supply point”. Specifically,
said request referred to the history of readings of Ms. AAA, indicating that the DNI of the
applicant was ***NIF.1 (...). It follows from all this that the date on which
the facts of this file occur (April 2018), are prior (3 months),
to the call alleged by the entity. It is also verified that the telephone indicated in the
call from 08/06/18 by the person who contacts the entity
MRG, does not correspond to the telephone number of the owner of the supply, but to the number of
the tenant of the house.

When MRG states that: "(...) email, when its function is to establish
a communication channel, it cannot be a data to be considered to identify the
applicant since there are no guarantees that they certify neither their ownership nor their use by the
interested party”, he is acknowledging with it, a foreseeable breach of security in his
systems, because anyone who comes into contact with them through this
medium and indicate that he is who he really is not, providing them with a minimum
identification, such as name or ID, the MRG entity considers it

as valid, thus demonstrating a clear symptom of lack of diligence in the
adoption of appropriate measures to ensure that the person who puts himself in
contact with them is who they say they are and not someone else.

For all these reasons, the documentation in the file offers clear indications
that the defendant violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles related to treatment,
in relation to article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when disclosing to a
third party the personal data of the claimant through an email
submitted by the claimant.

The claimant has provided the email sent to her by a third party in which
contains a link that leads to a summary of the claimant's purchase, displaying
said third party your data, having knowledge of the facts because that person
sent an email explaining what happened, indicating that his phone line is
associated with the data of the claimant.

The duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must be understood as
Its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not consented to by
their owners.

Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that falls not only on the
responsible and in charge of the treatment but to anyone who intervenes in any
phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

In this sense, the National High Court pronounced itself in a judgment of 01/18/02, in
whose Second Law Foundation, stated: "The duty of professional secrecy
which is incumbent on those responsible for automated files, ..., implies that the
responsible –in this case, the recurring banking entity- of the data stored
-in this case, those associated with the complainant- cannot reveal or make known their
content having the "duty to keep them, obligations that will subsist even after
to end their relations with the owner of the automated file or, where appropriate, with the
