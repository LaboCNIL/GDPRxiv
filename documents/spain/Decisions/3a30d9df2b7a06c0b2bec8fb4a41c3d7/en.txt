FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the Parliament-
European Act and of the Council, of 04/27/16, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons
regarding the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Movement of es-
Data (RGPD) recognizes each Control Authority and, as established in the
art. 47, 64.2 and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
I lie.

The joint assessment of the documentary evidence in the procedure brings to
knowledge of the AEPD, a vision of the denounced action that has been re-
reflected in the facts declared proven above reported.

II

In the present case, the dissemination of personal data of third parties, through
of the email, supposes a treatment of personal data and, therefore, it should
rely on any of the legitimating causes indicated in the RGPD.

In the present case, it is alleged that the claimants are businessmen and that, therefore,
the RGPD is not applicable in this case, as established in its article 1, that is,
when people act as entrepreneurs, in the development of their business activity,
presarial and to justify it I enclose the demand that, according to what he states, proves that
is the employer, but rather that the employers are the claimants and that they acted as
such.

In said lawsuit with the title of, "recognition of employment relationship and guardianship of
fundamental rights”, mentions Don B.B.B. with ***NIF.2 and Don C.C.C. with
***NIF.3. However, no document is presented to substantiate that the claims
parties will act as self-employed entrepreneurs in the alleged contractual relationship.

Regarding the alleged illicit use of the personal data of the claimants
by the claimed party when he/she proceeds to inform, by means of an electronic mail
mass communication to customers, suppliers and sponsors, that both people
are unrelated to the "DNC Spain" project and therefore are not
authorized to use neither the name nor the logo, it is considered, in accordance with the
"principle of data minimization", contained in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD that re-
disclosure of personal data such as your ID number, is excessive in relation to
tion to the intended purposes.

Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for prescription purposes,
“The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established
in article 5 of the RGPD”.

This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

However, the art. 58.2) of the RGPD provides that: "Each supervisory authority
will have all the following corrective powers indicated below: b)
sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning when
treatment operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation; (...); i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83,
in addition to or instead of the measures mentioned in the paragraph, according to the
circumstances of each particular case”, therefore, the sanction that must correspond
in the present case it is “warning”.

In view of the foregoing, the following is issued:
