FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in art. 47 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

The defendant is imputed the commission of an infraction for violation of article 5
of the RGPD, which states that: Personal data will be:

“c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization").

The installation of this device (s) devoid of an informative sign, is
affecting the tranquility of the residents of the area, who are intimidated by the
himself, and lacking the necessary information to be able to contact the
responsible for the installation.

The infraction is typified in article 83 section 5 of said rule, which
 
considers as a very serious infraction the infraction of “the basic principles for the
treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5,
6, 7 and 9”.

III

In the present case, we proceed to examine the claim dated 02/19/19 by
means of which the following is transferred to this body:

“Three video-surveillance cameras were recently installed on the farm, two of

which point directly towards my house (...)”—folio nº 1--.

The facts are therefore specified in the installation of some type of device
(camera) disproportionately, so that it is oriented towards property
private and/or public space, without just cause.

On 02/20/19 the collaboration of the Local Police of the municipality is required,
who send a report identifying the person in charge of the installation as Doña A.A.A.,
with DNI ***DNI.1, residing in ***LOCALIDAD.1 (Germany), but residing
summer in the town.

The installation of three cameras is verified (two with orientation towards the
interior), while a third is oriented towards the communal area on top of a
massif of stones

It does not have any informative poster informing that it is a zone
video-surveillance, indicating the person in charge, as well as an effective address to which
power in your case address.

Article 74.1 a) of the LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5), qualifies as a lack

Minor, for legal purposes:

“Breach of the principle of transparency of information or the right
of information of the affected party for not providing all the information required by the articles
13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.

It has not been possible to verify the operability of the system, but the indications
obtained indicate that the system is operational, that is, that it obtains images that
can affect the adjoining neighbor and even transit areas without cause
justified.

It should be noted that anyone who installs this type of system, with the purpose of
to protect your property, you must be responsible that it conforms to the
current legality.

Thus, it must have an informative poster in a visible area, indicating the
responsible for the file, and even if you reside abroad, indicate a mailing address
email to which you can go, both any affected and in your case
the Security Forces and Bodies.

It should be ensured that it is oriented towards its private area, not
disturbing the privacy of the neighboring neighbors who can be seen intimidated
for this type of device.

Article 22 LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) provides the following:

“Physical or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the
purpose of preserving the safety of persons and goods, as well as their
installations"

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information” (*underlining belongs to this organization).

Thus, it is verified that the accused Ms. A.A.A. is responsible
of the installation of a video-surveillance system, which is oriented in a
disproportionate towards the private space of a third party and/or public without just cause,
affecting the adjoining neighbors, not being the same provided with information poster
and not having adopted any effective measure so that the different
Administrations can communicate with it, especially if it spends long
seasons in Germany.

IV

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83.5, sections a) and b), of the RGPD, in its
art. 58.2 b) establishes the possibility of sanctioning with a warning, in relation to what
stated in Recital 148:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance

of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

In the present case, it is taken into account that it is a citizen
foreigner, with little knowledge of the matter in question, the limited area
where the cameras are installed, as well as the absence of an administrative infraction
in this regard registered by this body.

The foregoing does not prevent the imposition of corrective measures- ex art. 58.2 letter d)
RGPD--, such as the reorientation and/or reinstallation of the camera (s) object of
complaint, as well as the installation of at least one informative poster in a visible area
indicating the person in charge to whom you can contact, as well as additionally
an email address for any incident that may occur.

The measures adopted, if any, must be reported to this
agency, accrediting the same (vgr, photograph with date and time), indicating the
procedure number PS/00090/2019, so that they are incorporated
to the administrative file.

v

In accordance with the foregoing, after analyzing the circumstances of the case, it is verified
according to the indications obtained (Local Police report) that the denounced system is not
adjusts to current legislation, proceeding to warn the accused party.

If a reasonable period of time elapses (eg three months) without
having adopted none of the measures described, it will be possible to proceed to the opening of
a sanctioning procedure of a pecuniary nature, given the situation of negligence
serious in the fulfillment of the obligations required for this type of device, which
which is communicated for the appropriate legal purposes.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: PROCEED to WARN Doña A.A.A. with NIF ***DNI.1, for one
infringement of article 5 letter c) of the RGPD, typified in art. 83 par. 5 of the RGPD and
classified as very serious, for the purposes of administrative prescription in art. 72.1 a)
LOPDGDD, having installed a video-surveillance system without it being
adjustment to the regulations in force, having to proceed:

-Place an informative device in a visible area indicating that it is
video-monitored area, indicating the person in charge and the effective address to which
heading down.

-Reorient and/or relocate that camera(s) that may be misoriented,

avoiding the affectation of the rights of third parties.
