FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.

II

In the proposed resolution, the defendant is accused of committing an infraction
for violation of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which states that personal data
shall be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for
those that are processed (“data minimization”).”

This infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD:

“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) the rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22; […].”

For the purposes of the limitation period of the infraction, it is considered very serious
and prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes
that:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. […]”

III

The facts proven in this proceeding show that the
claimed has installed a video surveillance system in which the two cameras
facing outwards, having a range of several meters, would capture
disproportionately the roads or spaces between dwellings of the urbanization. The
The complainant also states that the video surveillance system lacks a sign
informative and in the images provided its existence is not observed, as indicated by
in the agreement to initiate this procedure.

The installation of the aforementioned cameras oriented towards the outside is not
covered by the exclusion set forth in article 22.5 of the LOPDGDD insofar as
capturing images that go beyond —spatially and temporally— the
verification about the identity of people who try to access a
domicile at a given time, exceeds the consideration of treatment
“carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities exclusively
personal or domestic” of article 2.2.c) of the RGPD.

On the other hand, even when the purpose of the data processing carried out with the
Surveillance system outside to guarantee the security of the dwelling and the space
exclusive of the claimed —and therefore this legitimating basis could be asserted—,
the taking of images should be reduced to the aforementioned private space, its access,
perimeter or both, limiting the capture of adjacent spaces to the minimum
and without in any case being able to reach neighboring homes or traffic lanes.

In addition, and even though the motion for a resolution has not included a
infringement in this sense, it is necessary to point out that article 13 of the RGPD -in
compliance with the duty of information contained in the preceding article 12 of the
same legal text - regulates the information that must be provided when the data
are obtained from the interested party, a situation that occurs in the cases in which
images are captured by a video surveillance system. In this sense, the article
22.4 of the LOPDGDD establishes that "The duty of information provided for in article 12
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing a
informative device in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the
existence of the treatment, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the
rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Also
A connection code or email address may be included in the information device.
internet to this information. Therefore, so that the treatment carried out by the
installed video surveillance system is in accordance with the provisions of the regulations of
data protection, an informative poster must be placed that at least informs about the
treatment that is carried out, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility and manner of
exercise the rights recognized in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD; without impairment
that the rest of the information must be kept available to those affected
stipulated by article 13 of the RGPD.

On the other hand, it is pointed out that individuals who use this type of device are
responsible that these comply with current legislation, and must comply, when

The property is under the regime of community of owners, with the
requirements established in Law 49/1960, of July 21, on horizontal property
(LPH). Thus, the installation of a video surveillance system by an individual will require
of authorization of the board of the community of owners both when it is projected
its location in a common area such as when, even installed in an area of use
exclusive, is oriented to surrounding common areas and captures —respecting in any case
the principle of data minimization—tangentially common areas.

Finally, it is reported that access to images by third parties
other than the data controller must be regulated by the existence of a
contract and that those systems that are connected to a receiving center
alarm system or a control center must comply with the provisions of Law 5/2014, of
April 4, Private Security and other applicable regulations.

IV

The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, is established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Among
they have the power to sanction with a warning -article 58.2 b)-, the
power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD
-article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the controller or processor
that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period -article 58. 2
d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the RGPD, the aforementioned Regulation
has in its art. 58.2 b) the possibility of sanctioning with a warning, in relation
with what is stated in Considering 148:

“In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

v

In the present case, when deciding the sanction to be imposed, they have taken into account
It includes, in particular, the following elements:

 That it is an individual whose main activity is not linked to the
treatment of personal data.

 That there is no recidivism, because the commission is not recorded, within a year,
of more than one infringement of the same nature.

For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is
warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.

On the other hand, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD,
according to which each control authority may "order the person in charge or in charge
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a
specified period […]”, the person in charge must prove, within a period of two (2) months:

 Having proceeded to withdraw the cameras from the current locations, or to
reorientation by reducing the capture angle. In the event that

 Having proceeded to place the informative device in the areas

articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD), locating this device in a sufficiently
visible.

 That it keeps the information referred to in the document available to those affected.
quoted GDPR.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with NIE ***NIE.1, for a violation of article 5.1.c)
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a sanction of WARNING.
