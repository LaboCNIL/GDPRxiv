of ***CALLE.1, nº 6 that identifies as Mr. A.A.A. , (hereinafter, the claimed),
has installed a video surveillance camera in a tree that focuses and records the area
of the swimming pool of his house, a place frequently used for his games by his
three minor children.

The claimant attaches the following documentation:

-Copy of a general request filed on July 13, 2018 in the
OAC ***DISTRITO.1 Registry Office of the Madrid City Council, in which the
The claimant states that “There are cameras installed in trees that record us and

to assess, in the reference file E/04837/2018, that the data processing
linked to the installation of the video surveillance camera was in accordance with the regulations
of data protection.

On August 29, 2018, a written response is registered

of the complainant stating the following:

“- The person in charge of the installation is myself.

The respondent attaches two photographs in which the places of

exterior wall of a building and another on a pole located at an angle of a
fenced land adjoining another plot. He also provides two other photos.
taken from the places where the cameras are placed, which are not
show no pool. These are approximate images that do not reveal the
real scope of the video-monitored area by said cameras by not showing "the images
captured by the cameras, as displayed on the monitor or system
equivalent".

THIRD: On December 13, 2018, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning procedure of warning to
Mr. A.A.A., (hereinafter, the respondent), in accordance with the provisions of articles 63
and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of the
Article 5.1.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons in what
regarding the processing of personal data and the free circulation of these data, (in
hereinafter RGPD), in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2.b) of the aforementioned
RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

FOURTH: Notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, dated December 24,
2018, a written statement of allegations of the claimed party is registered in that Agency in the
which, in summary, alleges the following extremes:

- Provides details of the cadastre in which it indicates the location of the plots
located at numbers 2, 4 and 6 of ***CALLE.1, also setting the location of the
two cameras installed on your plot and the areas of it to which they point
these devices.

-That the camera that the claimant referred to as installed in a tree, and
that the respondent identifies as camera 2, was moved prior to
receipt of the information request, relocating to the post in the
which is currently installed at a height similar to that which was
placed on the tree, which was about two meters high. He denies that there was
more cameras installed in trees.

It also notes that “the photos provided by the claimant are taken
from above. Since my camera 2 was attached to the wall bordering the claimant.
Said wall is 2.5 high and my camera was placed less than 2 high and the
edge of your pool is 3 meters from the border fence. Otherwise
They have entered my plot to take the photos.”

Also, attach photograph No. 2 to indicate the location of camera 2, to the
side of the previous position in the tree, which allows us to appreciate that it is installed by
below the height of the boundary wall with ***CALLE.1, nº 2.

- The respondent presents four photographs to prove the position of the
cameras with respect to the claimant's plot/swimming pool, with the help of the map
with the detail of the cadastre. Under photograph no. 5, he reports: “Chamber 1 is attached
to the border with ***CALLE.1 nº 4. The border with ***CALLE.1 nº 4 and ***CALLE.1 nº 2
form a straight line, so camera 1, due to its position, cannot focus
toward the claimant's pool area.” Under photograph no. 6, it indicates “As
you can see in this photo the location of the camera below the boundary wall
prevents viewing the pool area of the claimant.”

- States that due to the position of the cameras, the pool of the claimant is
outside the capture field of said devices, noting for these purposes that:
“In order to have a view of the pool, camera 1 should be located where the
three borders (***STREET.1 nº 2, 4 and 6), that is, on the edge of the brick wall
***STREET.1 nº 4 and camera 2 should be located above 2.5 m of
height of the boundary wall with ***CALLE.1 nº 2. Which they are not, nor have they been.
Since my interest is not to observe the claimant's plot but the accesses to my
parcel from that boundary.”

-

It presents capture of the images collected by both cameras, which
clarifies coincide with those provided in your previous answer as there is no option to
see more field of vision. He adds that his equipment does not allow displaying date and time
superimposed on the captured area, so it presents an image of the list of
photos and an individual photo of each camera in which the day and time appear on the screen
of your device. What he justifies by referring to the manual provided at the time.

PROVEN FACTS:

FIRST: On July 13, 2018, Don B.B.B., (the claimant), filed with
the AEPD claim against Mr. A.A.A., (the defendant), for installing a security camera
video surveillance on the parcel of his property, which, according to the claimant, focused on the
pool area of his property, a place frequented by his three children under the age of
age.

SECOND: The claimant attached, among other documentation, a printout of four
photographs showing a video surveillance camera perched on a tree.

FOURTH:
  The graphic documentation provided by the respondent, together with the
information provided by the cadastral plan in which the location has been marked and

neighbour.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II

The use of video surveillance cameras allows capturing images, so
that its use affects identified or identifiable natural persons captured through
through said devices, and constitutes, therefore, a treatment of personal data.
personal character.

One of the requirements that image processing must meet through
a video surveillance system to be in accordance with current regulations is that of
respect the principle of proportionality.

Camcorders will not be able to capture images of people
are outside the private space, since the treatment of images in places
public can only be carried out, where appropriate, by the Forces and Bodies of
Security. Nor may spaces owned by third parties be captured or recorded without
the consent of their owners, or, where appropriate, of the natural persons affected by
said treatment.

III

In the present case it is elucidated if the claimed person carries out a treatment of
images for video surveillance purposes that could exceed the exclusive scope of their
plot, since it could also capture images of the pool area of the plot
neighbor and, consequently, of the members of the claimant's family and of
any third party found in that space outside their private property.

Such conduct could violate article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which establishes,

Regarding the “Principles related to treatment”, the following:

"1. The personal data will be:

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization");

For its part, Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), in its article 22,
regarding "Processing for video surveillance purposes", in sections 1, 2 and 5,

establishes that:

"1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the
purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
installations.

2. Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that

is essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.

However, it will be possible to capture the public road in an extension
superior when necessary to guarantee the security of goods or
strategic installations or infrastructures linked to transport, without
In no case may it involve capturing images of the interior of a home
private.

(…)

5. Under article 2.2.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is considered
excluded from its scope of application the treatment by a natural person of images
that only captures the interior of their own home.

This exclusion does not cover processing carried out by a security entity
private that had been contracted for the surveillance of a home and had access
to the images”

IV

For the purposes of determining the sanction that could entail the

mentioned infraction, the following precepts must be taken into account:

Sections b), d) and i) of article 58.2 of the RGPD provide the following:
“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
this Regulation;”

(...)
“d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a specified manner and within a specified period;”

“i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or in
instead of the measures mentioned in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case;

Article 83 of the RGPD, under the heading “General conditions for the

imposition of administrative fines”, in sections 2 and 5.a), states that:

"two. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated
in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). (…)

5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount: (...)

a)

consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; “.

For its part, article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD establishes that:
  "1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, are considered very serious and infringements will expire after three years.
that suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
particularly the following:

a)

The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In turn, Recital 148 of Regulation 2016/679, which establishes the
following: “In the event of a minor offence, or if the fine likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, rather than
sanction by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. must however
Special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of liability or any relevant prior violation, the manner in which
that the control authority has been aware of the infraction, compliance
of measures ordered against the person responsible or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance.”

The violation of the principle of data minimization could constitute
of the claimed, in its capacity as responsible for the treatment of video surveillance,
infringement of the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD in its relationship with the provisions of
article 22.5 of the LOPDGDD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and qualified
as very serious for prescription purposes in article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD.

In the case that concerns us, and in view of the evidence available in that
procedural moment, it was considered appropriate to initiate a sanctioning procedure of
warning in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2.b) of the RGPD. For
It was taken into account that the person responsible for the video surveillance treatment was a
natural person and the absence of intentionality in his conduct, since the
Image processing responds to security purposes of goods and people in a
private environment, also considering that the administrative fine that could
fall in accordance with the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a burden
disproportionate to that person.

In the present case, of the evidence provided by the defendant,
especially the photographic report attached to his allegations, through which
shows the exact location of the cameras installed inside your plot and the
images corresponding to the video-monitored area captured by each of the two
cameras that make up the video surveillance device installed on your property,
It follows that there is no processing of images of the swimming pool area of
the parcel owned by the claimant. The photographs that correspond to the area
captured by each of the video surveillance cameras show images of the
interior of the plot of the claimed, without collecting images of any pool.

In addition to these images of the captured area, the defendant justifies in his
allegations that given the position in which camera 1 is located it cannot focus
towards the pool area of the claimant, adding that since camera 2
located below the boundary wall it is not possible to see through the
the claimant's pool area itself, which is also supported by the
photographic report presented and the detail of the plan of the cadastre that allows to locate
the location of the cameras in relation to the claimant's swimming pool.

Consequently, since it is not accredited in the procedure that the chambers
are oriented towards the pool area of the claimant's plot, there is no
irrefutable proof of the affectation of the private space of others as a consequence
of the processing of images for video surveillance purposes carried out by the claimed party,
responsible for the installation in question and the treatment resulting from it.

SAW

Based on the foregoing, the principle of presumption of innocence prevents imputing a
administrative infraction when proof of
accrediting charge of the facts that motivate the imputation or of the intervention in the
of the alleged offender. Applying the principle “in dubio pro reo” in case of doubt
with respect to a concrete and determined fact, which obliges in any case to resolve
said doubt in the most favorable way for the interested party.

The presumption of innocence must govern without exceptions in the legal system
sanctioning and must be respected in the imposition of any sanctions, since
the exercise of the ius puniendi in its diverse manifestations is conditioned to the
game of evidence and a contradictory procedure in which they can defend themselves
own positions.

 In this sense, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment 76/1990, of 26/04,
considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: "that the sanction be
based on acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the conduct
reproached; that the burden of proof corresponds to the one who accuses, without anyone being
forced to prove his own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the result of
the tests carried out, freely assessed by the sanctioning body, must
result in an acquittal statement.

Said principle governs without exceptions in the sanctioning system and must
be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its
manifestations, is conditioned to the test game and to a procedure
contradictory environment in which their own positions can be defended.

Therefore, according to the same, no sanction can be imposed on the basis of
of the guilt of the accused if there is no activity to prove the charge, which in
the appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).

In accordance with the foregoing, the violation of the principle of
minimization of data by the claimed party and, consequently, the commission of the
administrative infraction described, obeying the installation of the system of
video surveillance for reasons of security of persons and property, without evidence
accredited that the image processing carried out affects the pool area of the
claimant's adjoining parcel.

Therefore, it is appropriate to file the actions carried out in this

administrative Procedure.

According to what was stated,

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: FILE the actions carried out in this procedure
