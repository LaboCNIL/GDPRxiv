FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

Yo

Article 58 of the RGPD, Powers, states:

II

"two. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the treatment operations have infringed the
provided in this Regulation;
(…)”

The RGPD establishes in article 5, principles that must govern the treatment

of personal data, mentions among them that of “integrity and confidentiality”.

The article notes that:

"1. The personal data will be:

(…)
f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
of measures
appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and
confidentiality”)”.
(…)

In turn, the security of personal data is regulated in articles

32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD.

Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
 
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the
treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration shall be given to
taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct under article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
guarantee that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and has access to personal data can only process said data
following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

Violations of article 32 are typified in article 83.4.a) of the

cited RGPD in the following terms:

"4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge pursuant to articles 8,
11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
(…)”

For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Violations, states that:
“The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law.

And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as "Infringements

considered serious”:

“Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

(…)
g) The violation, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance
to what is required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.
(…)

The facts revealed in this claim are specified in
the existence of a security incident in the claimed systems allowing
the vulnerability of the same by allowing documentation containing data from
personal character, were located next to some urban garbage containers
located in a neighborhood belonging to ***LOCALIDAD.1 (Gran Canaria) in bags of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

5/8

plastic, from different clients of the claimed one, allowing access to the data
contained in them.

The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as
“all those violations of security that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to such data”.

III

From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications of
that the claimed party has violated article 32.1 of the RGPD, when there was a breach of
security in their systems allowing access to the documents contained in
bags deposited next to some urban garbage containers located in
***LOCATION.1; documents containing personal data of clients of the
reclaimed.

It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned provision does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that is
object of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
that the treatment entails, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

Likewise, the security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the detected risk, pointing out that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational information must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resiliency, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the level of security,
particularly taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, such as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from violating the
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as
encryption. These measures must guarantee an adequate level of security, including
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
regarding the risks and the nature of the personal data that must be
protect yourself. When assessing the risk in relation to data security,
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data

transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or access is not
authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

In the present case, as evidenced by the facts and within the framework of the
investigation file E/05538/2020, the AEPD transferred the defendant on
07/06/2020 the written claim submitted for analysis requesting the
provision of information related to the claimed incidence, without
received any response from this body.

The responsibility of the claimed party is determined by the incident/bankruptcy
of security revealed by the SEPRONA section of the GC of Las
Palmas, since it is responsible for making decisions aimed at implementing
effectively the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a
level of security appropriate to the risk to ensure the confidentiality of the data,
restoring their availability and preventing access to them in the event of an incident
physical or technical. However, the documentation provided shows that the
claimed has not only failed to comply with this obligation, but also the
adoption of measures in this regard, despite having notified him of the claim
presented.

In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the respondent would be
allegedly responsible for the infringement of the RGPD: the violation of article 32.1,
infraction typified in its article 83.4.a).

However, as stated in Foundation II, article 58.2 of the RGPD
provides the following: "Each control authority will have all the following
corrective powers indicated below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the treatment operations have infringed the
provided in this Regulation;
(…)”

Therefore, the RGPD, without prejudice to the provisions of its article 83, contemplates
in its article 58.2 b) the possibility of going to the warning to correct the
processing of personal data that do not meet your expectations.
     

In the case at hand, it has been proven that the defendant
violated article 32.1 of the RGPD, by allowing third parties to have access to the
data contained in the documents that had been deposited with
existing garbage containers on the public road at the entrance of the neighborhood of
***BARRIADA.1, belonging to the municipality of ***LOCALIDAD.1; documents that
they contained personal data of clients of the claimed party.

According to the available evidence, said conduct
constitutes, on the part of the defendant, the infringement of the provisions of article 32.1 of the
GDPR.

This infringement in accordance with article 58.2.b) of the RGPD can be
sanctioned with a warning considering that the administrative fine that could
fall in accordance with the provisions of article 83.4.a) of the RGPD would constitute a
disproportionate burden for the defendant, in addition to the fact that the commission of
no previous breach of data protection.

In addition, in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the
requested to adopt adequate technical measures to ensure the
confidentiality of the information included in their systems so that in the future they do not
may incur in incidents such as the one that has given rise to this file, as well as
such as the provision of means of proof accrediting compliance with the
required.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
 

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE D. A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1, for an infraction of the
aarticle 32.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.4.a) of the RGPD, a sanction of
warning.

SECOND: REQUEST D. A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1, so that within the period of
one month from the notification of this resolution, accredit before the AEPD the adoption of

personal data that do not comply with the data protection regulations of
personal nature and prevent the recurrence of violations such as those that have
given rise to the claim correcting the effects of the infringement, determining the
necessary measures in order to adapt to the requirements contemplated in the
article 32.1 of the RGPD.

THIRD: NOTIFY this resolution to A.A.A., with NIF ***NIF.1.
