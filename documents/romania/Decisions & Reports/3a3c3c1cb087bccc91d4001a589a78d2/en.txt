In July, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator UTTIS INDUSTRIES SRL and found that it violated the provisions of art. 12 and art. 5 para. (1) lit. c) corroborated with art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC ( General Data Protection Regulation).
The operator of UTTIS INDUSTRIES SRL was sanctioned with a fine of a total amount of 11,834.25 lei (equivalent to the amount of 2500 euros).
Thus, it was applied:

 fine in the amount of 4,733.70 lei (equivalent to the amount of 1000 euros) for violating the provisions of art. 12 of the RGPD and
 fine in the amount of 7,100.55 lei (equivalent to the amount of 1500 euros) for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. c) corroborated with art. 6 of the RGPD.

The penalties were applied to the operator because:

 could not prove the information of the data subjects regarding the processing of personal data / images through the video surveillance system, which he had been carrying out since 2016;
 carried out the disclosure of the CNP of the employees, by displaying the Report for the training of the ISCIR authorized personnel related to 2018 on the company's notice board and could not prove the legality of the CNP processing, by disclosure, according to art. 6 RGPD.

The National Supervisory Authority applied the sanction as a result of notifications dated 21.03.2019 stating that UTTIS INDUSTRIES SRL has video surveillance cameras installed, without carrying out the legal information on video surveillance, as well as the fact that it revealed illegally the name and CNP of the employees, by displaying this personal data on the company's notice board.
According to art. 12 of the RGPD, the operator had the obligation to take adequate measures to provide the data subject with any information mentioned in art. 13 and 14.
