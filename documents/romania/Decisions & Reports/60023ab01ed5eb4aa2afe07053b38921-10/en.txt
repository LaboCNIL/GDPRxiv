Fine for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed in March 2022 an investigation at the operator Megareduceri TV S.R.L., to which it imposed a fine, as a result of the fact that this operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) correlated with the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the operator Megareduceri TV S.R.L was penalized for contravention with a fine of 19,795.6 lei (equivalent to the amount of 4,000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of the complaints of several petitioners who informed us about the fact that they received commercial messages promoting the services on the www.reducerazi.ro website, without having expressed their consent to receive such messages, on personal phone numbers.
Since the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, although he confirmed their receipt, he was fined.
At the same time, the following corrective measures were applied to the operator:

 the corrective measure to ensure the compliance of the processing operations with the provisions of the RGPD, respectively to avoid the situations of processing personal data without the consent of the persons concerned and without the existence of another situation in which consent is not necessary;
 the corrective measure consisting in taking the necessary measures regarding the evaluation of the personal data processed, so that data such as the telephone number is no longer processed for the purpose of direct marketing or the transmission of commercial communications through electronic communications services intended for the public without the express prior consent of the persons concerned.
