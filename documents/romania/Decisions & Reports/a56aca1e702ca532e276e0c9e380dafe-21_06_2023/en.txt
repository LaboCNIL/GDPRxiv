Penalty for GDPR violation

In May of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the Vodafone Romania SA operator and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).
As such, Vodafone Romania SA was fined 4,961 lei, the equivalent of 1,000 EURO.
The sanction was applied as a result of a complaint claiming that the operator violated the petitioner's right of access by refusing to share certain recordings of calls with his call center.
In the course of the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority found that the Vodafone Romania SA operator did not prove that it had sent a response to the petitioner to his request to exercise the right of access within 30 days, thus violating the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the GDPR.
In this context, we remind you that in art. 15 para. (3) it is stipulated that "The Operator provides a copy of the personal data that are the subject of processing. For any other copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. If the data subject submits the application in electronic format and unless the data subject requests a different format, the information is provided in a currently used electronic format."
At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure of adopting technical and organizational measures so that the operator can ensure that it effectively responds to requests that exercise the rights of data subjects provided for by Regulation (EU) 679/2016, including the right of access provided by Art. 15.
