A new penalty for breaching GDPR

In January of the current year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Medijobs Platform SRL in which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the company Medijobs Platform SRL was fined 24,610.5 lei, the equivalent of 5,000 EURO.
The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of a notification of breach of the security of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.
During the investigation, it was found that the breach of data processing security occurred through unauthorized access to the IT infrastructure managed by Medijobs Platform SRL, which made it possible to download and delete certain personal data.
This situation led to the unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to certain personal data from the candidates' CVs, such as: name, surname, email, phone number, professional/educational history, hobbies, marital status.
Thus, the operator Medijobs Platform SRL was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure to review and update the technical and organizational measures implemented as a result of the risk assessment for the rights and freedoms of individuals, as well as the work procedures related to the protection of personal data and employee training.
