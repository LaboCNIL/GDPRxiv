A new fine for violating the RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed on 25.11.2019 an investigation at the operator Telekom Romania Mobile Communications SA, finding the following:

 violation of the provisions of art. art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and art. 32 para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation;
 violation of art. 5 para. (1) lit. d) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.

The operator of Telekom Romania Mobile Communications SA was sanctioned with a warning for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016 and with a fine in the amount of 9,544.40 lei, the equivalent of the amount of 2000 EURO for violating art. 5 para. (1) lit. d) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.
The sanctions were applied as a result of a complaint alleging that the petitioner received invoices addressed to another person at his home address, a client of the operator, and that he had reported this situation to the operator, but had not received a reply.
During the investigation, Telekom Romania Mobile Communications SA could not prove the accuracy of the processed data, which led to the violation of the basic principle for data processing provided by art. 5 para. (1) lit. d) of the RGPD.
Thus, according to art. 5 para. (1) lit. d) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, â€œpersonal data are:
d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are deleted or rectified without delay ("accuracy"). "
It was also found that the operator did not take adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, which led to the disclosure of personal data of a customer of the operator by sending invoices to the petitioner that customer.
