Modernization of the Convention 108

In May 2018, the Council of Europe adopted the amended Protocol updating the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, known as the “Convention 108”.
The Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection, which was the only legally binding international instrument on the protection of privacy and personal data, has been modernized after a period of intense activity and negotiations.
The modernization of Convention 108 addresses the challenges to privacy resulting from the use of new information and communication technologies and, at the same time, strengthens the mechanism of Convention 108 to ensure its effective implementation.
The Modernized Convention was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe at its 128th session in May 2018. The English version of the Modernized Convention 108 is available here.
