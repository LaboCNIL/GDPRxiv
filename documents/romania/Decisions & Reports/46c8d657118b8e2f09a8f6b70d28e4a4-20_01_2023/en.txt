28 January 2023 - EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION DAY

January 28, 2023 marks the celebration of European Data Protection Day by all member states of the Council of Europe, when it is 42 years since the adoption of Convention 108 for the protection of individuals with regard to automated processing of personal data, by the Council of Europe, the first legal instrument in the field.
The annual celebration of this day is subordinated to the objective of raising the level of awareness of the general public regarding the rules for the use of personal data, under the auspices of highlighting the importance of the right to privacy and the protection of personal data.
For the celebration of the European Data Protection Day, on January 27, 2023, our institution will organize the online Conference entitled "The effectiveness of GDPR application in a connected world", in which relevant aspects from the case study will be presented and debated. Mainly, the authorities and representative central public institutions, the most important professional associations and unions, chambers of commerce, companies and media representatives were invited to this event.
The marking of the European Data Protection Day will also be carried out with the support of the national television station TVR and the Bucharest Transport Society, which will broadcast the informative clip on the General Regulation on Data Protection (public interest message), made by ANSPDCP.
In this context, we mention that our institution initiated a collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the National Authority for the Protection of Children's Rights and Adoption, in order to identify the appropriate means aimed at increasing the level of awareness regarding the rules for processing personal data and the risks involved.
Also, for those interested, synthetic information on the Authority's activity from the previous year is presented, as every year, in the Brochure dedicated to the European Data Protection Day, available, together with the related leaflet, at www.dataprotection.ro/informatii generale/ information of public interest/informative materials.
