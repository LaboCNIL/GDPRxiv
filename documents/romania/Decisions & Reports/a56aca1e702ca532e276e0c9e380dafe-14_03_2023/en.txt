Penalty for GDPR violation

In February of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Tinmar Energy SA in which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the company Tinmar Energy SA was fined 14,702.1 lei, the equivalent of 3,000 EURO.
The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of a notification of breach of the security of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the violation of data processing security occurred through unauthorized access to the e-mail server of Tinmar Energy SA, which led to access to certain personal data, such as: name, surname, email mail, CNP, telephone numbers and home addresses.
Thus, the operator Tinmar Energy SA was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
