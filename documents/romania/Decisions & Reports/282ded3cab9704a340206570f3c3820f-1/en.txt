European Data Protection Day

On the occasion of the celebration of the European Day of Data Protection, our institution launches the "Guide regarding the processing of personal data carried out by the owners' associations", which can be consulted in the "Useful information" section, on the website of the National Supervisory Authority.
This guide is intended to support owners' associations, related to the fulfillment of their obligations as personal data operators according to Regulation (EU) 679/2016, in order to comply with the conditions of personal data processing, including ensuring the rights of the persons concerned.
Also, in the "Informative Materials" section, the Brochure dedicated to the European Data Protection Day was posted, both in Romanian and in English.
