FRA Handbook on Legislation on
protection of personal data in Europe

On 29 May 2018, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) published a new handbook that provides an overview of the legal framework for the protection of personal data in Europe, including important case law.
The document was prepared by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in cooperation with the Council of Europe and the European Data Protection Supervisor. The purpose of this publication is to improve knowledge of the rules on the protection of personal data, especially among employees who process personal data or come into contact with it. The document provides new information on the changes brought about by the current reform of the legal framework on data protection.
The English version of the manual is available here: http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2018/handbook-european-data-protection-law.
