Fine for GDPR violation

In May 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at SC Interactions Marketing SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.
SC Interactions Marketing SRL, as an agent of an operator, was fined 4,942.3 lei (the equivalent of 1000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of complaints made by a data subject who complained that an operator had sent a commercial message to several people by e-mail, thus revealing their e-mail addresses.
As part of the investigation, it was found that SC Interactions Marketing SRL, as an authorized representative, ran a campaign for the complained operator, during which it sent a commercial message to the e-mail addresses belonging to a number of 27 people, without hiding them, thereby allowing unauthorized disclosure of email addresses to other recipients.
As such, SC Interactions Marketing SRL was sanctioned for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) from the General Regulation on Data Protection, although, as an authorized person, he had the obligation to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure the confidentiality of personal data processed.
