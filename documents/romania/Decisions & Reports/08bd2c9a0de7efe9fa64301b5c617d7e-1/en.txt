A new fine for breaching GDPR

On 13.02.2020, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator "SOS Infertilitatea" Association and found that it did not submit the information requested by the Supervisory Authority pursuant to art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and lit. e) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.
The operator was fined in the amount of 9529.2 lei, the equivalent of 2000 EURO, pursuant to art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from Regulation (EU) 679/2016.
The National Supervisory Authority was informed about the fact that the "SOS Infertility" Association disclosed personal data without the consent of the person concerned.
The supervisory authority requested more information from the Association regarding the reported issues, but the operator did not respond to our institution's requests. After contacting the operator by phone, the president of the association expressed his option to send the request to the Supervisory Authority by e-mail to an address indicated by him.
Since the "SOS Infertilitatea" Association did not submit the requested information by the end of the finding/sanctioning report, it was sanctioned with a fine.
At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure to send the Authority, in writing, all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
