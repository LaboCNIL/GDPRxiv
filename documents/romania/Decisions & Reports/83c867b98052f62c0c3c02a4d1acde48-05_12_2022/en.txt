To the attention of property owners' associations

In order to support property owners' associations, in relation to the fulfillment of their obligations as personal data operators according to Regulation (EU) 679/2016, our institution launched as early as January 2022 the "Guide on data processing of a personal nature carried out by the owners' associations".
We remind you that this guide is intended to clarify specific aspects of the application of personal data processing rules in the activities carried out by owners' associations, and we recommend consulting it on the website of the National Supervisory Authority, in the "Useful information" section.
