A new fine based on Law no. 506/2004

The National Supervisory Authority completed on 15.10.2019 an investigation at the operator Vodafone Romania S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. q) of Law no. 506/2004, corroborated with art. 13 para. (5) of Law no. 506/2004 and with art. 8 of OG 2/2001.
 
The operator of Vodafone Romania S.A. was sanctioned with a fine of 10,000 lei.
The sanction was applied because the operator did not consider the option of a petitioner not to receive messages with promotions, contests and any other messages other than those regarding the costs and security of calls, an option brought to the notice of the operator. Although, following his request, his unsubscription from the commercial communications sent by the operator was confirmed, he received another unsolicited message on his e-mail address from Vodafone Romania S.A., thus violating the provisions of art. 12 para. (1) of Law no. 506/2004 regarding unsolicited communications.
In this context, it was recommended that the company comply with the petitioner's request not to receive messages with promotions, contests and any other messages other than those regarding the costs and security of the calls. At the same time, the operator was recommended to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of art. 12 of Law no. 506/2004, in order to transmit commercial messages by electronic means of communication only with the prior express consent of the recipients.
