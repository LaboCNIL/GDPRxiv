Fine for GDPR violation

In May 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the company Wens Experience SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 28 para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).
The company Wens Experience SRL, as an authorized representative of an operator, was fined 7,418.55 lei (the equivalent of 1500 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the involved operator of a personal data security breach notification by its representative pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation.
During the investigation, it was found that the agent Wens Experience SRL recruited another person authorized to process the data of the operator's employees without first receiving a written, specific or general authorization from the operator, in violation of the provisions of art. 28 para. (2) of the GDPR.
We specify that, according to art. 28 para. (2) of the RGPD "The person authorized by the operator does not recruit another person authorized by the operator without first receiving a written authorization, specific or general, from the operator. In the case of a general written authorization, the person authorized by the operator informs the operator about any expected changes regarding the addition or replacement of other persons authorized by the operator, thus giving the operator the opportunity to object to these changes."
