Fine for GDPR violation

In November of the current year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator SC Nobiotic Pharma SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, SC Nobiotic Pharma SRL was penalized with a fine of 9890 lei, the equivalent of 2000 EURO, for violation of art. 58 para. (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, regarding the operator's obligation to provide the necessary information to the National Supervisory Authority.
In this context, we specify that art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) of the General Regulation on Data Protection provides the following:
"(1) Each supervisory authority has all the following powers of investigation:
a) to instruct the operator and the person authorized by the operator and, as the case may be, the representative of the operator or the person authorized by the operator to provide any information that the supervisory authority requests in order to fulfill its tasks;
e) to obtain, from the operator and the person authorized by the operator, access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of his tasks".
The investigation was carried out as a result of some complaints by which the petitioner claimed that the operator sent him unsolicited commercial SMS messages without his consent.
Since the operator did not respond to the request for information addressed by the National Supervisory Authority in the exercise of its powers, it was fined.
