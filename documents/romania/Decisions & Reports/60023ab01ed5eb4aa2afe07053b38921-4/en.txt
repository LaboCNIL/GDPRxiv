Fine for GDPR violation

In August 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at SC Raiffeisen Bank SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a), b) and d) and of art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
SC Raiffeisen Bank SA, as an agent of an operator, was sanctioned as follows:

with a warning for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and b) and of art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation;
with a fine of 9,763.60 lei (the equivalent of 2,000 EURO) for violating the provisions of paragraph 5. (1) lit. d) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.

The investigation was started as a result of a complaint made by a petitioner who complained that an operator was sending SMS text messages on his mobile phone number regarding transfers of sums of money to certain people, transfers that the petitioner did not did.
During the investigation, it was found that at the level of SC Raiffeisen Bank SA, as an authorized representative, the petitioner's phone number was erroneously entered in the application made available by the operator through which transactions were initiated at the request of customers.
It was also noted that the petitioner was not a client of SC Raiffeisen Bank SA and did not request the initiation of transactions through the operator's application.
At the same time, the Supervisory Authority found that SC Raiffeisen Bank SA, as authorized agent, processed inaccurate data (phone number) of people, occasional customers, who made money transactions through the operator's application, using the petitioner's phone number in within the framework of 44 transactions, thus violating the principle of data accuracy provided for in art. 5 para. (1) lit. d) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.
