Another fine for GDPR violation

On November 19, 2019, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Globus Score SRL (formerly Instrumental Theory SRL), as a result of a notification and found a violation of the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from the General Regulation on Data Protection, related to art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and lit. e) and in conjunction with art. 8 of the O.G. no. 2/2001.
The operator Globus Score SRL was fined 9551.800 lei, the equivalent of 2000 EURO.
Since the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, he was initially sanctioned with a warning for violating art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and lit. e) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Also, the corrective measure was applied to the operator to submit to the supervisory authority, in writing, all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
Since the operator Globus Score SRL did not implement the corrective measure ordered by the National Supervisory Authority, it was fined.
At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure of sending the Authority, in writing, all the requested information.
