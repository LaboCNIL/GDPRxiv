The National Supervisory Authority completed on 25.01.2021 an investigation at the operator ING Bank N.V. Amsterdam, Bucharest Branch and found a violation of the provisions of art. 29 and art. 32 para. (2) and (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the operator ING Bank N.V. Amsterdam was penalized for contravention with a fine of 4,874.40 lei (equivalent to 1000 EURO).
Following the receipt of a data breach notification from ING Bank N.V. Amsterdam launched an investigation and it was found that this operator sent, on two different dates, some files to a contractual partner, through a proxy company, in order to issue insurance policies. The submitted files contained outdated information, as the employees of the insurance policy monitoring department did not check and process the insurance policies in accordance with the Work Procedure, affecting 270 natural persons.
Considering these aspects, it was determined that the technical and organizational measures implemented by the operator before the incident were not sufficient, which led to the violation of the confidentiality of personal data.
