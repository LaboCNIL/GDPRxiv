Press release

Given that one year has passed since the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, we emphasize that during this period the National Supervisory Authority has given priority to guiding operators to ensure adequate compliance with the new data protection rules.
In this regard, we present the following statistical information regarding the activity of the Authority starting with May 25, 2018 and until May 24, 2019:

 9439 data protection officers were registered;
 398 notifications of personal data breaches were registered;
 5260 complaints and notifications were received;
 485 ex officio investigations were carried out;
 496 investigations were carried out into the complaints of the data subjects.

Following the investigations, 57 corrective measures were ordered and 23 warnings were issued.
The corrective measures concerned in particular:

 respecting the right to information of data subjects and providing complete information;
 communication of complete and legal answers, without undue delay to the requests of the data subjects regarding the exercise of the right of access;
 compliance with the principles of data processing, in particular those on legality, transparency and proportionality;
 the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of data, as well as the observance of such measures;
 deletion of personal data after the expiry of the storage period set by reference to the purpose for which they were collected;
 training of data controllers under the authority of the controller (employees of the controller);
 transmission of commercial messages by electronic means of communication only with the prior express consent of the user.

The main complaints and allegations received were:

 non-compliance with the legal conditions regarding the exercise of the rights of the data subjects (for example: the rights of information, access, opposition, the right to be forgotten);
 receiving unsolicited commercial messages;
 disclosure of personal data on the Internet;
 violation of the principles of personal data processing in connection with the processing of data in the banking system;
 the legal conditions regarding the installation of video surveillance systems;
 breach of the rules of confidentiality and security of the processing of personal data.

The most common data security breaches were:

 unauthorized access to personal data processed by the operator;
 erroneous transmission of invoices to the operator's customers;
 disclosure of personal data / patient data;
 loss of postal items.

Thus, after one year of application of the new data protection rules, the number of complaints and notifications has increased significantly (in 2017 3734 complaints and notifications were received), which indicates that the awareness of individuals has also increased with regard to the rights they enjoy with the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
It also emerged from the notifications of recorded security breaches that operators were concerned to implement the obligations set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and to take appropriate action in the event of incidents.
At the same time, we recommend that natural persons exercise their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to operators, namely:

 the right of access;
 the right to rectification;
 the right to be erased - "the right to be forgotten";
 the right to restrict processing;
 the right to data portability;
 the right to opposition;
the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automatic processing).

If the data subjects are dissatisfied with the way the request is resolved or have not received a response from the operator, they have the possibility to submit a complaint to the National Supervisory Authority, by filling in the electronic complaint form, available on the website. of the authority https://www.dataprotection.ro/?page=Plangeri_RGPD&lang=ro
