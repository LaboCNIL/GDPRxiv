Penalty for GDPR violation

In December 2021, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the Kaufland Romania SCS operator and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, regarding the right of access.
As such, the operator was fined 14846.4 lei (equivalent to 3000 EURO).
The investigation was initiated as a result of a complaint made by a data subject who complained that the operator did not provide a full copy of the video recordings for a certain time interval during which she was in the respective commercial premises.
During the investigation carried out, it was held that it is an obligation of the operator to communicate a video recording containing images of the subject, as a result of exercising the right of access by him, and the communication of the images can be carried out by the operator by taking blocking measures ( "blurring") of those images that could affect the rights and freedoms of other natural persons, if applicable. Therefore, the operator is obliged to adopt a series of technical and organizational measures, in order to allow the full exercise of the data subject's right of access, while respecting, at the same time, the rights of other natural persons.
As such, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not fully communicate the requested video recordings, which constitutes a violation of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
