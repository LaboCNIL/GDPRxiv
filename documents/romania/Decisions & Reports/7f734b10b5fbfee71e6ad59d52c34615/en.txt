ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
BY JAPAN

According to the provisions of art. 45 of Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, â€œthe transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organization may take place when the Commission has decided that the third country, territory or one or more specified sectors of that third country or the international organization concerned shall ensure an adequate level of protection. "
Pursuant to the above provisions, the European Commission adopted on 23 January 2019 the Implementing Decision pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. 2016/679 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, hereinafter referred to as the GDPR, on the adequate protection of personal data by Japan under the Law on the Protection of Personal Information.
On this occasion, we would like to inform you that this is the first decision taken by the European Commission since the application of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. 2016/679, which recognized a third country an adequate level of protection of personal data.
