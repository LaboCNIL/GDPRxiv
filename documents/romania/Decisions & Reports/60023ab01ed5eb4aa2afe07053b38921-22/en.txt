Fine for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed on 06.05.2021 an investigation at an Owners' Association from the municipality of Ia»ôi to which it imposed a fine, as a result of the fact that this operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) correlated with the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. (a) and (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the Owners' Association was penalized for contravention with a fine of 2463.3 lei, the equivalent of 500 EURO, pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) lit. i) from the General Data Protection Regulation, in conjunction with art. 8 of the O.G. no. 2/2001.
The investigation was carried out as a result of a complaint claiming that the operator displayed payment lists detailing the name and first name of each member of the Owners' Association. The petitioner also complained about the display of a defamatory document in which his personal data (name and surname) were mentioned.
Since the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, although he confirmed their receipt, he was fined.
Also, the Owners' Association was ordered to transmit all the requested information to the supervisory authority, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
