Fine for GDPR violation

In March 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the Owners' Association in Str. Soporului 17, Cluj-Napoca municipality, to which he applied a fine, as a result of the fact that this operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) correlated with the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. (a) and (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the owners' association was penalized with a fine of 2,474.5 lei, (the equivalent of 500 EURO).
The investigation was carried out as a result of a complaint made by a targeted person claiming that the operator had disclosed on the Facebook group of the block in which he resides images of his person from the video surveillance system managed by the association.
Since the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, although he confirmed their receipt, he was fined.
It was also decided to transmit all the requested information to the supervisory authority, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
