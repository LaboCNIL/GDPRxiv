On May 25, 2022, it will be four years since the direct application, in Romania and in the other states of the European Union, of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the protection of natural persons in terms of data processing with personal nature and regarding the free circulation of these data and the repeal of Directive 95/46/CE (GDPR).
On the occasion of the celebration of the application of this European normative act, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data organizes a series of actions aimed at increasing the awareness of the general public regarding the new rules for ensuring the protection of personal data and specific rights from which individuals benefit.

During this event, aspects related to the developments recorded regarding the effective applicability of the new personal data protection rules will be addressed in an interactive manner, mainly regarding the person in charge of personal data protection, impact assessment, respect for the rights of data subjects, ensuring data security and notifying security breaches.
