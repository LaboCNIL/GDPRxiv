Courses at the Police Academy

On May 15, 2023, representatives of the National Authority for the Supervision of Personal Data Processing held two courses for students in the final years of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza Police Academy.
The first course contained general aspects regarding the status and organization of our institution, along with the main concepts and rules for processing personal data stipulated by the General Data Protection Regulation. Also, for the complete edification of the audience, some illustrative examples from the actual activity in the field of data protection were presented.
The second course addressed the new regulations regarding the Schengen acquis, with a special focus on Law no. 76/2023 regarding the organization and operation of the national information system for alerts and Romania's participation in the Schengen Information System, as well as for the amendment and completion of the Government's Emergency Ordinance no. 194/2002 regarding the regime of foreigners in Romania, which ensures the application of the new European SIS Regulations in our country.
In this context, we note the heightened interest shown by the students materialized in the generated interactive debates.
