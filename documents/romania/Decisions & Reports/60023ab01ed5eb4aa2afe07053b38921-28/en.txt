Another fine for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed on 07.11.2019 an investigation at the operator SC CNTAR TAROM SA and found that it violated the provisions of art. 32 para. (4) in conjunction with art. 32 para. (1) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
The investigation was carried out as a result of the notification to the supervisory authority by SC CNTAR TAROM SA of 13.09.2019 regarding the violation of the security of personal data.
The operator of SC CNTAR TAROM SA was fined 95,194 lei, the equivalent of 20,000 EURO.
The sanction was applied to the operator as a result of the fact that he did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure that any natural person acting under his authority and who has access to personal data, does not process it except at his request. Correlated with this aspect, the operator did not take any adequate measures to ensure a level of security corresponding to the risk generated by unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored or processed in another way.
This situation led to the unauthorized access, by an employee, of the reservation application and the photographing of a list containing the personal data of 22 TAROM passengers/customers and the unauthorized disclosure of this list online.
