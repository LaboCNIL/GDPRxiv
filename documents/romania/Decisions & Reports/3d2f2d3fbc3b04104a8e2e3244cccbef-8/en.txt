Penalty for GDPR violation

In May of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the Vodafone Romania S.A. operator. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 3 paragraph (1) and para. (3) lit. a) and b) from Law no. 506/2004, amended and supplemented.
As such, the operator Vodafone Romania S.A. was penalized for contravention with a fine of 5000 Ron.
The investigation was started as a result of a notification of violation of the security of personal data that was sent by the operator, based on the provisions of art. 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
Within this, it was found that the related invoices of some Vodafone customers were erroneously sent to the e-mail addresses of third parties. This led to unauthorized processing and access to certain personal data of Vodafone customers, such as name, surname, telephone number, customer code, address.
Therefore, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not take adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data processing, which would guarantee that personal data can only be accessed by authorized persons for the purposes authorized by law and to protect personal data stored or transmitted against unlawful processing, access or disclosure.
On this occasion, we reiterate the need for internal training of employees by each operator regarding the personal data protection rules, a component of the mandatory organizational measures that fall to him.
