Fine for GDPR violation

In May of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator E Software Concept SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) and of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the company E Software Concept SRL was penalized as follows:

 fine in the amount of 4,945.54 lei, the equivalent of 1000 EURO, since the operator did not provide the information requested by the Supervisory Authority;
 fine in the amount of 14,837.10 lei, the equivalent of 3000 EURO, since the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.

During the investigation, it was found that, on the operator's website, at certain links, certain documents were publicly available (such as the invoices issued by E SOFTWARE CONCEPT SRL to its clients, individuals and legal entities, and the AWBs - transport documents that must accompany the shipment of parcels, issued by applicants for courier services) through which the following personal data were disclosed: name, surname, sender and recipient address, telephone number, username and password, e-mail addresses . This situation led to the loss of confidentiality of personal data of the operator's customers (natural and legal persons).
Thus, the company E SOFTWARE CONCEPT SRL was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
At the same time, the operator was fined because it did not respond to the request for information addressed by the National Supervisory Authority in the exercise of its powers.
