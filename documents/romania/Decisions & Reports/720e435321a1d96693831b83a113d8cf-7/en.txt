The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Continental Automotive Romania SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 24 and art. 32 para. (1) lit. d) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.
The operator Continental Automotive Romania SRL was fined 9,886.00 lei (the equivalent of 2000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator during 2022, under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, of a notification of a breach of the security of personal data.
During the investigation, it was noted that the operator discovered at its headquarters in Timi»ôoara, outside the official camera system, a number of 135 unapproved surveillance cameras (not configured according to internal policies) connected to unofficial camera systems, most of them being located in the middle of the area of production.
As such, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not establish adequate technical and organizational measures and did not periodically evaluate the technical and organizational measures implemented in order to establish their effectiveness in order to ensure adequate security of the processing of video images of employees and prevent the processing unauthorized, in violation of operator policies/work instructions.
