Fine for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed in May 2021 an investigation at the operator S.C. Dreamtime Call S.R.L. to which he imposed a fine, as a result of the fact that this operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) from the General Regulation on Data Protection.
As such, the operator SC Dreamtime Call S.R.L. was penalized for contravention with a fine of 9,852.2 lei (equivalent to 2000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a complaint claiming that SC Dreamtime Call S.R.L. illegally processed the personal data of a natural person (phone number), by repeatedly contacting him by phone, without prior consent.
Since the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, although he confirmed their receipt, he was fined.
Also, the operator was required to transmit to the supervisory authority all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
