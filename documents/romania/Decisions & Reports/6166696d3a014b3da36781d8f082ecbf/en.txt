 Guide no. 3/2020 on the processing of health data for scientific research in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic

The aim of this Guide is to clarify issues related to the use of health data, in particular the legal basis for processing, the subsequent use of data for scientific research, including cross-border, as well as ensuring the rights of data subjects.

 Guide no. 4/2020 on the use of location data and detection tools in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic

The document aims to highlight the conditions and principles of proportional use of location data in order to monitor the spread of the virus, respectively of the detection tools to notify the people close to other people detected as infected. On this occasion, the Committee emphasizes that the use of this data must be done voluntarily by each person and that the person's movements must not be monitored, and that the principles of necessity and proportionality must be observed in determining measures during this period.
