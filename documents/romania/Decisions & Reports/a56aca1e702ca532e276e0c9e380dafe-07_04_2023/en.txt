Penalty for GDPR violation

In March 2023, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator REGENCY COMPANY SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a), b) and c) by reference to art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
As such, the operator was penalized with a fine of 14,764.2 lei (the equivalent of 3,000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a notification sent by a natural person who reported a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
Thus, it was reported that the employees and collaborators of REGENCY COMPANY SRL are audio/video monitored at work, without their consent.
During the investigation it was found that the operator, through the video surveillance system installed in the offices and in the dining room, processed personal data with non-compliance with the principles of processing, in the absence of a legal basis for processing that would justify such an intrusion into private life of employees.
At the same time, it was noted that the operator processed the personal data of its employees (image), excessively, through this video surveillance system, the purposes declared by this operator (monitoring people's access, ensuring the security of premises and goods, the safety persons) being able to be achieved by less intrusive means for the private life of employees.
Pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) lit. d) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the operator was also ordered to take the corrective measure consisting in eliminating the use of video surveillance cameras installed in offices and the dining room, for which there is no express legal basis for processing the personal data of its own employees, according to art. 6 of the GDPR.
