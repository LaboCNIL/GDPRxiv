Penalty for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority completed in November 2022 an investigation at the operator Medicover S.R.L. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (4) in conjunction with art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the operator was fined 4,901 RON (equivalent to 1000 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a data security breach notification that was sent by Medicover S.R.L., based on the provisions of art. 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
Thus, during the investigation, it was found that the violation of the security of data processing occurred as a result of the fact that an e-mail was sent to a client containing additional documents of the contracts for the provision of medical services that belonged to other clients of the operator.
Consequently, it turned out that this breach led to the loss of the confidentiality of the processed data through unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to certain personal data, such as: name and surname, CNP, address and signature.
The National Supervisory Authority found that Medicover S.R.L. did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of confidentiality and security corresponding to the processing risk, in accordance with the provisions of art. 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
