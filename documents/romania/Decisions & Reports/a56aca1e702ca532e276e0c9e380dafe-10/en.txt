The National Supervisory Authority completed in March 2022 an investigation at the operator MAYR MELNHOF PACKAGING ROMANIA S.R.L. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. b) and c), para. (2) and art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As such, the operator was fined in the amount of 7,421.10 lei (equivalent to 1500 EURO).
The investigation was started as a result of a notification, through which it was reported that video surveillance cameras are installed in the premises of the company, in the space intended for serving the meal and in the place intended for smokers.
During the investigation, it was found that the operator MAYR MELNHOF PACKAGING ROMANIA S.R.L. he had installed a system of surveillance cameras, and some of these cameras also monitored the dining room and the smoking area.
Thus, it turned out that the operator excessively monitors employees in the dining room and smoking areas, compared to the stated purpose of ensuring the health and safety of employees and the security of property.
In this context, it was found that the images were not processed in an adequate, relevant and limited way to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (principle of data minimization), which constitutes a violation of the provisions Art. 5 para. (1) lit. b) and c), para. (2) and art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
At the same time, as part of the investigation, two corrective measures were applied to the operator, as follows:

 to ensure the compliance of personal data processing operations in the video monitoring activity, in compliance with the principle of "data minimization", referred to art. 5 para. (1) lit. c) from the General Data Protection Regulation;
 to reanalyze the capture of video images so that the activity of the company's employees in smoking areas and in the dining area is not monitored.
