During the Anniversary Debate organized by the National Authority for the Supervision of Personal Data Processing on May 24, 2019, to celebrate one year since the application of the General Regulation on Data Protection, a new Guide of our institution was launched, comprising 85 questions and edifying responses regarding proper compliance with personal data protection regulations.
Through this Question and Answer Guide, our institution proposes punctual clarifications for operators, proxies and individuals, regarding the application of the provisions of the General Regulation on Data Protection, of Law no. 190/2018 and of the Decisions issued by the National Supervisory Authority.
We hope that this will be of real benefit to the general public.
