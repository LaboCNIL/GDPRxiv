A new penalty for breaching GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Qualitance QBS SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
The operator Qualitance QBS SA was fined 4,867.50 lei (the equivalent of 1,000 EURO) for contravention.
The investigation was started following the receipt of complaints that the operator had sent information by e-mail to 295 people (candidates who provided their personal data for recruitment on the operator's website or through online applications line), thus revealing the email addresses of other recipients.
During the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not implement sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data of the persons concerned, which led to the disclosure of the e-mail addresses belonging to a number of 295 persons to the other recipients, contrary to the obligations provided by art. 32 of the GDPR.
In this sense, art. 32 also provides for the obligation of the operator to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resistance of processing systems and services.
Also, the corrective measure was applied to Qualitance QBS SA to ensure the compliance of personal data processing operations with the General Data Protection Regulation, by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures in the case of remote transmission of personal data, including under the aspect regular training of persons who process data under his authority (employees or collaborators).
