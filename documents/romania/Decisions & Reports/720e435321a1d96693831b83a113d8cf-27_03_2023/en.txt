A new penalty for breaching GDPR

In March of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation of a natural person, as an operator, during which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 6 para. (1) in conjunction with art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) from the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).
As such, the operator was fined 2,212.02 lei, the equivalent of 450 EURO.
The investigation was started as a result of a notification claiming that the operator had posted the personal data of numerous individuals in a social network.
In the course of the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority found that the respective natural person disclosed the personal data (surname, first name, place of residence) of several targeted persons through a social network, posting this data without their consent and without fulfillment of another condition provided for in art. 6 para. (1) of the GDPR.
In this context, it was noted that the operator had the obligation to comply with the principle of legality provided for in art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) from the GDPR.
