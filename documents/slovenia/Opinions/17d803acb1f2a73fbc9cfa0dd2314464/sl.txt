                        The Information Commissioner (Slovenian National Supervisory Body for Personal Data Protection, hereinafter: Slovenian DPA) received your questions regarding the Instagram account retrieval. You state that you deleted your Instagram account and consequently lost a lot of memories and contact with friends and family and now would like to retrieve your Instagram account. You have contacted Instagram but they would not help. You are asking if there could be an exception in connection with the GDPR in a context of rectification. As requested, please find below answers to your questions:In compliance with Article 16 of General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: GDPR) the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.In the case of retrieving deleted online service account the Right to rectification according to the GDPR would not seem to be appropriate data subjects’ right to represent basis for your request as your processed personal data are presumably correct (username, password, account ID etc.). You could again turn to Instagram user support centre https://help.instagram.com but according to their Policy it is not possible to reactivate deleted account or use the same user name to open another user account.For detailed information please visit https://help.instagram.com/139886812848894?helpref=faq_content.Kind regards,Mojca PrelesnikInformation Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia
