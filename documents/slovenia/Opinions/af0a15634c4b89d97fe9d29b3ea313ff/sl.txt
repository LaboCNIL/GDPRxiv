                        The Information Commissioner (Slovenian National Supervisory Body for Personal Data Protection) has received your inquiry concerning the costs of the procedure before the Slovenian court regarding a data protection breach.We wish to inform you that the costs of such procedure are determined in line with the provisions of the Court fees Law (in Slovene – Zakon o sodnih taksah). The Law is (unfortunately only in Slovene, not in English) available at the following link:http://pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4729The costs depend on the matter in question and vary form case to case so it is very difficult to make an advance quality cost estimation.Kind regards,Matej Sironič,                                                  Personal Data Protection Advisor                       Mojca PrelesnikInformation Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia
