CONTEST REFERENCE: This precept can be contested within 30 days by submitting either: - a challenge to the Data Protection Inspectorate pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, or - an appeal to the Tallinn Administrative Court pursuant to the Code of Administrative Court Procedure. Contestation of a precept does not suspend the obligation to comply with the precept or the application of the measures necessary for compliance. PENALTY OF WARRANTY: If the precept is not complied with by the specified term, the Data Protection Inspectorate shall impose a penalty payment of 3,000 euros on the addressee of the precept pursuant to subsection 40 (2) of the APA. I would like to point out that the penalty payment may be imposed repeatedly - until the precept is complied with. If the addressee does not pay the penalty payment, it is forwarded to the bailiff to start enforcement proceedings. In this case, the bailiff's fee and other enforcement costs are added to the penalty payment. FACTUAL FACTS: The Data Protection Inspectorate (AKI) is in the process of supervising compliance with the requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act. Within the framework of the state supervision procedure, AKI submitted Inquiry No. 2.1.-4/18/877 to OH Eesti OÜ on 23.08.2018, the deadline for replying to which was 29.08.2018. Within the framework of the same inquiry, the Inspectorate drew the attention of OH Eesti OÜ to the imposition of a precept and a penalty payment if the latter did not respond to the AKI's inquiry by the specified deadline. AKI sent the above-mentioned inquiry to the representative of OH Eesti OÜ to the official e-mail address of OH Eesti OÜ to xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com and to the e-mail address Xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com. The latter became known to AKI when an unidentified person responded to an inquiry submitted by AKI on 22.08.2018, which was addressed to OH Eesti OÜ. With regard to inquiries sent by e-mail, it should be noted that a document made available or transmitted electronically pursuant to § 27 (2) 3) of the Administrative Procedure Act is deemed to have been served if the document or notice is sent to an e-mail address entered in the company's commercial register. Xxxxxx.xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com. To date, the representative of OH Eesti OÜ has not responded to the AKI's inquiry and has not contacted the administrative body regarding the response to the inquiry. GROUNDS FOR THE DATA PROTECTION INSPECTORATE: Pursuant to § 30 (1), (3) and § 321 (1) of the CAA, the CA has the right to request explanations and other information, including the submission of documents necessary for the conduct of supervision proceedings. Taking into account the factual circumstances of the case and the fact that answering the inquiry of the administrative body within the supervision procedure is mandatory and that an unidentified person answered the inquiry submitted on 22.08.2018, there is reason to believe that OH Eesti OÜ and its representative Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx do not properly comply with § 23 3 the obligation to tolerate state supervision measures applied to them on the basis and pursuant to the procedure provided by law. Based on the above, AKI finds that the imposition of a mandatory precept in the matter is justified and necessary in order to ascertain the essential circumstances of the supervisory matter and to eliminate the violation. / digitally signed / Sergei Miller, Senior Inspector, authorized by the Director General
