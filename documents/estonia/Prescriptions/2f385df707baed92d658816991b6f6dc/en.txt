The Data Protection Inspectorate conducts extra-judicial proceedings against misdemeanors. FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES: In the proceedings of the Data Protection Inspectorate (Inspectorate), there is a supervisory matter in the matter of personal data protection. As part of the supervision procedure, the Inspectorate submitted an inquiry to Pizzakoju OÜ in matter no. 2.1.-19/1929 on 13.11.2019, the deadline for replying of which was 27.11.2019. On 14.11.2019, a representative of Pizzakoju OÜ sent a letter to the Inspectorate requesting an extension of the deadline for answering the inquiry until 31.01.2020 due to XXX reasons. On the basis of the mentioned application Tatari tn 39/10134 Tallinn / 627 4135 / info@aki.ee / www.aki.ee On the basis of registry code 70004235, the Inspectorate extended the deadline for replying until 31 January 2020. On 16 January 2020, the Inspectorate submitted in case no. 2.1. an additional inquiry requesting additional information in addition to the information submitted on 13.11.2019. The deadline for replying to this request was also 31.01.2020. In the additional inquiries sent on 13.11.2019 and 16.01.2020, the Data Protection Inspectorate drew attention to the imposition of a precept and a penalty payment if the Inspectorate's inquiry is not answered by the set deadline. As of today, Pizzakoju OÜ has not answered any questions that were submitted in the inquiries sent to the Inspectorate on 13.11.2019 and 16.01.2020. On 31.01.2020, a representative of Pizzakoju OÜ sent a letter to the Inspectorate requesting to extend the deadline for submitting a response until March 6, 2020 due to the need for additional inspection of the materials and clarification of the circumstances. also repeatedly encountered. 04.06.2019 Pizzakoju OÜ wanted to extend the deadline for replying in connection with the holiday period and disciplinary proceedings. On 24.09.2019, the representative of Pizzakoju OÜ requested an extension of the deadline for replying due to the heavy workload. And after the aforementioned applications for extension also the above applications on 14.11.2019 and 31.01.2020 respectively. Pizzakoju OÜ has also failed to respond to previous inquiries in a timely manner during the supervision procedure, which is why the Inspectorate has made repeated inquiries. The inquiry submitted on 30.05.2019 was not answered in time, which is why we made a repeated inquiry in this regard on 10.07.2019. In addition, an application for an extension was missed between the two inquiries, ie Pizzakoju OÜ requested an extension of the deadline for replying, which the Inspectorate did. However, Pizzakoju OÜ also did not reply for an additional period. The inquiry sent to the Inspectorate on 08.08.2019 was also not answered in time, which is why we made a repeated inquiry on 29.08.2019. GROUNDS FOR THE DATA PROTECTION INSPECTORATE: Pursuant to § 58 (1) of the Personal Data Protection Act and Article 58 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Inspectorate has the right to request explanations and other information, including documents necessary for supervision. Taking into account the factual circumstances and the fact that it is mandatory to respond to inquiries made within the supervision procedure of the administrative body, but Pizzakoju OÜ has not responded to the Inspectorate's inquiries in time, the Inspectorate considers that issuing a mandatory precept in this matter is In the present case, the supervision procedure has also lasted an unreasonably long time, primarily due to the fact that Pizzakoju OÜ has not responded to the inquiries of the Inspectorate in time and has repeatedly requested to extend the deadlines for replying. Pizzakoju OÜ has also failed to respond in a timely manner in a situation where the Inspectorate has given a longer deadline for replying. Nevertheless, the Inspectorate has repeatedly responded to requests for extensions. However, the administrative procedure must be carried out as efficiently as possible, including as quickly as possible, which is why the Inspectorate cannot extend the deadlines for answering indefinitely and prepare repeated inquiries with the same questions, but with a new deadline. Considering the above, and also the fact that Pizzakoju OÜ wanted to extend the deadline for replying until March 6, 2020, we set the deadline for compliance with the precept as March 6, 2020. / digitally signed / Raiko Kaur Senior Inspector on behalf of the Director General
