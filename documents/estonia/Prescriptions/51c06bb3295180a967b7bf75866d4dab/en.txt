The Data Protection Inspectorate conducts extra-judicial proceedings against misdemeanors. FACTUAL FACTS:. One of the neighbors concerned lodged a complaint with the Inspectorate. 9/30/2020 The second concerned neighbor filed a complaint with the Inspectorate. 10/15/2020 The Inspectorate sent a proposal to the processor. 11/5/2020 The Inspectorate sent a repeated proposal to the processor. GROUNDS FOR THE DATA PROTECTION INSPECTORATE: Proposals have been sent repeatedly to the address xxx and postal address xxx provided in the Population Register of the processor. The Inspectorate has thereby fulfilled the obligation arising from subsection 40 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act to give the participant in the proceeding the opportunity to submit his or her opinion and objections on the matter before issuing the administrative act. Pursuant to ยง 58 (1) of the Personal Data Protection Act and Article 58 (1) (a) of the General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data, and subject to point (e) of the same paragraph, the Supervision Authority has the right to request explanations and other information, including documents necessary for supervision. Taking into account the factual circumstances and the fact that it is mandatory to respond to an inquiry made within the supervision procedure of an administrative authority, but the person has not responded to the Inspectorate's repeated proposal, the Inspectorate considers that a mandatory precept is necessary to ascertain to bring. If a person has problems in responding to the Inspectorate within the specified term, he or she will be able to explain to the supervisory authority which objective circumstances were the obstacle. However, simply not answering is not acceptable.
