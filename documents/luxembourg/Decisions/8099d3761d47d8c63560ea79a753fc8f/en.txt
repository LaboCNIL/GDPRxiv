(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter: the “GDPR”), the Commission

 

 

National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter: the “National Commission” or the

“CNPD”) has decided to launch a thematic survey campaign on the function of the DPO.

Thus, 25 audit procedures were opened in 2018, concerning both the private sector and the

public sector.

2.

In particular, the National Commission decided by deliberation n°[…] of 14

September 2018 to open an investigation in the form of a data protection audit

with Company A located at […], L-[…] and registered in the Trade and

Luxembourg companies under the number[…] (hereinafter: the “controlled”) and to designate Mr. Christophe

Buschmann as chief investigator. Said deliberation specifies that the investigation relates to the

compliance of the controlled with section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR.

 

3.

According to Article 3 of its articles of association, the purpose of the control is [to carry out all transactions

of insurance and reinsurance of the “Life” branch […].

 

4.

By letter dated September 17, 2018, the head of investigation sent a questionnaire

preliminary to the control to which the latter replied by email of October 8, 2018. A visit

on site took place on February 4, 2019. Following these exchanges, the head of investigation drew up the report

audit report no.[…] (hereinafter: the “audit report”).

 

5.

It appears from the audit report that in order to verify the organization's compliance with the

section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR, the head of investigation has defined eleven control objectives,

to know :

 

1) Ensure that the body subject to the obligation to appoint a DPO has done so;

2) Ensure that the organization has published the contact details of its DPO;

3) Ensure that the organization has communicated the contact details of its DPO to the CNPD;

4) Ensure that the DPO has sufficient expertise and skills to

carry out its missions effectively;

5) Ensure that the missions and tasks of the DPO do not lead to a conflict of interest;

6) Ensure that the DPO has sufficient resources to carry out effectively

of its missions;

7) Ensure that the DPO is able to carry out his duties with a sufficient degree

autonomy within their organization;

________________________________________________________________________

8) Ensure that the organization has put in place measures for the DPO to be associated with

all questions relating to data protection;

9) Ensure that the DPO fulfills his mission of providing information and advice to the

controller and employees;

10) Ensure that the DPO exercises adequate control over data processing within

of his body;

11) Ensure that the DPO assists the controller in carrying out the

impact analyzes in the event of new data processing.

6.

By letter dated October 24, 2019 (hereinafter: the “statement of objections”), the head

of investigation informed the control of the breaches of the obligations provided for by the RGPD that it

found during his investigation. The audit report was attached to that letter.

 

7.

In particular, the head of investigation noted in the statement of objections

breaches of





the obligation to communicate the contact details of the DPO to the supervisory authority2;

the obligation to ensure that the missions and tasks of the DPO do not lead to

conflict of interest 3.

 

8.

By email of November 27, 2019, the controller took a position on the breach noted

by the Head of Investigation regarding the obligation to ensure that the tasks and tasks of the DPO

do not involve conflicts of interest.

 

9.

On August 3, 2020, the head of investigation sent an additional letter to the controller to

the statement of objections by which he informs the controller of the corrective measure he

proposes to the National Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereinafter: "the" formation

restricted”) to adopt.

 

10.

By email of August 5, 2020, the controller sent the head of investigation his

comments on the additional letter to the statement of objections.

 
The case was on the agenda of the restricted committee meeting of June 16, 2021.

11.

In accordance with Article 10.2. b) the internal regulations of the National Commission,

the head of investigation and the control presented oral observations on the case and responded

 

 

to the questions posed by the Restricted Committee. The controller spoke last.

II.

Place

A. On the failure to communicate the contact details of the DPO to the authority

control

1. On the principles

12.

Article 37.7 of the GDPR provides for the obligation for the organization to communicate the

contact details of the DPO to the supervisory authority. Indeed, it results from Article 39.1. e) GDPR

that the DPO acts as a point of contact for the supervisory authority so it is important

that the latter has the contact details of the DPO.

 

13.

The DPO Guidelines explain in this respect that this requirement

aims to ensure that “supervisory authorities can easily and directly contact

with the DPO without having to go to another department of the organisation” 4.

 

14.

It should also be noted that the CNPD published on its website as of May 18

2018 a form allowing organizations to send it the contact details of their

DPD.

2. In this case

15.

It appears from the audit report that, for the head of investigation to consider objective 3

as filled in by the controller as part of this audit campaign, the head of investigation

expects the organization to have communicated the contact details of its DPO by 25 May 2018

at the CNPD.

 

16.

According to the statement of objections, page 2, “[i]t appears from the investigation that the

DPO declaration form was sent to the CNPD on September 28, 2018. The

communication was therefore made late. »

  

17.

The auditee did not return to this breach in its position of 27

November 2019, nor during subsequent exchanges with the CNPD.

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

4/10


 
18.

The Restricted Committee notes that the GDPR has been applicable since May 25, 2018 from

 

 

so that the obligation to communicate the contact details of the DPO to the supervisory authority exists

since that date. Thus, the communication of the contact details of the DPO to the CNPD dated

September 28, 2018 was late.

 

19.

In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee concludes that Article 37.7 of the GDPR has no

not respected by the controller.

 

 

B. On the breach relating to the obligation to ensure that the other missions and

tasks of the DPO do not give rise to a conflict of interest

 

1. On the principles

20.

According to Article 38.6 of the GDPR, “[the DPO] may perform other missions and tasks. the

responsible for the treatment or the processor ensures that these missions and tasks

do not involve a conflict of interest”.

 

21.

The guidelines for DPOs5 specify that "the DPO may not practice on the

within the organization a function that leads it to determine the purposes and means of the

processing of personal data”. According to the guidelines, “[i]n good standing

general, among the functions likely to give rise to a conflict of interest within

organization may include senior management functions (e.g. director

general, operational director, director

financial, chief medical officer,

responsible for

marketing department, human resources manager or service manager

IT), but also other roles at a lower level of the organizational structure

if these functions or roles involve determining the purposes and means of the processing.

In addition, there may also be a conflict of interest, for example, if an external DPO is called

to represent the data controller or the processor before the courts in

cases relating to data protection issues.

 

Depending on the activities, size and structure of the body, it can be good

practical for data controllers or processors:

 to identify the functions that would be incompatible with those of DPD;

                                                 
5 WP 243 v.01, version revised and adopted on April 5, 2017, pp.19-20

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

5/10



 

 establish internal rules to this effect, in order to avoid conflicts of interest;

 include a more general explanation regarding conflicts of interest;

 to declare that the DPO has no conflict of interest with regard to his function as

DPD, with the aim of raising awareness of this requirement;

 to provide guarantees in the organization's internal regulations, and to ensure that

that the vacancy notice for the function of DPD or the service contract is

sufficiently precise and detailed to avoid any conflict of interest. In this context, it

should also be kept in mind that conflicts of interest may take

different forms depending on whether the DPO is recruited internally or externally. »

2. In this case

 
 

 

 

22.

It appears from the audit report that, for the head of investigation to consider objective 5

as achieved by the auditee as part of this audit campaign, he expects that,

in the event that the DPO performs other functions within the audited body, these functions

do not lead to a conflict of interest, in particular through the exercise of functions that would lead the

DPD to determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

The head of the investigation also expects the person checked to have carried out an analysis as to

the existence of a possible conflict of interest at DPO level.

 

23.

According to the Statement of Objections, page 3, “[i]t appears from the investigation that the DPO is

also Head of Compliance, Money Laundering Reporting Officer. This other function

involves a risk of conflict of interest, in particular in the context of AML processing of the

compliance department. Indeed, the DPO Guidelines of the Working Party

"Article 29" on data protection indicate that the DPO cannot exercise within

of the organization a function which leads it to determine the purposes and means of the processing

of personal data. [The controller] informed the CNPD that in the event of any

conflicts of interest in the AML processing of the Compliance department, the processing

concerned would then be countersigned by the hierarchical superior of the DPO. Nevertheless, the

DPD remains involved in the implementation of personal data processing

as part of his duties as Head of Compliance. During the investigation, the CNPD did not

became aware of other elements making it possible to address this risk, such as the

appointment of an alternate DPO (outside the AML department) who would be in charge

analyze AML processing. »

24.

By email of November 25, 2019, the control indicated that two alternate delegates

 

 

have been appointed, namely the “Chief Risk Officer (for the processing of personal data

of the Compliance department)” as well as a “Senior Compliance Specialist (for all

processing of personal data other than that of the Compliance department)”.

 

25.

The auditee also transmitted, with its position paper of November 27, 2019,

several internal documents concerning the measures taken following the breach noted by

the head of investigation; these documents make it possible in particular to verify the information provided

by the auditee, in his email of November 25, 2019, relating to the designation of two

alternate delegates.

 

26.

The CNPD was then informed, on March 19, 2021, of the appointment of a new

DPD, as of April 1, 2021, who was previously the alternate delegate “for all

processing of personal data other than that of the Compliance department”. During

At the hearing of June 16, 2021, the auditee clarified that, due to this appointment, the risk of

conflict of interest that had been identified by the head of investigation no longer exists, the new DPO

not exercising the function of “Head of compliance”.

 

27.

Nevertheless, if measures have been taken by the controller in the direction of implementing

compliance, it should be noted that these were decided during the investigation.

 

28.

Therefore, the Restricted Committee concludes that Article 38.6 of the GDPR has not been complied with

by the controlled.

 

 

III.

On corrective measures

 

A. Principles

29. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the

National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data protection, the National Commission has the powers provided for in Article

58.2 GDPR:

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

7/10


 

 

 

(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this

settlement;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this

settlement;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

this Regulation;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,

specifically and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

f)

impose a temporary or permanent limitation, including a ban, on the

treatment;

30.

The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the facts taken into account in the context of the

 

 

this Decision are those found at the start of the investigation. Nevertheless, the procedures

performed by the controller to comply with the GDPR during the procedure

of investigation or to remedy the shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the

statement of objections are taken into account by the Restricted Committee within the framework of the

any corrective measures to be taken.

B. In the instant case

 

1. As to the call to order

 

31.

Pursuant to Article 58.2.b) of the GDPR, the CNPD may call a manager to order

of the processing or a processor when the processing operations have led to a violation

provisions of the GDPR.

32.

Considering that the controlled has violated articles 37.7 and 38.6 of the GDPR, the

Restricted Committee considers that it is justified to issue a call to order against him.

2. Regarding the taking of corrective measures

33.

In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 3 August 2020, the

head of investigation proposes that the restricted committee take the following corrective measure:

“a) Order the implementation of measures ensuring that the various missions and

duties, current or past, of the person performing the function of DPO do not entail

no conflicts of interest in accordance with the requirements of article 38 paragraph 6 of the

GDPR. Although several ways can be implemented, one of the

possibilities would be the involvement of a third party, benefiting from the skills

necessary, for the review of processing for which there is a conflict of interest (in

occurrence for AML/KYC processing). »

34. As to the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under a) of point 33 of the

this Decision and with reference to point 30 of this Decision, the training

restricted takes into account the steps taken by the audited in order to comply

to the provisions of article 38.6 of the GDPR. More specifically, it takes note of the facts

following:

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

9/10



 

- With regard to the violation of Article 38.6 of the GDPR, the Restricted Committee finds

that a new DPO has been appointed, as of 1 April 2021, and that this new DPO

does not exercise the function of “Head of compliance”. The Restricted Committee considers as soon as

when there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation

(a) of point 33 of this Decision.

 
 

 

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to retain the breaches of Articles 37.7 and 38.6 of the GDPR;

 

- issue a call to order against Company A with regard to the violation of the

articles 37.7 and 38.6 of the GDPR.

 

Thus decided in Belvaux on October 13, 2021.
