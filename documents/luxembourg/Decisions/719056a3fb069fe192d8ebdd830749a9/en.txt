Facts and procedure

1.

During the second half of 2018, the judicial administration, represented by

the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (hereinafter: the "General Prosecutor's Office"), had

proposed to hire three full-time government employees for the period of September 17

2018 to September 16, 2020. More specifically, these were two positions of referendum and

of a post of referendary-librarian.

2.

By letter dated July 26, 2019, the National Commission for the Protection of

data (hereinafter: the “National Commission” or the “CNPD”) has been seized of a

complaint of Mr […] (hereinafter: the “complainant”) having applied for two of the three

aforementioned positions. The complaint was lodged through its agent,

Master Fränk Rollinger, lawyer at the Court.

 
The Claimant states that during a job interview that took place on September 26

3.

2018, he was confronted with information concerning him registered in the database

“Justice criminal chain known as JU-CHA” (hereinafter: the “JU-CHA database”). The

JU-CHA database is an "internal application for the central management of

all the services of the judiciary dealing with criminal cases [which] groups together in one

sole application most of the computerized processing, accessible in whole or in part, by

law enforcement agencies dealing with criminal cases”.

 
In essence, the complainant believes that his personal data has been

4.

stored in the JU-CHA database for an excessive period of time, this

violation of article 3, paragraph 1, letter e) of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data in

criminal matters and national security.

 
Furthermore, the complainant maintains that his personal data were

5.

used in a manner incompatible with the purposes for which they were collected.

 

6.

During its deliberation session on August 8, 2019, the National Commission sitting

in plenary session (hereafter: the “plenary session”) had decided to open an investigation

with the General Prosecutor's Office on the basis of article 37 of the law of 1 August 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime

on data protection and to appoint Mr Marc Lemmer as head of investigation.

 

7.

The plenary session had also decided that the investigation carried out by the CNPD

was limited to aspects of the processing of personal data relating to the procedure

of recruitment to the General Prosecutor's Office and that the part of the complaint concerning the article

3, paragraph 1, letter e) of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of persons

with regard to the processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as

that in matters of national security was transmitted to the judicial control authority under

of Article 44, paragraph 4, of this law (see also point 18 of this document).

8.

The investigation was carried out pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 1, letter b) of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the

protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data

personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC

(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter: the “GDPR”). By mail dated 4

September 2019, a questionnaire was sent to the General Prosecutor's Office to which the latter

replied by letter of September 27, 2019. A site visit then took place on September 14, 2019.

November 2019.

 

9.

By letter of January 23, 2020, the head of investigation communicated to the General Prosecutor's Office

the complaints made against him, namely the lack of a basis of lawfulness relating to the processing of

personal data from the JU-CHA database as part of the

recruitment of a State employee as well as non-compliance with the transparency requirement vis-à-vis

towards the persons concerned.

 

10.

On January 28, 2020, the General Prosecutor's Office informed the head of investigation that the letter from the

January 23, 2020 did not call for any comments on his part, while setting out the measures he

would have taken in the meantime to respond to the shortcomings noted by the head of the investigation.

The National Data Protection Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereafter

after: the “restricted committee”) takes note of this and refers to this subject to points 45 and 46 of

the current.

11.

By letter dated July 21, 2020, additional to the statement of objections of July 23

January 2020, the head of investigation informed the General Prosecutor's Office of the corrective measures he

proposed to the Restricted Committee to adopt under Article 58, paragraph 2 of the GDPR.

The General Prosecutor's Office then replied to the head of investigation by letter dated July 23, 2020 that the

corrective measures proposed did not call for any comments on his part.

12.

The case was examined by the Restricted Committee during its meeting on 23

October 2020. In accordance with Article 10, point 2, letter b) of the internal rules of

the National Commission, the head of the investigation presented oral observations on the case

while the General Prosecutor's Office had informed the President of the National Commission by

email of September 21, 2020 that he did not intend to attend this meeting.

Place

II.1

As to the reasons for the decision

A. On the competence of the National Commission

13.

According to article 4 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the Commission

national authority for data protection and the general data protection regime,

the National Commission is responsible for controlling and verifying whether the data submitted to a

processing are processed in accordance with the provisions:

1) GDPR;

2) the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the

data protection and the general data protection regime;

3) of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to

the processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in

matters of national security;

4) legal texts providing specific provisions for the protection

personal data.

14.

Article 5 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission

for data protection and the general data protection regime specifies

that the CNPD “is not competent to control the data processing operations

of a personal nature carried out by the courts of the judiciary, including the Ministry

public, and of the administrative order in the exercise of their jurisdictional functions”.

15.

In this case, the processing of personal data which is the subject of the

complaint and investigation were carried out as part of a recruitment process by

the General Prosecutor's Office, i.e. the public ministry.

16.

Such data processing does not fall within the jurisdictional functions of the Public Prosecutor's Office

general, so that the CNPD considers itself competent to analyze and verify the compliance of

processing operations related to the recruitment process with the legislation relating to the

data protection and, more particularly with the GDPR, the law of 1 August 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime

on data protection and the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of persons

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

with regard to the processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as

than in terms of national security.

17.

It is common ground that personal data appearing in the

JU-CHA database – which a priori can only be processed for the purposes

relating to the jurisdictional functions of the judicial authorities – were consulted and

used in the context of a recruitment procedure, the processing of which pursues a specific purpose

administrative and therefore a non-jurisdictional purpose.

18.

It is also in this sense that the CNPD sent a letter dated August 26, 2019

to the judicial control authority to inform it that it considered itself competent for a section or

at least only for certain aspects of the complaint, just as it considered that

the judicial control authority was competent to analyze another aspect of the complaint.

The letter in question had, among other things, the following content:

“The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) has been seized of a
complaint lodged by Mr […] on July 30, 2019 concerning the operations
processing of personal data from the “JU-CHA” database in the
framework of the process of recruitment of a "referendary-librarian" by the administration
judicial.

The CNPD considers that the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of a
recruitment, even if implemented by the public prosecutor, do not come under the "functions
jurisdictional” thereof and are therefore subject to the control of the CNPD. The CNPD is
thus competent for the investigation of the part of the complaint relating to the processing carried out
in this recruitment process.

It appears from the complaint that the complainant considers that the rules concerning the storage
data governing the “JU-CHA” database is contrary to Article 3 (1) (e)
of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in matters of
national security. However, according to the assessment of the CNPD, these questions relate
presumably to the “jurisdictional functions” of the courts of the judiciary.

Therefore, the CNPD, in accordance with article 40 paragraph 2 and article 44 paragraph 4
of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in matters of
national security, takes the liberty of forwarding to you the complaint lodged by Mr […]
with regard to data processing operations carried out by the courts of
the judiciary in the exercise of their judicial functions.

We would also like to inform you that Mr. […] has been informed of this transmission

in accordance with article 44 paragraph 4 of the said law. »

B. On the breach of the purpose principle enshrined in Article 5.1 b) of the GDPR,

combined with the breach of Articles 5.1 c) (principle of minimization) and 6

(lawfulness principle) of the GDPR

19.

In its capacity as controller, the General Prosecutor's Office is required to respect

the data protection principles and must be able to demonstrate that these are

complied with (principle of accountability – Article 5(2) GDPR).

20.

He must, moreover, still in his capacity as controller, put in place

implement all the necessary measures for this purpose (Article 24 of the GDPR).

21.

Article 5, paragraph 1, letter b) of the GDPR enshrines the principle of finality, i.e.

the requirement that the data be collected for specific, explicit and

legitimate and not further processed in a manner inconsistent with these

purposes.

22.

The purpose principle is a cornerstone of the processing of personal data.

personal character. Indeed, it is in the light of the purpose that other

principles also enshrined in Article 5 of the GDPR (the principle of minimization – in the terms

of which only adequate data relevant and limited to what is necessary with regard to

of the purpose may be processed (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c) of the GDPR)), as well as to

Article 6 of the GDPR (principle of lawfulness).

23.

 The CNPD therefore considers that it follows from the economy of the aforementioned articles that the

principles of finality, minimization and legality are intrinsically linked. The CNPD

will therefore analyze these principles successively below, just as it considers that

the final assessment of these principles, for the purposes of this decision, must be made

in general.

24.

If the complainant does not question the existence of the JU-CHA database

as such which, a priori, can find a legitimate basis on the basis of the law of August 1

2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data

personal character in criminal matters as well as in matters of national security, he considers

however that “(…) certainly certain magistrates and members of the Public Ministry may resort

to the data processed and stored in the JuCha, but can only do so if

that they act within the framework of their jurisdictional functions, and even that within the framework

prosecution of facts likely to constitute offenses respectively at the level of

the execution of criminal penalties. In this case, the job interview conducted by a

representative of the Public Ministry and magistrates obviously does not constitute, as far as the

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

concerns, an act carried out within the framework of their jurisdictional functions but constitutes neither

more or less than an act performed in the context of an administrative function, in this case a

recruitment of three future state employees. The Claimant continues that the use of his

data in the JU-CHA database “as part of a procedure of

recruitment for one or more government employee positions is simply unacceptable,

while such use is irretrievably outside the scope of use

narrowly delimited, and rightly so, by the legislator. »

25.

If it is not up to the CNPD to decide on the purposes and legitimacy of the

processing of personal data in the JU-database

CHA which pursues a judicial or jurisdictional purpose2, the fact remains that the

National Commission is competent to verify the compatibility between the purposes of the file

JU-CHA and the administrative purpose pursued in the recruitment procedure

of a state employee.

26.

If, a priori, the purpose of collecting and using personal data

in the context of a recruitment procedure appears to be determined, explicit and legitimate

(article 5, paragraph 1, letter b) of the GDPR), it is still necessary to check how, i.e.

by which processing operations, these data were collected or obtained (source of the

data). Some personal data was collected directly from the

claiming. However, other data concerning his person were collected indirectly,

know through the JU-CHA database. As such, it is important to analyze whether the

principle of minimization or proportionality of data, with regard to the purpose

"presumed legitimate", has been respected.

27.

Indeed, under the principle of data minimization or proportionality,

pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, personal data

must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. The extent of the data collected and processed, in this case,

or the question of whether data has been excessively processed is assessed by

relation to the purpose. As indicated above, the Restricted Committee recalls that the principles

purpose and proportionality are intrinsically linked.

28.

If the data collected directly from the person concerned does not seem

not pose a problem in terms of proportionality, it is otherwise with the data

collected and collected indirectly through the JU-CHA database. The General Prosecutor's Office

                                                 
2 This competence lies with the judicial control authority, as explained under point II.A.
________________________________________________________________________

justifies the consultation, verification and use of this data as follows (cf.

statement of objections, page 5):

 “To be able to estimate the degree of morality given the confidentiality of

information that the candidate is called upon to process in the context of his work,

in particular the degree of honesty of a candidate in relation to the question of whether he has

already had contact with the law.

 Avoid recruiting candidates for whom business is in progress

of instruction given the confidential nature of the files and the data

personal that they would have to deal with in the event of hiring. »

29.

In view of the developments above, it must be concluded that the use of data,

initially processed for judicial or jurisdictional purposes, is incompatible with the

subsequent processing of these data for an administrative purpose in the context of a

recruitment process and moreover excessive, unless a legislative provision

does not authorize this data processing and does not make the two purposes compatible

distinct, which the Restricted Committee proposes to examine in the developments which

follow.

30.

The GDPR provides for the possibility that processing for another purpose, in this case

incompatible with that for which the data was initially collected, may be

based on national law (Article 6 GDPR).

31.

The General Prosecutor's Office indicated in its written responses of 27 September 2019 that it

considers that the consultation of the JU-CHA database within the framework of the procedure

recruitment of a state employee is based on article 3, paragraph 1, letter c) of the law

of March 25, 2015 determining the regime and compensation for State employees. In

under this provision, the employee must offer the guarantees of morality required to be

admitted to state service.

32.

During the on-site visit on November 14, 2019, the General Prosecutor's Office however

claimed not to search the JU-CHA database for others

state administrations as part of the verification of morality in their process of

recruitment of state employees. This difference in treatment is justified in view of the

specificity of the positions to be filled within the judicial administration as well as the data

to which future employees are likely to have access.

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

33.

The Restricted Committee finds that the legal provision invoked by the Public Prosecutor's Office

general, namely article 3, paragraph 1, letter c) of the amended law of 25 March 2015

determining the regime and the allowances of State employees, does not expressly allow

the Public Prosecutor's Office to consult the JU-CHA database, in order to use the data therein

appearing to assess the morality of candidates for a position as a State employee in the context of

of the recruitment process.

34.

The Restricted Committee comes to the conclusion that there is therefore no legal text

authorizing the consultation of the JU-CHA database within the framework of the purpose

administration of a procedure for recruiting a State employee within

judicial administration and which would therefore make it compatible with the initial purpose

of the JU-CHA database which is judicial.

35.

In support of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee concludes that Article 5, paragraph

1, letter b), in conjunction with Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter c) and 6 have not been complied with by the

Prosecutor General.

C. On the breach of the obligation to process the data in accordance with the

principle of transparency enshrined in Articles 5.1 a), 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR

36.

Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) of the GDPR, personal data

personnel must in particular be treated transparently with regard to the person

concerned.

37.

The principle of transparency implies that the controller must provide the

data subject a certain amount of information, in accordance with Articles 12, 13 and

14 GDPR. Article 14 of the GDPR lists the information to be provided when the data to be

personal character have not been collected from the data subject, i.e. from

indirect way.

38.

According to the statement of objections of January 23, 2020, pages 8 and 9, “[t]his is apparent from the

elements of the investigation that the General Prosecutor's Office did not specifically inform the candidates

of the verification concerning them in JU-CHA” so that “[i]t should be kept in mind

against the data controller a breach of the obligations provided for in Articles

5 (1) (a) and 14 GDPR”.

39.

The Restricted Committee notes that it is not disputed by the General Prosecutor's Office that the

candidates were not informed of the verification of their personal data

________________________________________________________________________

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

in the JU-CHA database and the addition of this information in their file of

application in connection with the recruitment procedure.

40.

In view of the above, the panel concludes that Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a)

and 14 of the GDPR have not been complied with by the General Prosecutor's Office.

II.2.

On corrective measures

41.

In accordance with article 12 of the law of August 1, 2018 on the organization of the

National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data, the National Commission has the powers provided for in Article 58 of the GDPR.

42.

Under Article 58(2) of the GDPR, the CNPD has the power to:

(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

b) call to order a data controller or a processor when the operations

of processing have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

settlement;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

(f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of the processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the restriction

of the processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these measures to the

recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed pursuant

of Article 17, paragraph 2, and of Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or direct the certification body to withdraw a certification

issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the certification body not to

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

10/15

 

 

 

not issue a certification if the requirements applicable to the certification are not or no longer

satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty pursuant to section 83, in addition to or in addition to

put in place the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the specific characteristics of

each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a country

third party or an international organization.

43.

These measures also include the power to "impose an administrative fine in

application of Article 83 (…)”. However, article 48, paragraph 1, of the law of 1 August 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime

on data protection specifies that “[t]he CNPD may impose fines

administrative procedures as provided for in Article 83 of the [GDPR], except against the State or

municipalities. ".

44.

In its additional letter of July 21, 2020 to the statement of objections of the

January 23, 2020, the head of investigation proposed the following corrective measures:

“a) A call to order against the controlled for violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1,

letter a), and of article 6 of the GDPR, insofar as the controller has consulted the data

concerning Mr […] contained in the JU-CHA system, within the framework of the

recruitment of a legal secretary under the status of state employee, and this without a basis

lawful and without prior information to the person concerned;

b) A ban on consulting the data contained in the JU-CHA system, in the

framework of the recruitment of a new State employee or a new civil servant for

administration

judicial, in

lack of basis

legal allowing a

such

counseling;

c) A warning to the control that, in the context of any recruitment of a

new employee of the State or a new civil servant for the judicial administration,

candidates for recruitment must be informed in advance of the consultation

of their personal data, under penalty of violation of the provisions of the

GDPR relating to the mandatory information of the data subject. »

45.

 This decision refers to the situation as it arose when the facts

subject of the complaint took place, namely September 26, 2018, the date on which

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

11/15

 

 

 

the job interview took place. The Restricted Committee notes that, in its letter of 28

January 2020, the Public Prosecutor's Office outlines the measures it claims to have taken to respond

to the shortcomings noted by

the head of investigation. Modifications

intervened

later, even if they finally allow to establish the compliance of the person in charge

of the processing, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

46.

 In any event, the measures mentioned by the General Prosecutor's Office in its letter

of January 28, 2020 concern, on the one hand, the opinions issued by the judicial authorities as to

the good repute and morality of citizens and, on the other hand, the recruitment of legal attachés.

However, the subject of the investigation and of this decision relates to the consultation of the bank of

JU-CHA data as part of the recruitment procedure for a state employee.

A. The call to order

47.

Pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter b) of the GDPR, the CNPD may remind

order a controller or a processor when the processing operations

resulted in a violation of the provisions of the GDPR.

48.

Given that the Public Prosecutor's Office consulted the personal data

complainant's personnel in the JU-CHA database in violation of Articles 5,

paragraph 1, letters a), b) and c), 6 and 14 of the GDPR, the Restricted Committee considers that it is

justified to issue a call to order against the General Prosecutor's Office.

B. Prohibition of processing

49.

Pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter f) of the GDPR, the National Commission

may impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of the processing.

In view of the violation of articles 5, paragraph 1, letter b), 5, paragraph 1, letter c) and 6 of the

GDPR, noted in this decision, the Restricted Committee considers that there is reason to

prohibit consultation of the JU-CHA database within the framework of the

recruitment of a state employee. This prohibition shall apply until a

legal provision, where applicable, will expressly authorize the Public Prosecutor's Office to consult and

use the data in the JU-CHA database for recruitment purposes

of a State employee within the judicial administration.

50.

For all intents and purposes, the Restricted Committee finds that the prohibition proposed by the

head of investigation also targets the recruitment of civil servants. However, the investigation based on

this decision only analyzed the consultation of personal data in

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. 3691 conducted with the General Prosecutor's Office of the Grand Duchy of

Luxemburg

12/15

 

 

 

the JU-CHA database as part of the recruitment of a state employee so

that this decision cannot rule on the recruitment procedure under the

civil servant status.

C. Warning from the data controller

51.

With regard to the warning that the head of the investigation proposes to issue to

against the Public Prosecutor's Office on the basis of Article 58, paragraph 2, letter a) of the GDPR, the

restricted committee considers that in view of the ban imposed, it is superfluous to

issue such a warning.

D. Erasure of personal data

52.

Pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter g) of the GDPR, the CNPD may order

the erasure of personal data when they have been processed

illicit.

53.

 In view of the violation of articles 5, paragraph 1, letter b), 5, paragraph 1, letter c)

and 6 of the GDPR, noted in this decision, the Restricted Committee considers it necessary

to order the Public Prosecutor's Office to erase the personal data resulting from the

JU-CHA database which can be found, where applicable, in its recruitment files

relating to people who have applied for a state employee position.

E. Publication of the decision

54.

Under the terms of article 52 of the law of August 1, 2018 on the organization of the

National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data, “[t]he CNPD may order, at the expense of the sanctioned person, the publication

in full or in extracts from its decisions, with the exception of decisions relating to the pronouncement

periodic penalty payments, and provided that:

1° the means of appeal against the decision have been exhausted; and

2° the publication is not likely to cause disproportionate harm to the parties involved. »

55.

The Restricted Committee finds that both the complainant's representative and the Public Prosecutor's Office

general gave some publicity to the case giving rise to this decision,

in particular by their declarations made in the national press, so that the publication

of the decision is not likely to cause disproportionate prejudice to the parties involved.
