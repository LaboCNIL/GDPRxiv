European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 relating to the protection of natural persons

with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such

data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter "GDPR") and the law of 1 August

2018, in particular the compliance of the monitoring measures implemented through

video surveillance and geolocation systems, where applicable, installed by

public institution A.

3. On February 1, 2019, CNPD agents carried out a visit to the

the premises of the public establishment A. The decision of the National Commission for

data protection sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation (hereafter:

“Restricted Training”) will be limited to processing controlled by CNPD agents

and carried out by public institution A.

video surveillance system, but that he has not installed a geolocation device

in his vehicles.1

6. According to the explanations provided to CNPD officials, it was confirmed that the

CCTV system is managed by the controlled as responsible for the

processing2 and that the purposes of setting up the video surveillance system are

protecting company assets and securing access3. It appears from the mail

of the audit of April 4, 20194 that other purposes are the safety of staff, customers

and visitors and accident prevention.

7. On March 19, 2019, CNPD officials sent report no. […] and

a letter to the controller in which the CNPD agents asked for clarification from

about the manner in which data subjects are informed of the presence of the

CCTV system. The CNPD agents also asked him

to send a copy of the register of processing activities.

verbal no. […] relating to the on-site fact-finding mission carried out on February 1, 2019.

9. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 8

August 2019 a Statement of Objections (hereinafter: “the Statement of Objections”)

detailing the shortcomings that he considered constituted in this case, and more specifically a

non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

the persons concerned (right to information), i.e. employees and persons

non-employees, namely customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors (hereafter

after: "third parties") and non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.c) of the

GDPR (data minimization principle).

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and insofar as the

data subject already has this information. »

17. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.5 Said obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

18. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.6

2. In this case

19. With regard to the information of third parties about the system of

video surveillance, the head of the investigation noted that the thumbnails indicating the number

the former authorization7 issued by the CNPD under the repealed law of August 2, 2002 and

affixed to the bottom of access doors in various places were the only source

information about the CCTV system. In addition, the chief investigator has

mentioned that even if the controlled had explained in his letter of April 4, 2019 that

said vignettes will be replaced by stickers which "will be affixed in the

next few days”8, the non-compliance with article 13 of the GDPR was acquired no later than

day of the on-site visit and that the documentation submitted by said letter did not contain

no evidence against this non-compliance.

20. With regard to informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the head of the investigation noted that the thumbnails indicating the number

the former authorization9 issued by the CNPD under the repealed law of August 2, 2002 and

affixed to the bottom of access doors in various places were the only source

information about the CCTV system. He clarified that the

documentation sent by the control by mail of April 4, 2019, namely the note

"Commitment to respect information security for the personnel of the

public establishment A” (which would be sent and countersigned by the employees in the

part of a future information campaign) and the “welcome booklet” (which would in future be

given to all new employees), did not make it possible to show that the employees

had received all the information required within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR10. More

in particular, the head of investigation noted that the analysis of the two aforementioned documents

had shown that the auditee omitted to provide information on the rights of

data subjects and on the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.

control.

21. By letter dated November 7, 2019, the control sent to the head of investigation

-

confirmation that the new “information posters” intended for

third parties had been affixed to the entrances and exits of the buildings of the

checked by attaching a copy of the said “information poster”,

- a copy of the new chapter VII.A. of its “welcome booklet” intended for

new employees of the control and processing the information in relation to its

CCTV system, and

- a copy of the new note "Commitment to respect the safety of

information for the staff of public establishment A” intended for employees

of the control and the confirmation that the said note had been "delivered to each

collaborator”11.

22. By letter dated September 9, 2020, the controller replied to the letter

supplementary to the statement of objections of August 3, 2020 from the head of investigation and he

said it follows a two-tiered approach to informing third parties

since March 2020 and he attached to his letter a new “A6 size poster” and a

new excerpt from its "privacy policy".

23. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01, point 33).

24. The Restricted Committee considers that a layered approach to

Communicating transparency information to data subjects can be

used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in an environment

real, such as personal data collected by means of a

CCTV system. The first level of information (warning sign,

information note, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, information having the

greater impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects12, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address)13. the

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties.14

2.1. Information from third parties

25. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance only by the CNPD vignettes indicating the number of

the former authorization15 issued by the CNPD under the repealed law of August 2, 2002 and

affixed to the bottom of access doors in various places. By letter dated April 4, 2019, the

inspected claimed that said decals will be replaced by stickers which

“will be affixed in the coming days”16 and he attached a copy of the new

stickers. By letter dated November 7, 2019, the controller confirmed that the "new

information posters" had been affixed to all accesses to their buildings and he,

again attached a copy of said stickers. The Restricted Panel finds that

the content of the stickers has not changed since the first mail from the control.

26. Finally, by letter dated September 9, 2020, the controller sent a new

“A6 size poster” which had been “affixed to all exits (entrances / exits) (…)

in April 2019” by informing the head of investigation that he has decided to follow an approach “in

two levels (…) from March 2020” to communicate information on the

CCTV system. The new “A6 size poster” represented the first

level of information and the second level of information would be available on the website

internet of the controlled: […].

27. The Restricted Panel notes that the CNPD sticker indicating the number

of the old authorisation17 was the only source of information in relation to the system of

video surveillance. She also notes that the new “information posters”

sent by the control between April 4, 2019 and November 7, 2019 did not contain

all the required elements of Article 13 of the GDPR. If the "information posters"

contained the most important information for a first communication with

a data subject18, they nevertheless did not contain any reference to the

complete information required under Article 13.1. and 2. GDPR. By mail from

September 9, 2020, the audited said it was following a two-tiered approach to

the information of third parties since March 2020. The Restricted Committee notes that

the new "A6 size poster", sent by said courier, now contains the

video surveillance of the controlled.

17 Deliberation No. […] of the CNPD relating to the request for prior authorization in terms of
video surveillance of the controlled

required elements of the first level of information19 and it also refers to the site

internet of the controlled on which is the second level of information20 (i.e. the new

" privacy policy "). It also notes that the chapter on the "policy of

confidentiality” dealing with video surveillance, sent to the CNPD by said letter, contains

now all the elements required by article 13.1. and 2. GDPR.

28. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that all the documentation of the

first and second level of information was put in place only after the on-site visit

CNPD officers.

29. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

controlled with respect to third parties.

2.2. Employee information

30. With regard to employees, Restricted Training notes that during the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, the latter were informed of the presence of the

CCTV system only by

- the CNPD vignettes indicating the number of the old authorization21

issued by the CNPD under the repealed law of August 2, 2002 and affixed to the bottom of the

access doors to different places, and

- by information sent in 2004 to the members of the Joint Committee of the

controlled22, without the controlled having provided evidence in support of this assertion.

31. By letters dated April 4, 2019 and November 7, 2019, the controller sent a

copy of new stickers ("information posters"), two versions of the note

"Commitment to respect information security for the personnel of the

public institution A” and two versions of the “welcome booklet”. Restricted Training

notes that the first versions of the two aforementioned documents were adapted between April

                                                           
19 See Point 24. of this decision for more information on the two levels
of information.
20 See Point 24. of this decision for more information on the two levels

video surveillance of the controlled.

and November 2019 and they now expressly mention the right of access, the right

of opposition and the right of erasure of the persons concerned and the right to introduce a

complaint to the CNPD.

32. Finally, by letter dated September 9, 2020, the auditee firstly sent

a new “A6 size poster”, which represented the first level of information for

data subjects, and which refers to the second level of information that can be consulted on

the website of the controlled ([…]), i.e. the “privacy policy” of the controlled23. Else

hand, the controller returned the latest versions of the note "Commitment to respect

information security for the staff of public establishment A", which would have been

“given to each employee”, and the “welcome booklet”, which would be sent to all

new entrants.

33. With regard to the individual information of employees, the Training

Restreinte considers first of all that simply informing the joint committee does not ensure

that the control employees have been individually informed of the precise elements of

section 13.1. and 2. GDPR. However, it notes that employees are now informed

by the transmission of the note "Commitment to respect the security of information

for the staff of public establishment A” for current employees and the “booklet

d’accueil” for newcomers. However, the Restricted Committee notes that the

two aforementioned documents have not been adapted since the letter from the inspector of 7

November 2019. They do not mention the existence of the right to request from the controller

processing the rectification of personal data, nor the right to a limitation

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to data portability. By

Consequently, Restricted Training considers that employees receive

incomplete documents with respect to article 13.1. and 2. GDPR. The fact that employees

can consult the “privacy policy”, available on the website of the

controlled, in which there is an exact explanation of the rights of the persons

concerned, does not change the fact that the individual information of employees is

incomplete. Because the “privacy policy” can be qualified as a

collective information, but not as individual employee information. Furthermore, the

Restricted Training considers that all of the second level information must be

of information.

be “consultable in a single place or in the same document (in digital form

on a website or in paper format)”24 which must be easily accessible in the case

where the data subjects would like to consult all the information. In

species, the information is dispersed in different documents available in

various locations, making it difficult for people to get to know this information.

employees.

34. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

controlled with regard to the employees of the controlled.

B. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

35. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

36. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.25

37. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

38. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

information collected for other purposes.26

39. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.27

2. In this case

40. It was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes of setting up the

CCTV system were the protection of company assets, securing

access28 and also the safety of staff, customers and visitors and the

accident prevention29. However, the Restricted Committee observes that in the register of

processing relating to video surveillance provided by the controlled, the purpose described is as

follows: “Ensure the safety of users and the prevention of accidents as well as the protection

company assets. *allow visual control of access to the main cash desk. "30.

It therefore turns out that the purpose invoked during the investigation, i.e. "the securing of

access”, is not included in the processing register relating to video surveillance31.

2.1. With regard to the field of vision of the cameras filming the employees

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

-

the field of view of camera number […] (hereinafter: “camera […]”)

allowed, among other things, the permanent monitoring of employees employed

behind the counter (statement of objections, A.4.);

-

the field of view of camera number […] (hereinafter: “camera […]”

allowed the permanent surveillance of employees employed at the "entrance

[…]” (statement of objections, A.5.); and

-

the field of view of camera number […] (hereinafter: “camera […]”

allowed permanent monitoring of employees working at reception

[…]” (statement of objections, A.6.) .

42. The head of investigation considered that “(…) the permanent monitoring of

employees on their workstations is to be considered disproportionate. Indeed, a

such permanent surveillance can create significant psychological pressure for

employees who feel and know they are being watched, especially since the measures of

monitoring persist over time. The fact that the employees concerned do not have

of a means of evading this monitoring from time to time is also to

likely to aggravate this pressure. Such permanent monitoring is considered

as disproportionate to the aim pursued and constitutes an excessive interference with the

private sphere of employees occupied at their workstations. In this case, the rights and

fundamental freedoms of employees must prevail over the interests pursued by

the employer. Thus, he held that non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was

acquired on the day of the on-site visit and that the documentation submitted to the CNPD by the

letter of April 4, 2019 did not contain any evidence against this non-compliance, nor

no explanation as to the possible need for such monitoring measures

(statement of objections, Ad. A.3. to A.6.).

43. The auditee for his part explained in his reply letter to the

statement of objections of 7 November 2019 (and again in its letter of 9

September 2020) that the field(s) of vision

- cameras […] have been masked in order to no longer monitor areas of

work of employees at reception […];

- of the camera […] has been temporarily reoriented and masked in order to

monitor only the front door […];

- of the camera […] has been hidden in order to no longer monitor work areas

permanent staff […]; and

- of the camera […] has been hidden in order to no longer monitor work areas

employees at the reception […].

44. The Restricted Panel finds that the controller attached to his letter of 7

November 2019 and again to his mail of September 9, 2020 captures

screen showing the adjustments of the five aforementioned cameras. However, she notes

also that the inspected mentioned in said letters that the masking and

reorientation of the camera's field of view […] are only temporary because

work would be planned in the future for “a new location of this

camera (…) in order to film the attacks more clearly […]”32. Furthermore, she finds that

masking the field of vision of the camera […] does not prevent the

permanent monitoring of employees […]33.

45. La Formation Restreinte would like to point out that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach

the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. On the other hand, respecting

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

46. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee concurs with the finding of Chief

of investigation according to which the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents concerning the five cameras that allowed

permanent monitoring of the workstations of the employees employed there.

2.2. Regarding the field of vision of cameras filming [clients]

47. During the on-site investigation, the CNPD agents noted that

-

the field of vision of the camera […] allowed, among other things, surveillance

[…] (statement of objections, A.4.);

-

the field of view of camera number […] (hereinafter: “camera […]”)

allowed surveillance of a corridor […] (statement of objections, A.7.);

and

-

the field of view of camera number […] (hereinafter: “camera […]”)

allowed the surveillance of a reserved space […] (communication of

grievances, A.8.).

48. The head of the investigation considered that the surveillance of these spaces “should be considered

as disproportionate when the persons present there will be, in a way

permanent, subject to video surveillance as they choose these places as

meeting places [...]. However, the persons concerned who remain in this type of place

for a more or less long period of time, must be able to legitimately expect to

not to be filmed during these private moments. The use of cameras in these

spaces is likely to film the behavior of the persons concerned and may

create discomfort or even psychological pressure for the latter who feel

observed throughout their presence in these spaces. Such monitoring

permanent constitutes an invasion of the privacy of the persons concerned. " Thereby,

he retained that the non-compliance with article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established on the day of the visit

on site (statement of objections, Ad. A.4., A.7. and A.8.).

49. The auditee for his part explained in his reply letter to the

statement of objections of 7 November 2019 (and again in its letter of 9

September 2020) than the field of vision

- of the camera […] has been temporarily reoriented in order to monitor

only the front door […];

- of the camera […] has been temporarily masked in order to no longer monitor the

areas […]; and

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

17/31

- of the camera […] has been masked in order to no longer monitor the areas […].

50. The Restricted Panel finds that the controller attached to his letter of 7

November 2019 and again to his mail of September 9, 2020 captures

screen showing the adjustments of the three aforementioned cameras. On the other hand, she notes that the

controlled mentioned in said mails that the masking and redirection of the field

vision of the camera […] are only temporary (see point 44. of this

decision) and that the masking of the field of vision of the camera […] would also be

temporary because work would be planned in the future for “a new

installation of this camera (…) in order to film the exterior access door of the […]”34. The

Formation Restricte would like to remind you that customers […] who choose to switch from

time in these types of places must be able to expect not to be filmed during these

private times. She also wonders about the need for cameras […] and their

utilities to achieve the purposes sought by the auditee. Regarding the

camera […], the Restricted Panel notes that its field of vision encompasses a corridor which

acts as "[...] and that it is not necessary to film this corridor to achieve the finality

to “secure the exterior access door […]”35. Moreover, it considers that in this case

the interests and fundamental rights [of clients] not to be filmed while waiting […]

prevail in this specific case over the legitimate interest of the controlled party to want to secure its

exterior access. Indeed, there are less intrusive alternative means to achieve the

purpose invoked by the controller. Regarding the camera […], she also notes

that it does not seem necessary to film the whole corridor, […], especially since there is

obviously no access door in the field of vision of said camera.

52. The Restricted Committee also wishes to point out that the cameras intended

to monitor an access point (e.g. entrance and exit) must have a limited field of vision

on the surface strictly necessary to visualize the people preparing to access it.

If the main purpose of the three aforementioned cameras was not to monitor customers […]

getting ready to spend time in dedicated spaces […], the fact remains that these

are in the field of view of said cameras.

53. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the finding of Chief

of investigation according to which the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

1. Principles

54. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

19/31

 

 

 

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

55. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

56. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

20/31



e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

 

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

57. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

58. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the control to put itself in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

59. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 3 August

2020, the head of investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative audit for an amount of 6,700 euros.

60. In his response to said additional letter of September 9, 2020, the

checked referred, on the one hand, to his letter of November 7, 2019 and on the other hand, he took

once again position in relation to all the shortcomings mentioned in the

statement of objections by sending new explanations and new

documents in relation to Article 13 of the GDPR and attaching the same photos as in

his letter of November 7, 2019 in relation to article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.

61. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Panel notes that with regard to the breach of the obligation

to inform data subjects in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, the

Restricted Training recalls that information and transparency relating to the

processing of personal data are essential obligations

weighing on data controllers so that individuals are

fully aware of the use that will be made of their personal data

staff, once collected. A breach of Article 13 of the GDPR

thus constitutes an infringement of the rights of the persons concerned. This right to

information has also been reinforced under the terms of the GDPR, which testifies to

their particular importance.

As for breaches of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, they constitute

breaches of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and the right to the protection of

data in general), namely the principle of data minimization devoted

in Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

22/31

 

 

 

 

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent upon them. Moreover, an obligation to inform

comparable, as well as an obligation to respect the principle of minimization

already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1. b), 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2

August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of

personal data. Guidance on principles and obligations

provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular through

mandatory prior authorization for video surveillance.

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training finds that these are all employees working on the site

of the controlled, as well as all third parties, […].

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

 As for the measures taken by the auditee to mitigate the damage suffered by the

persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

23/31

measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. section 2.2. of this

decision for the related explanations.

62. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

63. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

27 February 2019 (see also point 57. of this decision).

64. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 13 and 5.1.c) GDPR.

65. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

articles 13 and 5 of the RGPD is reproached to the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

66. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of 6,700 euros appears

both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83.1

of the GDPR.

2.2. About taking corrective action

67. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

of investigation to

the Restricted Training in its additional letter to

the

statement of objections:

“a) Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for third parties ([…]) concerned by video surveillance,

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

24/31

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR in

indicating in particular the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the

data protection officer, the purposes of the processing and its legal basis,

the categories of data processed, the legitimate interests pursued by the controller,

the recipients, the retention period of the data as well as the indication of the

human rights and how to exercise them.

 

b) Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for employees affected by

video surveillance,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR in

informing in particular of the existence of the right to ask the person responsible for the

processing access to personal data, rectification or erasure

of these, or a limitation of the processing relating to the data subject and the right

lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

 

c) Order the controller to process only relevant data,

adequate and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protection

property and securing access and, in particular, adapting the video system

so as not to film employees at their workstations, nor to film third parties in

areas in

which one

such monitoring is considered

disproportionate, for example by removing or reorienting the cameras. »

68. In its reply to the said supplementary letter to the statement of objections

of September 9, 2020, the controller referred to his letter of November 7, 2019 in which

he had taken a position with regard to all the shortcomings mentioned in the

statement of objections, and he once again took a position with regard to all these

breaches, among other things, by sending new documents as an appendix to said

letter showing the measures taken by the control.

69. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation, the Panel

Restreinte takes into account the steps taken by the auditee, following the visit to the

CNPD officials, in order to comply with the provisions of Articles 13 and 5.1.c) of the

GDPR, as detailed in its letters of April 4, 2019, November 7, 2019 and 9

September 2020. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

25/31

 With regard to the implementation of information measures intended for persons

third parties by video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1 and

2 of the GDPR, the control sent by letter of September 9, 2020

o a new “A6 size poster” which would have been “affixed to all

issues (entries / exits) (…) in April 2019”,

oh

the statement that he has decided to follow a “two-tier approach (…)

as of March 2020” to communicate information on the

CCTV system, and

o a new chapter of its “privacy policy” available on

his website.

The Restricted Panel observes that the first level of information (i.e. the

new “A6 size poster”) and the second level of information (i.e. the

new chapter of its “privacy policy”) now contain

all the information required by article 13.1. and 2. of the GDPR and are

accessible to third parties.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that there is no need to

pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as

as set out in point 67 (a) with regard to third parties.

With regard more specifically to audited employees, Training

Restricted considers that

control employees must be

informed

individually regarding the specific elements of Article 13 of the GDPR. By

against, the Restricted Committee finds that the note "Commitment to respect

information security for the staff of public institution A”, which has

been sent to current employees, and the “welcome booklet”, which will be sent to

new entrants, do not contain all the information required by the article

13 GDPR. The two aforementioned documents do not mention the existence of the right

to ask the data controller to rectify the personal data

personal data, nor the right to restriction of processing relating to the data subject,

or the right to data portability. Consequently, the Restricted Formation

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation
on the outcome of survey no. […] conducted with public establishment A

 

 

 

26/31

considers that the information provided to employees under Articles 13.1. and 2. of

GDPR is incomplete.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the

corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in

point 67 (b) as regards the individual information of employees.

 As for the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting the property of

the company, securing access, security of personnel, customers and

visitors including the prevention of accidents, the control has annexed to his letters

from November 7, 2019 and September 9, 2020 photos showing adjustments

of the fields of view of all the disputed cameras. Restricted Training

considers that the fields of vision

- cameras […], and

- of the camera […]

are now compliant with the principle of data minimization according to

Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR in order to no longer permanently monitor areas of

work of employees.

With regard to the field of view of the camera […], the Restricted Formation

considers that the adjustment of the field of vision does not make it possible to prevent the

permanent monitoring of employees in the "[...]". Furthermore, in view of the

purpose of securing access, it considers that a reorientation of the said

camera would be more appropriate to target only “the entrance […]”36. The

Restricted Committee therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 67

under (c) in order to refer to “the entry […]”.

Regarding the field of view of the camera […], the person being checked asserted that

the reorientation and masking of the field of view of said camera would not

only temporary. A related question was asked during the hearing of the

                                                           
36 Cf. As suggested by the auditee himself in his letter of September 9, 2020.

Restricted training on February 5, 2021. The controller confirmed that the masking

is not definitive and that it is possible to unmask the field of vision at any

moment but only for future recordings and not for the

past. In his letter of November 7, 2019, he indicated that "a new

installation of this camera is envisaged in order to film more distinctly the

access […] ". Indeed, the Restricted Committee considers that there are means

much less intrusive alternatives to achieve the purpose invoked by the

controlled (i.e. in this case the securing of access, more precisely the

surveillance of the “front door […]”37), such as the installation of a

camera outside […]” which only aims at access […]. The act of masking

virtually any surface filmed by a camera is not a measurement

suitable alternative to ensure that the field of view of a camera is limited

on the surface strictly necessary to visualize people entering or leaving

[…] (see point 52. of this decision). The Restricted Committee considers as soon as

when it is necessary to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation

in this respect as set out in point 67 (c) in order to refer only to the door

of entry […] and in order to make this adjustment permanent.

Regarding the field of view of the camera […], the person being checked asserted that

masking the field of view of said camera would also be that

temporary. A related question was asked during the hearing of the Panel

Restricted on February 5, 2021. The control confirmed that the masking is not

definitive and that it is possible to unmask the field of vision at any time but

only for future recordings and not for the past. In his

letter of November 7, 2019, he indicated that “a new establishment of this

camera is planned to film the exterior access door […]”. In view of

the purpose of securing access and considering the right of [customers] not to

be filmed during their presence in the "[...]" [...], the Restricted Formation

considers that the adjustment of the field of vision of the camera […] does not allow

to prevent disproportionate surveillance […]. Customers] can escape

this surveillance only by taking a seat on a chair and the rest of the corridor

is still in the field of view of said camera, while there are

much less intrusive alternative means of achieving the purpose invoked by

the controlled (i.e. in this case the securing of access, more precisely the

surveillance of “the exterior access door […]”38), such as

the installation of a camera outside the “[…]” which only aims at access to the

"[...]". The fact of masking practically all of the surface filmed by a camera

is not a suitable alternative measure to ensure that the field of vision

of a camera is limited to the area strictly necessary to view the

persons entering or leaving the "[...]" (see point 52. of this decision). The

Restricted Committee therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 67

under c) in order to refer only to “the exterior access door […]” and in order to make

this permanent adjustment.

With regard to the field of view of the camera […], the Restricted Formation

considers that with regard to the desired purpose, the adjustment of the field of vision

of the said camera does not make it possible to prevent the disproportionate surveillance of

customers […], especially since it does not identify any access door in the field of
