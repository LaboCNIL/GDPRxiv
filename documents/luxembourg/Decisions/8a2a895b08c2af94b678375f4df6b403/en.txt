National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data protection (hereinafter "law of 1 August 2018") and to designate Mr.

Christophe Buschmann as head of investigation.

2. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation conducted by the CNPD

was intended to verify compliance with the provisions of the regulations relating to the protection

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”)

5. Dated 16 September 2019, a first Statement of Objections detailing

the shortcomings that the head of the investigation considered constituted in this case was notified to the

group A, together with the minutes of the aforementioned visits of 8, 13 and 14 May 2019.

6. On October 16, 2019, Group A filed written submissions on the

statement of objections.

 

7. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

Group A dated August 24, 2020.

 

8. By letter dated 28 September 2020, Group A submitted written observations

on the supplementary letter to the statement of objections.

9. The President of the National Commission for Data Protection

sitting in a restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter: “Formation

Restricted”) informed Group A by letter dated October 16, 2020 that its case would be

registered for the Restricted Training session of December 4, 2020 and that he could attend

at this session. Group A did not respond to this invitation.

10. During the Restricted Training session of December 4, 2020, the leader

investigator presented his oral observations in support of his written observations and

answered the questions posed by the Restricted Panel. Group A was not

present during the session.

11. After the said session, the Restricted Panel considered that it was not

sufficiently enlightened as to which of the different legal entities

controlled from group A would be considered as data controllers, or even

as joint controllers, depending on the different data processing

of a personal nature checked by CNPD officials during their visits to the site of the

May 8, 13 and 14, 2019.

The Restricted Panel therefore asked the head of investigation on March 31

2021, in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the CNPD's internal rules,

investigate further on this point.3

12. By letter dated August 27, 2021, CNPD officials therefore requested

additional information to three companies belonging to group A, including the controlled,

i.e. Company A.

13. Following the departure of Mr. Christophe Buschmann, the Plenary Formation

decided during its deliberation session of September 3, 2021 that Mr. Alain

Herrmann would from that date hold the position of chief investigator for the investigation in

cause.

14. The controller responded to questions from CNPD officials on 17

September 2021, specifying that it is to be considered as the controller at the

meaning of article 4 point 7) of the GDPR concerning personal data

collected through the video surveillance system installed around and inside

of the three buildings mentioned above in point 4 of this decision, that is to say [of the

building A], [building B], as well as [building C].

15. On December 15, 2021, the head of investigation notified the controller of a

new statement of objections (hereinafter: “the new statement of objections”)

detailing the shortcomings that he considered constituted in this case concerning the system of

video surveillance, and more specifically non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by

Article 13 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to data subjects,

i.e. employees and non-employees, i.e. customers, suppliers,

service providers and visitors (hereinafter: "third parties"), as well as by

Articles 5.1.a) and 12.1 and 12.7 of the GDPR (principle of transparency).

The head of investigation specified that “this constitutes a new communication

of the grievances which also takes into account the elements that you have provided to us on

of October 16, 2019, dated September 28, 2020 and dated September 15, 2021 in

response to our first statement of objections of 16 September 2019, to our

                                                 
3 See additional survey of March 31, 2021 addressed to the auditee and the letter informing the group
A of the supplementary investigation of the same date.

additional letter of August 24, 2020 and our request for information

supplements of August 27, 2021.”

In addition, he proposed to the Restricted Training in the new communication of the

grievances to adopt a corrective measure and to impose an administrative fine on the auditee

for an amount of 1,000 euros.

16. By letter dated January 13, 2022, the controller produced written observations

on the new statement of objections.

17. Mr. Thierry Lallemang, commissioner, informed the controller by post of the

March 25, 2022 that his case would be registered for the session of the Restricted Panel on March 25

May 2022 and that he could attend this meeting. The controller confirmed his presence at

said meeting dated May 23, 2022.

18. During the Restricted Training session of May 25, 2022, the head of investigation

and the controlled party, represented by Me […], presented their oral observations in support of

their written observations and answered the questions posed by the Panel

Restraint. The controller spoke last.

19. The decision of the Restricted Panel will be limited to processing controlled by

CNPD officials on May 13, 2019 and the legal provisions and

regulations taken into account by the head of investigation in his new communication

grievances.

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

 

A. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

20. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

5/25

 

 

 

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

6/25

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data;

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

21. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.4 Said obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

                                                 
4 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

22. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency. 5

2. In this case

23. The CNPD agents noted during their visits to [building A]

that the presence of the cameras is signaled to the persons concerned at the entrance by

the affixing of a pictogram and a sticker indicating the old number of

the authorization issued by the CNPD, as well as by an information poster affixed to the

main entrance door.6

In [building B], the presence of the cameras was indicated at the entrance of the building by a

sticker indicating the old number of the authorization issued by the CNPD and by the same

information poster on the main entrance door [of building A].7 [In building C], there is

had the same information in place at the time of the CNPD agents’ visit as at the time of the

[building B], with the only difference that the poster mentioned was also affixed to the

reception desk. 8

24. Moreover, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes pursued

by the installation of video surveillance are identical in the three buildings, i.e.

that is to say that it is aimed at “the protection of property and people, the safety of users, the

prevention of accidents as well as safeguarding the vital interests of people,

in particular to trace any expulsions of residents. »9

25. However, the head of investigation retained in his new statement of objections

whereas “some information is provided by the controlled to signal the

presence of video surveillance, it must be noted that in view of the requirements of article 13

above, this information is incomplete. […] It should therefore be noted that the

8/25

old CNPD vignettes and pictograms at the entrance to buildings as well as

the "posters" affixed by the control are not likely to meet the conditions

posed by the aforementioned article 13. (New statement of objections, paragraphs 19 and 20).

26. In this context, the head of investigation took into account the explanations of the inspector

contained in his letter of October 16, 2019, which he had therefore, among other things,

puts in place a personal data protection policy applicable to

third parties, an information notice on personal data

intended for the employees of the control and which would have been distributed to them by mail

electronic dated October 15, 2019 and finally that he had modified the panels

of information (see points 21 to 23 of the new statement of objections).

27. However, he was of the opinion that even if “the fact of putting in place policies of

protection of personal data applicable to third parties and to

employees and to modify the CCTV signaling panels makes it possible to

demonstrate a desire to comply, it is necessary to note that the non-

compliance with article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit. (Item 24 of

the new Statement of Objections).

28. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

29. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing, the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information with the most

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

9/25

strong impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address)10. the

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties.11

30. The Restricted Committee notes that during the visits to the three buildings of the

checked, the persons concerned were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by vignettes indicating the old number of the authorization issued

by the CNPD and by information posters. [In Building A], there was also a

pictogram of a camera with the words "VIDEOSURVEILLANCE" on the door

of entry.

31. She would first like to point out that since the old vignettes were

issued by the CNPD under the former authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002

on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

staff which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018, they have become obsolete and

since the entry into force of the GDPR, other rules in this area are applicable.

32. Furthermore, without prejudice to the dimension and size of the typeface

used (see in this context part II. 1. B. on the breach of the principle of

transparency), the Restricted Committee notes that the posters in place at the time of

the survey contained neither the information of the first level of information, nor of the

second level of information (see point 29 of this decision on the information to be

two levels). In particular, it lacks the legal basis for the processing, the existence of the right

to ask the data controller to rectify or delete the data,

a limitation of the processing relating to the person concerned, as well as the right to oppose

                                                 
10 See WP260 rev 01 (point 38) and EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on data processing
of a personal nature by video devices, version 2.0, adopted on 29 January 2020 (points 114.
and 117.).
11 See WP260 rev. 01 (Item 38.)

to processing, the right to data portability and the right to lodge a complaint

with a supervisory authority.

The fact that [in building A], there was also a pictogram of a camera with the mention

"VIDEO SURVEILLANCE" on the entrance door has no effect in the context of

the analysis of compliance with article 13 of the GDPR, but will be taken into account in the part

concerning a possible breach of the principle of transparency.

33. In view of the foregoing, it therefore concludes that at the time of the on-site visit

CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the control in

with regard to video surveillance with regard to third parties, as well as

employees.

34. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 51 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

B. On the breach of the principle of transparency

 

1. On the principles

35. Section 5.1. a) GDPR requires personal data to be

be "processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner with regard to the data subject

(lawfulness, fairness, transparency)”.

36. With specific regard to the transparency of information and

communications, Article 12 of the GDPR provides the following:

“1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any

information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication to the

under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 with regard to personal processing

concerned in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner,

clear and simple terms, in particular for any information intended specifically

to a child. Information is provided in writing or by other means including,

where appropriate, electronically. When the data subject makes the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

11/25

 

 

 

request, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the

the data subject is demonstrated by other means.

[…]

7. The information to be communicated to the persons concerned pursuant to Articles

13 and 14 can be provided with standardized icons to provide good

easily visible, understandable and clearly legible overview of the processing

intended. When the icons are presented electronically, they are readable by

machine.

[…]. »

37. Recital (58) of the GDPR specifies in this context that the “principle of

transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject

be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and stated in clear terms

simple and, in addition, where appropriate, illustrated with visual elements. »

2. In this case

38. During visits to the three buildings belonging to the controlled, the agents

of the CNPD noted that the presence of the cameras is signaled to the people

concerned by the affixing of "a sticker indicating the old number of the authorization

issued by the CNPD and an information "poster" (small and showing

a text whose font size is quite small) […]”12

39. In the new Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation considered that

the information "provided is not to be considered as easily visible, nor clearly legible,

especially given the small size of the posters and the small font size

used. The information is also not easily accessible in view of a significant proportion

of the population of the people concerned (elderly people), nor accompanied by icons

standardized (such as pictograms) making it easy to

understand that it is a video surveillance that is implemented on the sites

concerned. He was also of the opinion that these “arguments can also be

                                                 
12 See findings 17, 25 and 26 of the minutes.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

12/25

applied to the problem of the absence of specific information provided to

members of staff regarding video surveillance. (Points 28 and 29 of the new

statement of objections).

40. In this context, the head of investigation took into account the explanations of the inspector

contained in his letter of October 16, 2019 stating that he had modified the

information panels to make them more readable and visible .

However, even if the fact of modifying the road signs of the video surveillance

made it possible to demonstrate a desire to comply, the head of investigation was

of the opinion that on the day of the on-site visit, the controller failed in its obligation to respect

the principles of transparency arising from articles 5.1.a) and 12.1 and 12.7 of the GDPR (points

23, 24 and 30 of the new statement of objections).

41. The Restricted Committee takes into account in this context that the principle

of transparency provided for in Article 5.1. a) of the GDPR applies

practice in Articles 12 and following of Chapter III of the GDPR. While Articles 13

and 14 concretely specify which data must be provided by the data controller.

processing to a data subject for a given processing, Article 12 takes up, between

others, the obligations incumbent on the data controller as well as the terms

specific to implement.

Furthermore, it considers that “the quality, accessibility and intelligibility of the information

are as important as the actual content of the information in terms of transparency

to be provided to data subjects. (WP 260 rev. 01, point 4).

42. Taking into account that the vignettes indicating the old number of

authorizations issued by the CNPD were the size of a business card and by comparing

the size of the said thumbnail to that of the posters in place at the time of the visit to

of the three controlled buildings, on the one hand, and considering the small font size

of writing used for the said posters, on the other hand, the Restricted Formation joins

the opinion of the head of investigation that the information provided was not to be considered as

easily visible, nor clearly legible. Moreover, as the majority of people

concerned are elderly people, the control should have taken into account "the

vulnerabilities of these people in its analysis of how to ensure respect for

its obligations of transparency with regard to these data subjects. This requirement

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

13/25

is linked to the need for the controller to assess the likely level of

understanding of its audience […]. (WP 260 rev. 01, point 16).

43. Furthermore, she notes that a single size and color was used for the

information indicated on the posters and that no standardized icon was there

easily allowing the persons concerned (third parties and employees) to

understand that video surveillance was being implemented. The purpose of use

of icons is precisely to improve “transparency for the persons concerned by

possibly reducing the need to present large quantities

written information to them. (WP 260 rev. 01, point 52).

44. The fact that [in building A] there was also a pictogram of a camera with

the mention "VIDEOSURVEILLANCE" written in red and black on the entrance door allows

to increase transparency and understanding of the processing in question by the majority

of the persons concerned in this case (elderly people). Nevertheless, the thumbnail and

the poster in place at the time of the visit [to building A] were the same as those in

place in [building B], and [in building C], and the Restricted Formation therefore returns to its

related comments in points 42 and 43 above.

45. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel therefore concludes that at the time

visits to the three controlled buildings by CNPD agents, the articles

5.1.a), 12.1 and 12.7 of the GDPR were not respected by the control in terms of

video surveillance for third parties, as well as employees.

46. As for the measures taken by the control after the visits of the agents of the

CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 51 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

1. Principles

 

47. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

_____________________________________________________________

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

48. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

 

49. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

 

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

 

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

 

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

 

50. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

51. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

52. Taking into account the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR, the head

investigation proposed in the new statement of objections to the Restricted Panel

to impose an administrative fine on the person checked in the amount of 1,000 euros (see points

33 to 35 of the new statement of objections).

17/25

53. In his letter of January 13, 2022, the auditee confirmed his agreement to the

Restricted training with the said fine proposed by the head of investigation.

54. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel also analyzes the

elements provided for by said article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Panel notes that with regard to the breach of Article 5.1.a)

of the GDPR, combined with the breach of Article 12.1 and 12.7 of the GDPR, it is

constituting a breach of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and of the law of the

data protection in general), namely the principle of transparency enshrined

in Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 

This principle, “when respected by data controllers, allows

data subjects to control their personal data and

to require data controllers and processors to provide

accounts in this regard, for example by granting or withdrawing their consent

informed and enforcing their rights as data subjects. »

(WP 260 rev.01, point 4).

 

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

 

The Restricted Training nevertheless takes into account that partial information

data subjects did indeed take place, but that it was incomplete and

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

18/25

not transparent, especially in view of the fact that the majority of people

concerned were elderly people.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. She recalls here that two years

have separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into force for

enable data controllers to comply with the obligations

are incumbent, even if a comparable information obligation already existed in

application of articles 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

personal. Guidance relating to the principles and obligations provided for in said

repealed law was available from the CNPD, in particular through

prior authorizations for video surveillance, as well as on the site

CNPD website.

 

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training notes that these are employees who work at the three

buildings belonging to the controlled, i.e. [building B], [building A] and

[in building C], as well as all third parties, i.e. customers,

suppliers, service providers and visitors, who go there […].

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

 

 

 

 

 

19/25

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible (point 34.d. of

the new statement of objections).

 

 As for the measures taken by the auditee to mitigate the damage suffered by the

data subjects (article 83.2.c) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes

account of the measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

 

55. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

56. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

13 May 2019 (see also point 50 of this decision).

57. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.a), 12.1, 12.7 and 13 of the GDPR.

58. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

articles 5, 12 and 13 of the GDPR is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

59. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of one thousand (1,000) euros

appears to be both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of

GDPR Article 83.1.

2.2. About taking corrective action

 

60. The adoption of the following corrective action was proposed by Chief

inquiry to the Restricted Panel in its new statement of objections:

 

“Order the controlled person to complete the information measures intended for the persons

affected by video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13,

paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR by providing in particular:







the legal basis for the processing;

the legitimate interests pursued by the controller;

the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data

personal ;



the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the

personal data, rectification or erasure thereof, or

restriction of processing relating to the data subject; and



the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. »

61. As to the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation and by reference

in point 51 of this decision, the Restricted Panel takes into account the

steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.a), 12.1 and 12.7 and Article 13 of the GDPR,

as detailed in his letters of October 16, 2019, September 28, 2020, as well as

as of January 13, 2022. More specifically, it notes the following facts:

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned in point 60

of this Decision concerning the introduction of information measures on

the video surveillance system intended for third parties in accordance with

to the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, the controller specified in his letter

of October 16, 2019 that to “perfect the level of information of third parties, we

have prepared a notice relating to our data protection policy.

The latter can be viewed on our website but is also available

with our hostesses on request" and that he had modified the panels

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with Company A. belonging to the group

companies referred to as “Group A”

21/25

 

 

 

information dated October 15, 2019 "so that they are more readable

and visible”.13

The Restricted Panel considers that the new information panel contains the

required elements of the first level of information and it notes that the

information on said sign is in a larger font than on

the poster in place at the time of the on-site inspection, only two different colors

are used, and that a pictogram of a camera is displayed there. In what

concerns the aforementioned notice, it is of the opinion that it contains the majority of the elements

required for the second level, i.e. all of the information provided for in article

13 GDPR, except recipients or categories of data recipients

collected through the CCTV system.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 51 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 60 with regard to

informing third parties about the video surveillance system.

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned in point 60

of this Decision concerning the introduction of information measures on

the video surveillance system for employees in accordance with the

provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, the controller specified in his letter of 16

October 2019 that an employee data protection policy has been

drafted and distributed “dated October 15 to all of our employees and

posted on our intranet. »14

The Restricted Committee believes that said policy contains some of the

mentions provided for in article 13 of the GDPR. However, she finds that she

mentions all the legal bases applicable to the different processing operations

carried out by the person controlled, without however carrying out a differentiation by

                                                 
13 See Appendices 1 and 4 of the audit letter of October 16, 2019
14 See Appendices 2 and 3 of the audit letter of October 16, 2019.

22/25

intended processing, and therefore the legal basis for the data processing is missing

of a personal nature operated by the video surveillance system.

Furthermore, while point 5 of the data protection policy of

Group A employees relates to the recipients or categories of recipients of

personal data, said point mentions all the recipients

potential of the various treatments carried out by the controlled party, without

differentiate by targeted treatment. In addition, Restricted Training

notes that the parent company of group A, to which the controlled party belongs, can

receive personal data from employees. Now, like the house-

mother is located […], the controlled must inform the employees of his intention

to carry out a transfer of personal data to a recipient in

a third country and[…] the existence of an adequacy decision issued by the

European Commission15or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46, 47 and

49 of the GDPR, the reference to the appropriate or adapted safeguards and the means

to obtain a copy or the place where they have been made available

in accordance with section 13.1. f) GDPR.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 51 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 60 with regard to

informing employees about the video surveillance system.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to retain the breaches of Articles 5.1.a), 12.1, 12.7 and 13 of the GDPR;

- impose an administrative fine on Company A in the amount of

one thousand (1,000) euros, with regard to the breaches constituted in articles 5.1.a), 12.1, 12.7

and 13 GDPR;

 

- issue against Company A an injunction to bring the

processing with the obligations resulting from articles 13.1 and 13.2 of the GDPR, within a period

two months following the notification of the decision of the Restricted Committee, and in

particular :

 



inform non-employee third parties in a clear and precise manner about the

video surveillance system, either by providing them in a single place or

in the same document (in paper or electronic format) information on

all the elements required under Article 13 of the GDPR, either by proceeding

by a first and a second level by adapting the information of the second

level of information so that they contain all the information at the

meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR, including information on the recipients or

categories of recipients of the data collected through the system of

video surveillance.

 



individually inform employees in a clear and precise manner about the system

video surveillance as set out in point 61 of this decision, either by

proceeding via a first and a second level, or by providing them, in a

single place or in the same document (in paper or electronic format),

information on all the elements required under Article 13 of the GDPR

by adapting and supplementing the “employee data protection policy”

of group A" to which Company A belongs.
