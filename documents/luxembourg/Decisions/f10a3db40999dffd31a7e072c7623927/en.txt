By letter dated November 27, 2019, the controller made his observations relating to this

statement of objections.

8. Following the departure of Mr. Christophe Buschmann, the Plenary Formation

decided during its deliberation session of September 3, 2021 that Mr. Alain

Herrmann will take on the role of chief investigator for the investigation as of today.

cause.

At the end of his investigation, the new head of investigation notified the person inspected on

November 9, 2021 a new Statement of Objections. There are detailed shortcomings

that he considered constituted in this case, and more specifically:

- as regards video surveillance: non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by

Article 13 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to persons

concerned, i.e. employees and non-employees, i.e.

clients,

suppliers, service providers and

visitors (hereafter:

"third parties"), non-compliance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR (principle of

storage limitation) and non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.c)

GDPR (data minimization principle); and

- as regards geolocation: non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by

Article 13 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to employees.

He proposed to the National Commission for Data Protection sitting in

restricted panel on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter: “Restricted Panel”) to adopt

three corrective measures and to impose on the person controlled an administrative fine of an amount

of 4,000 (four thousand) euros.

It appears from the new statement of objections that the new head of investigation “has

interpreted the scope of the investigation in such a way as to focus on the monitoring of

employees as well as third parties in what is considered to be the workplace. Thereby

emphasis was placed on the video surveillance systems installed at the headquarters [of the organization

of public transport A] and not inside the buses”10.

Moreover, the new head of investigation did not retain in the statement of objections of the

November 9, 2021, nor non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by section 30.1 of the

GDPR (obligation to keep a record of processing activities), nor non-compliance with

requirements prescribed by Article 37.1.a) of the GDPR (obligation to appoint a data protection officer)

data protection) that the former head of investigation had retained in the communication

of the initial grievances of September 6, 2019, because he considered that these treatments

did not fall within the scope of the investigation in question.11

By letter dated December 6, 2021, the controller made his observations relating to the

statement of objections of 9 November 2021.

9. The president of the Restricted Formation informed the controller by mail of the

January 17, 2022 that his case would be registered at the session of the Restricted Panel of

February 24, 2022. By letter dated February 3, 2022, the controller informed that he will not appear

not at this session.

10. During this session, the head of investigation presented his oral observations to

the support of his written observations and answered the questions posed by the Panel

Restraint.

11. The Restricted Panel in its decision will be limited to controlled processing

by CNPD officials and the legal and regulatory provisions taken into account

by the head of investigation in his statement of objections of 9 November 2021 (hereinafter:

the “statement of objections”).

 

                                                           
11 Indeed, during the Restricted Panel hearing of February 24, 2022, the new chief
of investigation explained that he believed that the said obligations were not the subject of the investigation.

6/34

 



e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

14. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.12 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

15. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, such as the aforementioned guidelines on transparency13.

2. In this case

16. With regard to the information of third parties about the system of

video surveillance installed outside the buildings on the controlled operating site,

the head of investigation noted in the statement of objections that “during the on-site visit,

it was found that the presence of video surveillance measures is reported to the

data subjects (employees and third parties) by means of communication panels

signage affixed to […] entrances to the operating site”14.

According to the head of the investigation "while some information is provided by the controlled

to signal the presence of video surveillance, it must be noted that in view of the requirements

of the aforementioned article 13, this information is incomplete”15.

Moreover, in his opinion "no element of the documentation submitted to the CNPD by the

letter of May 7, 2019 mentioned above does not contain evidence to demonstrate the

compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR”16.

Thus, the head of investigation held that "non-compliance with the provisions of Article 13

aforesaid was nevertheless established on the day of the on-site visit”17.

17. The controller for his part attached to his letter of May 7, 2019 “the photos of the

CCTV information panels installed at […] entrances and

out of our establishment.

18. In addition, he explained in the position paper annexed to his letter of

November 27, 201918 that “specific information panels (see appendix) have

been installed at any potential entrance to the site, and are thus visible to anyone

accessing the site before entering the video-monitored area". He attached a copy of the

new information panel and photos showing the “positioning of the panels

warning sign at any potential entrance to [public transport agency A] site

".

He specified that "the panels were designed according to the principle of the" first layer

information” mentioned in the document “Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal

data through video devices” published by the European Data Protection Board. The

exhaustive information according to the provisions of article 13 paragraphs (1) and (2) of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2018 (hereinafter abbreviated as “GDPR”) are available

in the form of a specific information notice published on the website [of the organization

public transport A] (“second layer information”)”. He provided the link to the notice

information on its website.

19. Regarding

informing employees about the system of

video surveillance installed outside the buildings on the controlled operating site,

the head of investigation made the same observations as for third parties (see point

16 of this decision).

In addition, he took note of "the mitigation elements presented by the person in charge of the

treatment regarding the information of employees in its letter of November 20, 2019[19],

notably

the documents

entitled "Warning sign and

information

video surveillance of the site [of public transport organization A]”, “Positioning of

warning signs at any potential entrance to the site [of the transport agency

public A]”, “Memo to staff: information on data processing

personal » »20.

“Notwithstanding these mitigating elements”, the head of the investigation noted that “the non-

compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 13 was nevertheless acquired on the day of the

on-site visit”21.

20. The auditee for his part indicated in his letter of May 7, 2019 that the

CCTV system would have been discussed during a meeting between the management and the

staff delegation in 2008, but that he was not "in possession of a written report

of the session with the 2008 delegation”. He also reproduced an exchange of

messages on this subject between [a director] and the chairman of the staff delegation.

21. In addition, the inspected party explained in the statement annexed to his letter

of November 27, 201922 that a “memorandum concerning the video surveillance of the site,

(…) and the geolocation of bus drivers (see appendix) has been brought to the attention

staff by the following means:

November 29, 2019.

• Delivery of the memo to all staff members by hand,

• Publication of the memorandum on the Intranet accessible to all employees

and

• Establishment of a procedure which provides for the delivery of the memorandum to any

new staff member. »

The control pointed out that "the memorandum covers exhaustive information according to

Article 13 GDPR”. He attached the copy of the memo.

22. In addition, in his letter of December 6, 2021 to the head of the investigation, the controlled

underlined that “by the predicted letter of November 27, 2019, [the transport organization

public], informed you, with supporting documents, that he had proceeded to

full compliance with all points and facts (grievances) raised during your investigation”.

It would also have taken steps to comply "as soon as it is published

to the Memorial of Legislation in this Matter”. For these purposes, he would have hired a consultant to

namely Company B. He attached, among other things, a copy of the estimate of this company

dated October 24, 2018.

However, the audit recognized that "the duties envisaged for compliance

were not fully accomplished and that the grievances noted during your investigation did not

not been the subject of disputes concerning the principle of the breaches observed".

23. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). »23

24. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment like

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information having the

greater impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects24, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address)25. the

second level of information, i.e. all the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to the

third parties.26

2.1. Information from third parties

25. The Restricted Committee notes that at the time of the on-site visit by the security officers

the CNPD third parties were only informed of the presence of the security system

video surveillance outside the buildings on the operating site of the controlled only at the

means of information panels affixed to […] “entrances and exits”27, showing the

pictogram of a camera and indicating "SITE MONITORED BY VIDEO CAMERA,

[…]”28.

26. The Restricted Committee wishes first of all to point out that the former

CNPD authorizations for video surveillance have become obsolete, because

they were issued by the CNPD under the former authorization regime of the amended law

of 2 August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

of a personal nature which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018.

27. Then, she notices that the information panels in place during the visit

on site by CNPD agents, did not contain the elements required by the first

level of information. In particular, it lacks details of the purpose of the processing,

the identity of the data controller and the existence of the rights of data subjects.

28. With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Formation

notes that such information intended for third parties did not exist at the

time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials.

29. In addition, the auditee acknowledged that compliance with legislation

applicable had not been completed at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials

(see point 22 of this decision).

30. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the

has breached its obligation to inform third parties arising from Article 13 of the

GDPR.

31. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 72 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

2.2. Employee information

32. The Restricted Committee has already noted that information panels in

place during the on-site visit by CNPD agents did not contain the elements

required by the first level of information (see points 25 to 27 of this decision). She

considers that this observation is also applicable with regard to the information of

employees.

33. With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Formation

notes that such information intended for employees did not exist at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD officers.

34. It notes in particular that none of the documentation submitted by the audit

contains proof attesting that the staff delegation was informed of the presence

video surveillance during a meeting between management and the staff delegation

in 2008. It also considers that information from the staff delegation

does not ensure that the controlled employees have been individually informed about

the precise elements of article 13 of the GDPR.

35. In addition, the auditee acknowledged that compliance with legislation

applicable had not been completed at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials

(see point 22 of this decision).

36. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the

has breached its obligation to inform employees arising from Article 13 of the GDPR.

37. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 72 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

B. On the breach linked to the principle of limitation of storage

1. On the principles

38. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […] (retention limitation)”.

39. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. ".

2. In this case

40. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes

video surveillance outside the buildings on the site of the controlled are

“the protection of the property of [public transport organization A] and the securing of

access”29.

41. The Head of Investigation noted in the Statement of Objections that “during the visit

on site, a shelf life of 1(one) month and 11 (eleven) days was observed for

the images recorded by the video surveillance cameras installed on the site. This

retention period exceeds that which is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of

protection of property and securing access for which the system was set up

in place »30.

It also noted that “the CNPD takes note of the mitigation elements presented on

this subject by the controller in his letter of November 29, 2019[31] to

within paragraph 3. “Respect for the principle of limiting the storage of

data » »32.

Thus, it held that "notwithstanding these mitigating elements, it follows from the foregoing

that non-compliance with the provisions of article 5, paragraph 1., letter e) cited above was

nevertheless acquired on the day of the on-site visit”.33

42. For its part, the auditee specified in the position paper annexed to its

letter of November 27, 201934 that "the retention period of images recorded

has been set at 30 days (....) for the video surveillance practiced on the site (…)”, and that it

considered that this conversation duration was in accordance with the purposes of the

processing, in particular because “incidents that have occurred (…) on the site (…) are

often reported or detected several weeks after their occurrence”.

43. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period for the

personal data appropriate and necessary to achieve this purpose.

As mentioned above, the reviewer felt that a 30 day shelf life is

necessary in order to achieve the aims pursued, i.e. the protection of property and

securing access.

44. With regard to video surveillance, the Restricted Committee considers that the

images can be retained in principle for up to 8 days under the principle

aforesaid of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR. The controller can

exceptionally, for duly justified reasons, keep the images for a

duration of 30 days. A shelf life longer than 30 days is generally

considered to be disproportionate. In the event of an incident or violation, the Training

Restreinte is of the opinion that the images can be kept beyond this period and,

where appropriate, be communicated to the competent judicial authorities and to the authorities

law enforcement authorities competent to establish or prosecute criminal offences.35

All the more, an obligation to respect the principle of the limitation of the conservation

already existed pursuant to Article 4.1.d) of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. Of

guidance on the principles and obligations provided for in the said repealed law was available

with the CNPD, in particular through mandatory prior authorizations in

video surveillance, and guidance was available on the CNPD website.

45. While the Restricted Formation may understand the need for controlled

to keep the images from the video surveillance outside the buildings on the

operating site of the audited for 30 days, it nevertheless notes that in the

minutes relating to the on-site visit of February 27, 2019 CNPD officials have

noted that the shelf life was “1(one) month and 11 (eleven) days” for the

images recorded by the video surveillance system installed outside the

buildings on the operating site which exceeded the time necessary to achieve the

purposes pursued.

46. Based on all of these elements, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion

of the head of investigation and concludes that non-compliance with article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was acquired

on the day of the site visit by CNPD officials.

C. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

1. On the principles

47. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

48. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.36

49. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

50. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

data collected for other purposes.37

51. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.38

2. In this case

52. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes

video surveillance outside the buildings on the site of the controlled are

“the protection of the property [of public transport organization A] and the securing of

access”39.

53. The Head of Investigation noted in the Statement of Objections that “during the visit

on site it was found that the fields of vision of the cameras called: […]

allow the surveillance of part of the public thoroughfare”40.

In his opinion, "while the purposes indicated by the data controller may

find one or more bases of lawfulness under Article 6 of the GDPR, monitoring the

public road and

neighboring land should however be considered as

disproportionate. Indeed, in view of

purposes for

which is operated

the

video surveillance, it is not necessary to encompass parts of the public road and

surrounding land within the fields of view of the cameras in question”41.

It also noted that “the CNPD takes note of the mitigation elements presented on

this subject by the controller in his letter of November 29, 2019[42] in

in particular the document illustrating the angles of the video surveillance cameras of the site [of

public transport organization A] before and after adjustment”43.

“Notwithstanding these mitigating elements”, the head of investigation noted that the non-

compliance with the provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was nevertheless acquired on the day

of the on-site visit.44

54. The auditee for his part informed in the position paper annexed to his

letter of November 27, 201945 that “the angles of the cameras have been adjusted in order to

exclusively cover the land [of public transport organization A]”. He appended

photos showing the "camera perspectives before and after adjustment".

Furthermore, a procedure

internal would have been put in place "to ensure

a quarterly verification of camera angles, with an adjustment if

necessary ".

55. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor

a place of access (entrance and exit, threshold, porch, door, awning, hall, etc.) must have a

field of vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view people

preparing to access it; those who film exterior accesses must not mark

the entire width of a sidewalk along, where applicable, the building or public roads

adjacent. Outdoor cameras installed near or around a building

must be configured in such a way as not to capture the public thoroughfare, nor the surroundings, entrances,

access and interiors of other neighboring buildings possibly returning to their

field of vision.46

56. She notes that the photos taken by the CNPD agents during the visit

on site show that the fields of vision of the cameras called […] made it possible to

monitor the public highway47, so that the person being controlled did not respect the principle of

proportionality.

57. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

investigation and concludes that non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

58. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 72 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

II. 1.2. As for the geolocation device

On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

1. On the principles

59. With regard to the principles to be observed with regard to the obligation to inform

data subjects in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

refers to points 12 to 15 of this decision.

2. In this case

60. The Head of Investigation noted in the Statement of Objections that “during the visit

on site, it was noted that the employees were not properly informed of

the installation of the geolocation device in the buses of the manager of the

treatment. Indeed, it was explained to the agents that the bus drivers are informed

orally of the implementation of the geolocation device in the buses in the

part of their training.

He held that the control "does not respect its obligation to inform the people

concerned”49, and that “no element of the documentation submitted to the CNPD by the

letter of May 7, 2019 mentioned above does not contain evidence to demonstrate the

compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR”50.

It also took note of the mitigation elements presented by the auditee "in its

letter of November 29, 2019[51], in particular the document entitled “Memo to the

personnel: information processing personal data” as well as paragraph 7.

“Additional note concerning the geolocation of bus drivers […]”52.

“Notwithstanding these mitigating elements”, the head of investigation noted that the non-

compliance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR was nevertheless acquired on the day of the

site visit.53

Thus, he is of the opinion that the controller had failed in his "obligation to inform the persons

concerned about the presence of a geolocation device in vehicles,

arising from Article 13 of the GDPR”54.

61. The auditee for his part indicated in his letter of May 7, 2019 that the

staff delegation, because of its representation in the technical committee which

decides on the equipment to be installed in the controlled vehicles, would have been "involved

and informed […]”.

Bus drivers would be informed about the geolocation system as soon as they

compulsory initial training. The controller attached an email […] of April 25, 2019. This

the latter indicated, among other things, that the employees would receive explanations […], without them

would be informed specifically of the geolocation. They would be aware of the

geolocation of buses to display timetables at bus stops

and on the control center screen55.

62. In addition, the inspected party explained in the statement annexed to his letter

of November 27, 201956 that a “memorandum concerning the video surveillance of the site,

(…) and the geolocation of bus drivers (see appendix) has been brought to the attention

staff by the following means:

• Delivery of the memo to all staff members by hand,

• Publication of the memorandum on the Intranet accessible to all employees

and

• Establishment of a procedure which provides for the delivery of the memorandum to any

new staff member. »

The control pointed out that "the memorandum covers exhaustive information according to

Article 13 GDPR”. He attached the copy of the memo.

In addition, he informed in the statement appended to his letter of the

27 November 2019 cited above57 that steps […] would be underway with regard to

the geolocation of controlled bus drivers and the processing of their data

of a personal nature. The documentation of the control should be updated according to

results […].

63. The Restricted Panel would first like to refer to its clarifications set out

in points 23 and 24 of this Decision relating to the obligation imposed on the controller

processing to “provide” all the obligations mentioned in Article 13 of the GDPR and

the tiered approach to communicating the information required to

persons concerned.

64. Next, it wishes to clarify that Article 12 of the GDPR does not de facto exclude that

the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR may be provided orally

by the controller to the data subject. However, the working group

Article 29 insists that in this case, the data controller should take care "to

keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it (for the purposes of the

compliance with the responsibility requirement), of: i) requesting information orally,

(ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified (if

applicable, see point 20 above), and (iii) the fact that the information was transmitted to

the person concerned. »58

65. The Restricted Panel notes that no documentation submitted by the

checked does not contain evidence that:

-

the staff delegation was informed of the presence of a device to

geolocation […], as indicated by the controller in his letter of May 7, 2019.

The Restricted Committee also considers that information from the delegation

staff does not ensure that the employees of the control have been informed

individually regarding the specific elements of Article 13 of the GDPR;

-

the employees have been duly informed, before the on-site visit, orally

in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

66. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

investigation and concludes that on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents, the person inspected

breached its obligation to inform employees arising from Article 13 of the GDPR.

67. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 72 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

II. 2. On the fine and corrective measures

1. Principles

68. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

_____________________________________________________________

23/34

 



g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

69. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

70. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. […] carried out with public transport organization A

 

 

24/34

 



d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

71. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

72. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce and/or the setting of the amount of a possible administrative fine to be

pronounce.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

73. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposes to the Panel

Restricted to impose an administrative fine on the control in the amount of 4,000 (four

thousand) euros.59

74. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As to the nature and seriousness of the violation (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), it is

that with regard to breaches of Articles 5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR, they are

constituting breaches of the fundamental principles of the GDPR (and the right to

data protection in general), namely the principles of data minimization

data and limitation of storage set out in Chapter II “Principles”

of the GDPR.

As for the failure to

the obligation to inform

the people concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations weighing on data controllers

so that people are fully aware of the use that will be made of

their personal data, once collected. A failure to

Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights of individuals

concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced under the GDPR,

which testifies to their particular importance.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel finds

that these breaches have lasted over time, at least since May 25, 2018

and until the day of the visit of the CNPD agents. She recalls that guidance

                                                           
59 See Statement of Objections, page 9, Ad.C., point 39.

relating to the principles and obligations provided for by the GDPR was available from the

CNPD, in particular on its website. She recalls here that two years separated the entrance

into force of the GDPR from its entry into force to allow those responsible

processing to comply with their obligations. All the more, a

obligation to respect the principles of minimizing and limiting the

custody, as well as a comparable information obligation already existed in

application of articles 4.1.b) and d), 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating

the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

personal. Guidance relating to the principles and obligations provided for in the said law

repealed was available from the CNPD, in particular through authorizations

mandatory prerequisites in terms of video surveillance and geolocation, and the

guidance available on the CNPD website.

- As for the number of data subjects (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restreinte notes that for video surveillance, it is about […] employees of the

controlled60, as well as all third parties, i.e. customers,

suppliers, service providers and visitors, visiting the site

operation of the controlled.

With regard to the geolocation system, these are the various employees who

used buses equipped with such a system.

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately or

not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel recalls that

"not deliberately" means that there was no intention to commit the violation,

although the controller or processor has not complied with the obligation

due diligence required by law.

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of the

control.

- As to the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Panel takes into account the statement of the head of investigation according to

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

its willingness to comply with the law as soon as possible61.

- As for the measures taken by the inspected party to mitigate the damage suffered by the

data subjects (article 83.2.c) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account

of the measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of this

decision for the related explanations.

75. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

76. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the control

in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these have only been

adopted only following the control of CNPD agents on February 27, 2019 (see

also point 71 of this decision).

77. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c), e) and 13 of the GDPR.

78. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, it recalls that the

paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple infringements, such as

this is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for

the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

79. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Panel considers that the pronouncement of a fine of 3,500 (three thousand five

- to adapt the field of vision or to proceed with the removal of the cameras allowing the

surveillance of public roads; »62.

81. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 72 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c), e) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed

in his letters of May 7, 2019, November 27, 2019 and December 6, 2021. More

in particular, it takes note of the following facts:

1. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation listed under a. from

point 80 of this Decision concerning the introduction of measures

information for people

third parties affected by

the

video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR,

the controller explained in the statement attached to his letter of

November 27, 2019 that he opted for a multi-tiered approach to

communicate transparency information to third parties

concerned by information panels with pictograms and by a note

information available on its website. He provided a copy of the new

information board, photos showing that it was affixed to five places

external access to its operating site, and the link to the information notice

on its website63 with its aforementioned letter.

The Restricted Committee considers that the new information panels

contain the information of the first level of information, and that the second

level of information, i.e. the information note currently available

on the website of the controller, contains all the information required at the

under Article 13 of the GDPR.

Considering the sufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 72 of this decision, the Panel

Restricted therefore considers that there is no need to pronounce the measure

corrective action proposed by the head of investigation in this respect as set out in point

80 of this decision under a. with regard to the information of

third parties with regard to video surveillance.

2. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation listed under a. from

point 80 of this Decision concerning the introduction of measures

information intended for employees concerned by video surveillance and/or

geolocation in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the

controlled explained in the position paper attached to his letter of

November 27, 2019 that the transparency information would have been

communicated to employees by means of a memorandum64 of which he annexed

a copy.

The Restricted Committee notes that the said note, which not only targets the

video surveillance of the operating site, but also the geolocation of

bus, contains all the information required under article 13 of the

GDPR.

However, none of the documentation submitted by the auditee contains evidence

certifying that the memorandum has been delivered to all staff members

in person and/or published on the Intranet of the auditee, or that a

procedure has been put in place to ensure delivery of the memorandum to

any new employee.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 72 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte therefore considers that there is reason to pronounce the corrective measure

proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and repeated in point 80 of this

decision under a. with regard to informing employees about the

video surveillance and geolocation.

3. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation listed under b. from

point 80 of this Decision concerning the obligation to limit the storage

video surveillance data in accordance with the provisions of Article

5.1.e) of the GDPR, the controller in the position statement attached to its letter of

November 27, 2019 explained that the retention period of images

recorded would have been reduced to 30 days, which was recorded in the extract from the

register of processing activities that the controller has attached to his letter

aforementioned. He believed that this retention period was in accordance with the

purposes of the processing, which is not disputed by the Restricted Panel in

the species.

However, none of the documentation submitted by the auditee contains evidence

certifying that the retention period of the recorded images has effectively

been reduced to 30 days.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 72 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte therefore considers that there is reason to pronounce the corrective measure

proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and repeated in point 80 of this

decision under b.

4. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation listed under c. from

point 80 of this Decision concerning the obligation to deal only with

relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

protecting property and securing access, in accordance with the

provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, the audit confirmed in the taking of

position appended to his letter of November 27, 2019 that he had adjusted the

fields of vision of the cameras in order to exclusively cover its site

operating. He attached to this letter photos showing the fields of

vision of the cameras called […] before and after this adjustment.

The Restricted Panel considers that the fields of vision of these cameras have

been adjusted in order to, and as far as possible, no longer film public roads.

Considering the sufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 72 of this decision, the Panel

Restricted therefore considers that there is no need to pronounce the measure

corrective action proposed by the head of investigation in this respect as set out in point

80 of this decision under c.
