Thus, 25 audit procedures were opened in 2018, concerning both the private sector and the

public sector.

2.

In particular, the National Commission decided by deliberation n°[…] of 14

According to Article 3 of its statutes, the purpose of the control is [to offer social services].

By letter dated September 17, 2018, the head of investigation sent a questionnaire

It appears from the audit report that in order to verify the organization's compliance with the

section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR, the head of investigation has defined eleven control objectives,

to know :

 

1) Ensure that the body subject to the obligation to appoint a DPO has done so;

8) Ensure that the organization has put in place measures for the DPO to be associated with

all questions relating to data protection;

9) Ensure that the DPO fulfills his mission of providing information and advice to the

controller and employees;

10) Ensure that the DPO exercises adequate control over data processing within

of his body;

11) Ensure that the DPO assists the controller in carrying out the

impact analyzes in the event of new data processing.

6.

By letter dated October 28, 2019 (hereinafter: the "statement of objections"), the head

of investigation informed the control of the breaches of the obligations provided for by the RGPD that it

found during his investigation. The audit report was attached to that letter.

 

7.

In particular, the head of investigation noted in the statement of objections a

breach relating to the control mission of the DPO2.

 

8.

By letter dated November 18, 2019, the controller sent the head of investigation his decision

position on the breach noted in the statement of objections.

 

9.

On December 3, 2020, the head of investigation sent a letter to the controller

supplementary to the statement of objections by which it informs the auditee that, in view

given the latter's position of November 18, 2019, "there is reason to withdraw the grievance

on compliance with the requirements relating to the tasks of the DPO and in particular to the tasks

of control" and that "[i]there is therefore no longer any grievance against you

regarding this investigation. »

 

10.

By email of December 7, 2020, the head of investigation sent the investigation file to

the National Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereafter: the “commission

restricted”), indicating that he has not accepted any grievance or breach of the control,

when the latter had met the expectations set in the context of the investigation or presented

mitigation elements that it considers sufficient in relation to the control objectives included

in point 5 of this decision. For these reasons, the head of investigation proposed to the formation

restricted, in its communication of December 7, 2020, the closure of the file.

11.

The Restricted Committee examined the case during its meeting of February 5, 2021,

 

 

in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the National Commission's internal rules.

 

12.

During the said session, the Restricted Committee considered that it was not sufficiently

enlightened as to whether the controlled, given its structure, within which

several member entities are grouped together, and the preponderance of said entities for

management and exercise of its activities, is obliged to appoint a delegate to

data protection pursuant to Article 37(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

Data protection.

 

13.

The Restricted Committee therefore asked the Head of Investigation, by letter from

March 25, 2021, to proceed, in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the internal rules of

the National Commission, to further investigation on this point.

 

14.

By email of May 25, 2021, the head of investigation asked the control of him

communicate additional information and documents, in particular concerning the

activities of the controller and its decision-making structure, in order to be able to inform the training

restricted on the point of knowing if the control is in the obligation to designate a delegate

to data protection pursuant to Article 37(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Data protection.

 

15.

The controller responded to this request by letter dated June 15, 2021. The controller y

indicates in particular that he carried out an analysis which led him to consider that he is in

the obligation to appoint a DPO and that this analysis has been updated account

given the questions raised by the Restricted Committee in this regard.

 

16.

Following this exchange, the Head of Investigation informed the Restricted Committee, by email of the

June 22, 2021, of its conclusion on the point subject to further investigation, according to

which the controller is indeed subject to the obligation to appoint a DPO. The head of investigation has

elsewhere again proposed to the Restricted Committee to close the file, considering that it

there is no reason to find any breach with regard to the controlled party.

 

17.

The Restricted Committee again examined the case during its session on October 27

2021, in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the Commission's internal rules

national.

18.

Taking into account the elements communicated by the controller as part of the additional

inquiry, the Restricted Committee finds that it does not share the conclusion of the Chief

of investigation according to which the control is indeed subject to the obligation to appoint a delegate for the

Data protection.

 

19.

It should first be noted that the controlled entity is an entity [...] "which brings together the

activities organized for its provider members" and that, as mentioned in

point 12 of this decision, these entities have a prominent place for the management and

the exercise of its activities.

 

20.

As for the activities of the control, the Restricted Committee observes that if the head

of investigation correctly noted in its email of June 22, 2021 that “[t]he basic activities

[of the controlled] are [to provide social services] and that, within the framework of these activities, the

controlled deals with data relating to health, the head of the investigation also noted

that “[in] the context of its basic activities, [the auditee] does not have collaborators.

All activities are carried out by another entity, member of the network [of the controlled], for

the account [of the controlled]. »

 

21.

 In this regard, it should be noted that in its response of June 15, 2021, the audited

identified only one "own operational activity", the other activities mentioned

being on the one hand “Delegated operational activities” to one of its member entities

and on the other hand “Administrative and support activities” delegated to two entities

members.

 

22.

With regard to the decision-making structure, the elements communicated by the

audited confirm that its member entities, which sit in its Assembly

general, occupy a preponderant place, it being specified that “an activity is recognized

as an activity [of the auditee] if it was set up by decision of the board

of Directors”, this Board of Directors being “composed of […] members at least and

of […] members at most, taken from among the active members and elected by the general assembly

ordinary and annual ruling by a simple majority of the votes of the active members present. »

 

23.

The audit further indicates that this Board of Directors (hereinafter: CA) “is

responsible for the general management [of the controlled] and for the strategy of the network. Since [the

________________________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with the non-profit association A

controlled] has a very limited activity of its own, the CA focuses on agreements

 

 

between the partners forming the network. It validates common strategies

proposed by the partners, determines, where applicable, their financing and the entity or entities

responsible for their operationalization. »

 

24.

Finally, the controller indicates that it is “[i]n summary (…) a confederation bringing together the

members actors and drivers of a common idea in order to determine common policies

and to organize their implementation at the level of field activities. So any day-to-day management

(also that [of the auditee himself]) is entrusted to operational entities, in

occurrence to partners. »

 

25.

In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that it has not been established by the

further investigation that the auditee, namely Non-Profit Association A was

under the obligation to appoint a DPO.

 

26. Furthermore, given the objectives defined by the CNPD within the framework of the campaign

thematic survey on the function of the DPO, and in particular the criteria used for the

selection of entities, the Restricted Committee considers that the investigation opened by the deliberation

n°[…] of September 14, 2018 should also have covered, given their activities and

data processing, on other operational entities, service provider members

the non-profit association A.

 

27.

Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the matter should be closed,

in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the National Commission's internal rules.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting in

restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

- to close the investigation opened by deliberation n°[…] of September 14, 2018 of the

National Commission for Data Protection at the Non-Profit Association

A located at […], L-[…] and registered in the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register

under the number[…]
