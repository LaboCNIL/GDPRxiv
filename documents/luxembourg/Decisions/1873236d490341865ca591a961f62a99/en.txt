I. Facts and procedure

1. During its deliberation session of February 14, 2019, the National Commission

for data protection sitting in plenary session (hereafter: “Formation

Plenary”) had decided to open an investigation among the companies of Group A1 on the basis

of article 37 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission

for data protection and the general data protection regime (hereafter

after “Law of August 1, 2018”) and to designate Mr. Christophe Buschmann as

head of investigation.

2. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation carried out by the

CNPD officers was to verify compliance with the provisions of the regulations

(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 relating to the protection

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”)

and the law of August 1, 2018, in particular by setting up systems for

video surveillance and geolocation, where applicable, installed by […] companies in the

Group A.

3. On October 23, 2019, CNPD agents carried out a visit to the

the premises of Group A at […], L-[…]. During the visit, it was explained to the agents of the

CNPD that Company A is "the parent company" and that it "has appointed a competent DPO

for all entities of the Group A structure in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg”2.

Given that the report relating to the said on-site fact-finding mission does not mention

that, among the […] companies of Group A, as controller controlled the

Company A, the decision of the National Data Protection Commission sitting

in restricted training on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter: “Restricted Training”)

will be limited to processing controlled by CNPD agents and carried out by Company A.

by CNPD officials.

8. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 24

August 2021 a Statement of Objections (hereafter: the “Statement of Objections”)

detailing the shortcomings that he considered constituted in this case, and more specifically a

non-compliance with prescribed requirements:

 by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to

informing all persons concerned about the system of

video surveillance; And

 by article 5.1.c) of the GDPR (principle of minimization of data) with regard to

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

 

A. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

19. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

20. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.6

21. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

22. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal information collected for other purposes.7

23. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.8

2. In this case

24. During the on-site visit on 23 October 2019, it was explained to the

CNPD officials that the purposes of setting up the video surveillance system

are the protection of property, securing access to private places and places to

risks, user safety and accident prevention.9

2.1 With regard to the field of vision of cameras filming employees at their workplace

work and during their break time

25. During the said visit, the CNPD agents observed that the fields of

26. CNPD officials also noted during the said visit that the field

view of camera n° [12] (documented by the photo […]) allows monitoring

permanent employees during their break16 (statement of objections, point

26, page 8).

27. The head of investigation was of the opinion that “such permanent surveillance can create

significant psychological pressure for employees who feel and know they are

observed, especially since the monitoring measures last over time: the fact

that the employees concerned do not have a means of evading time from

another form of surveillance is also likely to aggravate this pressure: Such

permanent surveillance is considered disproportionate to the purpose sought

and constitutes an excessive invasion of the private sphere of the employees occupied in their positions

work and during their break time. In this case the fundamental rights and freedoms

employees must prevail over the interests pursued by the employer. " (communication

objections, point 27, page 8).

28. Thus, he held that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established

on the day of the site visit and that the documentation and photos submitted to the chief

of investigation by letter of December 13, 2019 made it possible “to document the will of the

controlled to remedy this problem in order to comply with the requirements of the GDPR

(…)” but that “the adoption of compliance measures after the visit

on site is not such as to upset this finding” (statement of objections, point 30,

page 8).

29. The controlled on his side explained in his email of November 5, 2019 (i.e.

before receipt of the minutes) that

-

he had set up "a masking system concerning the cameras filming

sensitive areas”, i.e. he sent a document showing a

masking of the fields of view of cameras n° [12], n° [7], n° [8], n° [9] and

the reception camera; and that'

-

he undertook to disconnect camera no. [11] from their “private space on the site

of Company X in the event of activation of our [their] backup plan”.

30. By letter dated December 13, 2019, in response to the minutes, the controller

explained, on the one hand, that he considered that certain fields of vision of certain cameras

above were justified and, on the other hand, that he confirmed having installed a new

masking so as not to film certain workstations (by attaching photos of the

changes to his mail) and, in one case, that he confirmed having ordered a new

equipment to replace a camera that did not allow the function to be restricted

zoom. Specifically, the auditee explained that

-

camera n° [1] was “positioned in the safe […] in which are

stored precious metals and physical securities” and that there was a

"Isolated employee in this difficult to access premises with very

restricted” and that he therefore considered that the presence of the said camera was

justified in relation to the purposes sought17;

-

camera n° [2] was “positioned in the […] safe […] in which are

stored values and the proceeds of the cash register” of the controlled and that the

work that were located there were not “permanently occupied, but

occasionally used for sensitive tasks ([…])” and that he considered

therefore that the presence of said camera was justified in relation to the purposes

wanted18;

-

cameras no. [3] and [4] were “intended to monitor the corridors of spaces

accessible to customers" and that the meeting rooms were "in reality

reception lounges, whose walls are equipped with an opacification system on

order” but that he nevertheless carried out the video masking to guarantee

the conformity of the device19;

-

camera no. [5] allowed “monitoring of a secondary access to space

of the […] floor of the building […]” and captured the entrance to a meeting room.

The controlled was of the opinion that the head of investigation should have qualified the assertion according to

which said camera allowed the permanent surveillance of people

present in the meeting room, because, according to him, the meeting room was equipped

a door allowing its contents to be completely concealed when it was

occupied, but he confirmed that he nevertheless proceeded with the video masking for

guarantee the conformity of the device20;

-

he carried out the partial masking of the field of vision of the reception camera21;

-

camera no. [6] was “positioned at the level of the central counter (…), local

sensitive because of the cash transactions carried out there (handling of

tickets […])” and that the workstation located there was not occupied in

permanently because cash transactions constituted an activity

marginal of the controlled and that he therefore considered that the presence of the said camera

was justified in relation to the purposes sought 22;

-

cameras n° [7], n° [8], n° [9], n° [10] were “oriented towards the access doors

private spaces on the floors of the building […]” and, on the one hand, he confirmed

that camera n° [7] captured in its field of vision the workstation of a

collaborator and, on the other hand, he indicated that, according to him, it seemed “questionable

to affirm that the cameras [8], [9] and [10]” allowed “surveillance in

permanence of the workstations of the employees occupying these offices" because

that “the interior fittings (…) and the partially encrusted walls

of reasons (…)” should “make it possible to qualify this assessment”. By

against, he confirmed that he nevertheless carried out the video masking at the level of

these 4 cameras to guarantee the conformity of the device23;

-

camera no. [11] aimed “to monitor the private space rented by Company A at

the provider Company X” and that this […] space was in principle “never

occupied, except in cases of force majeure resulting in the temporary unavailability of

premises of Company A and the activation of a contingency plan”. He indicated

also that the camera [11] was "intended to be deactivated in such

exceptional circumstances”. On the other hand, he confirmed, “despite the absence of

finding of deficiency", that he nevertheless carried out the video masking for

guarantee the conformity of the system 24; and

-

camera no. [12] made it possible “to monitor sensitive windows at the level of a

corridor of the building [...]" but that the presence of chairs and stools had

leads users to use this place of passage during their break time and

he confirmed that he therefore carried out the video “masking” at the level

of this camera to ensure device compliance.25

31. By letter dated October 29, 2021, the auditee responded to the communication from the

grievances of the head of investigation, reiterating certain explanations already mentioned in his

letter of December 13, 2019 and also noting that the minutes lingered "

on certain cameras (n° [1], n° [5], etc) while omitting to specify that the others

cameras (No. [100], No. [200], etc.) do not allow such "surveillance

permanent". In his view, the Statement of Objections did not address "this element to be

discharge”.26

32. The auditee noted more specifically that he is of the opinion that the head of investigation

should have distinguished between two distinct types of places filmed by the cameras in question:

on the one hand, the counters and the safe room of the controlled and, on the other hand, the other places,

such as meeting rooms. In his view "the economic and strategic sensitivity of

these two categories should not be confused.

33. With regard to “safe rooms”, the auditee noted that “even if there is

is correct that the employees of Company A present in the vault and at the counters

are filmed incidentally, this is proportionate and legitimized by the critical nature of

these places" and that "the very quantity and value of the assets thus protected is a

circumstance to be taken into account in the assessment of the proportionality of the

CCTV »28. In his opinion, the assertions of the head of the investigation according to which the

employees were filmed “permanently” and did not have “a means of

withdraw from this monitoring from time to time" (points 25 to 27 of the communication

grievances) would be at fault because “the employees assigned to the safe room and the

counters” were not “statically posted in the angle of the cameras in question”

and that they had “permission to move outside of these viewing angles” and that they

even had to “regularly do so, as part of their duties”29. He pointed out

also that “the employee assigned to the safe room” was “in a room

locked for obvious security reasons" and that because this person

isolated, it was therefore imperative for the controlled to ensure its safety and health.

According to him, the surveillance camera would be the only way to know if the employee in

question was not “in the throes of discomfort” or if he was having some other problem. In

Furthermore, he noted that the employee in question was not permanently filmed because

the employee assigned to the safe room was not always the same “because rounds, time

breaks and shifts are expressly provided for. This is a temporary workstation,

punctual and limited (…)”30.

With regard to "Company A's counters", the auditee noted that […].31

More generally, the auditee was of the opinion that the respective cameras were not

not “directed in such a way as to film the employees from the front”. He indicated that these

were “in principle filmed from behind and only incidentally. Neither the hands nor the

face, nor the devices (computers and private or professional telephones) of the employees "

were not targeted by these cameras. According to him, the cameras were "therefore installed in the

strict necessary and proportional framework relating to their purposes. 32 He therefore summarized that,

according to him, the fundamental rights and freedoms of his employees did not prevail over his

interest in ensuring the security and integrity of the assets of its customers.

34. With regard to “other places, including meeting rooms”, the control

- reiterated his explanations in relation to camera n° [12], in particular that

the space targeted by this camera was not "a place dedicated to the rest of employees"

but "a simple corridor between two departments" and that the control had

never “encouraged or fitted out this space so that it accommodates employees

during their break time”33;

- explained in relation to the cameras filming the workstations he practiced

“a distribution of employee offices in “flexible” mode” and that this

meant that its employees had no “assigned place” to carry out their

tasks but that they could settle in the office of their preference and that, for

Consequently, it would not be possible to reproach him for monitoring

of its employees34. With particular regard to the

camera no. [11], the person inspected reconfirmed his commitment to disconnect said

camera in the event of activation of the backup plan35;

- noted in relation to the cameras filming the audited meeting rooms that a

meeting room was not "a 'permanent' workplace for employees"

because the latter only went there "on rare occasions, for a while

limited and only for certain employees" and that, consequently, it would not be

not possible to blame him for “permanent surveillance” of his employees.

He also explained that the cameras in question were filming the corridors

leading to meeting rooms, but that people inside the rooms

were “not normally identifiable”. He added that all of his rooms

meeting were equipped with a system guaranteeing their opacity (i.e. the windows

were tinted/smoked or studded with patterns/logos/drawings, i.e. the rooms

were fitted with curtains/blinds/other covers) and that, consequently, the

supervision of the employees was either materially impossible or the employees

had the option of obscuring the walls of said meeting rooms.36

35. La Formation Restreinte would like to point out that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach

the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. However, to respect

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

36. In this case, she notes that at the time of the on-site visit, all the cameras

disputed (see point 25 of this decision) allowed the monitoring of workstations

work of the employees but she notes that there were some which allowed the surveillance

employees only on an ad hoc basis and not on a permanent basis and who

were at the same time justified in relation to the aims pursued.

                                            
35 See Letter from the audit dated October 29, 2021, page 25, 6.2.

She notes that camera numbers [1] and [2], which were monitoring a space in or in front of

the safes […] of the controlled, and camera n° [6], which monitored the central counter of the

controlled, seem a priori, at first, justified to achieve the purposes

pursued, i.e. the protection of property, the securing of access to places at

risks, user safety and accident prevention. These are three

cameras that monitored particularly sensitive places in an establishment

bank where regulations on the security of cash transport (law of 12

November 2002 and the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 22 August 2003 relating to the activities

deprived of guarding and surveillance) makes it compulsory to provide

surveillance in certain premises used by cash security guards and justifies as soon as

in the resulting data processing for monitoring purposes. She notes

also that, under certain assumptions, the risk to the safety of personnel may

be of such importance that it takes precedence over the protection of the privacy of the same personnel.

Thus, insofar as thefts from banking establishments are often

accompanied by violence, it may be necessary for certain employees to be under

permanent monitoring. However, it recalls that the principle of proportionality

implies that the controller must limit the processing to data

adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes to be achieved. By

Therefore, the field of vision of the cameras should not, as far as possible,

relate to the workstation of a particular employee, and if such cannot absolutely

be avoided, the face of the employee in question must not be visible (e.g. by the use of

blurring/masking computer techniques).

With regard to camera n° [1], the Restricted Panel notes that a post

of work “in the safe […]”37 is in the field of vision of the said camera.

After a question posed by the Restricted Panel during the hearing of February 24, 2022,

the controller has confirmed that this is the workstation of an isolated employee who must remain there

for at least several consecutive hours per day (and not as mentioned in

the mail from the control of October 29, 2021 "of a temporary, punctual and

limited”38). Consequently, the Restricted Panel finds that the employee in question

is permanently monitored in the workplace and this without the use of

computer blurring/masking techniques. She concludes that even if the installation of

said camera is justified in relation to the purposes pursued (i.e. the protection of property

and the safety of users in a particularly sensitive area of an establishment

bank), its field of vision is nevertheless excessive because there are techniques

blurring/masking to prevent an employee's face from being permanently visible,

so that the controlled did not respect the principle of proportionality.

With regard to camera n° [2], the Restricted Panel observes that

workstations in a “secure room adjoining the safe […]” are located in the

field of view of said camera. It appears from the letters of the control that these posts of

work are not "permanently occupied, but used occasionally for

sensitive tasks (storage and counting of cash, cash pick-up from the counter

central)” 39. Consequently, the Restricted Training finds that the employees in

issue are not permanently monitored in the workplace. She concludes

that, on the one hand, the installation of the camera in question is justified in relation to the purposes

pursued (i.e. the protection of property and the safety of users in a place

particularly sensitive of a banking establishment) and that, on the other hand, its field of

vision is not excessive.

With regard to camera n° [6], the Restricted Panel notes that a post

of work "at the level of the central counter" is in the field of vision of the said

camera. It appears from the letters of the control that this workstation "is not occupied in

permanence" because cash transactions were a marginal activity of the

controlled40 and that an employee would only go “to this counter only in the hypothesis

(exceptional) handling of cash”41. Therefore, the formation

Restricted finds that the employee in question is not permanently supervised

At work. It concludes that, on the one hand, the installation of the camera in question

is justified in relation to the purposes pursued (i.e. the protection of property and the security

users in a particularly sensitive area of a banking institution) and that,

on the other hand, its field of vision is not excessive.

With regard to the reception camera and cameras n° [7], [8], [9], [10] and [11], the

Restricted Formation notes that the photos taken by CNPD agents during the

visit show that the fields of vision of the said cameras made it possible to monitor

permanence of employees in the workplace. She would like to point out that the cameras

intended to monitor a place of access (entrance and exit, door, awning, hall, etc.) must

have a field of vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view the

people about to access it. To respect the principle of proportionality, the

controlled should have limited the fields of view of cameras n° [7], [8], [9], [10] and [11] to the

only area necessary to achieve the purpose(s) pursued and, by

Consequently, in this case he should have limited the fields of vision to the access doors without

include the offices of its employees.

With regard to cameras Nos. [3], [4] and [5], it also notes that the said

cameras made it possible to constantly monitor employees in meeting rooms

controlled and that even if they are equipped with an opacification system (on

order), such a system does not guarantee that the employees who are in the

the obligation to spend their working time there are not permanently filmed during

the performance of their tasks. To respect the principle of proportionality, the

controlled should have limited the fields of vision of cameras n° [3], [4] and [5] to the sole

area necessary to achieve the purpose(s) pursued and, consequently, it

should have limited the fields of vision to the “corridors of spaces accessible to the

customers”42 with regard to the two cameras n° [3] and [4], and, to the “secondary access

to the private space on the 1st floor of the building […]”43 with regard to camera no. [5].

In addition, it notes that camera no. [12] allowed permanent surveillance

employees during their break time. She wishes to remind that, when it comes to places

reserved for employees in the workplace for private use, as in this case the

corridor where there were chairs, stools and at least two tables (and where we see,

on the photos taken by CNPD agents at the time of the on-site visit,

employees eating), surveillance cameras are always considered

disproportionate to the aims sought. It's the same for

places such as, for example, changing rooms, toilets, smoking areas, areas

rest, the canteen, the kitchenette or any other place reserved for employees for use

private. In this case, the fact that the place in question was, according to the controlled, not

officially reserved for employees for private use, does not prevent its employees from

have de facto used this place to spend their break there, especially since furniture has

made available for this purpose a priori by the controller. In these cases, the rights and freedoms

employees must prevail over the legitimate interests pursued by

the employer.

37. As for the argument of the inspector that the employees were generally not filmed

"permanently" because they would not have a "dedicated place" to carry out their

tasks and that they could freely choose a workstation each day, the Training

Restreinte would like to mention that after a question was asked during the Training session

Restricted on February 24, 2022, the auditee confirmed that even if its employees have not

fixed workstation, they nevertheless choose a place each morning on which they

stay all day, that is to say the fact of not having a designated place does not prevent

not that an employer can monitor employees all day in the workplace if the

field of view of a camera allows it.

38. As for the argument of the control that the head of investigation would not have noted

of “exculpatory element”44 according to which only certain cameras allowed a

permanent surveillance of employees, but other cameras did not allow

no such monitoring (see point 31 of this decision), the Restricted Panel

considers that it would not be appropriate to pay particular attention to the cameras

supervision which corresponded to the legal provisions in force at the time of the

site visit. It notes that the cameras which corresponded to the legal provisions

in force at the time of the on-site visit are to be considered as a neutral element and

not as an exculpatory element of the controlled.

39. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

investigation in relation to cameras n° [1], [3], [4], [5], reception camera, [7], [8], [9], [10],

[11] and [12] and concludes that a non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established at the

day of the site visit by CNPD agents.

40. On the other hand, it does not follow the analysis of the head of investigation in relation to the

cameras Nos. [2] and [6] and concludes that said cameras complied with Article 5.1.c) of the

GDPR on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents.

41. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 93 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

42. During the on-site visit on October 23, 2019, CNPD officials

notice that

(statement of objections, point 28, page 8).

controller. This monitoring is therefore considered to be

disproportionate” (statement of objections, point 29, page 8).

44. Thus, he held that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established

on the day of the on-site visit and that the documentation and photos submitted by the controller

by letter of December 13, 2019 made it possible "to document the will of the control of

remedy this problem in order to comply with the prescriptions of the GDPR (…)” but

that "the adoption of compliance measures after the on-site visit

is not such as to upset that finding” (statement of objections, point 30, page 8).

45. The controlled on his side explained in his email of November 5, 2019 (i.e.

before receipt of the minutes) that

-

he had set up "a masking system concerning the cameras filming

sensitive areas”, i.e. he sent photos showing a

masking of the fields of vision of camera n° [15] and of the “dome” camera

No. [14]; And

-

he had programmed the replacement of the “dome” camera n° [13] because,

according to him, it did not allow a "masking" of certain areas.

46. These explanations were reiterated by the controller in his letter of 13

December 2019 in response to the minutes. In said letter, the controller reaffirmed

have ordered a new camera to replace the “dome” camera n° [13] in sight

compliance of the device and he sent back the same photos he had already

sent as an appendix to his email of November 5, 201948.

47. By letter dated October 29, 2021, the auditee responded to the communication from the

grievances of the chief of investigation, noting that, according to him, the reasons for which the chief

of investigation had considered that the control had not respected the principle of minimization

in relation to the disputed cameras seemed to him “little talkative”49.

48. The auditee referred in particular to the “EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on

the processing of personal data by video devices, version 2.0,

adopted on 29 January 2020” (hereinafter: “EDPB Guidelines 3/2019”) and that,

according to him, said EDPB 3/2019 guidelines seemed to contradict

analysis of the head of investigation, in particular because the EDPB indicated that "Most of the

time, the need to use video surveillance to protect the premises of the

controller applies only to the boundaries of the property. However, he does

It is not always enough to monitor the places concerned to guarantee effective protection.

In certain specific cases, it may be necessary to extend the video surveillance to

the immediate surroundings of the property. »50

49. The inspector considered that in this case, “effective protection of the premises, property

and persons required Company A to video-surveillance its own

buildings but also places adjoining them. Video surveillance of a party (minimum)

of public roads and third-party buildings was therefore necessary, adequate and

proportional”. He was of the opinion that it is inefficient to film only the threshold of the

controlled building because this did not make it possible to identify threats that

directed towards this threshold from an external zone. For example, he mentioned

vehicles or suspicious individuals on the public road directly adjoining the building

of the controlled who could not be monitored and/or arrested if the controlled could not

only filming its own façade51. In his opinion, "if the elements dangerous to the

safety of Company A (goods or people) and of its customers and employees cannot be

detected only once they have already entered Company A's buildings, such security

could easily be described as flawed and at the very least as insufficient and non-

effective”.52

50. Consequently, he considered that the processing could not be qualified as

disproportionate and did not violate the principle of data minimization. Moreover, he has

mentioned again that the controller has already carried out "masking of the areas whose

question (public road and third places)" but he stressed that these measures marked the

respect and sincere desire for cooperation of the audited party towards the CNPD and that they do not

should not be understood "as recognition, even tacit, on the part of the

Company A of any breach of the duty of data minimization”53.

51. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor

a place of access (entrance and exit, threshold, porch, door, awning, hall, etc.) must have a

field of vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view people

getting ready to get there. Those who film exterior accesses must not mark

the entire width of a sidewalk along, where applicable, the building or public roads

adjacent. Similarly, outdoor cameras installed near or around a

building must be configured so as not to capture the public thoroughfare or the surroundings,

entrances, accesses and interiors of other neighboring buildings possibly entering

their field of vision.54

52. She nevertheless admits that depending on the configuration of the premises, it is sometimes

impossible to install a camera that would not include in its field of vision a

part of the public thoroughfare, surroundings, entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In

such a case, it considers that the data controller should put in place

masking or blurring techniques to limit the field of view to its property.55

53. She notes that the photos taken by the CNPD agents during the visit

on site show that the field of vision of the “dome” camera n° [13] allowed the

surveillance of a small part of the roads belonging to the public domain as well as

buildings not belonging to the controlled. It takes into consideration that said camera

did not monitor the roads on board and that this only represents a small part

of the field of view of said camera.

In addition, she notes that the dome camera no. [14] allowed surveillance in

permanence of buildings not belonging to the controlled, so that the controlled does not

did not respect the principle of proportionality.

With regard to camera No. [15], the Restricted Panel notes that it allowed

surveillance of the entrance to the controlled building overlooking […], i.e. an entrance

accessible to the public, and that it allowed at the same time the surveillance of a small

part of the road belonging to the public domain. She finds that the field of vision of

said camera is sufficiently limited to what is necessary to achieve the purposes

continued (in this case, securing access to high-risk locations and the safety of

users) and that the principle of proportionality has thus been respected.

As for the argument of the control that the opinion of the EDPB would be contrary to the opinion of the head

point 29 of its statement of objections according to which the monitoring

performed by the three disputed cameras were disproportionate, the Formation

Restreinte would like to remind that the auditee quoted point 27 of the EDPB guidelines

3/2019 to explain why he believed the EDPB was allowing surveillance of the premises

adjoining the controlled buildings56. She notes that he quoted only the first part

of the said point 27 concerning the opinion of the EDPB with regard to a possible need to extend the

video surveillance in the immediate environment of the property of a manager of the

treatment: “Most of the time, the need to use video surveillance to

protecting the premises of the data controller applies only to the limits of the

property. However, it is not always enough to monitor the places concerned to guarantee

effective protection. In some specific cases, it may be necessary to extend the

video surveillance in the immediate environment of the property. »

The Restricted Committee points out that point 27 of the EDPB 3/2019 guidelines

continues with the following sentence: "In this context, the data controller

should consider additional physical and technical means, consisting of

example to block or pixelate irrelevant areas. ". Then, the EDPB finishes its

explanations with an example: “a bookstore wishes to protect its premises against

vandalism. In general, the cameras should film only the premises concerned, because it

it is not necessary to monitor neighboring premises or public places located at

around the bookstore for this purpose. 57 Consequently, it is of the opinion that the opinion of the EDPB

further reinforces the analysis of the head of investigation in his statement of objections by

compared to “dome” cameras n° [13] and [14].

54. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel therefore agrees with the opinion of the

head of investigation in relation to “dome” cameras n° [13] and [14] and concludes that a non-

compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit by the agents

of the CNPD.

55. On the other hand, she does not follow the analysis of the head of investigation in relation to the camera

No. [15] and concludes that said camera complied with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR on the day of the

on-site visit by CNPD officers.

56. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 93 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

 

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

57. According to paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the GDPR, the “controller

take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14

as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article

34 with regard to the treatment to the data subject in a concise manner,

transparent, understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

58. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

 

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

 

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

 

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

  

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

 

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; And

 

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

 

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

 

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

 

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

 

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

 

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data;

 

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

 

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

 

59. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.58 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

60. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.59

 

2. In this case

61. With regard to the information of customers, suppliers, service providers

services and visitors (hereinafter: “third parties”) and employees with regard to the

video surveillance system, the CNPD agents noted during their visit to

site that they are informed “by a pictogram and an old authorization sticker for

the CNPD at the level of the entrance door located at […]” and by “a pictogram at the level

of the passage not open to the public, located between […] and […]”.60

62. The Head of Investigation noted in the Statement of Objections that “while a

certain information is provided by the controlled party to signal the presence of the

video surveillance, it should be noted that in view of the requirements of the aforementioned article 13, this

information is incomplete. In particular, the audit fails to provide the following elements:

the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. »61

He therefore noted that "the pictograms affixed on site, as well as the old

CNPD vignettes are of such a nature as to fulfill the conditions of the aforementioned article 13. »62

63. The head of investigation clarified that “in his email of November 5, 2019 and in

his letter of December 13, 2019, the controller specifies that he initiated the replacement and

upgrading of pictograms warning employees and third parties of the presence

of a CCTV system. Nevertheless, it fails to note that the non-

compliance with article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit. In effect,

the adoption of compliance measures after the on-site visit is not

likely to upset this finding. »63

Thus, it held that the controller failed in its "obligation to inform the

data subjects of the video surveillance system (employees and customers) resulting from

Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR. »64

64. The controlled on his side attached to his email of November 5, 2019 (i.e.

say before sending the minutes) “a series of additional documents mentioned

together during your [the] control mission”:



the formalization of the “Data Protection Impact Assessment” carried out on the

Group A CCTV device;

 a “screenshot of the “GDPR” section” of the intranet site accessible

to all Group A employees (hereafter: the “intranet section

GDPR”);

He also mentioned the “launch of an internal study with a view to

in accordance with the pictograms indicating to employees and third parties the existence of a

camera surveillance system.

65. In his letter of December 13, 2019, in response to the minutes, the

controlled reported that it had “initiated the replacement and upgrading of

pictograms warning employees and third parties of the presence of a

video surveillance” and that it will indicate in the future “in particular the name of the person responsible for the

device, the legal basis, the retention period of the images and the methods of

complaint” to the Data Protection Officer and to the CNPD.

66. With regard more specifically to informing employees about the

CCTV system, the head of investigation noted in his statement of objections

that “the controller declared that the employees were informed of the protection policy

data via the distribution of related documents via the company's intranet as well as

through compulsory participation in an e-learning course on data protection. »67

67. After analyzing the GDPR intranet section, the data protection policy

data, internal rules and e-learning training, he noted that "the controlled

fails to provide, in particular, the following elements:

- the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended

personnel as well as the legal basis of the processing;

- the legitimate interests pursued by the controller;

- the length of the conversation. »68

In particular, he noted that the GDPR intranet section “did not contain any

mention of the specific processing of video surveillance”69, that the protection policy

of the data contained "a mention of video surveillance processing [...]" but that

“the purposes mentioned during the on-site visit (…) are not indicated in this

document”70 and that the internal regulations “contain a mention of video surveillance […],

but none of the other mentions provided for” in article 13 of the GDPR.

Thus, the head of the investigation again held that the control failed in its

"Obligation to inform data subjects arising from Article 13(1)

and 2 of the GDPR”71.

68. By letter dated October 29, 2021, the auditee responded to the communication from the

grievances to set out his opinion on Article 13 of the GDPR which, according to him, “does not impose any

specific form to controllers for the communication of information

to the people whose data is collected. (…)” and “does not require the

“one-shot” transmission of relevant information.”72. He has

also quoted the CNPD website on which it is mentioned that the CNPD

recommends to data controllers to meet their obligation to

transparency (and to avoid too long mentions at the level of a form) of

“give a first level of information at the end of the form and send it back to your [their]

privacy policy or a dedicated privacy page on your [their] website

which must include all of the above. »73

The inspector concluded "that the only vignette and the only pictogram of the Company

A did not include all of the information identified in Article 13 of the GDPR”

but this only because he had “carried out information in several stages

of these mentions, the vignette and the posters raised (…) being only the first”74. He

considered that “such a practice is in accordance with the law and the recommendations of the

supervisory authorities (EDPB, CNPD, etc.). He also cited WP 260 rev. 01 in

which the Article 29 Working Party mentioned that “a controller may

take a tiered approach, whereby it chooses to use multiple

methods to ensure transparency”75. He explained that he had precisely followed this

multi-level approach and that the vignette served, "in the first place, to warn all

the persons concerned on the principle that its buildings are potentially under

CCTV” and that details of other information were “easily accessible

on other cumulative media more suited to this information objective”76. On this

base, he contested the grievance of which he was accused by the head of investigation in his

statement of objections77 and it was of the opinion that “the absence of an element in a medium

does not constitute a fault, if this "missing" element is found in another medium

communicated to the persons concerned”.

Then, he explained why, according to him, the various media used by him

complied with its obligation to inform the persons concerned. In his opinion, the

thumbnail and pictogram on one side, and its website which contained and linked to its

data protection policy, towards [a “data regulation”]79 and, among others,

to a “page dedicated to the protection of personal data”80, on the other side,

together included "clear and detailed information relating to the treatment

data from the security cameras installed on and in its buildings" and this

“both vis-à-vis the employees (..) and vis-à-vis the third parties concerned”81.

Regarding his employees, he added that there were still other media

additional information, such as informing the staff delegation, the execution of

mandatory training for its employees concerning the protection of personal data

staff82, the GDPR intranet section specifically for its employees, the regulation

internal control that would apply to all members of its staff and

the continuous information of its staff, which was in charge of the DPO and/or the management of the

controlled83.

Regarding third parties, he added that he is of the opinion that the obligation

of information instituted by Article 13 of the GDPR would not be an absolute obligation and it

would in particular not be necessary “when the communication of information to the person

concerned proves impossible or would require disproportionate efforts" (see recital

62 GDPR). The controller was of the opinion that in this case the sticker and the billboard

were the only direct tool he had, because it would be "materially impossible,

if not extremely difficult (…) to prosecute each of the third parties passing within reach of its

security cameras to deliver to them in person a document containing all

the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR”84.

The controlled also mentioned that he had in the meantime



installed new, larger and more numerous billboards on and

in his buildings and he has attached a photo of these new panels

billboards85 (hereinafter: the “new billboards”);

 updated its data protection policy and published the said document on

its website86;

 updated an “internal personal data protection policy”

addressed to employees in terms of data protection and published the said

document on its intranet87; And

 sent an internal communication to all employees informing them of the

publication of new versions of the data protection policy and

the “internal personal data protection policy”.88

He also stressed that not all improvements made should

“be interpreted, even implicitly, as an acknowledgment of violations

allegedly identified” in the Statement of Objections89.

69. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. point 33).

70. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing, the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information with the most

strong impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address)90. THE

by video devices, version 2.0, adopted on January 29, 2020 (points 114. and 117.).

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties91.

2.1. Information from third parties

71. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were only informed of the presence of the security system.

video surveillance only by means of road signs containing pictograms

a camera and the words “Local/Locals under video surveillance” and the old

CNPD thumbnail. A panel and the old CNPD sticker were affixed to the

level of the entrance door located at […] and another panel was affixed at the level of a

passage not open to the public located between […] and […].92

72. She would first like to point out that since the old vignettes were

issued by the CNPD under the former authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002

on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

staff which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018, they have become obsolete and

since the entry into force of the GDPR, other rules in this area are applicable.

73. Next, it notes that the aforementioned panels, in place at the time of

investigation, did not contain the elements required by the first level of information, nor a

reference to the second level of information (see point 70 of this decision).

74. With regard to the first level of information, it lacked in particular the

details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller, the existence of

rights of the data subjects and the reference to the more detailed information of the

second level.

75. With regard to the second level of information (i.e. all of the

information required under Article 13 of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel finds

                                            
91 See WP260 rev. 01 (Item 38.)
92 See Minutes, page 3, finding 1; and Statement of Objections, page 5, point 12.

33/55

that the control sent to the CNPD agents on November 5, 2019, that is to say

say before sending the report to the controller, a series of documents which contained,

among other things, the data protection policy of the controlled which was accessible "in

line on the intranet site as well as on Company A’s website” (i.e., it was

accessible to third parties). In said data protection policy ([…])

there was a link for “customers and third parties” […] via [a “data regulation”] whose

controlled has not transmitted a copy and of which the Restricted Panel does not know the

content93.

76. While the said data protection policy did indeed contain certain

of the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR, it nevertheless did not specify the purposes

mentioned during the on-site visit (i.e. the protection of property, the securing of

access to private places and places at risk, the safety of users as well as the

prevention of accidents), nor the specific retention period in relation to the images

video surveillance. Chapter […] of the data protection policy contained

only a general list of all purposes for all data processing

carried out by the controlled and video surveillance is mentioned there as one of the purposes

and not as a processing of personal data in itself.

77. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee would like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

requires that, when the data controller collects personal data

personal contact with the person concerned, he “provides him, at the moment when the data in

question are obtained” the information listed therein. As mentioned above in point 69 of

this decision, the word “provide” is crucial because it “means that the person responsible for the

processing must take concrete steps to provide the information in question to

the data subject or to actively direct the data subject to

the location of said information (for example by means of a direct link, a code

QR, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. point 33).

Thus, "simply providing the information electronically and in writing, by

example in an online privacy statement or notice, may

not be suitable or not work on a device collecting the data at

personal character that does not have a screen (connected/smart devices) to

                                            
93 […].

display the website or this written information. In such a case, alternative means

additional and suitable should be considered, for example the provision of the

statement or notice on the protection of privacy in an instruction guide at the

paper format or the supply in paper format, in the instructions or on the packaging,

the URL address of the website (more precisely, the specific page of the website) where

is the privacy notice or statement. (WP 260, rev.01, point

19).

78. In the present case, the Restricted Panel considers, as the panels of

signage in place at the time of the on-site visit contained only a pictogram

a camera with the words “Local/Locals under video surveillance” and the old

thumbnail of the CNPD, that they therefore did not contain any reference to the website

of the controlled where the data protection policy of the controlled was located. By

therefore, a third party visiting the premises of the controlled could not have known where

find the relevant information. Furthermore, when the data of a person

third party are obtained by the controlled party, i.e. when the latter visits the premises of the

controlled and falls into the field of vision of one of the cameras, we cannot expect

that it has previously visited the website of the controlled to read the

information

relating to

data processing operated by

the system of

video surveillance.

79. The Restricted Committee takes note of the assertion of the control stipulating that the

panels and the old CNPD sticker were the only direct tool that it

had, because it would have been “materially impossible, if not extremely difficult

(…) to prosecute each of the third parties passing within range of its security cameras for their

hand deliver a document containing all the information required by

Article 13 of the GDPR”94.

80. However, it is not mandatory to hand-deliver to all persons

third parties a paper document containing all the information required by Article 13

of the GDPR. Indeed, and as also stated by the controller in his aforementioned letter

of October 29, 2021, a multi-layered approach to communicating information

information on transparency to data subjects can be used

                                            
94 See Letter from the audit dated October 29, 2021, page 18, point 4.4.2.

in the event of the collection of personal data by means of a system of

video surveillance (see point 70 of this decision on information at two levels).

However, the first level information (such as, for example, the panels of

signs at the entrance to a building) should therefore contain a reference

to more detailed information of the second level (for example, a link via a website

or a QR code).

81. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation95 and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the article

13 GDPR was not complied with by the video surveillance check for this

concerning third parties.

82. As for the measures taken by the controller after the on-site visit by the

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 93 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

2.2. Employee information

83. With regard to

informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the Restricted Panel notes that at the time of the on-site visit by the

CNPD officers, they were informed of the video surveillance by the same panels

signs and the old CNPD sticker that third parties (see points

71 to 74 of this decision). She also notes that the auditee stated that the

employees were informed of the data protection policy via the distribution of

related documents via its intranet as well as by compulsory participation in an e-

learning on data protection (minutes, finding 7).

84. In addition, it notes that the controller sent CNPD officials on

November 5, 2019, that is to say before the report was sent to the controller, a series of

documents which contained, among other things, the GDPR intranet section, the protection policy

data, internal regulations and e-learning training.

85. Regarding the data protection policy, she would like to refer to point

76 of this decision. With regard to the GDPR intranet section, she notes that she

                                            
95 See Statement of Objections, pages 6 to 7, points 16 and 22.

36/55

indeed contained most of the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR, but did not

contained no mention of the specific CCTV processing. However, the

GDPR intranet section referred to the data protection policy in which

there was a mention of CCTV processing in pages […]. The rule

interior also contained a mention of CCTV on page […], but

none of the other mentions provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR. Regarding the

e-learning training, Restricted Training notes that it was a general training

concerning the GDPR, the objective of which was to train and raise awareness among employees in the

field of personal data protection. It was not information

individual employees with respect to video surveillance processing. It is the same

for the other aforementioned documents, because these documents can be qualified as a

collective information, but not as individual employee information.

Furthermore, it considers that, even if the auditee had chosen a two-pronged approach

levels to communicate the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR to its

employees, all of their information must nevertheless “be accessible in a place

unique or in the same document (in paper or electronic format) that can be

easily consulted by this person if he wishes to consult all of the

information addressed to it” (WP260 rev. 01, point 17). In this case, the

information is scattered in different documents available in various places,

which makes it difficult for employees to become familiar with this information.

86. She also notes that the controller mentioned in his letter of October 29

2021 that the staff delegation had been in possession of all the information

necessary regarding CCTV processing. Attached to said letter, he

sent the agreement of […] concerning said processing96. In the aforementioned letter, the controller

also mentioned that, during e-learning training for its employees, "the

issue of surveillance cameras was addressed by employees of Company A and

relevant information was provided to them”97.

However, the Restricted Panel has no proof of such information from

employees, on the one hand, and it would like to point out that simply informing the […] does not ensure

                                            
96 See Letter from the audit dated October 29, 2021, exhibit no. 17.

that the control employees had been informed individually about the elements

of article 13 of the GDPR.

87. In view of the foregoing, she thus agrees with the opinion of the head of investigation98 and concludes,

that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 13 of the GDPR was not

complied with by the control in terms of video surveillance as far as employees are concerned.

88. As for the measures taken by the control after the on-site visit of the agents of

the CNPD, Restricted Training refers to point 93 as well as to Chapter II.2. Section

2.2. of this decision for the related explanations.

 

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

1. Principles

 

89. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

 

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

(d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

                                            
98 See Statement of Objections, pages 6 to 7, points 16 and 22.

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

90. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

 

91. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

92. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

93. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

 

94. In his Statement of Objections of 24 August 2021 (point 36), the Head of Investigation

proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose an administrative fine on the control of a

amount of 10,500 euros.

 

95. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Panel notes that with regard to the breach of Article 5.1.c)

of the GDPR, it constitutes a breach of the fundamental principles of the

GDPR (and data protection law in general), namely the principle

minimization of data dedicated to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

41/55

 

 

 

 

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent on them, even if an obligation to respect the principle

data minimization, as well as a comparable information obligation

already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1. b), 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2

August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of

personal data. Guidance on principles and obligations

provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular through

prior authorizations for video surveillance and guidance

available on the CNPD website.

 

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training notes that for video surveillance, it is all the

employees working on the controlled site, as well as all third parties,

i.e. customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors

visiting said site.

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

42/55

 

 

 

 

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

 

 As for the measures taken by the auditee to mitigate the damage suffered by the

data subjects (article 83.2.c) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes

account of the measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

 

96. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

97. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

23 October 2019 (see also point 92 of this decision).

98. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR.

99. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

articles 5 and 13 of the RGPD is reproached to the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

100. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above,

the Restricted Panel considers that the pronouncement of a fine of ten thousand (10,000)

euros appears to be both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of

GDPR Article 83.1.

2.2. About taking corrective action

 

101. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

inquiry to the Restricted Panel in its statement of objections (point 33.):

 

a) “Order the controlled party to complete the information measures intended for

people affected by

video surveillance, in accordance with

provisions of Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR by filling in

notably :

 

 

- the identity and contact details of the controller;

- the contact details of the data protection officer;

- the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended

personnel as well as the legal basis of the processing;

- the categories of personal data concerned;

- the legitimate interests pursued by the controller;

- the recipients or categories of recipients of the data to be

personal character;

- the length of the conversation ;

- the existence of the right to request from the data controller access to the

personal data, rectification or erasure thereof,

or restriction of processing relating to the data subject; And

- the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

b) Order the controlled to process only relevant, adequate data

and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting the

goods and securing access and, in particular, adapting the security system

video surveillance so as not to film public roads and buildings and

surrounding land, as well as employees at their workstations. Such a

44/55

adaptation can take place, for example, by removing and/or redirecting

the disputed cameras, and/or by adapting the field of vision of these cameras

by means of blurring or darkening. »

102. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 93 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in

his email of November 5, 2019 and in his letters of December 13, 2019 and 29

October 2021. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

1. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned in point

101 of this decision under b), concerning the obligation to deal only with

relevant, adequate and limited data to what is necessary with regard to

the purposes of protecting property, securing access to places

at risk and the safety of users, in accordance with the provisions of

article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, the controller confirmed in his email of November 5

2019 and in his letters of December 13, 2019 and October 29, 2021

- with regard to cameras n° [1], [2] and [6] allowing surveillance in

permanence of employees in their place of work:

 that he did not make any changes to the fields of vision of the three

disputed cameras because he considers the fields of vision of said

justified cameras (see points 30 and 33 of this decision for more

details).

The Restricted Panel considers that the arguments of the audited (see point 30

and 33 of this decision) in relation to cameras Nos. [1], [2] and [6] are

understandable since

surveillance was aimed at

premises in a

banking establishment, in this case the vaults (camera n° [1] and [2])

and the central controlled desk (camera no. [6]), which are places

particularly sensitive where there is a risk of theft or vandalism.

As elaborated in point 36 (2nd and 3rd paragraph) of this decision,

it is nevertheless of the opinion that the field of vision of camera n° [1] is

disproportionate because it must not relate to the workstation of an employee

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

45/55

 

 

 

in particular who is obliged to spend at least several hours in a row there by

day, and if such can absolutely not be avoided, the face of the employee in question

must not be visible (for example by the use of computer techniques

blurring/masking). As regards cameras n° [2] and [6], it

notes that the workstations in question are not occupied in

permanently but are only used occasionally by the employees of the

controlled for sensitive tasks. Therefore, she is of the opinion that no

corrective action is required with respect to cameras #[2] and [6].

In view of the absence of compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case (with regard to cameras Nos. [1], [2] and [6]) and point 93 of the

this decision, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that there is reason to

pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and

taken up in point 101 of this decision under b), but only by

compared to the field of view of camera n° [1].

- with regard to cameras n° [3], [4], [5], the reception camera, [7], [8], [9],

[10], [11] and [12], allowing permanent monitoring of employees on their

place of work or during their break time:

 that it brought a masking system to the field of vision of all

aforementioned cameras and that he confirmed his commitment to disconnect the

camera no. [11] in the event of activation of the backup plan.

Considering the sufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case (with regard to cameras n° [3], [4], [5], the reception camera,

[7], [8], [9], [10], [11] and [12]) and point 93 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte therefore considers that there is no need to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and repeated in point 101 of

this Decision under b).

 

- with regard to cameras n° [13], [14] and [15] allowing the monitoring of

public roads or buildings not belonging to the controlled:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

46/55

 

 

 

 that it masked the field of view of cameras n° [15] and [14]

and he attached photos showing the fields of view of said cameras

after this adjustment; And

 

 that he ordered a new camera to replace the “dome” camera

No. [13] because, according to the inspected, it did not allow masking of

certain areas. In his letter of October 29, 2021, he confirmed that the

dome camera no.

[13] was

replaced99. However, none

documentation submitted by the auditee does not contain evidence that

said camera was finally replaced by a new camera and that a

proper masking has been installed.

 

Furthermore, the corrective measures taken by the audited in relation to

the camera [14] correspond to the EDPB instructions on this subject in its

EDPB guidelines 3/2019 because the controlled has blurred the areas not

relevant to said camera.

 

With regard to camera n° [15], the Restricted Panel considers that

the field of view of said camera was not disproportionate to

the purposes pursued by the control (see point 53 of this decision

for related explanations).

In view of the incomplete compliance measures taken by

the controlled in this case (with regard to cameras n° [13], [14] and [15]) and the point

93 of this decision, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that there

takes place to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation to

this regard and taken up in point 101 of this decision under b), but

only in relation to the field of view of the “dome” camera n° [13].

2. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned in point

101 of this decision under a), concerning the introduction of measures

information for people

third parties on

the system of

video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, the

Restricted Training finds that the controlled explained that he was proceeding "to a

information in several stages (…), the thumbnail and the posters raised (…) do not

being that the first '100. In this context, the controlled explained that he installed

new billboards “larger and more numerous on and in

his buildings” 101 and he attached a photo of the new billboards

(Exhibit No. 12 of the audit letter of October 29, 2021). He also explained

that the more detailed information of the second level of information, would be

easily accessible on its website which contained and linked to

-

its data protection policy via the link […] and that it had updated this

data protection policy (Exhibit 21 of his letter of October 29

2021),

-

[a “data settlement”] via the link […], and

- a “page dedicated to the protection of personal data” via the link […].

Regarding the first level of information, the Restricted Training

notes that the new billboards do not contain all the

information required according to the first level of information (see point 70 of the

this decision), because the auditee mentioned only "the exercise of the right

of access to images” and not the existence of other rights of persons

concerned. As to the reference to the more detailed information of the second

level, it finds that the person inspected has mentioned a link […] to the

"legal information" from the controlled's website, and he also added a code

QR on new billboards that leads to the same site page

web. This "legal information" covers a large number of subjects (between

other, information about financial instruments and other products

of the controlled, the intellectual property and the applicable law) and mention […] the

“protection of personal data”. This chapter contains, among

others, a hypertext link to the new version of the privacy policy

data in pdf format, without mentioning the processing of

specifically CCTV.

Consequently, the Restricted Committee finds that the reference to the second

level of information is not sufficiently clear and it does not refer

directly to the source of the second level of information. However, in his

letter of December 13, 2019, in response to the minutes, the controller reported

that he had “initiated the replacement and upgrading of the pictograms

warning

the employees and

THE

third of

the presence of a system of

video surveillance” and he announced that he will indicate in the future “in particular the name

of the person responsible for the device, the legal basis, the retention period of the images

and how to complain" to the Data Protection Officer

and with the CNPD on the new panels. In this case, the Formation

Restricted finds that it has not added the retention period of the images (nor

at the first level of information on the new billboards, nor at the

second level of information) and that it decided to mention the methods of

complaint to the CNPD only at the second level of information,

which is sufficient.

With regard to the second level of information, she notes that the

aforementioned data protection policy was updated in […] 2021. By

However, said document still does not contain a specific section regarding

the specific purposes in relation to the video surveillance system, nor the duration

only in chapter […] among the categories of data processed.

The same applies to [the “data regulation”] […] on the website of the controlled

which contains no specific mention of CCTV.

Regarding the “page dedicated to the protection of personal data”

[…], she notes that it is only by going through the text [of the “regulation

data”] that a third party could find this other hypertext link which

leads to the said “page dedicated to the protection of personal data”. THE

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

49/55

 

 

 

CCTV processing is mentioned there only in a list of

several purposes that the controller has listed to justify the processing of

data it performs and therefore this document also does not contain

information about the CCTV system.

Consequently, the Restricted Panel holds that in this case there is no

“a single place or (…) the same document (in paper or

electronic)”102 where all of the information required by Article 13 of the

GDPR regarding the CCTV system can be easily

viewed by third parties.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 93 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 101 (a) of this

decision regarding the information of third parties about the system

video surveillance.

3. As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned in point

101 of this decision under a), concerning the introduction of measures

information intended more specifically for employees on the system of

video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, the

Formation Restreinte wishes first of all to refer to the explanations above by

compared to the first and second level information given to the

third parties (point 102 sub-heading 2). She adds that the controlled has

indicated in his letter of October 20, 2021 that he

- updated its “internal policy addressed to employees with regard to the protection

data” and that he had published it on his intranet site (Exhibit 22 of the letter

of the audit of October 29, 2021), and

                                            
102 See WP260 rev. 01, item 17.

_____________________________________________________________

50/55

- carried out an “internal communication (…) informing all employees of the

publication of new versions of its privacy policies

data”103 (Exhibit No. 23 of the audit letter of October 29, 2021).

Even if the Restricted Formation recognizes the efforts undertaken concerning

the individual information of its employees, it must nevertheless note that the

controlled employees have not received more specific information with respect to the

CCTV system than third parties. The "internal policy"

addressed to employees with regard to data protection" contains, as

already the data protection policy, some of the statements provided for in

Article 13 of the GDPR, but also contains no mention of the processing

specific to CCTV.

Consequently, the Restricted Panel holds that in this case there is not "a

single place or (…) the same document (in paper or electronic format)”104

where all of the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

concerns the video surveillance system can be easily consulted by the

employees of the controlled.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 93 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 101 (a) of this

decision with regard to the information of the employees of the control as to the

CCTV system.

 

II. 3. On access to the entire administrative file

103. On September 9, 2021, the controller, represented by […], asked the chief

investigation the transmission of the entire administrative file referred to in Article 11

of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 8 June 1979 relating to the procedure to be followed by

                                            
103 See Letter from the audit dated October 26, 2021, page 25, footnote no. 36.
104 See WP260 rev. 01, item 17.

state and municipal administrations. On September 22, 2021, the chief

of investigation responded to this request and transmitted the entire administrative file

(in CD-ROM form) to the controller on October 1, 2021. At the request of the controller,

the head of investigation then extended the deadline to produce written observations on the

statement of objections until 3 November 2021.

104. By letter dated October 29, 2021, the auditee produced written observations

on the statement of objections and he, among other things, raised in the "remarks

preliminary and retroacts” of the said letter that he was of the opinion that the administrative file

transmitted by the CNPD “did not seem complete”105. He noted the following:

- the absence of a document justifying the change of the head of investigation for the case in

species between Mr. Buschmann and Mr. Lemmer;

- the finding that the head of investigation was not in possession of the communications

exchanged after his statement of objections and the fear that the latter could not have

“finalize its grievances and its proposed sanction (…) based on communications

after that date”;

- criticism of the division of files transmitted to the control by the CNPD

on the CD-ROM between “official” files and “parts”; And

- the question in relation to the basis of the CNPD's intervention.

105. By letter dated December 8, 2021, the head of investigation responded to these

"Preliminary and retroactive remarks" of the controlled in his letter of October 29

2021 and he took a stand on all the criticisms raised by the controlled. Furthermore, he has

sent to the person inspected a copy of the extract from the report no. […] formalizing the resumption of

the function of head of investigation by Mr. Lemmer following the departure of Mr.

Buschman.

106. The Restricted Committee wishes first of all to emphasize that communication

of grievances contains only the assessments and proposals made by the head

of investigation on the basis of the facts observed and that the Restricted Panel makes its decisions

                                            
105 See Letter from the audit dated October 29, 2021, page 3, point 1.3.

independently and that it is under no circumstances obliged to follow the assessments and

proposals made by the head of investigation. Then, she notices that the CD-ROM that the

head of investigation transmitted to the control contained, with the exception of the extract from the report

no. […] formalizing the takeover of the function of head of investigation by Mr. Lemmer continued

at the departure of Mr. Buschmann, the same documents as the Restricted Training

itself received from the head of investigation for the purpose of making this decision. In what

concerning the said extract from minutes No […], it notes that it is a document which

only retains a change of personnel within the CNPD, which cannot

no circumstances influence his decision-making. For the other points raised in the letter

of October 29, 2021, the Restricted Training refers to the letter of December 8, 2021

of the head of investigation in which there are answers to all questions and criticisms

raised by the controller in relation to his administrative file. Restricted Training

would also like to note that after a question was asked during the training session

Restriction of February 24, 2022, as to whether the auditee was still of the opinion that he had not

received the entire administrative file, the controller replied that the completeness of the

administrative file is not the most important point at this pre-litigation stage.

In view of the foregoing, she concurs with the opinion of the head of investigation that the

controlled has received the entire administrative file.

 

 

 

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

- to retain the breaches of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR;

- to impose an administrative fine on Company A in the amount

of ten thousand (10,000) euros, with regard to breaches of articles

5.1.c) and 13 GDPR;

_____________________________________________________________

- issue against Company A an injunction to bring it into compliance

processing with the provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, within a period of

3 months following the notification of the decision of the Restricted Panel, and, in

particular,

 change the field of vision of camera n° [1] so that the face of the employee

in question is no longer visible (e.g. through the use of techniques

blurring/masking software) or, if this is not possible, install

real-time blurring of the employee occupying the workstation in

question ; And



replace the “dome” camera [13] with a device that allows you to

hide the roads belonging to the public domain as well as the buildings

not belonging to the controlled.

 

- to order Company A to maintain the modifications made during the

investigation procedure to the fields of view of cameras n° [3], [4], [5], camera

reception, [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and [14];

 

- issue against Company A an injunction to bring it into compliance

processing with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, within 3

months following the notification of the decision of the Restricted Panel, and, in

particular,

 



inform non-employee third parties and employees of the control of

clearly and completely on the video surveillance system, either by

adding a specific chapter on CCTV processing in

its data protection policy, either by creating a notice

specific information for the processing of video surveillance which contains

 adapt the new billboards on and in the buildings of the

controlled by modifying the reference to the second level of information (i.e. the

link to the website of the controlled and the QR code) and replacing it with a

new reference to the second level of information which leads directly

to a modified data protection policy (in particular by

report to a new chapter on the video surveillance system) and/or

towards a new information notice specifically concerning the

CCTV processing; And



individually inform employees in a clear and complete manner on the

video surveillance of the controlled site, emphasizing in particular, in its

communication, modification of the data protection policy

(particularly in relation to a new chapter on the system of

video surveillance) and/or the creation of a new information notice

specifically relating to CCTV processing.
