6/27

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.7 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

17. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.8

 

2. In this case

 

18. With regard to informing third parties about the system of

video surveillance, the head of the investigation found that neither the pictogram with the mention

“24-hour video surveillance” affixed to the main entrance door of the building

administrative (see statement of objections, A.1.), nor the new information poster

submitted to the CNPD by letter dated June 11, 20199 did not contain the elements required by

GDPR Article 13. He clarified that although the new information poster was more

complete and made it possible to document the controlee's desire to comply with the prescribed

of the GDPR, it also did not meet all the conditions set out in Article 13 of the GDPR.

GDPR and that the non-compliance with article 13 of the GDPR was established on the day of the visit to

site (see statement of objections, page 2, B.1. and page 3 Ad.A.1.).

19. With regard to informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the head of the investigation found that neither the pictogram with the mention

“24-hour video surveillance” affixed to the main entrance door of the building

administrative10 (see statement of objections, A.2.), nor the minutes of the meeting of the

Joint Control Committee of 13 December 201811, submitted to the CNPD by letter of 11

June 2019, did not show that the employees had received the information

required within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR (see statement of objections, page 2, B.1. and

page 3 Ad.A.2.). The head of investigation clarified that the non-compliance with article 13 of the GDPR

as far as employees are concerned was therefore acquired.

20. By email of October 10, 2019, the controller sent the head of investigation a

copy of a new data protection notice

relating to the video surveillance intended for the personnel of the control and the

third parties12. The controller mentioned that said information notice would be

available on the controller's website. In this email, the control also sent

to the head of investigation a photo of a new information poster13 which would have been placed

outside the building on the main entrance door and inside the building on a

information/communication board in the lobby and at reception. Furthermore, the

controlled sent several photos14 to show the new information poster

mentioned above in several places inside and outside its building.

21. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01, point 33).

2.1. Information from third parties:

22. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by a pictogram with the words "video surveillance 24 hours a day"

affixed to the main entrance door of the administrative building. By letter of June 11

2019, the controller sent a new poster with “permanent information”15

comprising

email from the control of October 10, 2019).

- information concerning the purposes of the video surveillance,

- an e-mail address for questions regarding the use of security cameras

video surveillance and in relation to the rights of the persons concerned,

- a link to the "privacy policy" on the website of the controlled, which would have

was posted on all of its billboards.

23. Finally, by email of October 10, 2019, the auditee sent a second

new information poster16 which would have been placed in several places inside and outside

outside the controlled building, including

- information concerning the purposes of the video surveillance,

- a new e-mail address for questions regarding the use of the

CCTV cameras and the rights of data subjects, and

- a new link to a new "data protection policy

relating to video surveillance”17 available on its website.

24. The Restricted Committee considers that a layered approach to

Communicating transparency information to data subjects can be

used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in an environment

real, such as personal data collected by means of a

CCTV system. The first level of information should

general include the most essential information, namely details of the purpose of the

processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of persons

concerned, as well as the information having the greatest impact on the processing or

any processing likely to surprise data subjects.18 The second

level of information, i.e. all of the information required under Article

13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means, such as by

for example, a link on the website to an information notice with regard to the

non-salaried third parties.19

25. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that neither the pictogram with the

mention "24-hour video surveillance" at the time of the site visit, nor the new

poster with "permanent information" sent by mail dated June 11, 2019, nor the

second new information poster sent by email from October 10, 2019 only

contained the required elements of the first level of information for people

non-employee third parties. The Restricted Committee also notes that the new "policy of

protection of personal data relating to video surveillance”20, to which refers

the link in the second new information poster, did not contain the full

elements required by articles 13.1 and 13.2 of the GDPR.

26. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

controlled with respect to third parties.

2.2. Employee information:

27. As far as the employees are concerned, the Restricted Committee notes that during the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, the latter were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance system with a pictogram bearing the words "video surveillance

24h/24h” affixed to the main entrance door of the administrative building.

28. By letter dated June 11, 2019, the controller sent the minutes of the meeting

of the Joint Control Committee of December 13, 201821 in which the installation of new

CCTV equipment and the number of cameras have been announced. In the

same letter, the auditee claimed to have posted the said report for more than three

months on a panel provided for this purpose inside its building. The controlled has

also claimed that a pictogram was affixed to several places on its site and it

sent out a new poster with “permanent information”22 featuring

- information concerning the purposes of the video surveillance,

- an e-mail address for questions regarding the use of security cameras

video surveillance and in relation to the rights of the persons concerned,

- a link to the "privacy policy" on the website of the controlled, which would have

was posted on all of its billboards.

In addition, the auditee clarified that he had decided to include a paragraph on the

video surveillance in its new collective agreement, which was, at that date, in phase

of renegotiation23.

29. In its response to the statement of objections, the auditee sent a

second new information poster24 which would have been placed in several places in

inside and outside the controlled building, including

- information concerning the purposes of the video surveillance,

- a new e-mail address for questions regarding the use of the

CCTV cameras and the rights of data subjects, and

- a new link to a new "data protection policy

relating to video surveillance”25 available on its website.

30. The Restricted Committee considers first of all that the mere information of the

joint committee does not ensure that the control employees have been informed individually

regarding the specific elements of Article 13 of the GDPR. The Restricted Formation holds

also to point out that even if the auditee decides to include a new paragraph

on video surveillance in its future collective agreement, this does not guarantee that

each employee, current or future, will be informed individually.

31. The Restricted Committee considers that a layered approach to

Communicating transparency information to data subjects can be

used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in an environment

real, such as personal data collected by means of a

CCTV system. The first level of information should

general include the most essential information, namely details of the purpose of the

processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of persons

concerned, as well as the information having the greatest impact on the processing or

any processing likely to surprise data subjects.26 The second

level of information, i.e. all of the information required under Article

13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means, such as by

example a copy of the privacy policy emailed to employees.27

32. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that neither the pictogram with the

mention "24-hour video surveillance" at the time of the site visit, nor the new

poster with "permanent information" sent by mail dated June 11, 2019, nor the

second new information poster sent by email from October 10, 2019 only

contained the required elements of the first level of information whether for the

employees or non-employee third parties. The Restricted Committee also notes that the

new "personal data protection policy"

relative to

the

CCTV »28, to which the link refers in the second new poster

information, did not contain all the elements required by article 13.1 and 2 of the

GDPR.

33. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

controlled with regard to the employees of the controlled.

B. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

34. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

35. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.29

36. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

37. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal information collected for other purposes.30

38. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.31

2. In this case

39. It was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes of setting up the

CCTV system are the protection of company assets, securing

access, the reduction of risks (“place at risk”) as well as the safety of users

and accident prevention. In his letter of June 11, 2019, the controller mentioned

additional purposes and more specifically the detection and identification of

potentially suspicious or dangerous behavior that could cause

accidents or incidents, the search for the origin of an incident and the timely alerting of

emergency, fire or law enforcement services as well as the facilitation of their

intervention.

40. During the on-site investigation, CNPD officers found that

-

the field of view of the camera called "[...]" (hereinafter: "camera 1")

allows the surveillance of part of the public road (communication of

grievances, A.3.);

-

the field of vision of the cameras called "[...]" (hereinafter: "camera 2")

and camera 1 allow the surveillance of a neighboring land (communication

grievances, A.4.); and

-

the field of vision of the camera called "[...]" (hereinafter: "camera 3")

makes it possible to monitor the control employees preparing to clock in the hours of

their entries and exits (statement of objections, A.5.).

41. With regard to cameras 1 and 2, the head of investigation was of the opinion that “[...]

surveillance of the public road and neighboring land should however be considered

as disproportionate. Indeed, in view of the aforementioned purposes for which is operated

video surveillance, it is not necessary to encompass parts of the public road or

of neighboring land in the fields of view of the cameras listed under point

A. hereof. (statement of objections, Ad.A3. and A.4.)

42. The controlled on his side explained in his response email to the

statement of objections of 10 October 2019 that the fields of view of cameras 1 and

2 have been adjusted to no longer monitor parts of public areas and land

neighbours. However, as the auditee did not present any mitigating elements for this

subject in its response of June 11, 2019 to the minutes drawn up by CNPD officials,

the head of investigation concluded that the non-compliance with article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established

on the day of the visit.

43. With regard to camera 3, the chief investigator was of the opinion that “The

permanent monitoring of the employees' clocking machine, as described under the

point A.5. above, is also to be considered disproportionate, in view of the

purposes indicated by the company. Indeed, surveillance by video cameras of access to the

building has, according to the explanations given during the site visit, the purpose of

securing said access. The purpose of installing a time clock is to manage and

control the working hours and the time of presence of employees at the workplace.

Including the time clock in the field of view of the access cameras results in a

additional supervision which is not necessary. Such treatment is therefore

consider as excessive and disproportionate in relation to the purposes invoked by the

society. (statement of objections, Ad. A.5.)

44. The controlled on his side explained in his response email to the

Statement of Objections dated October 10, 2019 that Camera 3 has been withdrawn. Nevertheless,

as the auditee did not present any mitigating elements on this subject in its response

of June 11, 2019 to the minutes drawn up by the CNPD agents, the head of the investigation

concluded that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established on the day of the visit.

45. As for cameras 1 and 2, the Restricted Panel finds that the controlled has

sent two videos showing the adjustment of the fields of view of the cameras in question

attached to its email of October 10, 2019. In addition, the Restricted Panel notes that

the cameras in question monitor neighboring land composed solely of

wooded area as well as a small part of the public road33.

46. Nevertheless, the Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended

to monitor a place where the surroundings of a building or site must have a field of

vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view people getting ready

to access it. Cameras installed near or around a building must be

configured so as not to capture the public road, nor the surroundings, entrances, access and

interiors of other neighboring buildings possibly falling within their scope of

                                                           
33 See the elements taken into account by the head of investigation in his additional letter to the communication
of grievances of August 17, 2020, page 2.

vision. Depending on the configuration of the premises, it is sometimes impossible to install a

camera that does not include part of the public road in its field of vision,

surroundings, entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In such a case, the CNPD considers

that the data controller must put in place techniques for masking or

blurring to limit the field of view to its property.34

47. As for camera 3, the Restricted Panel notes that the field of view of the

camera 3 did not initially monitor the time clock of the controlled but an entrance airlock

of the administrative building. It would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor a

access point (e.g. entrance and exit) must have a field of vision limited to the surface

strictly necessary to visualize the people about to access it. If the purpose

was not to monitor people about to use the clock,

the fact remains that it is in the field of vision of this camera.

48. In addition, the Panel finds that the controller attached to his email of 10

October 2019 photos of where camera 3 was installed before (i.e. above

above the pointing machine of the controlled employees) showing that the camera in

question has been removed.

49. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the finding of Chief

of investigation according to which the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents concerning the three cameras.

 

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

1. Principles

50. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

 

                                                           
34 See CNPD Guidelines (Point 4.), available at: https://cnpd.public.lu/fr/dossiers-
topics/video surveillance/necessity-proportionality.html

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

16/27

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

17/27

 

 

 

51. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

52. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

 

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

 

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

18/27

 

 

 

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

53. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

54. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

 

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

 

55. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 17 August

2020, the head of investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative control for an amount of 3,500 euros.

56. In its response to said additional letter of August 18, 2020, the audited

referred to his email of October 10, 2019 in which he had taken a position with regard to

all the shortcomings mentioned in the statement of objections, inter alia, in

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

19/27

sending photos and new documents attached to said email showing the

actions taken by the controller.

57. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation notes that with regard to breaches of Article

5.1.c) of the GDPR, they constitute breaches of a fundamental principle

of the GDPR (and data protection law in general), namely the principle

minimization of data dedicated to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent on them. Moreover, an obligation to respect the

principle of minimization, as well as a comparable information obligation

already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1. b), 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2

August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of

personal data. Guidance on principles and obligations

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular through

mandatory prior authorization for video surveillance.

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training finds that these are all employees working on the site

of the controlled, as well as all third parties, i.e. customers,

suppliers, service providers and visitors to this site.

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

 As for the measures taken by the auditee to mitigate the damage suffered by the

persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

measures taken by the auditee and refers to chapter II.2. section 2.2. of this

decision for the related explanations.

 

58. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

59. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

21/27

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

27 February 2019 (see also point 53. of this decision).

60. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR.

61. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

articles 5 and 13 of the RGPD is reproached to the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

62. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of 3,500 euros appears

both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83.1

of the GDPR.

 

2.2. About taking corrective action

 

63. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

of investigation to

the Restricted Training in its additional letter to

the

statement of objections:

 

“a) Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for persons concerned by video surveillance in accordance with the

provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by providing

in particular the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and its

legal basis, the categories of data processed, the legitimate interests pursued

by the controller, the recipients, the retention period of the data as well as

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

22/27

the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of exercising them (concerning the

employees, it should be noted that the information must be provided both for new

employees than for employees who have been with the company for some time);

 

b) Order the controller to only process data

relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of

protection of property and securing access and, in particular, adapting the

video system so as not to film employees when they pass through the

the pointer, for example by deleting or reorienting the cameras. »

 

64. In its response to the said supplementary letter to the Statement of Objections

of August 18, 2020, the controller referred to his email of October 10, 2019 in which he

claimed to have already sent all the evidence requested to show its implementation

compliance.

65. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation, the Panel

Restreinte takes into account the steps taken by the auditee, following the visit to the

CNPD officials, in order to comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the

GDPR, as detailed in his letter of June 11, 2019 and his emails of October 10

2019 and August 18, 2020. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

 As for the implementation of information measures intended for third parties

and to employees by video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of Article

13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller has drawn up and displayed on its premises and outside

from its premises a new information poster35 featuring

- information concerning the purposes of the video surveillance,

- a new e-mail address for questions regarding

the use of video surveillance cameras and in relation to the rights

of the persons concerned, and

- a link to a “personal data protection policy”

relating to video surveillance” available on its website.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

23/27

The Restricted Panel considers that said information poster does not contain

all the information required by article 13 of the GDPR. Thus, the identity and the

contact details of the controller, which are to be considered as a

first level information is not shown on the poster. Furthermore, the

Restricted Formation notes that the note "data protection policy

relating to video surveillance" (to which the link refers in the

new information poster), also does not contain all the information

required by Article 13 of the GDPR. Thus, the identity and contact details of the

controller (i.e. first level information) and the explanation of the

rights of data subjects, more specifically the right of access, the right to

rectification or erasure, the right to restriction of processing, the right

to object and the right to the portability of personal data (i.e.

second level information), are not indicated in this note. As to

to the rights of data subjects, they are mentioned in general

in this note and it is stated that

-

-

employees could find more information on the “[…]” page

or on the “Intranet page of […]”36, and

third parties could find more information in the “

[…]” available at: […].

The Restricted Panel considers that all of the information from the second

level must be "available in a single place or in the same document

(in digital form on a website or in paper format)”37, which must be

easily accessible should data subjects wish to

view all the information. In this case, the information is

scattered in different documents available in various places, which

makes it difficult to become familiar with this information, both for employees

only for third parties.

With regard more specifically to controlled employees, Training

Restreinte considers that the controlled employees must be informed

individually regarding the specific elements of Article 13 of the GDPR and that the

                                                           
36 The Restricted Panel was unable to verify these two sources of information.
37 See WP 260 rev. 01 (item 33).

new poster together with the note "data protection policy

personal information relating to video surveillance” are not sufficient in this context.

Individual employee information may be provided or made available by

other means, such as a copy of the note “policy of

protection of personal data relating to video surveillance” sent by

e-mail to employees of the control.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the

corrective action proposed by the head of investigation under a) both with regard to

concerns third parties as well as the employees of the audited and to add in this

with regard to employees, an obligation to provide individual information.

 As for the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting property and

access security, the controller attached to his email of October 10, 2020

videos showing the adjustment of the fields of view of cameras 1 and 2 and

photos of where camera 3 was installed before (i.e. above the

clocking machine of the controlled employees) showing that camera 3 was

uninstalled. In view of the compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 48. of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed

by the head of investigation under b).

- to pronounce against the company “Company A” an injunction to enforce

compliance of the processing with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, within a period of

two months following the notification of the decision of the Restricted Panel, in particular:

i. inform third parties and employees in a clear and complete manner

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, in particular by providing

information relating to the identity and contact details of the controller

(i.e. first level information), both on the poster installed inside and outside

outside the control building as in the note “policy for the protection of

personal data relating to video surveillance" and to complete the latter

by specifying the rights of the persons concerned (i.e. information of the second

level) so that all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR can be found
