transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

17. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.12

2. In this case

18. With regard to the information of third parties, CNPD agents

noted during the on-site visit that the presence of the video surveillance system

"is not reported to the third parties concerned (customers, suppliers and

service providers, visitors)”13.

19. In the Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, the Head of Investigation

noted that in view of the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR, the information of "persons

concerned (employees and third parties)" was incomplete14, and that the non-compliance

in article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit. In particular, he retained

that no evidence as to the information of third parties was presented and that the

documentation attached to the letter from the audit dated February 11, 2019 did not contain any

evidence against this non-conformity. Therefore, the lead investigator was

of the opinion that the controller has breached its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR to

towards third parties in relation to video surveillance.16

20. The controller indicated in his letter of February 28, 2020 that a “series of

signs and pictograms informing employees, deliverers and visitors of the existence of a

video surveillance will be installed on our sites concerned as soon as possible" and that

“visitors/deliverers are informed of this by means of an information sheet, available from our

reception-reception […]”. He attached to his letter copies of the information letter

intended for third parties in French and German. By mail from

December 7, 2020 he informed that he “installed traffic signs-

on-site video surveillance.

21. With regard to informing employees, CNPD officials have during

the site visit noted that the presence of the video surveillance system “is not

reported to company employees.

22. In the Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, the Head of Investigation

noted that in view of the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR, the information of "persons

concerned (employees and third parties)" was incomplete18 and that the non-compliance with

article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the site visit. In particular, he held that

the observation of the control that the employees would have been informed of the presence of the system

video surveillance orally, without presentation of supporting evidence, was not

nature to irritate the last observation19. Therefore, the lead investigator was of the opinion that the

controlled has breached its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to the

employees in relation to video surveillance.20

23. The controller indicated in his letter of February 11, 2019 that "employees

were not officially informed about the CCTV system, only by

oral route” and only after the compliance process in which the control is carried out

would be engaged “all employees will be informed of the exact location of the security cameras

video surveillance in an internal regulation”. Furthermore, in his letter of

February 28, 2020 he mentioned his intention to inform employees by means of signs

information and pictograms displayed on site, as well as by an information letter

which would initially be appended to their next payslips, and by the

suite published on the "intranet" site of the controlled. Copies of the information letter intended

to employees in French and German are attached to his letter. By mail

of December 7, 2020, he informed that he “installed road signs-

video surveillance on site”, and that he “started to introduce all the elements

missing concerning the topics of video surveillance and […] in our regulations

internally for our employees.

24. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). »21

25. Furthermore, it would like to point out that Article 12 of the GDPR does not de facto exclude

that the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR can be provided

orally by the controller to the data subject. However, the group

of Labor Article 29 insists that in this case, the data controller should ensure

“to keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it (for the purposes of

compliance with the accountability requirement), of: i) the request for information by

oral, ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified (if

applicable, see point 20 above), and (iii) the fact that the information was transmitted to

the person concerned. »22

26. Next, the Restricted Committee would like to point out that there is in the GDPR a

“inherent conflict between, on the one hand, the requirement to communicate to data subjects

the complete information that is required under the GDPR and, on the other hand, the requirement

of

the

do it concisely,

transparent, understandable and easily

reachable”23. Prioritize the information to be provided to the persons concerned and

determine what levels of detail and methods are appropriate for communication

information is not always obvious.

27. It is for this reason that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

for example personal data processed by means of a device of

geolocation. The first level of information should generally include the

most important information, namely details of the purpose of the processing, the identity

                                                           
21 See WP 260 rev.01, point 33.
22 WP 260 rev.01, point 21.
23 See WP 260 rev.01, point 34.

of the controller and the existence of the rights of data subjects, as well as

that the information having the greatest impact on the processing or any processing

likely to surprise those concerned. The second level of information

i.e. the other information required under Article 13 of the GDPR, could

be provided later and by other means, such as a copy

of the privacy policy sent by e-mail24.

2.1 Information of third parties

28. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, these people were not informed of the presence of the security system.

video surveillance.

29. After the on-site visit, the controller prepared an information letter relating to the

CCTV system for use by third parties, copies of which he submitted

in the different language versions available at the CNPD by mail from

February 28, 2020, specifying that said letter would be available at its reception-reception. The

Formation Restreinte notes, however, that the new information letter intended for

third parties does not contain all the elements required by article 13.1 and 2

of the GDPR.

30. It also notes that the documentation submitted by the audit does not

contains or evidence that the aforementioned information mail is available

at the reception-reception of the site of operation of the controlled in […], nor proof attesting that

third parties have been informed by the installation of pictograms and signs

signaling relating to video surveillance, as mentioned in the letters of the

checked on February 28, 2020 and December 7, 2020.

31. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that the control in its letter of

December 7, 2020 in response to the statement of objections of November 5, 2020 a

indicated the following: "with regard to the lack of information of the persons

concerned, we are fully aware that the items listed (apart from

                                                           
24 See WP 260 rev.01, point 38 as well as EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of
personal data by video devices whose version 2.0 was adopted on
January 29, 2020, point 110 et seq.

the identity and contact details of the data controller for point 17. who, in our

eyes, seem obvious to us in case someone arrives at our business site)

in your Statement of Objections under points 17.[25] and […] were only at the time of

your visit not to the availability of our employees / customers / suppliers / visitors /

service providers. Moreover, the forgetting, in the past, on our part to inform the same

people on the existence of video surveillance on site by setting up a written

or traffic signs is not to be disputed. ".

32. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the controlled

has breached its obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

relates to third parties.

2.2 Informing employees

33. The Restricted Panel first notes that the controlled party did not submit any

documentation that contains evidence that employees have been validly

informed, prior to the site visit, orally or otherwise in accordance with

GDPR Article 13.

34. After the on-site visit, the controller prepared an information letter intended for

employees, of which he submitted copies of the different language versions to the CNPD by

letter of February 28, 2020, specifying that this letter would first be sent to the

employees as an appendix to their pay slips, and that it would then be published on its website

“intranet”. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that this new letter

information does not contain all the elements required by article 13.1 and 2 of the

GDPR.

                                                           
25 Cf. Elements listed in point 17. in the statement of objections of 5 November 2020,
page 4, Ad.B.1) (video surveillance): “The controlled omits in particular to provide the elements
following: - the identity and contact details of the controller; - the purposes of the processing
for whom the personal data are intended and the legal basis for the processing
; - the legitimate interests pursued by the controller; - the recipients or the
categories of recipients of personal data; -  the length of the conversation  ; -
the existence of the right to request from the controller access to personal data
personal information, rectification or erasure thereof, or limitation of processing relating to the
concerned person ; and - the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. »

35. It also notes that the documentation submitted by the audit does not

does not contain any evidence that employees have been informed of the system of

video surveillance by means of specific provisions in its internal regulations, such as

that mentioned in the letters of the control of February 11, 2019 and December 7, 2020, nor

proof attesting to the installation of pictograms and relative signage

at

video surveillance,

as mentioned in

letters from the control of

February 28, 2020 and December 7, 2020. The controlled also did not provide proof

certifying that employees have been informed by information letter attached to their files

salary or published on the "intranet" site, as mentioned in the letter from the controller

of February 28, 2020.

36. In addition, the auditee recognized the lack of information of the persons

concerned at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials (see point 31 of the

this decision).

37. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the controlled

has breached its obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

relates to employees.

 

B. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

1. On the principles

38. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

39. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.26

40. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

41. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

2. In this case

43. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that “the

purposes of the implementation of video surveillance are the protection of the property of

the company, the securing of access as well as the safety of users and the prevention

accidents”29.

2.1 As for the camera whose field of vision extends to neighboring land

45. The head of investigation

retained in

the statement of objections of the

November 5, 2020 that the surveillance of neighboring land was disproportionate in view of

of the purposes for which video surveillance was carried out. He felt he was not

necessary to include neighboring land in the field of vision of the camera by

question34.

46. He found that a non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR had been established

day of the site visit. He considered in particular that the mail from the control of the

February 11, 2019 contained no evidence against this non-compliance, and that

the control had also not presented any mitigating elements, such as a reorientation

of the camera's field of view, or a blurring of surrounding terrain35.

47. The controller for his part indicated in his letter of February 28, 2020 that the

field of view of the camera concerned would be reduced to private land within a period

one month.

48. Contrary to these remarks, he explained in his letter of December 7, 2020,

that he was of the opinion that the video surveillance of part of the neighboring land […] was not

to be considered disproportionate.

49. By letter of July 21, 2021 he finally informed that the software currently

used would not make it possible to mask part of the field of vision of the camera, and that

the camera located at the back of the depot […] “will be relocated in such a way as to no longer

see the buildings on the village side, or the neighboring field”.

50. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor

a place of access where the surroundings of a building or site must have a field of

vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view people getting ready

to access it. Cameras installed near or around a building must be

configured so as not to capture the public road, nor the surroundings, entrances, access and

interiors of other neighboring buildings possibly falling within their scope of

vision. Depending on the configuration of the premises, it is sometimes impossible to install a

camera that does not include part of the public road in its field of vision,

surroundings, entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In such a case, the CNPD considers

that the data controller must put in place techniques for masking or

blurring in order to limit the field of vision to its property.36

51. She noted that at the time of the site visit the field of vision of the camera

in dispute extended to the neighboring lands so that the control did not respect

the principle of proportionality.

52. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation according to which non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

2.2 As for the cameras permanently monitoring the workstations of employees in

the agencies […] of control

53. The head of investigation accepted in the statement of objections of 5 November

2020 that “the permanent monitoring of employees at their workstations, […] is

also to be considered disproportionate. Indeed, such monitoring

permanent can create significant psychological pressure for employees who

feel and know they are being watched, especially since the surveillance measures continue

in time. The fact that the employees concerned do not have a means of

withdrawing from this supervision from time to time is also likely to aggravate this

pressure. Such permanent surveillance is considered disproportionate to the

purpose sought and constitutes an excessive interference with the private sphere of employees

busy at their jobs. In this case, the fundamental rights and freedoms of

employees must prevail over the interests pursued by the employer.

54. He found that non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR had been established

day of the site visit. He considered that the letter of the control of February 11, 2019 does not

contained no evidence against non-compliance, and that the auditee had not provided

no explanation as to the possible need for monitoring, nor presented

mitigating elements38.

55. The controller indicated in his letter of February 28, 2020 that the cameras

disputed would have been disconnected from the video surveillance system and would

uninstalled within one month. Contrary to the above, he indicated

in his letter of December 7, 2020, that these cameras would have been disconnected and

would be used more.

56. La Formation Restreinte would like to point out that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach

the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. However, to respect

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

57. In this case, it notes that at the time of the on-site visit, the cameras

litigious allowed the permanent monitoring of the workstations of the employees

so that the controlled did not respect the principle of proportionality.

58. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

investigation and concludes that non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was established on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

II. 1.2. As for the geolocation device

A. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

1. On the principles

59. With regard to the principles to be observed with regard to the obligation to inform

data subjects in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

refers to points 14 to 17 of this decision.

2. In this case

60. During the on-site visit, CNPD officials noted that “persons

concerned by the geolocation are employees of the company and customers (third parties) having

rented a vehicle from the controller”39.

61. With regard to the information of third parties, CNPD officials

found that the presence of the geolocation device “is not reported to

inside rented vehicles”40, but “that third parties are informed [...] by

the signing of the rental contract which includes a specific stipulation relating to this

point  (…). By their signature, the lessees of the vehicles also mark their

consent to this surveillance measure”.

62. In the Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, the Head of Investigation

noted that the specific stipulation contained in the vehicle rental contract

to inform third parties of the presence of the geolocation device

did not meet the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR. He considered that no evidence

additional information regarding more complete information for third parties had not been

presented, and that the documentation submitted by letter of the control of February 11, 2019

did not contain any evidence either.42 Thus, he held that in view of the requirements of Article 13

of the GDPR, the information provided by the controlled party to signal the presence of the

geolocation was incomplete43. He was of the opinion that the auditee failed in his duty

information arising from Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to persons

third parties44.

63. The controller informed by letter dated February 28, 2020 that “customers […] will be

informed [of the geolocation] by a document, annexed to the rental contract of

provision of a service vehicle”. He attached copies of the information letter in

question in French and German. Moreover, he mentioned in his letter

of December 7, 2020 its intention to review the “lease agreements in order to inform more

precisely our customers on the presence of a geolocation in our vehicles of

lease ".

64. With regard to the information of employees, CNPD officials noted

during the on-site visit that the presence of the geolocation device “is not reported

inside the vehicles to company employees”45, and that “no evidence that the

employees have been duly informed of the installation of the geolocation device in

vehicles were provided”46.

65. In the Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, the Head of Investigation

noted that the note dated April 29, 2014 which was distributed to the drivers for the

inform of the presence of the geolocation device, and which has been communicated to the

CNPD by letter of the control of February 11, 2019, did not meet the requirements of

article 13 of the GDPR47. Thus, he retained that in view of the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR,

the information provided by the controlled party to signal the presence of the

geolocation was incomplete48. He was of the opinion that the auditee failed in his duty

information arising from Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to employees49.

66. The controller informed in his letter of February 11, 2019 that during

the installation of the geolocation device a “note to drivers was distributed

in the boxes of these. “, and that” since then, the explanation of the system as well as

data collected is part of the job interview procedure which is done

orally”. He attached copies of the aforementioned note in French and German

to his mail. He also indicated that after the compliance process in

which he would have committed "the drivers will see the information of the

geolocation in their contract”.

67. In addition, he specified in his letter of February 28, 2020 that the employees

would be informed by letter attached to their next payslips, and that this

mail would then be published on the "intranet" site of the controlled. Copies of mail

information intended for employees in French and German have been appended to

his mail.

68. By letter dated December 7, 2020, control informed the CNPD of the following:

“Following your visit, from a written point of view, we have started to introduce all the

missing elements concerning the themes of […] and geolocation in our

internal regulations for our employees”.

69. The Restricted Panel would first like to refer to its clarifications set out

in points 24 and 25 of this Decision relating to the obligation imposed on the controller

of the processing to “provide” all the obligations mentioned in article 13 as well as in the

oral communication of information.

70. Next, she would also like to recall the multi-level approach to

communicate the required information to the persons concerned as described in

points 26 and 27 of this decision.

2.1 Information of third parties

71. The Restricted Committee notes first of all that during the on-site visit, these

people were informed of the geolocation by a specific stipulation in the

vehicle rental agreement, which was documented by a photo taken by the officers

of the CNPD during the on-site visit, and which states the following: “n. The tenant declares

be

informed that

the vehicle

rented is generally equipped with a system of

geolocation. This system makes it possible to record the speeds and routes traveled

(location) and is used to record operational vehicle data. All

the data recorded will be treated strictly confidentially. By its

signature, the tenant explicitly agrees to his data being

registered and that he cannot exercise any rights of appeal relating thereto. ". She notices

that the controller had the aforementioned contractual stipulation signed separately.

72. She then notes that after the on-site visit the controller prepared a letter

information intended for third parties which should be annexed to the contracts of

vehicle rental and of which he submitted copies of the different language versions to the

CNPD by letter dated February 28, 2020.

73. It notes, however, that neither the specific stipulation in the contracts of

rental, nor the new information letter, do not contain all the elements

required by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.

74. It also notes that the documentation submitted by the auditee does not contain

proof that the aforementioned information letter is systematically attached to the

rental contract, or proof that the audited has reviewed its rental contracts

in order to inform

the people

third parties more precisely on

the presence of a

geolocation in its rental vehicles, as mentioned in the letter from the

checked on December 7, 2020.

75. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee notes that the check in its letter of the

December 7, 2020 in response to the statement of objections of November 5, 2020 a

indicated the following: "with regard to the lack of information of the persons

concerned, we are fully aware that the elements listed […] in

your statement of objections under points […] and 22.[50] weren't at the time of your

visit not at the availability of our employees / customers / suppliers / visitors / service providers

Services. […]. ".

76. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the controlled

has breached its obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

relates to third parties.

2.2 Informing employees

77. The Restricted Committee notes that at the time of the on-site visit, the drivers

were informed by the note sent to them when the device was installed.

geolocation, and that after the site visit the controller prepared an information letter

intended for employees, of which he has submitted copies of the different language versions to the

CNPD by letter dated February 28, 2020, specifying that this letter would first be sent

to employees as an appendix to their pay slips, and that it would then be published on its website

“intranet”.

78. It considers, however, that neither the note sent to the drivers during

the installation of the geolocation device, nor the information mail, and from which it received

copies, do not contain all the elements required by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.

79. It also notes that no documentation submitted by the auditee

contains proof attesting that the employees were duly informed, before the visit

on site, orally in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR or proof attesting

that a specific provision was added to their employment contracts after the site visit

site, as mentioned in the letter from the auditee of February 11, 2019. The auditee did not

no longer provided proof attesting that the employees were informed by mail

information appended to their pay slips or published on the “intranet” site, such as

mentioned in the letter of the control of February 28, 2020, or by means of provision

specific in its internal regulations, as mentioned in the letter from the control of the

December 7, 2020.

80. In addition, the auditee recognized the lack of information of the persons

concerned at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials (see point 75 of the

this decision).

81. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the controlled

has breached its obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

relates to employees.

B. On the breach linked to the principle of limitation of storage

1. On the principles

82. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […] (retention limitation)”.

83. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. ".

2. In this case

84. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that “the

purposes of the implementation of the geolocation device is the geographical location

vehicles, protection of company assets, optimal fleet management,

optimization of the work process, health and safety of users, prevention

accidents, the provision of responses to customer complaints, the provision of

proof of services, invoicing of services as well as the evaluation of

employee performance.

85. CNPD officials also noted that “the data collected

and recorded by the geolocation device are the position of the vehicle, the

route, the date and time of the start and end of the journey, the distance covered,

recording of stops and breaks (vehicle status), driving time,

instantaneous speed, average speed, speeding violations committed by drivers

                                                           
51 See Minutes of the on-site inspection, page 5, point 9, finding 13.

as well as information on driver driving (sudden turns and braking,

accelerations, etc.)”52.

86. It is apparent from the statement of objections that “during the on-site visit, it was

noted that the retention period of the geo-positioning data noted has been

2 (two) years 11 (eleven) months and 7 (seven) days”53. According to the head of the investigation, the said duration

conservation "exceeds that which is necessary for the achievement of the purposes for

which the geolocation device has been set up”. Furthermore, he found that

“in its letter of February 11, 2019, the company claims that “the data details” are

kept for 3 months on the user platform […] and for 3 years for this

concerning statistical data and register data. The company remains

however failing to explain exactly what is referred to by the "details of data

and “registry data”. The same is true for data.

statistics”.54 Thus, “for lack of additional details” the head of the investigation was

of the opinion that the controller has breached its obligation under Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR55
.

87. For his part, the person inspected successively provided a certain amount of information to the

CNPD:

88. By letter dated February 11, 2019, he confirmed that “the retention period of the

data collected from […] are:

 3 months on user platform for data details

 3 years (current year + 2 previous years) for data from

statistics as well as for register data”.

He attached to this letter a brochure entitled "[...]" as well as a copy of his register

processing activities.

89. By letter dated February 28, 2020, he informed that he cannot configure himself

the retention period of the data in the geolocation device being given

that it is a standard set up by the supplier. However, it would be in exchange

regularly with the supplier in order to find a solution that would allow configuration of

the length of the conversation.

90. By letter dated December 7, 2020, he specified that "the details of the data are intended

for example the kilometers or journeys traveled (on a specific race) or the

different benchmarks of our service vehicles while the statistical data

or of the register refer rather to the points of departure or arrival of our service vehicles

or even all the kilometers traveled (over a year for example) of our

service vehicles in order to make correct “VAT” declarations to the

foreign responsible institutions. »

91. By letter dated July 21, 2021, he provided additional information on

the “telemetric system data retention”: he appended a table in format

Excel “explaining data type retention in our telemetry system”; he

specified that it was possible “in theory, [to] detect for ten years which driver

drove which service vehicle, this for billing reasons (the on-board letter

which contains this information constituting an annex to the invoice)”; and he indicated

that he would not intend to “perceive the driving history of a driver for a

equal duration of three years" even if the processing device allows it, "except

request of the police or legal authorities”.

92. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period for the

personal data appropriate and necessary to achieve this purpose.

93. With regard to the geolocation of service vehicles used by the

employees, it is of the opinion that the following retention periods meet the principle

the limitation of storage under the following conditions:

-

personal data obtained by geolocation may

principle only be kept for a maximum period of two

month ;

-

whether the geo-tracking device is installed for time verification purposes

work (when this is the only possible means), the personal data

staff obtained by geolocation that allow to check the time

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

25/45



of work may nevertheless be kept for a maximum period

three years in accordance with the limitation period set out in article 2277 paragraph

1st of the Civil Code in matters of action for payment of remuneration of

employees. In the public sector, this data may be kept for

a maximum duration of five years;

-

whether the personal data obtained by geolocation are

used by the controller for the purposes of proof for the

invoicing of services performed for its customers,

the data

necessary for such invoicing may be kept for a period of

1 year, provided that it is not possible to provide proof of the

benefits by other means;

- in the event of an incident, the data may however be kept beyond the

aforementioned deadlines, in the context of the transmission of data to

competent judicial authorities and competent law enforcement authorities

to ascertain or prosecute criminal offences.

The data obtained by geolocation can also be kept beyond

of the aforementioned durations, if these have previously been made anonymous, that is

that is to say that it is no longer possible to make a link – direct or indirect – between this data and

a specified employee.56

With regard to the geolocation of rental vehicles used by persons

third parties, it considers that the aforementioned retention periods apply

mutatis mutandis.

94. The Restricted Panel first notes

geolocation exceed those necessary for the achievement of the purposes pursued by

controlled, and declared to CNPD officials during the on-site visit (see point 84 of the

this decision).

96. Next, the Restricted Committee observes that it appears from the copy of the register of

processing activities that the controller attached to his letter of February 11, 2019, and more

particularly of the “register card […]” relating to the processing referred to as “management

of the tachograph" that

-

the “main purpose” of the processing carried out is to “Manage and control the

drivers' tachographs”;

-

the following personal data are concerned: “Driver:

Surname, First name, Driver's license number, Period of validity of the driver's license

Drive, Driving Time Data” and “Users: Name,

First Name and Email”;

-

these data are kept for "3 years according to the law, 90 days for

Live data for tachograph data, duration of the contract for the

driver”, “3 years from their collection for data relating to the

                                                           
57 […].

working time" and "2 years minimum from their collection for

driving data.

97. It notes that the processing purpose indicated on the register sheet in

question, namely "manage and control the drivers' tachographs", does not correspond

not for the purposes that the control declared to the CNPD agents during the visit to

site (see point 84 of this decision). Moreover, it considers that the information

contained in the “register card […]” are not precise enough to

demonstrate that the retention periods indicated are necessary for the achievement of

the desired purpose. It should also be mentioned that the “register card […]”

relating to “fleet management” was not included in the copy of the register of activities

which has been communicated to the CNPD.

98. Finally, the Restricted Panel notes the table in Excel format attached

to the letter of the control of July 21, 2021 which lists the data recorded by the

geolocation device and their respective retention periods.

The list includes sixteen “Type[s] of data”, namely: “Positions, Tracks, Data

[…], Contact Changes, Order States, Work State Changes, Codes

of faults, Acceleration (horizontal), Tachograph data, Device monitoring

tracking, Archived reports, KPIs, Vehicle statistics, Vehicle statistics

driver, working time statistics and logbook”.

The retention periods for this data range from 40 days to three years. Some

types of data are marked “non-anonymized”. These last are

kept for “2 calendar years + current year”, namely the “Statistics of the

driver, working time statistics and board book" or "three years", i.e.

“Archived Reports”.

99. It considers, however, that the information contained in the letter from the

of 21 July 2021 as well as the new table appended thereto are not

sufficiently precise to demonstrate that the stated retention periods are

necessary for the achievement of the purposes pursued by the control, and declared to the

CNPD officials during the on-site visit (see point 84 of this decision).

100. Accordingly, the Restricted Panel finds that no documentation submitted

by the controlled party does not contain proof attesting that "the period of storage of the data

of geo-positioning (…) of 2 (two) years 11 (eleven) months and 7 (seven) days” which was

noted during the on-site visit by CNPD officials58, did not exceed that

necessary in order to achieve the purposes pursued by the control, and declared to the agents

of the CNPD during the on-site visit (see point 84 of this decision).

101. On the basis of all of these elements, the Restricted Formation joins

the opinion of the head of investigation and concludes that the control failed in its obligation arising from

Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

1. On the principles

102. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

                                                           
58 See Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, page 7, Ad.B.3), point 34.

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

103. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

104. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that

administrative fines

imposed are, in each case, effective,

proportionate and dissuasive, before specifying the elements that must be taken into

account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the

amount of this fine:

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

30/45



d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same object, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the violation. »

105. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

106. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

107. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposes to the Panel

Restricted to impose an administrative fine to the control of an amount of ten thousand

(10,000) euros.59

108. In his letter of December 7, 2020 addressed to the head of investigation, the controlled

said the following: "In general, after fully analyzing your

statement of objections, we are a bit disappointed that you are going to propose to the

National Commission sitting in restricted formation to condemn us to a fine

of such a significant amount in a rather delicate situation for our group

companies ([…]), taking into consideration, as mentioned in your letter

of November 5, 2020, our good collaboration throughout your investigation with respect

stringent deadlines imposed and the fact […]. »

109. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to

decide, where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into

includes the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation notes that with regard to breaches of

articles 5.1.c) and 5.1.e) of the GDPR, they constitute breaches of the

fundamental principles of the GDPR (and data protection law in

general), namely the principles of data minimization and the limitation

of conservation set out in Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

treatment so that people are fully aware of the use

what will be done with their personal data, once these

collected. A breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes a

infringement of the rights of data subjects. This right to information has

has been strengthened under the GDPR, which demonstrates its importance

quite particular.

It should be noted that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, neither the

employees, nor third parties were informed of the video surveillance

and/or geolocation in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have lasted over time, at least since

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the site visit. She recalls here that two

years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into force for

enable data controllers to comply with the obligations that

are incumbent on them. Moreover, an obligation to respect the principles of

minimization and limitation of storage, as well as an obligation

comparable information already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1.b) and d),

10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of August 2, 2002 on the protection of

individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. Of the

guidance relating to the principles and obligations provided for in the said law was

available from the CNPD, in particular through authorizations

mandatory prerequisites for video surveillance and geolocation and

guidance available on its website.

- As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training notes that for video surveillance, it is all

employees working on the controlled site's operating site at […] respectively

in the agencies […], as well as all third parties, i.e. the

customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors to these

premises.

With regard to the geolocation devices installed in the

controlled vehicles are concerned all employees and third parties

using vehicles. It should be noted that during the on-site visit the agents of the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

33/45

 

 

 



CNPD found that approximately […] vehicles ([…]) were equipped with the device

of geolocation60.

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (Article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

recalls that "not deliberately" means that there was no intention to

commit the breach, although the controller or processor

failed to comply with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the

legislation.

In the present case, it is of the opinion that the facts and breaches found do not

do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of the

control.

- As to the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f)

of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head

of investigation according to which the cooperation of the controlled throughout the investigation

was good, as well as its willingness to comply with GDPR requirements

as soon as possible.61

- As for the measures taken by the controlled party to mitigate the damage suffered by

the persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account

of the measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of

this decision for the related explanations.

110. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

111. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the control

in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these have only been

adopted only following the control of CNPD agents on December 7, 2018

(see also point 105 of this decision).

112. Moreover, unlike the head of investigation62, she does not take into account the

camera installed at the level of the entrance gate to the site of […] given that this point does not

is not the subject of this decision.

113. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c), 5.1.e) and 13 of the GDPR.

114. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, she recalled that the

paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple infringements, such as

this is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for

the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

115. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above,

the Restricted Committee considers that the pronouncement of a fine of four thousand nine

hundred (4,900) euros appears both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the

requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

2.2 Regarding the taking of corrective measures

116. In the statement of objections of 5 November 2020 the head of investigation

proposes to the Restricted Formation to adopt the following corrective measures:

" has. Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for persons concerned by video surveillance, in accordance with the

provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by providing

in particular the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and its

legal basis, […], the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, the recipients,

the retention period of the data as well as the indication of the rights of the person

and how to exercise them;

                                                           
62 See Statement of Objections of 5 November 2020, page 5 et seq., Ad.B.2), point 24 et seq.

b. Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for persons concerned by geolocation, in accordance with the

provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by providing

in particular the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and its

legal basis, […], the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, the recipients,

the retention period of the data as well as the indication of the rights of the person

and how to exercise them;

vs. Order the controller to process only relevant data,

adequate and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes and, in particular:

i. to carry out or have carried out the removal or the reorientation of the camera

installed at the level of the entrance gate to the […] site comprising in its scope

vision of parts of the public highway;

ii. to carry out or have carried out the removal or the reorientation of the camera

number 2 called "[...]" (installed at the company's headquarters) allowing the

surveillance of part of a neighboring land;

iii. to carry out or have carried out the removal or the reorientation of the cameras

installed inside the branches […] allow permanent surveillance

of the workstations of the employees who are occupied there.

d. Order the data controller to limit the retention of data to a

duration not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes for which the data

are collected and processed. »63

117. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 106 of this decision, the Restricted Training takes into account

the steps taken by the controller, following the on-site visit by CNPD agents,

in order to comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c), 5.1.e) and 13 of the GDPR, as

detailed in his letters of February 11, 2019, February 28, 2020, December 7, 2020 and

July 21, 2021. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

1. As regards the implementation of information measures intended for persons

third parties concerned by the video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of

Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller maintained that following the on-site visit, he

would have installed pictograms and signs relating to the

video surveillance

(cf.

letters from

checked on February 28, 2020 and

December 7, 2020). However, the Restricted Formation does not have the

documentation that would demonstrate that this measure has been put in place.

The auditee also maintained that a fact sheet would now be

available at its reception. He provided the CNPD with copies of the new

information letter in French and German (see letter from the controller

of February 28, 2020). However, the Restricted Formation does not have the

documentation that would demonstrate that this information letter is

available at the reception-reception of the controlled operating site at […].

The Restricted Committee also notes that the information letter intended for

third parties does not contain all the information required by article 13

of the GDPR.

Thus, this letter does not make it easy to identify the controller.

(article 13.1.a) of the GDPR), the legitimate interests pursued (Art.13.1.d) of the GDPR)

are not mentioned and the purposes of the processing (article 13.1.c) of the GDPR), the

(categories of) recipients of personal data (Article 13.1 e) of the

GDPR) as well as the rights of data subjects (Article 13.2.b) of the GDPR)

are not specified in detail.

Furthermore, it is noted that the information provided by the controller does not

fulfill neither the conditions required for the first level of information, nor those for the

second level of information (see points 26 and 27 of this decision).

2. Regarding the implementation of information measures for employees

affected by video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1

and 2 of the GDPR, the controller argued that following the site visit he would have installed

pictograms and signs relating to video surveillance

(see letters from the audit of February 28, 2020 and December 7, 2020) and that

specific provisions should be included in its internal regulations (cf.

letters from the control of February 11, 2019 and December 7, 2020). Training

Restreinte, however, does not have the documentation that would allow it to

demonstrate that these measures have been put in place.

The controller also maintained that the employees would be informed of the

video surveillance by an information letter which would be communicated with their

payslips and which would also be published on its "intranet" site. He provided

copies of the letter in question in French and German (see letter

of the audit of February 28, 2020). However, the Restricted Formation does not have

documentation that would demonstrate that this information letter was

been communicated to employees.

The Restricted Training also notes that the mail sent to employees

does not contain all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR.

Thus, the identity and contact details of the controller (Article 13.1.a) of the

GDPR) as well as the legitimate interests pursued (Art.13.1.d) of the GDPR) are not

not mentioned, and the contact details of the data protection officer

(Art.13.1.b) of the GDPR), the purposes of the processing (Article 13.1.c) of the GDPR), the

(categories of) recipients of personal data (Article 13.1 e) of the

GDPR), as well as the rights of data subjects (Article 13.2.b) of the GDPR)

are not specified in detail.

Furthermore, it is noted that the information provided by the controller does not

fulfill neither the conditions required for the first level of information, nor those for the

second level of information (see points 26 and 27 of this decision).

In conclusion, considering the insufficient compliance measures

taken by the auditee in this case and point 106 of this decision, the

Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of the investigation in this regard64 and repeated in point 116 of

this Decision under (a), as regards the information of employees and

third parties regarding the video surveillance system.

In addition, during the on-site visit, the auditee was identified as responsible for the

treatment65, which was not disputed by the person inspected, neither during the investigation nor

during the Restricted Training session of June 30, 2021. Nevertheless, the

information mail intended for third parties as well as mail

information intended for employees, indicate two employees as responsible

of the treatment. However, in this case it turns out that the controller is indeed

the controlled party, i.e. Company A and not employees, so that the

Restricted Training is of the opinion that the control should adapt the documents

information in this regard.

3. As to the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes sought, namely the

protection of company assets, securing access, as well as security

of users and the prevention of accidents with regard to video surveillance

implemented by the auditee (see point 43 of this decision), the latter has

indicated in his letter of February 28, 2020 that the fields of vision of the cameras

allowing surveillance of neighboring land should be reduced.

However, it appears from his letters of December 7, 2020 and July 21, 2021 that the

controlled only intends to relocate the camera located at the rear of the depot of

[…] in order to limit his field of vision and no longer film the surrounding land.

For the Restricted Formation, it is camera number 2 called […]” by

report to which the head of investigation held that it is "installed at the headquarters of the

society”66. She notes that with regard to this camera that she does not however have

no documentation that would demonstrate that the field of vision of

this camera has been reduced.

The corrective measures do not take into account the camera installed at the level

of the entrance gate to the site of […] given that this point is not the subject of the

this decision.

With regard to cameras allowing the permanent monitoring of

workstations of the employees in the agencies […] of the control, the latter has

                                                           
65 See Minutes of the on-site inspection, page 1, point 1.

indicated in his letter of February 28, 2020 that the disputed cameras would have

been disconnected from the CCTV system and would be uninstalled

within one month. However, the Restricted Formation does not have

confirmed information that these cameras have been removed. In effect,

in his letter of December 7, 2020, the controller indicated that the cameras

would have been disconnected and would no longer be used. However, this uncertainty

does not guarantee satisfactory protection for employees. The

Formation Restreinte considers, moreover, as it noted in point 57 of

this Decision, that the fields of view of these cameras are

disproportionate.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 106 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard67 and taken up in point 116 of this Decision under

c) in items ii. and iii.

4. As regards the implementation of information measures intended for persons

third parties concerned by geolocation, in accordance with the provisions of

Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller argued that following the on-site visit the

third parties would be informed by a document annexed to the contract of

vehicle rental. He provided copies of the information letter in question in

French and German languages (see letter from the control of February 28, 2020). The

However, Formation Restreinte does not have the documentation that would allow

to demonstrate that this information letter is systematically attached to the

vehicle rental contracts.

The Restricted Committee notes that the information letter intended for

third parties does not contain all the information required by article 13

of the GDPR.

Thus, this letter does not make it easy to identify the controller.

de) recipients of personal data (Article 13.1 e) GDPR)

as well as the rights of data subjects (Article 13.2b) of the GDPR) are not

not specified in detail.

Furthermore, it is noted that the information provided by the controller does not

fulfill neither the conditions required for the first level of information, nor those for the

second level of information (see points 26 and 27 of this decision).

The auditee further maintained that third parties should be informed

geolocation in its rental vehicles through rental contracts

location reviewed and clarified (see letter from the inspection of December 7, 2020). The

Formation Restreinte, however, does not have the documentation that

would demonstrate that this measure has been put in place.

5. Regarding the implementation of information measures for employees

affected by geolocation, in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1

and 2 of the GDPR, the controller maintained that following the on-site visit, the employees

would be informed of the geolocation by an information letter which would be

communicated with their payslips and which would also be published on its website

“intranet”. He provided copies of the letter in question in French and

German (see letter from the control of February 28, 2020). Restricted Training does not

however, does not have the documentation that would demonstrate that this

information letter was sent to employees.

The Restricted Training finds that the mail intended for employees does not contain

not all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR.

Thus, this letter does not make it easy to identify the controller.

Furthermore, it is noted that the information provided by the controller does not

fulfill neither the conditions required for the first level of information, nor those for the

second level of information (see points 26 and 27 of this decision).

The controller also maintained that the employees would be informed of the

geolocation by means of “their[s] contract[s]” (cf. letter from the control of the

February 11, 2019) and by means of its internal regulations (see letter from the control of the

December 7, 2020). However, the Restricted Formation does not have the

documentation that would demonstrate that these measures have been implemented

square.

In conclusion, considering the insufficient compliance measures

taken by the auditee in this case and point 106 of this decision, the

Restricted Panel considers that there is reason to pronounce the corrective measure

proposed by the head of investigation in this regard68 and repeated in point 116 of this

decision under b), as regards the information of employees and persons

third parties as to the geolocation device.

In addition, during the on-site visit, the auditee was identified as responsible for the

treatment69, which was not disputed by the person inspected, neither during the investigation nor

during the Restricted Training session of June 30, 2021. Nevertheless, the

information mail intended for third parties as well as mail

information intended for employees, indicate an employee as responsible for the

treatment. However, in this case it turns out that the data controller is indeed the

controlled, i.e. Company A and not an employee, so that the Formation

Restricted is of the opinion that the audited should adapt the information documents

in this sense.

6. As for the obligation to limit the retention period of the data to a period

not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes for which the data

are collected and processed, the Restricted Training finds that the documentation

submitted by the controller does not contain any evidence that would demonstrate

that the latter has adapted the retention period of the geolocation data

after the on-site visit by CNPD officials. Indeed, the controller informed that he

cannot itself set the retention period for data in the

geolocation device. The Restricted Panel considers, however, that the

retention periods for data from the geolocation device must be

be adapted according to the different purposes pursued.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

reviewed in this case and point 106 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard70 and taken up in point 116 of this decision under

d).

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:
