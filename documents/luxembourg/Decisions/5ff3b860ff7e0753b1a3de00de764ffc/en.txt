I. Facts and procedure

1. On June 29, 2018 and September 14, 2018, the National Commission for

data protection (hereinafter: the “CNPD”) received two complaints

reporting to the CNPD potential breaches of the provisions of Regulation (EU)

2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 relating to the protection of

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and to the

free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter: “GDPR”)

by using the online service of the Trade and Companies Register (here

after: "RCS") of the site "www.lbr.lu" whose manager is the interest group

economic “LUXEMBOURG BUSINESS REGISTER” (hereinafter: “LBR”), located at 14,

Rue Erasme, L - 1468 Luxembourg and registered with the RCS under number C24.

2. During its deliberation session of February 22, 2019, the National Commission

for data protection sitting in plenary session (hereafter: “Formation

Plenary”) therefore decided to open an investigation with the LBR on the basis of article 37

of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the

data protection and the general data protection regime (hereinafter: “Law

of August 1, 2018”) and to appoint Mr. Christophe Buschmann as Chief

of investigation.

3. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation conducted by the CNPD

was intended to verify the compliance of the public availability of the data

personal information accessible via the RCS online service of the “www.lbr.lu” site, with the section

2 of Chapter 4 of the GDPR entitled "Security of personal data" and this

for the period from 2004 to 2019.

4. On May 24, 2019, the LBR responded to the preliminary questionnaire sent

by the CNPD by letter dated April 18, 2019.

5. On June 20, 2019, CNPD officials participated in a meeting in

LBR premises. The said meeting was the subject of a report, for which the LBR

shared its remarks and comments dated July 19, 2019.

6. On July 25, 2019, a second meeting took place at the premises of the

LBR. On July 26, 2019, the LBR sent additional documents to the CNPD and

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

2/19



dated August 9, 2019, he provided his remarks and comments relating to the account

report from the aforementioned meeting.

7. By email of August 9, 2019, the CNPD asked questions

additional information to the LBR, to which the latter replied on September 6, 2019.

8. By letter dated March 6, 2020, the head of investigation informed the Ministry of Justice

that during its deliberation session of January 14, 2020, the Plenary Formation decided

to include the said ministry, in its capacity as controller for the updating

public availability of personal data accessible via the RCS Online Service

of the website www.lbr.lu, within the scope of the investigation opened on February 22, 2019.

Indeed, the head of investigation considered that in consideration of the investigative measures

carried out by him between April 16, 2019 and September 9, 2019, it appears that the

LBR acts as a subcontractor in the context of the processing covered by the survey

mentioned above and acts only in execution of the decisions taken by the Ministry of

Justice, the latter assuming the role of responsible for said treatments.

A copy of the aforementioned letter of March 6, 2020 was sent to the LBR.

9. Following the change in the scope of the survey, i.e. the inclusion of the

Ministry of Justice (hereinafter: "the Ministry") as controller,

while it turned out that the LBR only assumed the function of subcontractor, a

meeting with the Ministry and CNPD officials took place on July 7, 2020.

The said meeting was the subject of a report, for which the ministry expressed its

remarks and comments dated August 17, 2020.

10. The CNPD agents in charge of the investigation had, in the meantime, more

precisely dated July 17, 2020, sent to the ministry all the elements

relevant previously exchanged with the LBR.

11. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the Ministry on

May 27, 2021 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically a non-compliance with the requirements prescribed

by Article 32 of the GDPR.

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

In the statement of objections, the head of investigation proposes to the National Commission

for data protection sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation

(hereinafter: “Restricted Training”) to adopt four corrective measures.

 

12. On June 29, 2021, the Department filed written submissions on the

statement of objections.

 

13. The president of the Restricted Formation informed the ministry by letter of the

August 10, 2021 that his case would be registered for the Restricted Panel session of 6

October 2021. The Ministry has confirmed its presence at the said meeting on August 26

2021.

 

14. Following the departure of Mr. Christophe Buschmann, the Plenary Formation

decided during its deliberation session of September 3, 2021 that Mr. Marc

Lemmer would occupy from September 3, 2021 the function of chief of investigation for

the investigation in question.

 

15. During the Restricted Training session of October 6, 2021, the leader

of investigation and the Ministry presented their oral observations in support of their

written observations and answered the questions posed by the Restricted Panel. the

department spoke last.

II. Reasons for decision

II. 1. As to the procedure

1. On the role of controller and processor

16. During its deliberation session of February 22, 2019, the Plenary Formation had

decided to open an investigation with the LBR with the aim of verifying the compliance of

the public availability of the personal data accessible via the service in

RCS line of the "www.lbr.lu" site whose manager is precisely the LBR, with the

section 2 of chapter 4 of the GDPR entitled “Security of personal data”

and this for the period from 2004 to 2019.

_____________________________________________________________

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

17. However, in view of the investigative measures carried out by him between

on April 16, 2019 and September 9, 2019, the Chief Investigator found that the LBR

would intervene only as a subcontractor of the ministry which assumes the role of

responsible for the processing covered by the investigation in question and has requested the extension of

the inquiry to the Plenary Formation.

18. The Restricted Committee notes that under Article 2 of the amended law of

19 December 2002 concerning the Trade and Companies Register (RCS) as well as

accounting and annual accounts of companies and amending certain other

legal provisions, the RCS operates under the authority of the Minister of Justice, while

the management of the RCS is entrusted to “an economic interest group, bringing together the State,

the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Trades, constituted for this purpose. »

19. Article 1 of the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 January 2003 on

execution of the law of 19 December 2002 concerning the register of commerce and

companies as well as the accounting and annual accounts of companies (hereinafter:

"modified grand-ducal regulation of 23 January 2003") provides in this context that the

management of the RCS is entrusted to the “RCSL economic interest group”.

It should be noted that by filing of March 29, 2018, the name of the grouping

of economic interest “RCSL” has been changed to “LUXEMBOURG BUSINESS

REGISTERS (abbreviated “LBR”).1

20. It also emerges from the minutes of the meeting of CNPD officials that

June 20, 2019 with the LBR that the “Ministry of Justice considers that the law as well as

the implementing regulations are specific to such an extent that the LBR is to be considered

as a mere subcontractor and does not enter into a relationship of joint responsibility with

the Ministry of Justice. »

 

                                            
1 It should be noted that Article 1 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation amending 1° the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of
January 23, 2003 implementing the law of December 19, 2002 concerning the register of commerce and
companies as well as the accounting and annual accounts of companies, approved by the Board of
government in its meeting of January 14, 2022, plans to replace the acronym "RCSL" with "
Luxembourg Business Registers”.

2. On the scope of the investigation

21. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation “takes note of the fact that the

scope of the investigation concerns the compliance of a single processing operation, namely the updating

public access to personal data accessible via the rcs.lu website. To lead

this investigation, the head of investigation focused his attention on article 32 of the GDPR,

only article relevant to the processing under investigation. Thus, the provisions of

Articles 33 and 34, relating to the data breach notification procedure and to

informing the persons concerned in the event of a violation, have not been the subject of measures

special checks. »

 

Restricted Training supports the approach of the head of investigation to limit the scope of

the investigation to the verification of the compliance of the public availability of the data

personal data accessible via the RCS online service of the "www.lbr.lu" site (former site

being www.rcs.lu) with article 32.1 and 2 of the GDPR entitled “Security of processing”.

22. It also agrees with the opinion of the head of investigation (see communication of the

objections, points 21 to 24), that as regards the principle, the making available to the public of the data

of a personal nature on the www.lbr.lu website, as part of the RCS online service, is not

not questioned. Indeed, the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 January 2003 provides

such provision, as well as the terms of said provision. Thereby,

as mentioned above, the Restricted Training will only analyze whether the security measures

put in place by the ministry as part of making available to the public the

personal data in question complied with Article 32 of the GDPR.

23. Furthermore, in this decision it will only analyze

the provision to the public of the personal data accessible via the service in

RCS line of the site www.lbr.lu and not data accessible via the same site and

concerning the Electronic Compendium of Companies and Associations (RESA), as well as the

Register of Beneficial Owners (RBE).

24. The head of investigation further specified in the statement of objections “that

the scope of the survey concerns compliance with a set of provisions of the GDPR

over the period 2014 to 2019, whereas these provisions did not come into force until

from May 25, 2018. […]”

Once again, the Restricted Panel approves the choice made by the head of investigation and does not

will take into account in this decision only the facts found by the head of the investigation

for the period after May 25, 2018.

 

II. 2. As to substance

 

1. On the breach of the obligation to guarantee the security of the processing of

personal data

 

1.1. On the principles

25. According to Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, personal data must be

“processed in a way that ensures appropriate security of personal data,

including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against the loss,

accidental destruction or damage, using technical measures or

appropriate organizational (integrity and confidentiality). »

26. Considering the state of knowledge, the costs of implementation and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risks, including

the degree of likelihood and severity varies, for the rights and freedoms of individuals

physical, the controller is bound under paragraph (1) of Article

32 of the GDPR to “implement the technical and organizational measures

appropriate in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk […].

According to Article 32.2 of the GDPR, when “assessing the appropriate level of security,

account is taken in particular of the risks presented by the processing, resulting

including the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of

personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed,

or unauthorized access to such data, accidentally or unlawfully. »

27. Furthermore, the opinion of the Article 29 Working Party on the reuse of

public sector information and open data clarifies in this context that the

“reuse of publicly available personal data is and should be

limited by:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

7/19





the general provisions of the applicable legislation with regard to the protection of

data,



(if applicable) specific additional legal restrictions, and

 technical and organizational safeguards put in place to protect the

personal data. »2

28. With respect to such specific additional legal restrictions,

Article 22 of the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 January 2003 provides that, among the

procedures for accessing data from the RCS, the "search for data can only be done

from the name of the natural person trader, the name or company name

of the legal person or through the registration number in the Register of

commerce and societies. Searching for data based on other search criteria

research for the benefit of public administrations and public establishments is subject to

the prior authorization of the Minister of Justice who specifically determines for each

public administration and for each public institution concerned the criteria from

which research can be carried out and the reasons for granting this authorization.

Public administrations and public establishments may not make such

research only within the framework of the exercise of their legal attributions. »

29. With regard to the technical and organizational safeguards put in place to

protect personal data, the opinion of the Article 29 Working Party on the

aspects of data protection related to search engines indicates that "the

website owners can choose a priori not to appear in the search engine

search or cache, using robots.txt file or tags

Noindex/NoArchive”. The opinion further clarifies that it “can be more than a solution

optional. Publishers of personal data should consider whether their database

legal authorizing the publication includes the indexing of this information by the engines

Open Data, WP207, adopted June 5, 2013, page 9.

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

8/19



research and create the necessary corresponding guarantees, in particular the use

robots.txt file and/or Noindex/NoArchive tags.” 3

1.2. In this case

30. It appears first from the report of the on-site visit of 20 June 2019

that “given that the Ministry of Justice and the LBR consider that their mission is

to make the data in the RCS public, no specific measures have been

put in place to prevent access to them – this would even have constituted a

inconsistent with their mission. » 4

By email of September 6, 2019, the LBR confirmed that no “specific measures

preventing the consultation or reuse of public information has been put

specifically in place. »

31. Secondly, with regard to risk analysis from the point of view

business, it is specified in the report of June 20, 2019 “that such an analysis has not

was carried out explicitly – the need for such an analysis would not have been identified

because registry data is public by definition. »

During the meeting of July 7, 2020, the ministry confirmed “that a risk analysis in

as such has not been carried out for the RCS. The analysis exists for the Register of

Beneficial Owners and is in progress with regard to the RCS. » 5

Nevertheless, the aforementioned minutes of June 20, 2019 mentions that in the context of the

discussions a number of measures were identified on an ad-hoc basis, such as

including connection to the LBR site through a user account to consult

the documents filed or to order a register extract, as well as the issue

extracts by the LBR on secure paper or electronically with a signature

qualified.

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

9/19



With regard specifically to access to RCS data, which was done by a

user/password due to the paying nature of the consultation, the ministry explained

during the meeting of July 7, 2020 that in the meantime “access has become free and it is

possible to access information anonymously. This anonymous access is

technically framed as follows: checking that the connection is made

by a natural person (by carrying out a simple mathematical calculation),

the acceptance of the general conditions of use of the site and the interruption of the connection

in case of inactivity for a certain period of time. » 6

32. Lastly, concerning the potential indexing of available documents

at the RCS, it was specified on May 24, 2019 by the LBR that "to avoid delays on

the RCS computer application, which could have resulted from external calls and

automated to the database, a robots.txt file preventing the indexing of

documents filed with the RCS has been set up. » 7

33. By email of September 6, 2019, the LBR confirmed that the “robot.txt file has

was put in place above all for reasons of site performance and not for

prevent any indexing of documents. Especially since this file only allows

to prohibit the indexing of documents by official search engines, which respect

this principle, but does not prevent its circumvention by a program or robot. »

34. With regard specifically to the question of indexation, the head of investigation

noted in the statement of objections of 27 May 2021 that even if file no

robots was set up to avoid overloading the network and not directly

to avoid indexing via search engines on the www.lbr.lu site, this measure

nevertheless makes it possible to limit the accessibility of information via a path other than that

intended. The investigation revealed the absence of anti-indexing configuration on the gd.lu domain

(hosting of documents from the www.lbr.lu site) over the period preceding the month of

November 2018. This means that the personal data was indexable by

search engines and therefore available without connecting to the lbr.lu site. »

                                            
6 See minutes of the meeting with the Ministry of July 7, 2020.
7 See the response to question 3.1 (page 13) of the LBR's preliminary questionnaire of May 24, 2019.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

10/19



35. The head of investigation thus came to the conclusion that, as the data

personal data made available to the public on the lbr.lu site, were only until November

2018, not protected against direct accessibility via search engines,

also allowing access to data that does not comply with the provisions of Article

22 of the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 January 2003, and as no analysis

making it possible to assess the level of security appropriate to the risks incurred in terms of

protection of personal data has not been carried out, the Ministry has failed to

its obligations under Article 32 of the GDPR (see statement of objections, point

34).

36. By letter dated June 29, 2021, the Ministry specified that a “risk analysis

relating to the provision of personal data to the public via the site

LBR internet will be immediately investigated. LBR and the CTIE are already in

relationship with a service provider to carry out this analysis and implement on the basis of this

last, the particular additional measures which would result therefrom and which would not be

not already in place. »

37. The Restricted Committee considers in this context that, as Article 22 of the

amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 January 2003 provides that the search for data

to the RCS can only be done from the name of the trader who is a natural person, the

name or business name of the legal entity or through the number

registration with the RCS, the ministry was obliged to put in place measures to

necessary security, in accordance with Article 32.1 and 2 of the GDPR, in order to avoid any

research not authorized by the aforementioned article of said Grand-Ducal regulation.

In order to know what these adequate security measures would have been, she believes that a

risk analysis to assess what would have been the appropriate level of security

and appropriate to the risk, should have been implemented by the ministry. However, even if said

ministry indicated in its letter of June 29, 2021 that such an analysis relating to the

making personal data available to the public via the LBR website

will be immediately expedited, the Restricted Panel finds that at the time of

the opening of the investigation, such an analysis was not carried out.

38. Furthermore, it notes that between May 25, 2018 and November 2018, the

personal data made available to the public on the lbr.lu website were not

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

11/19



protected against direct accessibility via search engines, allowing from

when accessing data that does not comply with the provisions of Article 22 of the Regulation

grand-ducal amended on 23 January 2003 and therefore also does not comply with the requirements of

Article 32.1 and 2. of the GDPR.

39. The Restricted Panel therefore concurs with the opinion of the head of investigation8 and concludes

that due to i) the failure to have carried out an analysis making it possible to assess the level of

security adapted to the risks incurred in terms of personal data protection

personnel by providing the personal data contained in the RCS

to the public on the website www.lbr.lu and ii) the lack of protective measures in place until

November 2018 in order to avoid the indexing of the documents in question by search engines

research, the Department breached its security obligations arising from

GDPR article 32.1 and 2.

III. On corrective measures

 

1. Principles

 

40. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

 

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

                                            
8 See statement of objections, point 34.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

12/19



d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

41. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

the state or municipalities.

 

42. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

13/19



subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

43. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the Ministry to put itself in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce.

2. In this case

44. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

inquiry to the Restricted Panel in its statement of objections of May 27, 2021:

"- Order the performance of a risk analysis relating to the updating of

public access to personal data via the lbr.lu website

in accordance with Article 32 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR;

- Order the implementation of the measures resulting from this analysis;

-  To order

the establishment of a process to assess

regularly the effectiveness of the measures taken to prevent the reuse

data by third parties for different purposes, in accordance with

Article 32 paragraph 1 (d) of the GDPR.

45. In that Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation also proposed to

the Restricted Committee "to issue a call to order against the Ministry of

justice according to which the provision of public data must comply with the legislation

applicable in terms of data protection, if the latter contain

personal data. »

46. In its response to the Statement of Objections of 29 June 2021, the Ministry

taken a position on the various grievances raised by the head of the investigation.

47. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 44 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the ministry, following the opening of the investigation, in order to

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

 

survey no. 2798 conducted with the Ministry of Justice.

 

 

 

14/19



comply with the provisions of Article 32.1 and 2 of the GDPR, as detailed in the

minutes of the meetings of June 20, 2019, July 25, 2019 and July 7, 2020, as well as

only in his letters of July 26, 2019, September 6, 2019, and June 29, 2021.

More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

 As to the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under the first indent

of point 45 of this Decision concerning the performance of an analysis of

risk relating to the public availability of personal data

via the lbr.lu site in accordance with article 32.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the ministry specified

by letter of June 29, 2021 that a “risk analysis relating to the updating

public availability of personal data via the LBR website

will be immediately processed. LBR and the CTIE are already in contact

with a service provider to carry out this analysis and implement on the basis of this

last, the particular additional measures which would result therefrom and which

would not already be in place. »

During the Restricted Training session of October 6, 2021, the ministry

reiterated that a risk analysis is underway including a legislative part,

as well as a more technical part.

Given that the said analysis was not yet closed on the date of the session

aforementioned and as the Restricted Training does not have documentation

to demonstrate that the risk analysis has meanwhile been finalized, it

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in the first indent of point 45. However,

because of the scope of the survey9, it wishes to limit the obligation to carry out

an analysis of the risks to the public availability of the data

personal data accessible via the RCS online service of the www.lbr.lu website and not

data accessible via the same site and concerning the Electronic Compendium

of companies and associations (RESA), as well as the Register of beneficiaries

headcount (RBE).

 As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under the second

indent of point 45 of this Decision concerning the implementation of the measures

that would result from this analysis, the Restricted Panel takes into account that

in its letter of June 29, 2021, the ministry indicated that the measures

particular additional factors that would result from the risk analysis relating to the implementation

public access to personal data via the website of

LBR, and which are not already in place, would be implemented.

However, as the Restricted Training does not have documentation

to demonstrate that the risk analysis has meanwhile been finalized, it

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by

the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 45, second indent of the

this decision.

As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under the third

indent of point 45 of this Decision concerning the setting up of a

process to regularly assess the effectiveness of the measures taken to

to prevent the reuse of data by third parties for different purposes,

in accordance with Article 32.1 (d) of the GDPR, the Restricted Panel considers that it

there is a need to pronounce it.

 As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under point 46 of

this decision concerning a call to order against the ministry according to

which the provision of public data must comply with the legislation

applicable in terms of data protection, if the latter contain

personal data, the Restricted Panel can only agree with

this proposition.

It takes the view that, as Article 22 of the amended Grand-Ducal Regulation of

January 23, 2003 provides that the search for data at the RCS can only be done at

from the name of the natural person trader, the denomination or reason

company of the legal person or through the registration number at the RCS,

the ministry was obliged to put in place the necessary security measures,

in accordance with Article 32.1 and 2 of the GDPR, in order to avoid any research not

authorized by the aforementioned article of said Grand-Ducal regulation.

However, between May 25, 2018 and November 2018, personal data

made available to the public on the lbr.lu website were not protected against

direct accessibility via search engines, thus allowing access

to data that does not comply with the provisions of Article 22 of the Grand-

aforesaid ducal and therefore also does not comply with the requirements of article 32.1 and 2. of the

GDPR.

The Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

corrective action proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point

46.

 Finally, under the terms of article 52 of the law of 1 August 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the

general data protection regime, “[t]he CNPD may order, at the expense

of the sanctioned person, the publication in full or in extracts of his

decisions with the exception of decisions relating to the issuance of periodic penalty payments, and under

provided that:

1° the means of appeal against the decision have been exhausted; and

2° the publication is not likely to cause disproportionate harm to the parties

in question. »

 

The Restricted Committee considers that the publication of this decision does not

not likely to cause disproportionate harm to the department, but that it is

justified with regard to the public interest in knowing the results of the investigation of the

CNPD on the compliance of the public availability of data

personal data accessible via the RCS online service of the “www.lbr.lu” site with

GDPR Article 32. Indeed, the personal data of a number

large number of natural persons are concerned by this provision.
