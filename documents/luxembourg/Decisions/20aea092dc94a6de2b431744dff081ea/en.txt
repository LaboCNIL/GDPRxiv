Restricted assumes that this CCTV system is operated by the controlled

as controller.

9. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 3

February 2020 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically non-compliance with the provisions of Article

5.1.c) of the GDPR and non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR.

10. On February 28, 2020, the auditee produced written observations on the

statement of objections.

11. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

checked on August 10, 2020. In this letter, the head of investigation proposed to the

Restricted Formation to adopt two different corrective measures, as well as to inflict

to the controlled an administrative fine of 1,900 EUR.

12. By letter of August 25, 2020, the controller produced written observations on the

supplementary letter to the statement of objections.

13. The president of the Restricted Formation informed the controller by letter of 16

October 2020 that his case would be registered for the Restricted Panel session of 27

November 2020. The controller confirmed his presence at the said meeting dated 13

November 2020.

1. On the principles

In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data must

be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

The principle of data minimization in video surveillance involves

that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve the target(s) should be filmed

purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.13

Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

Before the installation of a video surveillance system, the data controller

must define, precisely, the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by resorting to

such a system, and may not subsequently use the personal data

collected for other purposes.14

The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis

and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.15

2. In this case

15. As for the [S2] site, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes

of the implementation of the video surveillance system are the protection of the property of

the company, securing access and preventing accidents.

16. When investigating the site of [S2] and watching the control monitors

to which the images captured by the cameras installed on the production sites are transmitted.

[…], the CNPD agents noted that

i) on the site of [S3], the fields of view of several cameras

include parts of the public thoroughfare and surrounding land16; and

ii) on the site of [S4], the field of view of a camera includes parts

public road and neighboring land.

17. The head of the investigation was of the opinion that “(…) surveillance of public roads and

of neighboring land is, however, to be considered disproportionate. Indeed, at

given the aforementioned purposes for which video surveillance is operated, it is not

necessary to include parts of the public road or neighboring land in the

fields of view of the cameras listed under points A.1. and A.2. of this. »

(statement of objections, Ad. A.1. and Ad. A.2.)

18. The auditee for his part explained that the main purposes of the

video surveillance were the prevention of accidents (for their staff and for

external persons) and the protection […]. Furthermore, the auditee explained that the

visualization of a restricted space around the fence was necessary to be able to act

in a preventive and non-curative way and that the detection of movements upstream of the

closure allowed, on the one hand, the triggering of systems […] which aimed to

dissuade the authors of intrusion attempts and, on the other hand, an intervention on site

faster. Nevertheless, the person inspected claimed to have adapted the fields of vision of the

disputed cameras on the site of [S3] and also of the disputed camera on the site of

[S4] by blurring parts of the public road and surrounding land18.

19. The Restricted Committee finds that the annexes to the mail from the control of the

February 28, 2020 contain photos of the fields of view of the disputed cameras which

show that nearby public roads and/or land are now blurred.

20. In his letter of August 25, 2020, the controlled person again emphasized that he had

already corrected the fields of view of the disputed cameras after receipt of the

statement of objections and that he had ensured, during a review of all the

cameras installed, that these cameras do not film public roads.

21. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor

a place or the surroundings of a building or site must have a limited field of vision

on the surface strictly necessary to visualize the people preparing to access it.

Cameras installed near or around a building must be configured accordingly.

so as not to capture the public road, nor the surroundings, entrances, accesses and interiors of other

neighboring buildings possibly falling within their field of vision. In terms of

configuration of the premises, it is sometimes impossible to install a camera that does not

would not include in his field of vision a part of the public road, surroundings,

entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In such a case, the CNPD considers that the

controller must implement techniques for masking or

blurring to limit the field of view to its property.19

22. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the finding of Chief

of investigation20 according to which the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

B. On the breach linked to the principle of limitation of storage

 

1. On the principles

23. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […]”.

24. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. ".

2. In this case

25. As for the administrative headquarters of [S1], it was explained to CNPD officials

during the on-site investigation that the CCTV system is operated by Company B in

as a subcontractor on behalf of the controller who is to be considered responsible

of treatment21. It was confirmed that the purposes of setting up the system of

video surveillance are the protection of company assets and the securing of access22.

26. With regard to the retention period of the images recorded by the

CCTV cameras, it appears from the findings of CNPD agents that the

oldest data dated from June 28, 2019, i.e. the duration of

data retention was three months.23

27. According to the head of the investigation, the said retention period for the data of

video surveillance of three months exceeded that which was necessary to carry out the

aforementioned purposes and for which the video surveillance device had been put in place.

square. For this reason, the head of investigation was of the opinion that a non-compliance with the prescribed

of article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit (see communication

grievances, Ad.A.3.). Therefore, he proposed to the Restricted Panel to order the controlled

to implement a retention period policy for personal data

personnel in accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, in particular by not keeping the

images from the video stream for a duration exceeding one week.24

28. By letter dated February 28, 2020, the inspector specified that after verification with

its subcontractor, the latter had found a programming error in the system

video surveillance as being

the source of the problem erasing the

recordings. The controller confirmed that his subcontractor had, as a result,

rescheduled the retention period to a maximum of 30 days and that, henceforth, the

30-day old recordings will be deleted automatically25.

29. By letter dated August 25, 2020, the controller explained that the ABCD group had

set the retention period for video recordings for all its entities to 30

days this to protect people and property from any incident that would cause

damages, but also to preserve the evidence necessary for an action in

justice. In addition, the control indicated that the reporting of offenses required a certain

time and that the time for opening an investigation was well over a week in

the majority of cases. In addition, as part of the legitimate interest of the ABCD group to protect

property, acts of vandalism were not always detected immediately, but

during […] or a control of the buildings which take place periodically. Thus, the delay of a

week did not allow the controller to be able to gather the evidence

essential to a claim for compensation. The auditee also considered that, in

In practice, the access procedures put in place ensured that the recordings

would not be used for purposes other than those declared, so that a period of

retention of 30 days was a necessary period to fulfill the aforementioned purposes.

30. During the Restricted Panel hearing of November 27, 2020, Chief

survey explained again that the one-week shelf life is

referred only to the administrative headquarters of [S1] where the auditee's offices are located,

because he considered that for the offices of the controlled a retention period of 30

days would not be justified, unlike the sites […]. The controller reiterated his remarks

contained in its letter of August 25, 2020, insisting that a retention period

images from CCTV cameras a week ago would not be

sufficient, but that a shelf life of 30 days would be more realistic, especially for

which are security issues.

31. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period

appropriate and necessary to achieve that purpose. As mentioned above, the controlled

considers that a 30-day retention period is necessary in order to achieve the

purposes pursued, i.e. protecting controlled assets and securing access to

its premises.

32. With regard to video surveillance, the CNPD considers that the images can

be kept in principle for up to 8 days under the aforementioned principle of Article

5.1.e) GDPR. The data controller may exceptionally, for reasons

duly justified, keep the images for a period of 30 days. A duration of

storage longer than 30 days is generally considered to be

disproportionate.26

33. In the event of an incident or violation, the Restricted Panel is of the opinion that the

images may be kept beyond this period and, if necessary, be

communicated to the competent judicial authorities and law enforcement authorities

competent to establish or prosecute criminal offences.

34. While the Restricted Formation may understand the need for controlled

to keep the images from video surveillance for 30 days, it notes

however, during the on-site visit by CNPD officials, the duration was three

months, which greatly exceeded the time necessary to achieve the objectives

continued.

35. Based on all of these elements, the Restricted Panel concludes that at

the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was not

not respected by the controller.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

1. Principles

36. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

11/18

 

 

 

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

37. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

38. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to

sections 25 and 32;

 

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

12/18



g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

39. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

40. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce.

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

13/18

 

 

 

41. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 10 August

2020, the head of investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative to the control of an amount of 1,900 euros.

42. In its response to said additional letter of August 10, 2020, the audited

maintained in particular that he had quickly carried out all the corrective measures

recommended subject to the retention period of 30 days and that he misunderstood

why he would be liable to an administrative fine.

43. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation notes that with regard to breaches of Articles

5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR, they constitute breaches of the principles

fundamentals of the GDPR (and data protection law in general), to

know the principles of data minimization and the limitation of the

data retention set out in Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent on them, even if the obligations to respect the

principles of conservation minimization and limitation already existed in

application of articles 4.1. b) and d) of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

personal.

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation finds that

o with respect to the breach of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR in relation to

at the sites of [S3] and [S4], are concerned, on the one hand, passers-by using

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with “Company A”

 

 

 

14/18

public roads, and on the other hand the owners of the land

neighbours;

o with respect to the breach of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR in relation to

at the administrative headquarters of [S1], all employees working

at the administrative headquarters, as well as all third parties, i.e.

customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors visiting

said site.

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

44. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

45. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

September 27, 2019.

46. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breaches of articles 5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR.

47. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that breaches of

article 5 of the RGPD are reproached to the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine being able

to be retained amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the worldwide annual turnover, the

the highest amount being retained.

48. In view of the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of 1,900 euros appears

both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83.1

of the GDPR.

2.2. About taking corrective action

49. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

of investigation to

the Restricted Training in its additional letter to

the

statement of objections:

“a) Order the controller to process only personal data

relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of

protection of property and securing access and, in particular, adapting the

video device so as not to film the public road, for example by "blacking out"

partially the cameras named " […] ", " […] ", " […] " and " […] " installed

on the site of [S3] and the camera called " […] " installed on the site of [S4].

 

b) Order the data controller to implement a privacy policy

retention period of personal data in accordance with the

provisions of e) of Article 5 of the GDPR, not exceeding the duration necessary for the

purposes for which they are collected, and in particular by not keeping

images from the video stream for a period exceeding one week. »

50. The Restricted Training takes into account the steps taken by the

checked, following a visit by CNPD officials, in order to comply with the provisions

Articles 5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR, as detailed in his letters of February 28, 2020

and August 25, 2020. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts, which have been

_____________________________________________________________

confirmed by the controller during the Restricted Training session of November 27

2020:

- As to the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary for the purposes indicated in accordance with the

provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, the controller has adapted the

video surveillance so that the public road and surrounding land are no longer

filmed, in particular by blurring parts of the public road and land

neighbours. The annexes to the audit letter of February 28, 2020 contain

photos showing the blurring of the areas in question.

- As for the establishment of a retention period policy for data to be

personal character in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, the

controlled adapted, after the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the duration of

retention of data from the video surveillance system from 3 months to 30

days. The annexes to the letter of February 28, 2020 from the auditee contain a

photo showing that the CCTV system settings have been

modified in the sense that the retention period has been limited to 30 days.

51. In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case, the Restricted Panel considers that there is no need to pronounce measures

corrections to it.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to pronounce against the company "Company A" an administrative fine of one

amount of one thousand nine hundred euros (1,900 euros), with regard to the violation of articles

5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR.

 

 

Thus decided in Belvaux on May 12, 2021.
