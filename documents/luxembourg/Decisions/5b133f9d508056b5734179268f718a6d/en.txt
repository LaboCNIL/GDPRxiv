I. Facts and procedure

 

1. During its deliberation session on 16 January 2019, the National Commission

for data protection sitting in plenary session (hereafter: “Formation

Plenary”) had decided to open an investigation with the municipal administration of

[…] (hereinafter: “the controlled”) on the basis of article 37 of the law of August 1, 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the regime

General on Data Protection (hereinafter "Law of 1 August 2018") and to appoint

Mr. Christophe Buschmann as head of investigation.

 

2. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation carried out by the

National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter: "CNPD") had as

purpose of verifying compliance with the provisions of the regulations relating to the protection of

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and to the

free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”)

and the law of August 1, 2018, in particular by setting up systems for

video surveillance and geolocation if necessary installed by the controlled.

3. On January 24, 2019, CNPD agents carried out a visit to the

the premises of the control at the following address: [...]1 The decision of the National Commission

for data protection sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation

(hereinafter: “Restricted Training”) will be limited to processing controlled by the agents

of the CNPD.

4. During the said visit, the representatives of the audit2 confirmed to the agents of the

CNPD that a geolocation system is installed in […] vehicles fitted with a

device for clearing snow or salting the road, but that the controller does not use

a CCTV system.3

5. According to the explanations provided to CNPD officials, the persons concerned

by geolocation are the members of the municipal staff (employees and civil servants

councils) having expressed their wish to take part in the winter service.

6. In addition, the CNPD agents noted that the software of the device of

geolocation of the controlled is hosted online by the supplier "[...]", specializing in

cleaning and snow removal and that said supplier is to be considered as

processor within the meaning of Article 4, point 8 of the GDPR.

7. In his response letter of February 14, 2019 to the minutes drawn up by the

CNPD agents, the controller specified that the data collected by the boxes of the

geolocation device are not transmitted to the servers of the provider of the

program via wifi connection ([…]), but using mobile phone cards.

 

8. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 8

August 2019 a statement of objections detailing the failure he considered constituted

in this case, and more specifically non-compliance with the requirements prescribed by Article

13 of the GDPR with regard to employees.

 

9. On September 17, 2019, the auditee produced written observations on the

statement of objections.

 

10. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

checked on August 3, 2020. In this letter, the head of investigation proposed to the

Restricted formation to adopt two different corrective measures.

 

11. By letter dated August 24, 2020, the auditee produced written observations on

the additional letter to the statement of objections.

October 2020 that his case would be registered for the session of the Restricted Panel on 17

November 2020. The controller confirmed his presence at the said meeting dated 3

November 2020.

 

13. During the Restricted Training session of November 17, 2020, the leader

of investigation and control presented their oral observations in support of their

written observations and answered the questions posed by the Restricted Panel. The

president consented to the control's request to be able to send to the Formation

Restricted additional photos from the geolocation system and to provide by

writes the necessary explanations within a week. The controller had the floor

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

 

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

5/13



b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

right to data portability;

 

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

 

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

6/13

 

 

 

 

17. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.4 Said obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

 

18. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, such as the aforementioned guidelines on transparency5.

 

2. In this case

 

19. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation referred to a letter from

February 14, 2019 of the audit, in which the latter attached a document entitled "[...]

". In the said letter, the controller also specified that "everything is done to

also transmit the information in writing to the agents concerned. Thus, a

personalized information letter for the attention of the agents making up the teams of the

winter service has been prepared […]”.

 

20. Nevertheless, the head of investigation found that the non-compliance with article 13 of the

GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit, because the documentation submitted to it by the

aforementioned letter did not contain any evidence against this non-compliance with this

precise date. The head of the investigation added that "the observation that the employees had been

informed orally, without however presenting evidence in support of this

claim, is not likely to irritate this observation. (see statement of objections,

page 2, Ad.A.1.).

                                            
4 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

21. In his letter of August 24, 2020, the auditee on his side referred to his

remarks contained in his letter of September 17, 2019 which already mentioned the

steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR. The control stated that

in accordance with Article L-261-1 of the Labor Code, collective information relating to the

implementation of the geolocation system for civil servant delegations and

municipal employees, as well as employees took place by letter dated August 13, 2019, from a

part, and that all the agents concerned would be informed individually before the 1st

November 2019, on the other hand. Furthermore, the controller specified that the information also

been placed on the intranet site of […] and that the instruction was given to the services to display

information in the premises of the services concerned. Copies of information notices

intended for the delegations, as well as for the employees were annexed to the letter of 17

September 2019.

22. In addition, the controller explained in the aforementioned letter of September 17, 2019

that on this date the number of intervention vehicles equipped with a

geolocation amounted in all to […]6 and that for November 1, 2019, vignettes

signs would be installed in the said vehicles with the following content: "...

to inform you that this vehicle is equipped with a geolocation system.

For more information, you can inquire at the following address: ... »

23. Finally, during the Restricted Training session of November 17, 2020,

as well as in his email of November 18, 2020, the control confirmed that

the information notice communicated to the CNPD by the aforementioned letter of 19 September

2019 has been forwarded and individually countersigned by all service agents

winter of [...].

24. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

                                            
6 […] vehicles in the Hygiene department and […] vehicles in the Roads department.

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01, paragraph 33).

25. Furthermore, it would like to point out that Article 12 of the GDPR does not de facto exclude

that the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 may be provided orally by the

controller to the data subject. On the other hand, the WP260 rev. 01

(paragraph 21) insists that in this case, the data controller should take care “to

keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it (for the purposes of the

compliance with the responsibility requirement), of: i) requesting information orally,

(ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified (if

applicable, see point 20 above), and (iii) the fact that the information was transmitted to

the person concerned. »

26. During the on-site visit by CNPD officials, the controller precisely

mentioned that the persons concerned were only informed orally about the

presence of the geolocation device in the vehicles in question as part of the

work instructions provided.

 

27. Nevertheless,

the Restricted Panel finds that no documentation

submitted by the auditee does not contain proof that the employees of the auditee have

been duly informed, before the on-site visit by CNPD agents, orally

in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

28. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

control.

II. 2. On corrective measures

 

1. Principles

 

29. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with the municipal administration of […]

 

9/13

 

 

 

 

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with the municipal administration of […]

 

10/13

 

 

 

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

30. These measures also include the power to “impose a fine

administrative procedure pursuant to Article 83 […]”. However, article 48.1 of the law of 1 August

2018 on the organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and

of the general data protection regime specifies that “[t]he CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the [GDPR], except against

of the state or the municipalities. ".

31. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee would like to point out that the facts taken into account

in the context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The

any changes relating to the processing of data under investigation

occurred subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish entirely or

partial compliance, do not allow a breach to be reversed retroactively

found.

 

32. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce.

 

2. In this case

 

33. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

investigation to the Restricted Training in its additional letter to the communication

grievances of August 3, 2020:

“a) Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for persons concerned by geolocation, in accordance with the

provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by providing

in particular the identity of the controller, the purposes of the processing and its

legal basis, the categories of data processed, the legitimate interests pursued

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no. […] conducted with the municipal administration of […]

 

11/13

 

 

 

 

by the controller, the recipients, the retention period of the data as well as

the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of exercising them.

 

b) To issue a call to order against the data controller for

cause of violation of the provisions of the GDPR. »

34. The Restricted Training takes into account the steps taken by the

checked, following a visit by CNPD officials, in order to comply with the provisions of

Article 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in his letter of August 24, 2020. More

in particular, it takes note of the following facts, which have been confirmed by the audited

during the Restricted Training session of November 17, 2020, as well as in its

email of November 18, 2020:

 The information notice on the geolocation of intervention vehicles,

communicated to the CNPD by letter dated September 19, 2019, was transmitted and

countersigned individually by all the agents of the Hygiene Service and the

Roads Department providing winter service to [...].

 Identification stickers have been installed in the intervention vehicles

with the following content: “… would like to inform you that this vehicle is

equipped with a geolocation system. For more information, you

you can inquire at the following address: ... »

35. Under Article 58.2.b) of the GDPR, the CNPD may call to order a

controller or a processor when the processing operations have

resulted in a violation of the provisions of the GDPR.

36. Given the fact that at the time of the site visit by CNPD officials,

no documentation submitted by the auditee contained evidence that the

employees of the audit have been validly informed in violation of article 13 of the GDPR, the

Restricted Formation considers that it is justified to issue a call to order to

against the control.
