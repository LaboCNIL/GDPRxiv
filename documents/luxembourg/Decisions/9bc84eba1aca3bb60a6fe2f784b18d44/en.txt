I. Facts and procedure

1. During its deliberation session of February 14, 2019, the National Commission

for data protection sitting in plenary session (hereafter: “Formation

Plenary”) had decided to open an investigation with Company A on the basis of Article

37 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the

data protection and the general data protection regime (hereinafter “Law

of August 1, 2018”) and to appoint Mr. Christophe Buschmann as Chief

of investigation.

2. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation carried out by the

National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter: “CNPD”) had as its

purpose of verifying compliance with the provisions of the regulations relating to the protection of

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and to the

free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”)

and the law of August 1, 2018, in particular by setting up systems for

video surveillance and geolocation, if applicable, installed by Company A.

3. On March 7, 2019, CNPD officials visited the

company premises Company A. The decision of the National Commission for the Protection

data sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter:

“Restricted Training”) will be limited to processing controlled by CNPD agents

and carried out by Company A.

4. Company A is a […] registered in the Trade and Companies Register of

Luxembourg under number […] and having its registered office at number […] (hereinafter “the

control "). The controlled [is active in the tertiary industry]. 1

5. During the above-mentioned visit of 7 March 2019 by CNPD agents to the

controlled premises, it was confirmed to CNPD officials that the controlled uses a

video surveillance system consisting of twenty-two cameras and that he installed a

geolocation device in […] company intervention vehicles.2

6. By email of April 25, 2019, the controller replied to the report drawn up by

CNPD officers.

7. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 7

November 2019 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically a non-compliance with the requirements prescribed

by article 13 of the GDPR with regard to the information of all persons

concerned with regard to the video surveillance system and with regard to the information of

employees with regard to the geolocation system, non-compliance with the requirements of article

5.1.c) of the GDPR with regard to the video surveillance system, as well as a non-

compliance with the requirements of articles 5.1.e) and 32.1 of the GDPR with regard to the

geolocation system.

8. On December 3, 2019, the auditee produced written observations on the

statement of objections.

 

9. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

checked on August 17, 2020. In this letter, the head of investigation offered the

Restricted Formation to adopt two different corrective measures, as well as to inflict

to the controlled an administrative fine of 7,200 euros.

 

10. By letter dated September 4, 2020, the controller produced written observations

on the supplementary letter to the statement of objections.

 

11. The president of the Restricted Formation informed the controller by letter of 19

January 2021 that his case would be registered for the session of the Restricted Panel on 26

February 2021. The controller confirmed his presence at the said meeting dated January 28

2021.

12. During the Restricted Training session of February 26, 2021, the leader

of investigation and control presented their oral observations in support of their

written observations and answered the questions posed by the Restricted Panel. The

president consented to the control's request to be able to send to the Formation

Restricted photos of the display currently in place on its site in terms of

video surveillance and to provide the necessary explanations in writing within a

week. The controller spoke last.

II. Place

 

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

 

II.1.1. About the CCTV system

 

A. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

13. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

14. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.3

15. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

16. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal information collected for other purposes.4

17. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.5

2. In this case

18. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the

purposes of setting up the video surveillance system are the protection of property,

securing access to private places, as well as the safety of users and the

accident prevention.6

19. During the said visit, the CNPD agents noted that the field of vision

of the "camera called "[...]" allows permanent monitoring of the workstation

of the person busy at the reception" and that the field of vision of the "camera

called "[...]" allows the monitoring of the staff entry area. In this

area is also fitted out the smoking area. Employees taking their break are therefore

permanently monitored there. » 7

20. The head of investigation was of the opinion that even if the aforementioned purposes “may

find one or more bases of lawfulness under article 6, permanent monitoring

employees at their workplace (welcome area) and during their break (smoking area)

is to be considered disproportionate. (statement of objections, Ad. A.2. and A.3.).

21. The controlled on his side explained in his response email to the lawsuit-

report of April 25, 2019 that the camera called "[...]" was oriented in such a way as to

no longer have a view of the counter and that while waiting for the implementation of new

surveillance cameras, the smoking area has been moved a few meters outside

of the field of view of the camera called "[...]". By noting the will of the controller to

remedy the problem in question in order to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, the

head of investigation therefore concluded that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was

acquired on the day of the site visit.

22. La Formation Restreinte would like to remind you that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach

the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. On the other hand, respecting

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

23. When it comes to places reserved for employees in the workplace for a

private use, such as a canteen where employees can meet around

of a meal, surveillance cameras are in principle considered as

disproportionate to the aims sought. The same goes for

places such as, for example, changing rooms, toilets, smoking areas,

rest, the kitchenette or any other place reserved for employees for private use. In

In these cases, the fundamental rights and freedoms of employees must prevail over the interests

lawsuits pursued by the employer.

24. In his letter of December 3, 2019, the controller specified that for

technical reasons, it was impossible for him to move the workstation to Reception which is

was in the field of vision of the surveillance camera, but that he chose the option

mask the camera's field of vision so that the workstations at

Home are no longer visible. In addition, the controlled reiterated the content of his email

of April 25, 2019 that the smoking area has been moved a few meters out of the field

vision of the camera called "[...]". He attached to the said letter photos attesting to the

aforesaid remarks.8

25. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the finding9 of Chief

of investigation according to which the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day

the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

26. According to paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the GDPR, the “controller

take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14

as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article

34 with regard to the treatment to the data subject in a concise manner,

transparent, understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

27. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

 

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

 

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

 

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data;

 

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

 

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

 

28. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.10 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

 

29. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.11

2. In this case

30. With regard to the information of customers, suppliers, service providers

services and visitors (hereinafter: "third parties") regarding the system of

video surveillance, the CNPD agents noted during their visit to the site that they

are informed by a panel consisting of a pictogram representing a video-

camera and the mention “Establishment under video surveillance”, as well as by a

old CNPD sticker displayed at the company's main entrance. Furthermore, the

chief of investigation considered that the additional photos attached to the email of the controlled

of April 25, 2019 show a poster identical to that referenced by the agents of the

CNPD during their on-site visit and that therefore the latter was still not of a nature

to fulfill the conditions of Article 13 of the GDPR.

31. With regard to informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the head of investigation found that they were informed by the same

panel consisting of a pictogram representing a video camera and a statement

"Establishment under video surveillance", as well as by an old thumbnail of the

CNPD. In addition, the head of investigation notes that an ethics charter has been put in place.

place in 2016 by the auditee and that the latter is trying to demonstrate its desire to

comply with the regulations by invoking the provisions of the said charter. However,

the head of the investigation considered that while "that the said charter includes some of the mentions

provided for in the aforementioned article 13, it must be noted that its article 11 entitled "processing

personal data” deals with all data processed by the company,

all the legal bases applicable to all of the different processing operations carried out by

the company and all the purposes invoked for this processing, without

differentiate by targeted treatment. This information is therefore provided by

diffuse manner and do not respect the principle of transparency to which each

controller. According to this principle, the information addressed to the person

concerned must be concise and easily understandable. Note also that

said charter includes information in direct opposition to the findings made

during the site visit. Indeed, the charter informs employees that the images from

CCTV are backed up for 2 weeks before they are deleted, so

that the observed storage period is 22 days. (statement of objections, Ad.

A.1.).

_____________________________________________________________

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

10/30

32. For the above reasons, the head of investigation considered that the conditions of

article 13 of the RGPD have not been respected and that it is necessary to retain against the

checked for non-compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

the persons concerned (statement of objections, Ad.A.1).

33. By email of April 25, 2019, the controller clarified that points 9 and 10 of the

report of the joint committee of […] 2013 would be proof of the information to the

CCTV installation staff representatives.

34. By letter dated December 3, 2019, the auditee responded to the communication from the

grievances of the chief of investigation by specifying that the old posters were removed and

replaced by a new poster.12 Furthermore, following the hearing of the Panel

Restricted from February 26, 2021, the controlled emailed a new poster that he

plans to put in place and which would seem to him more complete and compliant, but that he

would await the return of the Restricted Formation before implementation and modifications

possible.13

35. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

36. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by a panel composed of a pictogram representing a video-

camera and the mention “Establishment under video surveillance”, as well as by a

old stamp of the CNPD.

                                            
12 See Annex 1 of the audit letter of December 3, 2019.
13 See audit email of February 26, 2021 and its appendix.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

11/30

37. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the panel, the pictogram and

the old CNPD sticker did not contain the information required within the meaning of

article 13 of the GDPR and no other information notice was available during the visit

on site, to third parties.

38. With regard to the employees, the Restricted Training noted that during the visit

on site by CNPD agents, they were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by the panel, the pictogram and the old CNPD sticker

as mentioned above, as well as by a part entitled “Processing of personal data

personnel” contained in the ethical charter dated […] 2016.

39. The Restricted Committee considers first of all that a report by the joint committee

on the information of staff representatives does not ensure that the employees of the

company have been validly informed in accordance with article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.

40. The Restricted Committee also considers that a multi-level approach

to communicate transparency information to data subjects may

be used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a

real environment such as personal data collected

through a CCTV system. The first level of information should

generally include the most essential information, namely the details of the

purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of

data subjects, as well as the information having the greatest impact on the

processing or any processing that may surprise data subjects.14 The

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties.15

41. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the panel, the pictogram and

the old CNPD sticker in place during the on-site visit did not contain the

                                            
14 See WP 260 rev.01 and EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data
by video devices, version 2.0, adopted on January 29, 2020.

12/30

required elements of the first level of information whether for employees or

non-salaried third parties.

42. With regard to the part entitled “Processing of personal data

staff” contained in the ethics charter, Restricted Training agrees with the observation

of the head of investigation that said part of the ethics charter includes some of the

mentions provided for in the aforementioned article 13, but that it concerns all the data processed

by the company, all the legal bases applicable to all the different

processing carried out by the company and all the purposes invoked for this processing,

without making a differentiation by targeted treatment. This information does not

therefore do not comply with the principle of transparency to which each manager is bound

of the treatment. According to this principle, the information must be addressed to the person

concerned "in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner,

clear and simple terms”.16 Moreover, as the head of the investigation noted, the said

charter includes information in direct opposition to the findings made during

of the site visit. Indeed, the charter informs the employees that the images resulting from the

video surveillance are saved for two weeks before they are deleted,

while the retention period noted by CNPD officials was 21 days17

and that the control even specified in his email of April 25, 2019 that the duration of

Retention of CCTV images has been set at eight days.

43. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

control.

1. On the principles

44. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […]”.

45. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. »

2. In this case

46. During the on-site investigation, it was explained to CNPD officers that the

purposes of geolocation are as follows: “geographic location, management

optimization of the fleet as well as the response to customer complaints. »18

47. With regard to the retention period of data from the device

of geolocation, it appears from the observations of the CNPD agents that the most

old data was dated July 18, 2018, i.e. the retention period

of data was 246 days, or more or less 8 months.19

48. According to the head of the investigation, the said retention period for the data of

geolocation of 8 months exceeded that which was necessary for the achievement of the purposes

mentioned above and for which the geolocation system had been put in place. For

14/30

For this reason, he was of the opinion that a non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR

was upheld (see statement of objections, Ad.A.5).

49. By letter dated December 3, 2019, the inspector informed the head of investigation of his

decision to stop the processing of personal data carried out by the system of

geolocation installed in its service cars and that negotiations to stop

the contract with the provider would be in progress and that the latter will definitively end

on January 1, 2020.

50. During the hearing of the Restricted Panel on February 26, 2021, the controlled

clarified that he considers that a retention period of 6 months was justified, among other things,

by the fact that sometimes customers dispute invoices and in this case, the data

from geolocation would have been checked.

51. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period

appropriate and necessary to achieve that purpose. Thus, as the system of

geolocation set up by the control has several purposes, the durations of

conservation are to be individualized for each specific purpose.

52. As mentioned above, during the hearing of the Restricted Panel, the controlled

clarified that the geolocation data also have the purpose of verifying the

invoicing customers for services provided by its employees.

53. With regard to the geolocation of employee vehicles, the Training

Restricted considers that

personal data obtained by

the

geolocation can in principle only be kept for a period

maximum of two months under the aforementioned principle of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR.

However, it considers that if said data is used by the person responsible for the

processing for the purposes of proof for the invoicing of the services carried out for its

customers, the data necessary for such invoicing may be kept for a

duration of one year, provided that it is not possible to provide proof of the services

by other means.20

54. In the event of an incident, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the data may

be kept beyond the time limits mentioned above in the context of the transmission of

given to competent judicial authorities and competent law enforcement authorities

to ascertain or prosecute criminal offences.

55. She would also like to point out that the data obtained by geolocation

may also be kept beyond the aforementioned durations, if these have

been previously made anonymous, i.e. it is no longer possible to make a link

– direct or indirect – between this data and a specific employee.

56. The Restricted Panel notes that the CNPD officials observed during the

their on-site visit of March 9, 2019 that at that time, the retention period of the

data from the geolocation system was 8 months, while according to the charter

Ethics of Control and Claims of Control During the Training Hearing

Restricted from February 26, 2021, the duration would have been set at 6 months.

57. Considering that the audit ethics charter indicated that the data to be

personal character obtained by geolocation are kept for 6 months,21

but that it appears from the findings of CNPD officials that the retention period

data from geolocation was 8 months22, the Restricted Panel concludes

that Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR has been violated by the controlled.

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

58. With regard to the principles to be observed with regard to the obligation to inform

the persons concerned in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

refers to points 26 to 29 of this decision.

2. In this case

59. With regard to informing employees about the system of

geolocation, the head of the investigation considered that the information contained in the

document entitled "provision of service vehicle", provided in appendix 3 of the

email of the control of April 25, 2019, as well as the mentions relating to the geolocation

contained in the “ethical charter” were not sufficient with regard to the prescriptions of

GDPR Article 13. Therefore, he considered that non-compliance with Article 13 of the GDPR

was acquired on the day of the site visit.

60. By letter dated April 25, 2019, the inspector specified that points 9 and 10 of the

report of the joint committee of […] 2013 would be proof of the information to the

staff representatives for the implementation of the geolocation system.

61. By letter dated December 3, 2019, the controller responded to the communication from

grievances of the head of investigation by informing him of his decision to stop the data processing

of a personal nature operated by the geolocation system installed in its cars

of service and that negotiations to end the contract with the provider would be in progress.

course and that the latter will definitively end on January 1, 2020.

62. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

17/30

63. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, employees were informed of the implementation of the geolocation system

by the document entitled "provision of service vehicle", provided in appendix 3

of the email of the audit of April 25, 2019, as well as by the mentions relating to the

geolocation contained in the ethical charter.

64. The Restricted Committee considers first of all that a report by the joint committee

on the information of staff representatives does not ensure that the employees of the

company have been duly informed in accordance with Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.

65. The Restricted Committee subsequently considers that a multi-level approach

to communicate transparency information to data subjects may

be used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a

real environment such as personal data collected

using a geolocation system. The first level of information should

generally include the most essential information, namely the details of the

purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of

data subjects, as well as the information having the greatest impact on the

processing or any processing that may surprise data subjects.23 The

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, may be provided or made available by other

means, such as a copy of the privacy policy sent by

e-mail to employees or a link on the website to an information notice for what

concerns non-salaried third parties.24

66. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the document entitled “update

service vehicle layout" did not contain the required elements of the first

level of information and that the part entitled “Processing of personal data

staff” contained in the ethics charter did not contain all of the elements

required by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.

                                            
23 See WP 260 rev.01 and EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data
by video devices, version 2.0, adopted on January 29, 2020.

18/30

67. With reference to point 41 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

considers that even if the said part of the ethical charter includes some of the mentions

provided for in the aforementioned article 13, it concerns all the data processed by the company,

all the legal bases applicable to all of the different processing operations carried out by

the company and all the purposes invoked for this processing, without

differentiate by targeted treatment. This information therefore does not respect

not the principle of transparency to which each data controller is bound. According

this principle, the information must be sent to the data subject "in a manner

concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible, in clear and

simple”.25

68. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the

control.

C. On the breach of the obligation to guarantee appropriate security

 

1. On the principles

69. Pursuant to Article 32.1 of the GDPR and “taking into account the state of knowledge,

the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the

treatment as well as risks, the degree of likelihood and severity of which vary, for the

rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor

implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to

guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk including, among other things, as required:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

 

b) the means to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

ongoing resilience of processing systems and services;

 

c) means to restore the availability of personal data

and access to them within appropriate timeframes in the event of a physical or technical incident;

                                            
25 See Article 12.1 of the GDPR.

(d) a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of

technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. »

 

2. In this case

70. The head of investigation examined the aspect related to the security of access to data

listed in the geolocation system. As access to the operating software of the

geolocation device was only secured by means of an identification

unique, i.e. a unique user name and password, which is used by

all persons authorized to access said software, he held against the controlled

non-compliance with the measures prescribed by

GDPR Article 32.1 (see

statement of objections, Ad.A.6).

71. The controlled clarified during the hearing of the Restricted Panel of February 26

2021 that even if access to the GPS software was only protected by an identifier

unique, the need to badger to enter the software room should be considered

as an additional check.

72. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that on the day of the visit by the

CNPD agents in the premises of the control, the policies for access to the software of

geolocation did not meet the minimum necessary requirements in terms of

security, i.e. having in place individual accounts by means of an identifier and

a password for persons authorized to access it within the framework of

the accomplishment of their missions.

73. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that Article 32.1 of the

GDPR has not been respected by the controller.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

1. Principles

 

74. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

20/30

 

 

 

 

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

21/30

 

 

 

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

75. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

 

76. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

 

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

 

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

 

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

22/30

 

 

 

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

 

77. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

 

78. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce.

 

2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

 

79. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 17 August

2020, the head of investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative audit relating to the amount of 7,200 euros.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

23/30

80. In his response to said additional letter of September 7, 2020, the

controlled asked the Restricted Formation to disregard a fine

administrative action against him, if not to revise the proposed fine to a lower amount,

whereas the amount proposed would seem to him disproportionate in view of the efforts and means

deployed to comply with the GDPR, and the responsiveness with which the

points raised during the investigation conducted by the CNPD would have been corrected.

81. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation notes that with regard to breaches of Articles

5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR, they constitute breaches of the principles

fundamentals of the GDPR (and data protection law in general), to

know the principles of data minimization and the limitation of the

conservation devoted to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

 

As to the failure to have in place the minimum requirements necessary for

terms of security in accordance with Article 32.1 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

considers that, faced with the risks represented by data breaches at

personal nature, the European legislator intended to strengthen the obligations

data controllers in terms of processing security. So, according to

recital 83 of the GDPR and in order to “guarantee the security and prevent any

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

24/30

 

 

 

 

processing carried out in violation of this Regulation, it is important that the

controller or processor assesses the risks inherent in the

treatment and implements measures to mitigate them, such as

encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including

including confidentiality, taking into account the state of knowledge and the costs of

implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data

personnel to be protected. […] . However, by securing the operation of the

geolocation only by means of a unique identification, i.e. a

username and a unique password, which is used by all

persons authorized to access said software, the Restricted Training considers that

the auditee did not measure the importance of data security

personal information contained in the geolocation system.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent on them, even if an obligation to respect the

principles of data minimization and retention limitation, while

as a comparable information obligation already existed in application of the

sections 4.1. b) and d), 10.2 and 26 of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

personal.

 

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training notes that for video surveillance, it is all the

employees working on the controlled site, as well as all third parties,

i.e. customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors

visiting said site.

 

With regard to the geolocation system, considering that each

vehicle has been allocated to a specific employee, Restricted Training notes that it

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

 

25/30

these are […] employees corresponding to the […] cars which were equipped with such a

system.

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

 

 

82. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

83. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD agents on 7

March 2019 (see also point 77 of this decision).

84. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c), 5.1.e), 13 and 32.1 of the GDPR.

85. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

26/30

articles 5,13 and 32 of the GDPR is blamed for the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

86. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of 7,200 euros appears

both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83.1

of the GDPR.

2.2. About taking corrective action

 

87. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

investigation to the Restricted Training in its additional letter to the communication

grievances:

 

“a) Order the controller to complete the measures

information intended for the persons concerned (employees and customers) by the

video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and

(2) of the GDPR by providing in particular the identity of the data controller, the

purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the categories of data processed, the

legitimate interests pursued by the controlled, the recipients, the duration of

retention of data as well as the indication of the rights of the person and the

how to exercise them;

b) Order the controller not to process within the framework of the

video surveillance only data that is relevant, adequate and limited to what is

necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting property and securing

access and, in particular, adapt the video system so as not to film the employees

on their workstation, for example by deleting or reorienting the cameras "[...]

" and " […] ".

 

Note: For geolocation, no corrective measure is proposed due to the fact

that the processing has been stopped as confirmed in the letter of December 10

2019.”

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

 

27/30

88. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 78 of this decision, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in

his letters of April 25, 2019, December 3, 2019, September 7, 2020, as well as

February 26, 2021. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

 With regard to the implementation of information measures intended for persons

affected by video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of Article

13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller maintains in his letters of December 3, 2019 and

of September 4, 2020 having developed and posted a new information poster.

Furthermore, following the hearing of the Restricted Panel on February 26, 2021, the

controlled sent a new version of said information poster that he

would like to put in place, believing that it would be more complete and more

compliant.

The Restricted Panel notes that the latest version of the poster sent by

email of February 26, 2021 is intended for the attention of employees, as well as

visitors to the site. However, the Restricted Panel considers that the said poster

does not contain all the rights enjoyed by data subjects

under the GDPR, in particular the right of access pursuant to Article 15 of the

GDPR.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case and point 78 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

as soon as it is necessary to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head

investigation under a).

 As for the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting property and

securing access and, in particular, adapting the video device so as not to

not film the employees on their workstation, the control has annexed in its

letter of December 3, 2019 photos showing that the field of vision of the

camera “[…]” has been masked so that the workstations on it

are no longer visible and that the smoking area has been moved a few meters in

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

28/30

outside the field of vision of the camera called "[...]". In consideration of

compliance measures taken by the audited in this case and point 78 of

this decision, the Restricted Panel therefore considers that there is no

appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation under b).

 As for any corrective measures concerning

the system of

geolocation, the Restricted Training agrees with the proposal of the head of investigation

not to adopt a corrective measure in this regard due to the fact that the processing

was arrested as confirmed in the letter of the control of December 3, 2019.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to retain the breaches of Articles 5.1.c) and e), 13 and 32.1 of the GDPR;

 

- to impose an administrative fine on the company in the amount of seven

one thousand two hundred euros (7,200 euros), with regard to breaches of articles

5.1.c) and e), 13 and 32.1 of the GDPR;

 

- issue an injunction against the company to bring the

processing with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, within two months

following notification of the decision of the Restricted Committee, the supporting documents

in compliance, to be sent to the Restricted Training, at the latest, within this period;

 

and especially :

 

1. inform non-employee third parties in a clearer and more precise manner,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, in particular by providing

third parties information relating to the existence of the right of access;

 

2. individually inform employees in a clear and more precise manner, in accordance with

the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, in particular by providing employees with a

information relating to the existence of the right of access.
