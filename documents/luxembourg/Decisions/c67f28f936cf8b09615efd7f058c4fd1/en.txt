7. By letter dated October 18, 2019, the head of investigation informed the person inspected that he had not

found to be in breach of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR. The audit report was

attached to said letter.

8. By email of October 6, 2020, the head of investigation sent the investigation file to the

National Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereafter: the "constitution

restricted”), indicating that it did not retain any grievances or breaches against the

controlled, while the latter had met the expectations set in the context of the investigation

or has presented mitigation elements that it considers sufficient in relation to the

control objectives indicated in point 6. of this document. For these reasons, the chief

of inquiry proposed, in its communication of October 6, 2020, to the training

restricted the closing of the file.

November 2020. In accordance with article 10, point 2, letter a) of the rules of order

inside the National Commission, the head of the investigation presented observations

oral on the case.

10. The Restricted Committee notes that the head of investigation did not find any shortcomings

on the part of the controller to the provisions of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR. During

examination of the investigation file, the Restricted Committee did not find either

other elements that would constitute a breach of section 4 of the chapter

4 GDPR.

11. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the case should be closed,

in accordance with Article 10, point 2, letter a) of the internal rules of the

National commission.
