I. Facts and procedure

1. During its deliberation session of September 28, 2018, the Commission

Data Protection Authority sitting in plenary session (hereafter:

“Plenary Formation”) had decided to open an investigation with Company A on the basis of

of article 37 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission

for data protection and the general data protection regime (hereafter

after “Law of August 1, 2018”) and to designate Mr. Christophe Buschmann as

head of investigation.

2. According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation conducted by the CNPD

was intended to verify compliance with the provisions of the regulations relating to the protection

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”)

and the law of August 1, 2018, in particular by setting up systems for

video surveillance and geolocation installed by Company A.

3. On November 20, 2018, CNPD officials visited

on the premises of Company A. The decision of the National Commission for the Protection

data sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter:

“Restricted Training”) will be limited to processing controlled by CNPD agents

and carried out by said company.

4. Company A is a limited liability company entered in the register of the

Commerce et des Sociétés de Luxembourg under number […] and having its registered office

at number […], L - […] (hereinafter "the controlled"). The controlled [aims to deposit

goods.]1

5. During the aforementioned visit of November 20, 2018 by CNPD agents to

the controlled premises, it was confirmed to CNPD officials that the controlled uses

a video surveillance system and that he installed a geolocation device in […]

company vehicles.2

6. By letter dated November 23, 2018, the controller replied to the report drawn up

by CNPD officials.

7. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 30

August 2019 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically a non-compliance with the prescribed requirements:

 by article 13 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to information

of all persons concerned with regard to the video surveillance system and

concerning the information of employees about the geolocation system;

 by article 5.1.c) of the GDPR (principle of minimization of data) with regard to

concerns the video surveillance system;

 by article 5.1.e) of the GDPR (principle of limitation of storage) with regard to

concerns the geolocation system;

 by article 32.1 of the GDPR (security of processing) with regard to the system

control computer.

 

8. On October 2, 2019, the auditee produced written observations on the

statement of objections.

 

9. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

checked on January 29, 2021. In this letter, the head of investigation proposed to the

Restricted training to adopt five corrective measures and to inflict on the controlee a

administrative fine of 6,600 euros.

 

10. By letter dated February 11, 2021, the auditee produced written observations on

the additional letter to the statement of objections.

11. The President of the Restricted Formation informed the controller by letter of 29

April 2021 that his case would be registered for the Restricted Panel session of July 7

2021 and that he could attend this session. The controller did not respond to this

invitation.

12. During the Restricted Training session of July 7, 2021, the head of investigation

presented its oral observations in support of its written observations and responded to the

questions asked by the Restricted Panel. The controller was not present during the

session.

II. Place

 

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

 

II.1.1. As for the CCTV system

 

A. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

13. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

14. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.3

15. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

16. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal information collected for other purposes.4

17. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.5

2. In this case

18. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the

purposes of setting up the video surveillance system are the security of the site, as well as

as the protection of property. For example, an incident, in this case a burglary

which occurred on October 2, 2018, was reported to officers.6

19. During the said visit, the CNPD agents observed that the fields of

vision of the cameras documented by the photos […] include parts of land

surrounding areas that are not part of the property of the controlled.7

20. The head of investigation was of the opinion that even if the aforementioned purposes “may

find one or more bases of lawfulness under article 6, the surveillance of land

surrounding areas is, however, to be considered disproportionate. […] " (communication

grievances, Ad. A.2.).

21. The auditee for his part explained in his letter of October 2, 2019 that in

dated September 23, 2019

the following corrective action has been

implemented:

“Reorientation of surveillance cameras where parts of neighboring land

fell into the field of vision of these and masking of all areas of parties

of surrounding land […] entering the field of vision of the cameras of

video surveillance. (See photos provided in Annex 5). “The said explanations were

reiterated by the controller in his letter of February 11, 2021.

22. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the cameras intended to monitor

a place of access (entrance and exit, threshold, porch, door, awning, hall, etc.) must have a

field of vision limited to the area strictly necessary to view people

getting ready to get there. Those who film exterior accesses must not mark

the entire width of a sidewalk along, where applicable, the building or public roads

adjacent. Similarly, outdoor cameras installed near or around a

building must be configured so as not to capture the public thoroughfare or the surroundings,

entrances, accesses and interiors of other neighboring buildings possibly entering

their field of vision.8

23. She nevertheless admits that depending on the configuration of the premises, it is sometimes

impossible to install a camera that would not include in its field of vision a

part of the public thoroughfare, surroundings, entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In

such a case, it considers that the data controller should put in place

masking or blurring techniques to limit the field of view to its property.9

24. The Restricted Panel notes that the controller attached to his letter of 2

October 2019 photos showing that he reoriented or masked the fields of vision

cameras aimed at neighboring land.10 However, this modification only took place

only after the on-site visit by CNPD officials.

25. In view of the foregoing, it therefore agrees with the finding11 of the head of investigation

that the non-compliance with article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the visit

CNPD agents on site.

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

26. According to paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the GDPR, the “controller

take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14

as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article

34 with regard to the treatment to the data subject in a concise manner,

transparent, understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

27. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

 

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

 

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

 

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

 

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

  

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

 

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

 

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

 

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

 

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

 

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

 

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

 

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

those data;

 

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

 

28. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.12 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

 

29. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.13

 

2. In this case

30. With regard to the information of customers, suppliers, service providers

services and visitors (hereinafter: “third parties”) and employees with regard to the

video surveillance system, the CNPD agents noted during their visit to

site that they are informed by signs affixed at the level of the entrance gate near

from the guard post, as well as in the parking lot for visitors and staff. These panels

contained a poster of a camera,

the statement “Establishment under

video surveillance” and the old CNPD sticker was pasted on it. Furthermore, the

                                            
12 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

head of investigation considered that the "documentation submitted to the CNPD by the letter of 23

November 2018 does not contain sufficient evidence to counter a non-

compliance with the requirements of article 13 of the GDPR. (Statement of Objections, Ad.A.1.).

31. For the above reasons, the head of investigation considered that the conditions of

article 13 of the RGPD have not been respected and that it is necessary to retain against the

checked for non-compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR with regard to

third parties and employees (statement of objections, Ad.A.1).

32. By letter dated October 2, 2019, the auditee responded to the communication from the

grievances from the head of investigation stating that the warning signs have been updated

and that on simple request an information notice will be distributed to the public and to

visitors.14 Concerning new employees, it is specified that when signing the

employment contract, they are informed about the site's video surveillance system.15

33. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

34. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing, the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information with the most

strong impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address)16. the

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties17.

2.1. Information from third parties

35. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by panels containing a poster of a camera, the mention

"Establishment under video surveillance" and the old CNPD sticker was stuck

above. The said road signs were affixed at the level of the entrance gate

at the guard post and in the parking lot for visitors and staff and all

people working on the controlled site would be required to enter and exit through this

entrance to the site.18

36. She would first like to point out that since the old vignettes were

issued by the CNPD under the former authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002

on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

staff which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018, they have become obsolete and

since the entry into force of the GDPR, other rules in this area are applicable.

Furthermore, the aforementioned panels, in place at the time of the investigation, do not contain either

information from the first level of information, nor from the second level of information (see

point 35 of this Decision) and therefore do not comply with the conditions of Article

13 GDPR.

                                            
16 Cf.WP260 rev 01 (point 38) and EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data

37. The Restricted Panel then notes that in its letter of 23 November

2018, the controller has attached a CD-Rom containing a whole series of different documents,

such as a form called "personal information" submitted after

hiring a new employee, an information notice on data processing

of a personal nature in the context of recruitment or even a form for

administrators. However, no document concerns the information of third parties

on the processing of personal data carried out by the system of

video surveillance.

Thus, the Restricted Panel concurs with the observation of the head of investigation that the documentation

submitted to the CNPD by the aforementioned letter "does not contain sufficient evidence

allowing to counter a non-compliance with article 13 of the GDPR. (communication of

grievances, Ad.A.1.).

38. In its response to the statement of objections of 2 October 2019, the audited

clarified that the warning signs have been updated and that on simple request

an information leaflet will be distributed to the public and visitors.19

The Restricted Panel considers that the panels contain the information of the

first level of information and that the second level of information, i.e. the note

information available on request from the guardhouse, contains

all the information required under Article 13 of the GDPR, subject to a

modification of a formal nature: the term "in charge of data protection" must be

replaced by the term "data protection officer". Like the coordinates

said control delegate were communicated to the CNPD on […], the Training

Restricted assumes that it is indeed only a formal error.

39. By letter dated February 11, 2021, the controller confirmed that he had displayed

updated signs put in place after the on-site inspection “on the fence […]

of the site at video-monitored locations" and that the above-mentioned information note is available

“free consultation for visitors to the guardhouse. »

40. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that all the documentation of the

first and second level of information was put in place only after the on-site visit

CNPD officers.

41. In view of the foregoing, she therefore endorses the opinion of the head of investigation and concludes

that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 13 of the GDPR was not

complied with by the control in terms of video surveillance with regard to the

third persons.

2.2. Employee information

42. With regard to

informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the Restricted Panel notes that at the time of the on-site visit by the

CNPD officers, they were informed of the video surveillance by the same panels

signals than third parties (see points 36 and 37 of this decision).

43. Furthermore, it notes that the controller informed the CNPD agents that the

implementation of the video surveillance system would have been discussed at the Joint Committee

company and that information relating thereto would have been displayed on a panel

information.20 However, the Restricted Panel has no proof of the posting

of such information, on the one hand, and it wishes to specify that the mere information of the

Joint works committee does not ensure that the employees of the control had been informed

individually regarding the specific elements of Article 13 of the GDPR.

44. The Restricted Panel then notes that in its letter of 23 November

2018, the controller has attached a CD-Rom containing a whole series of different documents,

including in particular an information notice on the processing of personal data

staff in recruitment. However, that note concerns only the candidates and

not the current employees of the auditee and it does not include the processing carried out by the system

video surveillance. Thus, it agrees with the observation of the head of the investigation that the

documentation submitted to the CNPD by the aforementioned letter "does not contain evidence

sufficient to counter non-compliance with Article 13 of the GDPR. »

45. In its response to the statement of objections of 2 October 2019, the audited

clarified that the warning signs have been updated and that the information notice,

available at the guardhouse for third parties, is attached to the contract

hiring of new controlled employees.

Concerning precisely the said panels, as well as the information note, the Training

Restreinte would like to refer to its conclusions in point 39 of this decision. By

elsewhere, whereas the information of the first level of information is therefore at

available to control personnel, it notes that the second level of information,

that is to say the aforementioned information note which contains all the information

required under Article 13 of the GDPR, is only annexed to employment contracts

new employees of the controlled, but not current employees.

46. In his letter of February 11, 2021, the controller did, however, specify that a

“Information notice on video surveillance has been drawn up. The staff

concerned by the video surveillance is informed. », therefore also including employees

current of the controlled. The inspector also specified that a general information notice

concerning the protection of personal data has been sent to all

employees together with the pay slip of February 2021.

47. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that all the documentation of the

first and second level of information was put in place only after the on-site visit

CNPD officers.

48. In view of the foregoing, she thus endorses the opinion of the head of investigation21 and concludes

that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 13 of the GDPR was not

complied with by the control in terms of video surveillance as far as employees are concerned.

1. On the principles

49. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […]”.

50. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. »

2. In this case

51. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes

of geolocation are as follows: “the geographical location of vehicles, the

provision of responses to customer complaints, provision of evidence of

services, invoicing of services, optimal management of the fleet, health and

safety of users, monitoring of working time and monitoring of transported goods as well as

as the protection of company property (…). »22

52. With regard to the retention period of data from the device

of geolocation, it appears from the observations of the CNPD agents that the most

old data dated from April 10, 2018 (date of installation of the device), i.e.

that the data retention period was seven months and 10 days.23

53. According to the head of the investigation, the said data retention period exceeded

that which was necessary for the achievement of the aforementioned purposes and for which the

geolocation device had been put in place. For this reason, he was of the opinion

that a non-compliance with the requirements of article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was to be retained (see

statement of objections, Ad.A.4).

54. By letter dated October 2, 2019, the controller proposed the corrective action

following: “Retention of geolocation data for a maximum period

two months. “In his letter of February 11, 2021, the controller confirmed that the duration

storage of geolocation data has been limited to a maximum period of

two months.

55. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period

appropriate and necessary to achieve that purpose. Thus, as the system of

geolocation set up by the control has several purposes, the durations of

conservation are to be individualized for each specific purpose.

56. With regard to the geolocation of employee vehicles, the Training

Restricted considers that

personal data obtained by

the

geolocation can in principle only be kept for a period

maximum of two months under the aforementioned principle of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR.

However, it considers that if said data is used by the person responsible for the

processing for the purposes of proof for the invoicing of the services carried out for its

customers, the data necessary for such invoicing may be kept for a

duration of one year, provided that it is not possible to provide proof of the services

by other means.24

57. In the event of an incident, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the data may

be kept beyond the time limits mentioned above in the context of the transmission of

given to competent judicial authorities and competent law enforcement authorities

to ascertain or prosecute criminal offences.

58. She would also like to point out that the data obtained by geolocation

may also be kept beyond the aforementioned durations, if these have

been previously made anonymous, i.e. it is no longer possible to make a link

– direct or indirect – between this data and a specific employee.

59. Finally, if the geolocation device is installed for verification purposes

working time (when this is the only possible way), the Restricted Training considers

that the personal data obtained by the geolocation which allow to

check the working time may nevertheless be kept for a period

maximum of three years in accordance with the limitation period set out in article 2277 paragraph

1st in the Civil Code in matters of action for payment of employee compensation.25

60. In the present case, it appears from the minutes of the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD that the retention period for geolocation data of seven

months and 10 days corresponded to the date of installation of the device in question.26 As

no documentation submitted by the control to the head of investigation by mail dated 23

November 2018 does not contain information on setting a retention period

precise, the Restricted Panel considers that at the time of the on-site visit by the security

the CNPD, the control had not determined, according to the different specific purposes

continued by the geolocation device, appropriate retention periods and

necessary to achieve these purposes.

61. The Restricted Committee notes that in its letter of February 11, 2021, the

controlled confirmed its comments of October 2, 2019 that the retention period of

geolocation data was limited to a maximum of two months.

The Restricted Panel nevertheless notes that said retention period has not been

determined only after the on-site visit by CNPD officials.

62. In view of the foregoing, she thus agrees with the opinion of the head of investigation27 and concludes

that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was not

not respected by the controlled with regard to its geolocation device.

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

63. With regard to the principles to be observed with regard to the obligation to inform

the persons concerned in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

refers to points 34 and 35 of this decision.

2. In this case

64. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that […]

vehicles are equipped with geolocation devices and that the persons concerned

by said geolocation are only the employees of the company. It has moreover been

affirmed to the CNPD agents that the employees were informed orally of the installation

of the geolocation device in vehicles and that the written communication relating

at the meeting of the joint works council of March 21, 2018 which decided on the implementation

of the device would have been published.

65. The head of the investigation considered in this context that the person checked "remains in default

to produce any evidence as to the assertion that the persons concerned

have been duly informed of the installation of the geolocation device in the

company vehicles. Arguing that a written communication relating to the

meeting of the joint works council of March 21, 2018 having approved the implementation of the

device has actually been published is not likely to irritate this finding. The society

did not present any other elements of mitigation in its defence. “From then on, he

considered that the non-compliance with article 13 of the GDPR was established on the day of the visit to

site (statement of objections, Ad.A.3.).

66. By letter dated October 2, 2019, the inspector specified that in all vehicles

equipped with a geolocation device, a warning sticker has been affixed

date of September 26, 201928 and that new employees are informed during the

signature of the employment contract on the presence of geolocation devices in

                                            
28 See appendix 6 of the audit letter of October 2, 2019.

vehicles and their personal data protection rights

by an information notice on geolocation.29 In addition, the control has

indicated that the paper register containing historical data on the use of

vehicles was modified on September 25, 2019 so that before each use

vehicles, users are informed in advance via the information notice in

matter of geolocation.30

67. By letter dated February 11, 2021, the auditee reiterated that an “information notice

on geolocation has been drafted. The personnel concerned by the system of

geolocation is informed by consulting this information notice. The register

of use of vehicles equipped with these geolocation devices has been modified from

in such a way as to record in writing the knowledge by the user of the vehicle of the

content of this geolocation information notice. Dashboards

of vehicles equipped with the geolocation device have been identified thanks to the affixing

with a warning sticker. »

68. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify first of all that Article 12 of the GDPR

does not exclude de facto that the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 may be

provided orally by the controller to the data subject. However,

the WP260 rev. 01 (paragraph 21) insists that in this case the data controller

should ensure “to keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it

(for the purposes of compliance with the accountability requirement), of: i) the request for information

orally, ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified

(if applicable, see point 20 above), and (iii) whether the information has been

transmitted to the person concerned. »

During the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the inspector specifically mentioned that

the persons concerned have been informed orally of the presence of the device

geolocation in vehicles.

Nevertheless, the Restricted Panel finds that no documentation submitted by the

controlled does not contain proof that its employees have been duly informed,

                                            
29 See appendix 4 of the audit letter of October 2, 2019.

before the on-site visit by CNPD officials, orally in accordance with Article

13 GDPR.

69. She then noted that the written communication relating to the committee meeting

joint venture of March 21, 2018 having stopped the implementation of the system, which would have

been published, contains only the following information: "For security reasons a

geolocation system will be installed in vehicles […] used for

travel/transportation. This communication does not even contain the information

required for the first level of information (see point 35 of this decision) and

therefore does not comply with the conditions of Article 13 of the GDPR.

70. It also appears from the letters of the audit of October 2, 2019 and February 11

2021 that warning stickers have been affixed to the dashboards of

vehicles equipped with the geolocation device and that the personnel concerned by the said

device is informed by consulting an information notice on

geolocation. The register of use of vehicles equipped with these devices

geolocation has even been modified so that each person using such a vehicle

must record in writing the knowledge of the content of this information notice,

which is also annexed to the employment contracts of the new employees of the audit.

The Restricted Committee notes that, even if the information notice on

aforementioned geolocation contains all the information required under article

13 of the GDPR, it was only put in place and brought to the attention of employees after

on-site visit by CNPD officers.

71. In view of the foregoing, it therefore concludes that at the time of the on-site visit

CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the control in

geolocation for employees.

II.1.3. On the breach of the obligation to guarantee appropriate security

 

1. On the principles

72. Pursuant to Article 32.1 of the GDPR and “taking into account the state of knowledge,

the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the

treatment as well as risks, the degree of likelihood and severity of which vary, for the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

20/34

rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor

implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to

guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk including, among other things, as required:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

 

b) the means to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

ongoing resilience of processing systems and services;

 

c) means to restore the availability of personal data

and access to them within appropriate timeframes in the event of a physical or technical incident;

 

(d) a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of

technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing. »

 

2. In this case

73. During the on-site visit, it was confirmed to CNPD officials that the accounts

electronic mail

individuals are exclusively administered by

the

IT manager, that he is the sole holder of the login credentials of

all of said accounts, which it also stores on a paper document, and

that he can potentially access the content of these mailboxes. In addition, identifiers

connection of email accounts and workstations would never be

renewed.31

74. The head of the investigation considered in this context that the “fact that the identifiers of

connection of e-mail accounts are never renewed and that these are

stored on a paper document kept by the IT manager, do not satisfy

to the requirements of article 32 of the aforementioned GDPR. Indeed, the aforementioned practices

do not represent the state of the art applicable in the matter and do not make it possible to guarantee a

level of security appropriate to the risks run by the data controller. »

21/34

75. By letter dated October 2, 2019, the controller specified that the migration to a

new e-mail server is in progress and that with this "new

solution for electronic messaging, users will no longer need a password

password to access their email accounts. They will be able to

access after their Windows authentication (SSO principle). In this way, the

IT manager will no longer have the identifiers of the user accounts that

will be personal. He further explained that a “password directive

(Password Policy) will be put in place to require users to change their

passwords every six months" and that the paper document held by

the head of the IT department and containing all the login credentials of the

email accounts "has been kept in a safe and will be destroyed as soon as the

solution […] of electronic messaging will have been replaced by the new solution of

email. »

76. In his letter of February 11, 2021, the auditee confirmed that the migration to

a new e-mail server located on its site at […] has been made,

that a password directive, as mentioned above, has been put in place and that

finally the paper document containing all the connection identifiers of the

email accounts was destroyed.

77. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that, even if due to these

modifications the requirements of Article 32.1 of the GDPR would henceforth be complied with,

they were only put in place by the control after the on-site visit by the agents of

the CNPD. At the time of the visit, email account access policies

however, did not meet the minimum requirements necessary for

terms of security and did not represent the state of the art applicable in this area.

78. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel thus concludes that at the time of

the on-site visit by CNPD agents, article 32.1 of the GDPR was not respected by the

control.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

 

 

 

 

 

 

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

22/34

1. Principles

 

79. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

 

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

 

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

 

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

 

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

 

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

 

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

 

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

23/34

 

 

 

 

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

 

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

 

80. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

 

81. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

 

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

 

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

 

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

 

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

 

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

24/34

 

 

 

 

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

 

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

 

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

 

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

 

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

 

82. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

83. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

 

 

 

 

 

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

25/34

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

 

84. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 29 January

2021, the head of the investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative audit for an amount of 6,600 euros.

 

85. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

 As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Formation notes that with regard to breaches of Articles

5.1.c) and e) of the GDPR, they constitute breaches of the principles

fundamentals of the GDPR (and data protection law in general), to

know the principles of data minimization and the limitation of the

conservation devoted to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

 

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

 

As to the failure to have in place the minimum requirements necessary for

terms of security in accordance with Article 32.1 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training

considers that, faced with the risks represented by data breaches at

personal nature, the European legislator intended to strengthen the obligations

data controllers in terms of processing security. So, according to

recital 83 of the GDPR and in order to “guarantee the security and prevent any

processing carried out in violation of this Regulation, it is important that the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

26/34

 

 

 

 

controller or processor assesses the risks inherent in the

treatment and implements measures to mitigate them, such as

encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including

including confidentiality, taking into account the state of knowledge and the costs of

implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data

personnel to be protected. […] . However, in view of the fact that the e-mail accounts

individual electronic devices were exclusively administered by the manager

computer, that he was the sole holder of the login credentials of

all of said accounts, which he also stored on a document

paper, and that the login credentials of e-mail accounts and

workstations were never renewed, the Restricted Training considers that

the auditee did not measure the importance of data security

personal data contained in its computer system.

 As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have persisted over time, at least since the

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. The Restricted Formation reminds

here that two years separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into

application to enable data controllers to comply with the

obligations incumbent on them, even if an obligation to respect the

principles of data minimization and retention limitation, while

as obligations of information and security of comparable processing

already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1. b) and d), 10.2, 22 and 26 of the law

repealed from August 2, 2002 relating to the protection of persons with regard to the

processing of personal data. Guidance on

principles and obligations provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD

in particular through prior authorizations for video surveillance

and guidance available on the CNPD website.

 

 As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training notes that for video surveillance, these are […]

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

27/34

 

 

 

 

employees32 working on the controlled site, as well as all third parties,

i.e. customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors

visiting said site.

 

With regard to the geolocation system, these are the various employees

who used the […] cars equipped with such a system.

 As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

 

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of

of the controlled.

 

 As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.

 

 As for the measures taken by the auditee to mitigate the damage suffered by the

data subjects (article 83.2.c) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes

account of the measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. section 2.2.

of this decision for the related explanations.

 

 

86. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

                                            
32 As indicated on the website of the controlled […].

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey no. […] conducted with Company A.

 

 

 

28/34

87. The Restricted Committee also notes that while several measures have been implemented

place by the auditee in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings,

these were only adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on

20 November 2018 (see also point 83 of this decision).

88. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c), 5.1.e), 13 and 32.1 of the GDPR.

89. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of breaches

multiple, as is the case here, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed

the amount fixed for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of

articles 5, 13 and 32 of the GDPR is blamed for the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine

that can be withheld amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual turnover

worldwide, whichever is higher.

90. In view of the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Panel considers that the pronouncement of a fine of four thousand six hundred

(4,600) euros appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the

requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

2.2. About taking corrective action

 

91. The adoption of the following corrective measures was proposed by Chief

investigation to the Restricted Training in its additional letter to the communication

grievances:

 

“a) Inform the persons concerned by the video surveillance system

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR;

b) Inform the persons concerned by the geolocation device

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR;

 

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

29/34

 

 

 

 

c) Precede a "blurring", redirect or remove the disputed cameras in order to

that they no longer capture parts of neighboring land;

 

d) Limit

the retention period of the geo-positioning data

in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 letter e) of the GDPR;

 

e)

Implement and

respect security measures

techniques and

Organizational guidelines for managing email passwords

electronically in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 paragraph (1) of the GDPR.

92. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 84 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c), e), 13 and 32.1 of the GDPR, as

detailed in his letters of November 23, 2018, October 2, 2019 and February 11

2021. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under a) of the

point 92 of this Decision concerning the introduction of measures

information for people affected by

the system of

video surveillance in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, the

controlled specified in its letter of October 2, 2019 concerning the persons

third parties that the warning signs have been updated and that on simple

request an information notice will be distributed to the public and visitors.33 By

letter of February 11, 2021, the controller confirmed that he had displayed the

updated panels “on the fence […] of the site in video-monitored places” and

that the above-mentioned information note is available “for free consultation for

visitors to the guardhouse. »

In said letter of October 2, 2019, the controller further specified that the notice

information, available at the guard post for third parties, is

appended to the employment contract for new audited employees. In his
