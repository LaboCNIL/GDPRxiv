place took place on May 16, 2019 and July 3, 2019.

6.

conclusion that Company A was under no obligation to appoint a DPO due to the absence

regular and systematic large-scale monitoring of natural persons by Company A, at the

meaning of Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR. Therefore, only the first control objective was

analyzed without it being necessary to analyze the other ten control objectives.

The Restricted Committee notes that the Head of Investigation did not find any breach by the

9.

part of Company A with the provisions of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR. When examining the

investigation file, the Restricted Committee did not find any other elements that would be

constituting a breach of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR.

 
Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the case should be closed,
