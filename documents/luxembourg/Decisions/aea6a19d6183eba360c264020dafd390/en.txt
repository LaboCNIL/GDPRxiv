launch a thematic survey campaign on the function of the DPO. Thus, 25 audit procedures

were opened in 2018, involving both the private and public sectors.

 

2.

In particular, the National Commission decided by deliberation n° […] of 14 September

2018 to open an investigation in the form of a data protection audit with the […]

Company A, established and having its registered office at L- […], and registered in the trade and

preliminary draft to Company A to which the latter responded by email dated October 4, 2018. A

on-site visit took place on 12 February 2019.

found to be in breach of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR. The audit report was attached to the audit

mail.

By email of November 6, 2020, the head of investigation sent the investigation file to the

National Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereafter: the “restricted formation”) in

indicating that it has not upheld any grievances or breaches against Company A, whereas

the latter had met the expectations set in the context of the investigation or presented

mitigation elements that it considers sufficient in relation to the control objectives indicated in

item 6. hereof. For these reasons, the head of investigation proposed, in his communication

of November 6, 2020, to the restricted committee the closing of the file.

The Restricted Committee examined the case during its session of January 22, 2021,

in accordance with Article 10, point 2), letter a) of the Commission's rules of procedure

national.

The Restricted Committee notes that the Head of Investigation did not find any breach by the

part of Company A with the provisions of section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR. When examining the
