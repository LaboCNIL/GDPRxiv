the support of his written observations and answered the questions posed by the Panel

 

Restraint.

 

II. Place

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

A. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

1. On the principles

13. According to Article 12.1 of the GDPR, the “controller shall take

appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as

to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in

which relates to the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent,

understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

14. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with company A

 

 

 

4/22



(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data ;

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with company A

 

 

 

5/22



underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

15. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.6 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

16. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, such as the aforementioned guidelines on transparency7.

2. In this case

17. With regard to the information of third parties about the system of

video surveillance, the head of investigation noted in the statement of objections that “when

of the visit, it was found that the presence of the video surveillance system is not

notified to the persons concerned. No signaling pictogram, nor any

poster or information notice could not be shown to CNPD officials. It emerges

therefore from these findings that the controller does not comply with his obligation

to inform the persons concerned. 8 He therefore held that non-compliance with

                                                           
6 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit, the control having not provided

elements likely to demonstrate its compliance with the said article. Thus he was

of the opinion that the auditee failed in its obligation to inform third parties

arising from article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR.9

18. Regarding

informing employees about the system of

video surveillance the head of investigation in the statement of objections exposed the same

observations and conclusions only for third parties (see point 17 above). It was

of the opinion that the auditee failed in its obligation to inform the employees arising from

GDPR article 13.1 and 2.10

19. The control during the meeting of March 3, 2020, first explained to the agents

of the CNPD, that there was no joint committee or staff delegation within

society11. Then, after claiming to be unaware of the provisions of

article L.261-1 of the Labor Code, he confirmed that no information from the labor inspection

Labor and Mines (hereinafter: "ITM") had been carried out in order to inform the latter

the implementation of the video surveillance system, but that information from the ITM

would be carried out as soon as possible.

20. The Restricted Panel would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). »13

21. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment like

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information having the

greater impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects,14 as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (for example, via a QR code or a website address).15 The

second level of information, i.e. all the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice regarding

third parties.16

2.1. Information from third parties

22. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by CNPD agents

third parties were not informed of the presence of the security system

video surveillance.

23. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, Article 13

of the GDPR was not respected by the control in terms of video surveillance for what

relates to third parties.

2.2. Employee information

24. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by CNPD agents

the employees were not informed of the presence of the video surveillance system.

25. It also notes that the auditee did not submit any documentation

attesting that after his meeting of March 3, 2020 with CNPD officials, he informed

the ITM of the implementation of the video surveillance system. In any case, the information of

the ITM could not be qualified as individual information.

26. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, Article 13

of the GDPR was not respected by the control in terms of video surveillance for what

relates to employees.

 

B. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

1. On the principles

27. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

28. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.17

29. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

30. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

information collected for other purposes.18

31. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.19

2. In this case

32. During the meeting of March 3, 2020, the controller explained to the CNPD agents

that the purpose of video surveillance was to protect company property.

2.1. With regard to the field of vision of the camera aiming at [work] stations

33. During the on-site visit of January 30, 2020, CNPD officers observed

that "the camera's field of vision allows the permanent surveillance of workstations

work, in particular employees (…) occupied in [work] positions (Photo […])”.21 During

of the meeting of March 3, 2020, they again documented the field of vision of the

disputed camera by a screenshot “(see photo […])”.22

34. The Head of Investigation stated in the Statement of Objections that while the

purpose of protecting the company's assets "can find one or more bases of

lawful under Article 6 [of the GDPR], the permanent monitoring of employees on their

workstations, such as permanent monitoring of employees working behind the

checkout and those occupied at [work] stations, noted during the on-site visit, is

however, to be considered disproportionate. Indeed, such monitoring

permanent can create significant psychological pressure for employees who

feel and know they are being watched, especially since the surveillance measures continue

in time. The fact that the employees concerned do not have a means of

remove from this supervision from time to time. Such permanent monitoring is

considered disproportionate to the purpose sought and constitutes a

excessive interference with the private sphere of employees occupied at their workstations. In

In this case, the fundamental rights and freedoms of employees must prevail over the interests

sued by the employer. 23 Thus, he held that the conditions of Article 5.1.c) of the

GDPR have not been complied with, and that the controller has breached its obligation under

of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.24

35. Control for its part, during the meeting of March 3, 2020, after explanations

received relating to the modalities allowing video surveillance in the workplace and

limits of such a surveillance measure, confirmed that it would "implement all

technical measures to ensure that the video surveillance system put in place

complies with the applicable legislation", and particularly that the field of vision of the

camera would be reoriented to target only the crate.25

36. La Formation Restreinte would like to point out that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach

the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. On the other hand, respecting

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

37. She notes that the photo and screenshot documented by law enforcement officers

CNPD during the on-site visit respectively their subsequent meeting with the controller

show that the field of view of the disputed camera was aimed at employees working on

workstations so that the disputed camera allowed permanent surveillance

of these employees.

38. It also notes that the auditee did not submit any documentation

attesting that after his meeting of March 3, 2020 with CNPD officials, he took

technical measures, such as the reorientation of the disputed camera, to comply with the

video surveillance system to the applicable legislation.

39. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the head of investigation and

concludes that the controller has breached its obligation under Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR

on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents.

2.2. With regard to the field of vision of the camera aiming at the body

40. During the on-site visit of January 30, 2020, CNPD officials observed

that "the camera's field of vision allows the permanent surveillance of workstations

work, in particular employees working behind the cash desk (…) (Photo […])”.26

41. The Head of Investigation explained in the statement of objections that, if “the

surveillance of a checkout area can pursue the purpose of protecting property

by observing customers and employees when handling funds or

registration of purchases, it follows from point 20 of Guidelines 3/2019 on the

processing of personal data by video devices10 that the interest

legitimate must actually exist and be current. Thus, it is recommended that those responsible for

process to document the relevant incidents (date, nature, financial loss) and the

related criminal proceedings. However, the company did not produce sufficient evidence to

support for his assertions. Indeed, the only oral affirmation as to alleged

cash differences cannot be taken into consideration, for lack of written evidence

evidence in this regard. Indeed, it was specified during the said meeting that no complaint

for theft was never filed with the Grand Ducal Police. In this

context, the CNPD considers that the company has not produced sufficient evidence to

to establish the real and present nature of his interest and that, therefore, the interest of securing the

payment fund cannot legitimize surveillance measures. 27 Thus, he held that

the conditions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR have not been respected, and that the controller has

breached its obligation arising from Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.28

42. The auditee for his part, during the meeting of March 3, 2020, explained that the

disputed camera had been installed following the discovery of cash differences

recurring expenses amounting to several hundred euros per month, but that despite everything no

no complaint had been lodged with the police concerning the said differences in cash.29

In addition, he confirmed that he would implement technical measures to comply with the

video surveillance system to the applicable legislation, and particularly that the field

of vision of the camera would be reoriented in order to target only the body30 (see point 35

of this decision).

43. As regards the right of employees not to be, in principle, subject to

continuous and permanent monitoring, Restricted Training refers to point 36 of

this decision. As mentioned, in order to avoid permanent monitoring and

continues, the data controller must limit the field of vision of the cameras to the

only surface necessary to achieve the aims pursued. So, for example,

the purpose of camera surveillance of a store checkout can be to protect

the property of the data controller against acts of theft committed by its employees or

by a client/user and to ensure the safety of its personnel. However, in order not to

violate the privacy of employees, the camera must be configured in such a way that

that the employees present behind a cash counter are not targeted, by directing

its field of vision towards the checkout itself and the front of the counter, i.e. the space

waiting for customers in front of the counter, in order to allow

identification of perpetrators, for example.31

44. The Restricted Committee notes that the photo documented by the agents of the

CNPD during the on-site visit shows that the field of view of the disputed camera aimed

the employees busy behind the cash counter so that the disputed camera

allowed the permanent monitoring of these employees.

45. It also notes that the auditee did not submit any documentation

attesting to the alleged differences in cash, nor proof attesting that after its meeting

of March 3, 2020 with CNPD agents, he took technical measures, such as

the reorientation of the disputed camera, to conform the video surveillance system to

the applicable legislation.

46. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the head of investigation and

concludes that the controller has breached its obligation under Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR

on the day of the site visit by CNPD officials.

2.3. With regard to the use of the video surveillance system for the verification of

work instructions given to employees

47. The head of investigation explained in the statement of objections that “according to point

4.3 of

guidelines of

the CNPD with regard to video surveillance11

the

CCTV should not be used to observe the behavior and performance of

members of the controller's staff. Indeed, such monitoring is

considered disproportionate to the aim sought and constitutes an infringement

excessive to the private sphere of employees occupied at their workstations. In this case,

the fundamental rights and freedoms of employees must prevail over the interests pursued

by the employer. 32 He also noted that the person checked "did not present any proof

against this non-conformity nor any mitigating elements in this regard”33. Thus, he has

held that the conditions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR have not been respected, and that the

controlled has breached its obligation arising from Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.34

48. The controlee for his part, during the meeting of March 3, 2020, affirmed that the

video surveillance system was also used to check whether the instructions for

work given to employees were respected by them.35

49. With regard to the right of employees not to be, in principle, subject to

continuous and permanent monitoring, Restricted Training refers to point 36 of

this decision.

50. Furthermore, she considers that video surveillance should not be used to observe the

behavior and performance of the staff of the head of the

processing outside the purposes for which it was set up. Thus, a

employer has the right to use the images of an employee committing theft of goods

and which come from a video surveillance system used for the purpose of protection

goods. However, he does not have the right to take measures against an employee when,

to the taste of the employer, the employee discusses too long with a customer or a colleague of

work and that this behavior is recorded by the CCTV system. This

would constitute purpose diversion prohibited by the GDPR.36

51. The Restricted Panel notes that the controller explained to CNPD officials

that the purpose of the video surveillance was to protect company property37. By

Consequently, it considers that the use of the disputed camera in order to verify whether the

work instructions given to employees were respected by the latter, constitutes

Purpose diversion prohibited by the GDPR.

52. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the head of investigation and

concludes that the controller has breached its obligation under Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR

on the day of the site visit by CNPD officials.

 

II. 2. On the fine and corrective measures

1. Principles

53. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

54. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

55. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

56. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

57. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

to pronounce.

2. In this case

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

58. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposed to the Panel

Restricted to impose an administrative fine to the control of an amount of two thousand

five hundred (2,500) euros.38l

59. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As to the nature and seriousness of the violation (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), it is

that with regard to breaches of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, they are

constituting breaches of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and the right to

data protection in general), namely the principle of minimization of

data devoted to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations incumbent on those responsible for

processing so that individuals are fully aware of the use that

will be made of their personal data, once collected. A

breach of Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights

                                                           
38 See Statement of Objections, page 8, Ad.C., point 25.

of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates their particular importance.

It should be noted that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, no

signaling pictogram, nor any poster or information notice could

be communicated to CNPD officials with regard to the information of

employees and third parties regarding the video surveillance system.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

notes that these shortcomings have lasted over time, at least since

the installation of the video surveillance system during the month of August 201939 and

until the day of the meeting of March 3, 2020. She reminds that guidance

relating to the principles and obligations provided for by the GDPR was available from

the CNPD, and in particular through its website.

- As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Restricted Training finds that these are all employees working on the site

of the controlled, as well as all third parties, i.e. customers,

suppliers, service providers and visitors to this site.

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately

or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel reminds

that “not deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller or processor has not

complied with the duty of care incumbent upon it under the law.

In the present case, it is of the opinion that the facts and breaches found do not

do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of the controller.

- As to the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2.f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good, as well as

than its desire to comply with the law as soon as possible.40

60. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

61. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR.

62. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, it recalls that the

paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple infringements, such as

this is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for

the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

63. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Panel considers that the pronouncement of a fine appears to be both effective,

proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

64. However, the Restricted Panel notes that the auditee was declared bankrupt

dated  […]. Following the request of the President of the Restricted Formation, the

curator of the auditee explained […] that the assets of the auditee in bankruptcy would be insufficient to

cover the costs of bankruptcy. Given that there are no longer any prospects of recovering a

debt, the Restricted Committee considers that it is not appropriate to impose a fine

administration in this case.

2.2. Regarding the taking of corrective measures accompanied by a penalty payment

65. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposed to the Panel

Restricted to adopt the following corrective measures:

"which should be implemented within 1 month, under penalty of

amount of EUR 50 per day of delay:

has. Order the controller to put in place the measures

information intended for persons concerned by video surveillance,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR in

indicating in particular the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the

processing and its legal basis, the categories of data processed, the interests

legitimate interests pursued by the control, the recipients, the retention period of the

data as well as the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of

exercise ;

b. Order the controller to modify the field of vision of the

contentious camera in such a way that employees are no longer targeted

permanently at their workstations. »41

66. The Restricted Panel notes the explanations of the curator of the bankruptcy audited

in his email of June 28, 2021, which states: "on the day of the declaration of bankruptcy,

the company only carried on business in […]. According to the manager, the lease of the premises at […]was

terminated at the end of July 2020”. It therefore concludes that following the cessation of the activities of the

controlled at the premises controlled by the CNPD, it is also not appropriate to pronounce or

corrective measures or on-call duty.

 

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

to close the investigation opened during the January 14, 2020 meeting of the Commission

national data protection authority with bankrupt company A.

 

Thus decided in Belvaux on December 16, 2021.
