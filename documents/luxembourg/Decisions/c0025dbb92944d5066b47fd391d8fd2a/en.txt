I. Facts and procedure

1. During its deliberation session of February 14, 2019, the National Commission

CNPD officials noted that the video surveillance system is made up of 4

cameras of which 2 cameras are off.3

5. In his response letter of July 24, 2019 to the minutes drawn up by the

CNPD agents, the control specified that "the agents and persons concerned by

the presence of a video surveillance system were informed orally. In addition, each

place equipped with a video surveillance system has signs with the mention

"Video surveillance, this object is electronically monitored" and old thumbnails

of the CNPD”.

6. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on

August 31, 2020 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically a non-compliance with the requirements prescribed

by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR with regard to the data subjects (employees

and customers), non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, and non-compliance

compliance with the requirements of article 37.1.a) of the GDPR.

II. Place

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

A. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

1. On the principles

11. According to Article 12.1 of the GDPR, the “controller shall take

appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as

to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in

which relates to the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent,

understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. The

information is provided in writing or by other means including, when it is

appropriate, electronically. When the data subject so requests, the

information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the person

concerned is demonstrated by other means. »

12. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with the municipal administration […]

 

 

 

4/20

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data ;

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with the municipal administration […]

 

 

 

5/20

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

13. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.4 Said obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

14. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, such as the aforementioned guidelines on transparency5.

2. In this case

15. With regard to the information of third parties, as well as of

civil servants, employees and municipal employees with regard to the video surveillance system,

the head of investigation notes in the statement of objections that “during the on-site visit, he

it was found that the CCTV is signaled to the persons concerned

(civil servants and municipal employees, employees and customers) through panels

information sheet with the inscription "Video surveillance, this object is monitored

                                                           
4 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

electronically” and old CNPD vignettes. 6 Nevertheless the leader

investigation finds “that in view of the requirements of the aforementioned article 13, this information is

incomplete”7 and that “the information panels affixed on site bearing the wording

mentioned above, as well as the old CNPD vignettes are not sufficient to fulfill

the conditions set out in the aforementioned article 13. »8

16. The head of investigation also notes that in his aforementioned letter of

July 24, 2019 the control argued that "the information of employees (civil servants and

municipal employees, employees, etc.) […] was carried out orally and that therefore the obligation

to inform has been respected”. However, the head of the investigation notes that such an observation, without

presentation of supporting evidence, is not likely to upset the finding that the

conditions set out in Article 13 of the GDPR have not been met.9

17. Thus, the head of investigation is of the opinion that the control failed in its obligation

to inform “the persons concerned (employees and customers)” arising from Article 13.1 and

2 GDPR.10

18. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). »11

19. Furthermore, it would like to point out that Article 12 of the GDPR does not de facto exclude

that the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR can be provided

orally by the controller to the data subject. However, the group

of Labor Article 29 insists that in this case, the data controller should ensure

“to keep a written record, and ensure that he is able to prove it (for the purposes of

compliance with the accountability requirement), of: i) the request for information by

oral, ii) the method by which the identity of the data subject was verified (if

applicable, see point 20 above), and (iii) the fact that the information was transmitted to

the person concerned. »12

20. With regard to the “information panels […] and the old vignettes

of the CNPD”13 displayed at the time of the site visit to inform people

third parties, as well as civil servants, employees and municipal employees, the Training

Restricted considers that they do not contain all the elements required by the article

13.1 and 2 GDPR.14

21. With regard to the information provided orally, she notes that no

documentation submitted by the auditee does not contain evidence that the persons

third parties, as well as civil servants, employees and municipal employees have been validly

informed, before the on-site visit, orally in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

22. The Restricted Committee also considers that a multi-level approach

to communicate transparency information to data subjects may

be used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a

real environment such as personal data collected

through a CCTV system. The first level of information should

generally include the most essential information, namely the details of the

purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of

data subjects, as well as the information having the greatest impact on the

processing or any processing that may surprise data subjects.15 The

second level of information, i.e. all the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

                                                           
12 WP 260 rev.01, point 21.
13 See Statement of Objections, page 5, Ad.B.1.), point 18.
14 These stickers, which have become obsolete, were issued by the CNPD under the old regime
of authorization of the amended law of 2 August 2002 relating to the protection of persons with regard to
processing of personal data which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018.

employees or a link on the website to an information notice regarding

non-salaried third parties.16

23. It notes, however, that “the information panels […] and the old

CNPD vignettes”17 in place during the on-site visit do not contain the elements

required of the first level of information whether for third parties or

civil servants, employees and municipal employees.

24. During the session of February 5, 2021, the auditee confirmed having installed on the

doors giving access to areas under video surveillance of the new panels

information containing the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR. Training

Restricted notes, however, that no documentation submitted by the control to the

time of the hearing contains evidence that these information boards were

been installed, and are appropriate to inform data subjects validly

in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR.

25. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, Article 13

of the GDPR was not respected by the controller.

 

B. On the breach linked to the principle of limitation of storage

1. On the principles

26. In accordance with Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, personal data

must be kept "in a form which permits the identification of the persons

concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes

for which they are processed […]”.

27. According to recital (39) of the GDPR “personal data

should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the duration of

retention of data is kept to a strict minimum. Character data

personal should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot be

reasonably achieved by other means. In order to ensure that the data is not

not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be set by the

controller for erasure or for periodic review […]. ".

2. In this case

28. With regard to the retention period of the images recorded by the

CCTV cameras, it appears from the statement of objections that "during the

on-site visit, it was found that the retention period of the images recorded by

CCTV cameras is 4 (four) years 7 (seven) months and 14 (fourteen)

weeks. »18

29. According to

the head of investigation

said retention period "exceeds

substantially that which is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of protecting the

property, user safety and accident prevention for which the system has

been put in place”.19

30. Thus, the head of investigation holds that the conditions of article 5.1.e) of the GDPR

have not been respected. He is of the opinion that the auditee failed to respect the principle of

the limitation of data retention arising from Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR.20

31. By letter dated September 30, 2020, the controller explained that the duration of

retention of images recorded by CCTV cameras has been reduced

30 days by his "IT Department" manager in the presence of the agents of the

CNPD during the on-site visit of March 27, 2019. The annexes to the letter from the

September 30, 2020 of the control contain a photograph showing that the

parameters of the video surveillance system have been modified accordingly.

32. During the hearing of February 5, 2021, the controller specified that the duration of

retention of 30 days would be justified by the fact that the images recorded by the

CCTV cameras in server rooms are not checked every

                                                           
18 See Statement of Objections, page 5, Ad.B.2.), point 22.
19 See Statement of Objections, page 5, Ad.B.2.), point 23.
20 See Statement of Objections, page 5, Ad.B.2.), point 24.

10/20

days. The controller also explained that the images are not viewed live,

but only for evidentiary purposes in the event of an incident.

33. The Restricted Committee recalls that it is the responsibility of the controller

to determine, according to each specific purpose, a retention period

appropriate and necessary to achieve that purpose. As mentioned above, the controlled

considers that a 30-day retention period is necessary in order to achieve the

purposes pursued, i.e. the protection of property and the safety of users.

34. With regard to video surveillance, the CNPD considers that the images can

be kept in principle for up to 8 days under the aforementioned principle of

Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR. The data controller may exceptionally, for

duly justified reasons, keep the images for a period of 30 days. A duration of

storage longer than 30 days is generally considered to be

disproportionate.21

35. In the event of an incident or violation, the Restricted Panel is of the opinion that the

images may be kept beyond this period and, if necessary, be

communicated to the competent judicial authorities and law enforcement authorities

competent to establish or prosecute criminal offences.

36. While she can understand the need for the controlled to keep the

images from video surveillance of server rooms, […], for 30 days, it

nevertheless notes that in the minutes of March 27, 2019 relating to the on-site visit

CNPD officials noted that the duration was “4 (four) years 7 (seven) months and

14 (fourteen) weeks” which greatly exceeded the time needed to achieve

the aims pursued.

37. On the basis of all of these elements, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion

of the head of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents,

article 5.1.e) of the GDPR was not respected by the controlled.

C. On the breach of the obligation to appoint a delegate for the protection of

data

1. On the principles

38. In accordance with Article 37.1.a) of the GDPR, the controller designates

in any case a data protection officer when "the processing is

carried out by a public authority or a public body, with the exception of the courts

acting in the exercise of their judicial function. »

39. According to recital (97) of the GDPR “where the processing is carried out by

a public authority, with the exception of courts or judicial authorities

independent bodies acting in the exercise of their judicial function, […] a person

with specialist knowledge of the law and practices relating to

data protection should help the controller or processor to

verify internal compliance with this Regulation. »

40. These obligations have been clarified by the Article 29 Working Party in

its guidelines for Data Protection Officers (DPOs), including the

revised version was adopted on 5 April 2017 and taken over and re-approved by the EDPS who

replaced the Article 29 Working Party, as explained above in point 14.

2. In this case

41. In the statement of objections, the head of the investigation noted that the control

as a municipal administration is to be considered as a public body of

so that he falls under the obligation to appoint a data protection officer

in accordance with the provisions of Article 37.1.a) of the GDPR.22

42. In this context, the head of the investigation explains that the person inspected explained during the

site visit that “the appointment of a data protection officer was not

effectively”. The head of investigation also indicates that the person checked provided explanations

additional information by its aforementioned letter of July 24, 2019, namely "in view of the refusal of the

[…] to carry out the mission of protection delegate for […], the municipality […] would have

then directed to the Data Protection Commissioner, who when checking the

CNPD, had not yet been officially appointed. »23

43. Thus, the head of investigation, after noting that on the day of publication of the

statement of objections the control had not appointed a delegate for the protection of

data,24 concludes that the conditions of Article 37.1.a) of the GDPR have not been

respected. He is of the opinion that the audit failed to comply with the obligation to appoint

a data protection officer arising from Article 37.1.a) of the GDPR.25

44. By letters dated 22 and 30 September 2020, the controller informed the CNPD that a

Data Protection Officer had been appointed “on […]. "  This

appointment is evidenced by a copy of the corresponding deliberation of the College of

Mayor and Aldermen of […] annexed thereto. It is also mentioned in this document

that a working group on data protection had been created as early as […].

45. During the hearing of February 5, 2021, the auditee reiterated his comments contained

in her letters of July 24, 2019, September 22 and 30, 2020. When the President

asked the controlled why he did not appoint as delegate for the protection of

data the government commissioner for data protection in the state,

as envisaged, the controller specified that he preferred to hire another person. Leaving

the Restricted Training finds that during the on-site visit the controller did not name

a data protection officer.

46. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the article

37.1.a) of the GDPR was not respected by the controlled.

The Restricted Panel considers that the new information panel is

intended for the attention of all visitors to the site (officials and employees

councils, employees and third parties). She notes, however, that although the

new information panel installed by the controlled contains more information

that “the information panels […] and the old CNPD vignettes”28

installed at the time of the site visit by CNPD officials, it does not contain

all information required within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR, namely the basis

of lawfulness as required by Article 13.1 c) of the GDPR.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

investigation in this regard.29

letter from the control of September 30, 2020 (camera at [...] of the building) as well as to the

email from the control of January 13, 2021 (camera in the office […]).

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case and point 50 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

when there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this regard.30

- As for the establishment of a retention period policy for data to be

personal character in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, the

controlled adapted, after the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the duration of

retention of data from the video surveillance system of “4 (four)

years 7 (seven) months and 14 (fourteen) weeks » 31 to 30 days. Mail attachments

of September 30, 2020 of the audited contain a photograph showing that

the settings of the video surveillance system have been modified accordingly.

In the present case, the Restricted Panel considers that the duration of

30-day retention of images from the video surveillance of the rooms of

servers is proportionate. In consideration of compliance measures

taken by the auditee and point 50 of this decision, it therefore considers

that there is no need to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this regard.32

- As for the obligation to appoint a data protection officer, the

Restricted Training finds that the control has appointed a protection delegate

data under investigation. The appointment of the delegate for the protection of

data is demonstrated by a copy of the deliberation of the College of

Mayor and Aldermen of […] (meeting of […]) for the purpose of appointing

of a data protection officer attached to the letters of the control of the

September 22 and 30, 2020.

In consideration of the compliance measures taken by the control in

case and point 50 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

when there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this regard.33

54. Under Article 58.2.b) of the GDPR, the CNPD may call to order a

controller or a processor when the processing operations have

resulted in a violation of the provisions of the GDPR.

55. Given the fact that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials

- none of the documentation submitted by the controller contained proof of

that the persons concerned have been validly informed pursuant to Article 13

GDPR,

-

the retention period of the images recorded by the cameras of

video surveillance greatly exceeded the time required to reach the

purposes pursued, and

- no data protection officer had been appointed,

the Restricted Panel considers that it is justified to adopt the corrective measure

proposed by the head of investigation in this regard34 and to issue a call to order to

against the control.

 

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

- to retain the breaches of Articles 5.1.e), 13 and 37.1.a) of the GDPR;

- to pronounce against the municipal administration […] a call to order

for violating Articles 5.1.e), 13 and 37.1.a) of the GDPR;

- to pronounce against the municipal administration […] an injunction to

bring the processing into compliance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR,

within 3 (three) months of notification of the Panel's decision

and in particular, inform third parties, as well as officials, employees and

municipal employees in a clear and complete manner, in accordance with the provisions of
