I. Facts and procedure

 

 

1.

By deliberation no. […] of 23 November 2017, the National Commission

for Data Protection (hereafter: “CNPD”) sitting in plenary session (hereafter:

after: “Plenary Training”) decided to carry out a verification mission to

of Company A on the basis of Article 32.7 of the amended law of August 2, 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and

instruct Mr. Christophe Buschmann to carry out the said mission. The object of the

mission was to check whether the video surveillance system was implemented in

compliance with the amended law of 2 August 2002, law meanwhile repealed by the law of 1

August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for Data Protection

and the general data protection regime (hereinafter: “Law of 1 August 2018”),

as well as with the conditions and restrictions defined in the deliberation n° […] of May 24

2017 National Data Protection Commission authorizing Company A

to operate video surveillance.

2.

Company A is a public limited company registered in the Commercial Register

and Companies in Luxembourg under number […], with registered office at […], L- […] (here-

after: the “controlled”). The controlled [is active in the field of construction

metallic].

3.

On December 12, 2017, CNPD agents carried out a

visit to the premises of the control. The measures put in place by the control following

said visit1 led the Plenary Formation to close the verification mission

cited above by decision no. […] of March 23, 2018.

4.

During its deliberation session on September 28, 2018, the Panel

Plenary had decided to open a new investigation with the auditee on the basis of article

37 of the law of August 1, 2018 and to appoint Mr. Christophe Buschmann as head

of investigation.

5.

According to the decision of the Plenary Formation, the investigation carried out by the

CNPD was intended to verify compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of persons

with regard to the processing of personal data and to the free

movement of this data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter: “GDPR”) and of

the law of August 1, 2018, in particular by setting up a video surveillance system

installed by the controlled.

6.

 On October 5, 2018, CNPD agents visited

in the premises of the controlled.2 The decision of the National Commission for the Protection

data sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of the investigation (hereinafter:

“Restricted Training”) will be limited to processing controlled by CNPD agents.

7.

At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on the date

of January 8, 2019 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case, and more specifically a non-compliance with the requirements prescribed

by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR (right to information) with regard to persons

concerned, i.e. employees and non-employees, i.e. customers,

suppliers, service providers and visitors (hereinafter: “third parties”)

and non-compliance with the requirements of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR (principle of minimization

Datas).

8.

By letter dated January 25, 2019, the inspector made his observations on

statement of objections.

9.

An additional letter to the statement of objections has been sent

to the control dated January 29, 2021. In this letter, the head of investigation proposed to the

Restricted Formation to adopt two corrective measures, which should be

implemented within 1 month, under penalty of a penalty payment of 50 euros per

day of delay, as well as to impose on the person controlled an administrative fine in the amount of

6,000 euro.

10.

By letter dated February 23, 2021, the controller produced observations

written on the supplementary letter to the statement of objections.

11.

The president of the Restricted Formation informed the controller by mail

of April 29, 2021 that his case would be registered for the session of the Restricted Panel of

II. Place

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

A. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1.

On the principles

14.

In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

personnel must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the

with regard to the purposes for which they are processed (minimization of data)”.

15.

The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.3

16.

Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data

must be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not

be further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limited

purposes)”.

17.

Before installing a CCTV system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

                                                           
3 See CNPD Guidelines (Point 4.), available at: https://cnpd.public.lu/fr/dossiers-

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal information collected for other purposes.4

18.

The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

on a case-by-case basis and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.5

2.

In this case

19.

During the on-site visit, CNPD officials noted that the

fields of vision of the cameras installed in the backyard, in front of the large gate and

in the external depot, were modified compared to what they had observed during a

on-site visit on December 12, 2017 as part of the previous verification mission,

so that parts of the public road are no longer captured.6

20.

Regarding the field of view of the camera installed in the workshop

of production [...] the CNPD agents noted that, during working hours,

it is closed off by a metal plate, so that monitoring of employees

in the workplace is excluded. The controller explained that at the end of the working day,

this shutter would be removed by the personnel in order to allow the monitoring of the room in

outside working hours.7

21.

Nevertheless, the CNPD agents found that the camera installed

in the large workshop […] allows permanent monitoring of the employee(s) including

working. When questioned, it was explained to the agents that, most of the time, a

person works alone in this workshop and that the purpose of this permanent monitoring

would be to guarantee the safety of this employee and that the latter would have given his consent.8

22.

With regard to the said camera, the head of investigation was of the opinion that a

permanent monitoring of an employee at his workstation is to be considered as

the CNPD, available

disproportionate, because it can create significant psychological pressure for the

employee who feels and knows he is being watched, especially since the surveillance measures

persist over time and that the employee does not have a means of evading

this monitoring (statement of objections, p.3).

23.

With regard to the argument of the controller that the employee would have marked his

consent to such a surveillance measure, the head of the investigation refers to the “Lines

guidelines on consent within the meaning of Regulation 2016/679” of the Working Group

Article 29 and considers that, in this case, in view of the risk for the employee of incurring

negative consequences in the event of a refusal, the consent of the employee

is not to be considered as freely given.

24.

The control on his side explained in his reply letter to the

statement of objections of 25 January 2019 that henceforth the procedure in place for

the camera installed in the production workshop […], that is to say that the employees block

the camera during working hours by a metal plate, would also be in place

for the camera installed in the large workshop […]. He attached photos to his letter

fields of view of the two cameras.9

25.

La Formation Restreinte would like to remind you that employees have the right not to

not be subject to continuous and permanent surveillance in the workplace. For

achieve the purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a manager of the

processing to install a CCTV system in the workplace. On the contrary, in

respecting the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the

the most protective means of surveillance of the employee's private sphere and, for example,

limit the fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

or the purpose(s) pursued.

26.

The Restricted Committee notes that henceforth the procedure for the camera

installed in the production workshop […] is also in place for the camera installed in

the large workshop […], that is to say that the employees themselves block the camera during

working hours by a metal plate. Nevertheless, even if the controlled had

clarified in his letter of February 20, 2018 that said procedure was already in place for

the two aforementioned cameras10, it notes that on the day of the on-site visit by the

CNPD agents, this was not yet the case for the camera installed in the large

workshop […] which therefore allowed permanent monitoring of the employee(s)

working.

27.

It also considers that even if the purpose indicated by the control is-

that is to say guarantee the safety of its employees, can find one or more bases of legality

under Article 6 of the GDPR, the permanent monitoring of employees is however

consider disproportionate. Moreover, the argument of the controller that the employee,

who works there most of the time alone would have agreed, is to be rejected. The

Restricted Training takes into account in this context the “Guidelines on the

consent within the meaning of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679 of the Working Group Article

29. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter: “EDPS”),

which has replaced the Article 29 Working Group since May 25, 2018, took over and reapproved

the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25, 2018, such as

specifically the aforementioned guidelines on consent.11

28.

These guidelines expressly mention the "imbalance of

balance of power between an employer and the members of his staff” and that indeed

“in view of the dependence resulting from the employer/employee relationship, it is unlikely

that the person concerned is able to refuse to give his consent to his

employer regarding the processing of his data without fear or incurring

negative consequences following this refusal. It is therefore unlikely that an employee will be in

able to respond freely to a request for consent from his or her

employer seeking to activate surveillance systems, such as security cameras

surveillance, in the workplace […] without feeling obliged to consent”12

29.

 Furthermore, the Restricted Panel notes that during the hearing of 14

July 2021 the controller added that the two cameras in question would have been installed at

because of a theft that occurred in his establishment, that therefore the purpose pursued would be the

protection of his property. Nevertheless, compliance with the principle of proportionality implies

that the employer must resort to the most protective means of surveillance in the sphere

private to the employee. In this case, the Restricted Panel considers that the way of proceeding

controlled, i.e. leaving the responsibility of the employees to seal with a plate

metal of said cameras during working hours by employees, who without

closure would allow permanent monitoring of said employees, is to be considered

as disproportionate to the desired end and that means less

invasions of the privacy of the persons concerned exist, such as the

movement of the camera outward or inward limited to the surface strictly

necessary to visualize people entering or leaving.

30.

In addition, as it is the responsibility of the data controller, i.e. in

the species to be checked, to respect and be able to demonstrate compliance with the rules

provided for in the GDPR13, it considers that it is not acceptable for the controller to delegate this

responsibility to its employees who must themselves ensure that the cameras are

closed during working hours.

31.

Thus, the Restricted Panel considers that non-compliance with Article 5.1.c)

of the GDPR had been acquired on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents with regard to

concerns the cameras installed in the large workshop […] and in the production workshop

[…].

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

32.

According to paragraph 1 of article 12 of the GDPR, the “controller of the

processing takes appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles

13 and 14 as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and

Article 34 with regard to the treatment to the data subject in a concise manner,

transparent, understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

33.

Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

collected from this person, the data controller provides him, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

 

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the

representative of the controller;

 

b) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

 

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as

the legal basis for the processing;

  

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

 

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

 

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

transfer of personal data to a third country or to an organization

international community, and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the

Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or Article 49,

paragraph 1, second subparagraph, the reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

 

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

 

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent made before the

withdrawal thereof;

 

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

 

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal nature has a regulatory or contractual nature or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

personal character, as well as on the possible consequences of the non-provision of

those data;

 

f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article

22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information concerning the

underlying logic, as well as the significance and intended consequences of such processing

for the person concerned.

 

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

34.

The communication to the persons concerned of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.14 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”). It should be noted that the EDPS also took over and

re-approved the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.15

2. In this case

35.

CNPD officials observed during their on-site visit that the

CCTV is not reported to those affected by signs

information, pictograms or other means, but that a sticker informing the

number of the video surveillance authorization deliberation issued by the CNPD is

affixed to the front door of the administrative building was the only source of information

compared to the CCTV system. A simple outline of a pictogram,

printed on free paper, was presented to the agents by the control, but "no

proof could not be provided that these pictograms were actually affixed in such a way

permanent after 7 February 2017 (date of formal notice by the CNPD). »

36.

In his Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation clarified that the

"Vignette issued by the CNPD and affixed to the main entrance door is not

nature to irritate this finding, given that since May 25, 2018, video surveillance

is no longer subject to the obligation of prior authorization and that, a fortiori, the authorization

indicated on the said sticker no longer has any legal value. » Lack of evidence

contrary, he thus reproached the person inspected for not having informed the persons concerned

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR.

37.

By letter dated January 25, 2019, the inspector specified that he installed four

places outside the panels.16 Then, by letter dated February 23, 2021, the controller

added that the staff members would have signed a memorandum which would mention

the existence of surveillance cameras. Two signed copies of the said memorandum have

                                                           
14 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.
15 See EDPS Endorsement Decision 1/2018 of 25 May 2018, available

attached to the aforementioned letter (appendix 3), one undated copy and the other dated 9

February 2021.

38.

The Restreinte Committee wishes first of all to point out that Article 13 of the

GDPR refers to the obligation on the controller to “provide”

all the information mentioned therein. The word “provide” is crucial here and it “

means that the controller must take concrete steps to provide

the information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the

data subject to the location of such information (for example by means of

a direct link, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

39.

It also believes that a multi-level approach to

Communicating transparency information to data subjects can be

used in an offline or non-digital context, i.e. in an environment

real, such as personal data collected by means of a

CCTV system. The first level of information (warning sign,

information note, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, as well as the information

having the greatest impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise

the persons concerned, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (for example, via a QR code or a website address).17 The

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

non-salaried third parties18.

40.

Regarding the first level of information, the Restricted Training

notes that even if the controller had specified in his letter of February 20, 2018 that

traffic signs showing a surveillance camera would have already been

                                                           
17 Cf.WP260 rev 01 (point 38) and EDPS Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data
by video devices, version 2.0, adopted on January 29, 2020 (points 114. and 117.).

attached19, she noted that during the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the only

source of information in relation to the video surveillance system for employees and

third parties was the old sticker affixed to the entrance door of the building

administrative and informative

the number of

the deliberation of authorization of

the

CCTV issued by the CNPD. However, as these vignettes were issued

by the CNPD under the former authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002 relating

the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018, they have become obsolete and since

the entry into force of the GDPR, other rules in this area are applicable. Thereby,

no document contained the required elements of the first level of information for

employees and third parties.

41.

With regard to the second level of information20, the Training

Restricted notes that such information intended for employees and third parties

was non-existent at the time of the site visit by CNPD officials. She notices

however, in his letters of January 25, 2019 and February 23, 2021, the auditee

clarified that he installed in four places outside the panels and that the members of the

staff would have signed a memorandum which would mention the existence of security cameras

surveillance. However, the Restricted Panel finds that the pictograms and said

memorandum do not contain all the information required under Article

13 GDPR.

42.

In view of the foregoing, it agrees with the opinion of the head of investigation and concludes

that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 13 of the GDPR was not

complied with by the control in terms of video surveillance as far as employees are concerned

and third parties.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

1. On the principles

43.

 In accordance with article 12 of the law of August 1, 2018, the CNPD has

the power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

44.

In accordance with article 48 of the law of August 1, 2018, the CNPD may

impose administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except for

against the State or the municipalities.

45.

Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority ensures that

that the administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective,

proportionate and dissuasive, before specifying the elements that must be taken into

account in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and in deciding the

amount of this fine:

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

_____________________________________________________________

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

 

15/24



 

 

 

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the violation. »

46.

The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the facts taken into account in

the context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The

any changes relating to the processing of data under investigation

occurred subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish entirely or

partial compliance, do not allow a breach to be reversed retroactively

found.

47.

Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

48.

In the supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 29

January 2021, the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel to impose a fine

administrative control for an amount of six thousand (6,000) euros.

49.

In his letter of February 23, 2021, the controller wonders why a

fine of such an amount would be justified considering its efforts to comply with the

rules in this regard.

50.

In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to

decide, where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into

includes the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

51.

As to the nature and seriousness of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR),

it notes that with regard to breaches of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, they are

constituting breaches of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and of the law of the

data protection in general), namely the principle of data minimization

devoted to Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR. Note that at the time of the site visit

by CNPD agents, the camera installed in the large workshop […] allowed the

permanent supervision of at least one employee.

52.

As regards the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that the information

and transparency relating to the processing of personal data are

essential obligations incumbent on data controllers so that data subjects

are fully aware of the use that will be made of their personal data

staff, once collected. A breach of Article 13 of the GDPR is thus

constituting an infringement of the rights of the persons concerned. This right to information has

have also been strengthened under the GDPR, which demonstrates their very importance.

particular. It should be noted that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, all

the persons concerned, i.e. employees and third parties, were

only informed of the implementation of the video surveillance system by a

old sticker affixed to the entrance door of the administrative building and providing information

the number of the video surveillance authorization deliberation issued by the CNPD

under the old regime provided for by the repealed law of 2 August 2002 on the protection of

individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.

53.

As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restreinte finds that these shortcomings have lasted over time, at least since

May 25, 2018 and until the day of the site visit. She recalls here that two years have

_____________________________________________________________

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

separated the entry into force of the GDPR from its entry into application to allow

controllers to comply with their obligations. Especially

more, an obligation to respect the principle of minimization, just like an obligation

comparable information already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1.b), 10.2 and 26 of

the repealed law of 2 August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing

personal data. Guidance on principles and obligations

provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular through

mandatory prior authorizations for video surveillance and guidance

available on the CNPD website.

54.

As for the number of data subjects (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the

Formation Restreinte notes that these are […]21 employees working on the premises of the

controlled, as well as all third parties visiting said premises.

55.

As to whether the breaches were committed

deliberately or not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training

recalls that "not deliberately" means that there was no intention to commit the

breach, although the controller has not complied with the duty of care

incumbent on him under the law, which is the case here.

56.

As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article

83.2.f) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel takes into account the assertion of the head of investigation

that the co-operation of the auditee throughout the investigation was good.22

57.

As for the measures taken by the controlled party to mitigate the damage suffered

by the persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of this decision

for the related explanations.

58.

As to the relevant violations previously committed by

the

controller or processor (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training

decides to take into account only the facts noted at the start of the investigation carried out on 5

October 2018 by CNPD officials, i.e. after the entry into force

of the GDPR.

59.

The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

60.

It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the

checked in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these have not

adopted only following the control of CNPD agents on October 5, 2018

(see also point 42 of this decision).

61.

Therefore, the Restricted Committee considers that the pronouncement of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR.

62.

As regards the amount of the administrative fine, it recalls that the

paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple infringements, such as

this is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for

the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

63.

In view of the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above

before, the Restricted Panel considers that the pronouncement of a fine of two hundred

(200) euros appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the

requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

2.2. About taking corrective action

64.

In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 29

January 2021 the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel to adopt the measures

following corrective measures, which should be implemented within 1 month, under

fine of 50 euros per day of delay:

“1. Order the person in charge of the

supplement treatment

measures

information intended for persons concerned by video surveillance,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR in

indicating in particular the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the

processing and its legal basis, the categories of data processed, the interests

legitimate interests pursued by the control, the recipients, the retention period of the

data as well as the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of

exercise ;

2. Order the controller to put in place measures to avoid

to film employees permanently or almost permanently on their

personal work places. »

65.

As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of the investigation and by

reference to point 43 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the controller, following the on-site visit by CNPD agents,

in order to comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed

in his letters of January 25, 2019, of February 23, 2021, as well as in his email of

July 14, 2021. More specifically, it takes note of the following facts:

- With regard to the implementation of information measures intended for persons

concerned (third parties and employees) by video surveillance, in accordance

to the provisions of Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller has specified in its

letters of January 25, 2019 and February 23, 2021 that he installed in four places

outside the signs and that the staff members would have signed a

memorandum which would mention the existence of surveillance cameras. To his

email of July 14, 2021, the controller also attached a photo showing

that the old vignette indicating the number of the authorization deliberation

video surveillance issued by the CNPD under the former regime of the repealed law

of 2 August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of

personal data is always affixed to the front door of the

administrative building.

The Restricted Formation would first like to point out that the old vignettes

of the CNPD have become obsolete, because they were issued by the CNPD under

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

20/24

 

 

 

 



 

the former authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002 relating to the

protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data

personnel which was repealed by the law of August 1, 2018. Then, it notes that

the aforementioned signs are just posters of a camera without text

supplement, while the aforementioned memorandum only mentions what

follows: […]

The Restricted Panel considers that the panels and the memorandum do not

do not contain the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR.

Thus, the identity and contact details of the controller, the purposes of the

processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the

legal basis for processing, recipients or categories of recipients

personal data, the retention period of the data to

personal nature, the existence of the right to ask the person responsible for the

processing access to personal data, rectification or

the erasure of these, or a limitation of the processing relating to the person

concerned, or the right to oppose the processing and the right to the portability of the

data, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with an authority of

control are not mentioned.

Furthermore, it is noted that the information provided by the controller does not

fulfill neither the conditions required for the first level of information, nor those for the

second level of information (see point 35).

In conclusion, considering the insufficient compliance measures

taken by the auditee in this case and point 43 of this decision, the

Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 52

first point with regard to the information of employees and persons

third parties regarding the video surveillance system.

- As to the obligation to only process data that is relevant, adequate and

limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of user safety

and accident prevention, the Restricted Panel notes that the controller has

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

21/24

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

explained in his letter of January 25, 2019 that henceforth the procedure in

place for the camera installed in the production workshop […], that is to say that the

employees block the camera during working hours with a plate

metal, would also be in place for the camera installed in the large workshop […],

so that no employee would be subject to permanent surveillance. He has

attached to his letter photos of the fields of view of the two cameras.23

Nevertheless, as mentioned in point 29 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte considers that the manner in which the audit is carried out should be considered as

disproportionate to the purpose pursued, i.e. the protection of

assets of the controlled, and that means less intrusive to the privacy of

people involved exist. She also considers that the assertion of the

controlled contained in his letter of February 23, 2021 only between seven a.m. and 4 p.m.

hours the images from video surveillance would not be recorded,

is not likely to irritate this observation. Indeed, compliance with the principle of

proportionality implies that the employer must resort to means of surveillance

the most protective of the employee's private sphere. In this case, in view of the

configuration of the premises and taking into account the purpose pursued by the controller,

the Restricted Panel considers that the two cameras in question must be limited

to film the only places of access to the establishment of the controlled and that they must

have a field of vision limited to the area strictly necessary to visualize

people about to access it.

In conclusion, considering the insufficient compliance measures

taken by the auditee in this case and point 43 of this decision, the

Restricted Panel therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce the measure

correction proposed by the head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 52

second point.

The Restricted Committee nevertheless considers that there is no need to impose a

on the controlled person to compel him to comply with the two corrective measures.
