I. Facts and procedure

1. During its deliberation session of 17 July 2020, the National Commission sitting in

plenary formation (hereafter: the “Plenary Formation”) has decided to open an investigation

with Company A on the basis of article 37 of the law of August 1, 2018 on the organization

of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime on the

data protection (hereinafter: the “Law of 1 August 2018”) and to designate Mr.

Christophe Buschmann as head of investigation.

The said decision specified that the investigation carried out by the National Commission for the

data protection (hereinafter: the “CNPD” or the “National Commission”) had

for the purpose of monitoring the application and compliance with the GDPR and the law of August 1, 2018, and

specifically compliance with Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.

2. Company A is a […] registered in the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register

under number […], with registered office at L-[…], […] (hereinafter: the “controlled”).

The controlled [is active in the operation of internet portals and the provision of services via these

portals]1.

 

3. The decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation (hereafter: the

“Restricted Training”) on the outcome of the investigation will be based:

 

 on the processing carried out by the controller in relation to the operation of the site

internet […] and the mobile application […] (hereinafter: the “website”

respectively the “mobile application”) and checked by CNPD agents;

And

 

 on the legal and regulatory provisions taken into account by the head

inquiry in its Statement of Objections.

4. By letter dated August 26, 2020, the head of investigation sent a preliminary questionnaire to the

control. This moment is later referred to in this decision as "at the beginning

of the investigation ". The controller replied by letter dated September 16, 2020. After a visit

on the spot which took place on October 13, 2020, the control and the investigation service of the CNPD

exchanged letters.2

5. Following this exchange, the head of investigation drew up Investigation Report No. […] based on the

deliberation of July 17, 2020 relating to compliance with Articles 12 point 1, 13 and 14 of the

GDPR dated April 27, 2021 (hereinafter: the “Investigation Report”).

It appears from the investigation report3 that in order to structure the investigation work, the chief

investigation has defined nine control objectives, namely:

1) Make sure the information is available;

2) Ensure that the information is complete;

3) Ensure that the absence of information is motivated by a valid exception;

4) Ensure that information is transmitted by appropriate means;

5) Ensure that information is concise, transparent, understandable, and

conveyed in clear and simple terms;

6) Ensure that the information is adapted to the category of persons concerned;

7) Ensure that information is free;

8) Ensure that information is easily accessible and

9) Ensure that the information is transmitted during the key stages of the processing.

It is specified in the investigation report that the CNPD agents did not check “the

legality of the processing carried out by the controller”. In this context, it is given

the following example: “in the event that the controller informs the persons

concerned that their personal data are kept for a period

2 years, CNPD officials will be able to check that the controller does not

not retain said data for a different period. On the other hand, the agents of the

                                                           
2 See Statement of Objections, point 9 for a detailed list of exchanges throughout the investigation.

CNPD will not comment on the legality of this 2-year period applied by the

controller. »4

In addition, the survey focused on users of the website and the application

mobile, and did not target other categories of data subjects such as employees

controlled.5

The investigation report is annexed to the documents collected by the investigation department of the

CNPD and on which the investigation report is based (appendix 1), as well as the

report of the on-site visit by CNPD agents of October 13, 2020 mentioned above (appendix

2) (hereinafter: the “Report”).

6. It also emerges from the investigation report that the auditee “acts both as a subcontractor

of [customers] by providing them with an […] online service and by processing personal data

on their behalf, and as data controller in the context of the management of

data relating to [customers] having a user account on the website […]. » 6

Given that the CNPD agents only analyzed the processing carried out

implemented by the controller as controller "for [customers] who create

an account on the site or mobile application, solely for account data

[…]”7, the decision of the Restricted Panel will be limited to said processing. THE

processing implemented by the controller as a subcontractor of [customers] in the

framework of the […] online service are therefore not analyzed in this Decision.

7. During its deliberation session of July 23, 2021, the Plenary Formation appointed

Mr. Marc Lemmer, commissioner, as head of investigation replacing

Mr. Christophe Buschmann, resigned.

8. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on

13 January 2022 a Statement of Objections (hereinafter: “Statement of Objections”)

detailing the shortcomings that he considered constituted in this case in relation to the requirements

prescribed by Article 12.1 of the GDPR (transparency obligation).

The head of investigation proposed to the Restricted Panel to adopt four measures

different corrective measures, as well as to impose on the person controlled an administrative fine of one

amount of 3,700 euros.

9. The audited replied to the statement of objections by email dated February 10, 2022.

10. By letter dated May 20, 2022, the president of the Restricted Formation informed the controlled

that his case would be registered for the Restricted Panel session of July 6, 2022 and

that he could attend this meeting. The controller has confirmed his presence at the said meeting

as of May 31, 2022.

11. During this session the head of investigation, Mr. Marc Lemmer, was present. Control

was represented by […] and by […]. The head of investigation and the representatives of the control

presented their oral observations in support of their written observations and replied to the

questions asked by the Restricted Panel. The Restricted Formation gave the

checked the possibility of sending additional information within a week

requested during that session. The controller spoke last.

12. By email of July 7, 2022, the controller sent the additional information

requested by the Restricted Panel during the meeting of July 6, 2022.

II. Place

II. 1. On the reasons for the decision

On the breach of the obligation of transparency

1. On the principles

13. According to Article 12.1 of the GDPR, the “controller shall take measures

appropriate to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as to

carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 with regard to

concerns processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent,

understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms, in particular for

any information intended specifically for a child. The information is provided by

in writing or by other means including, where appropriate, electronically.

When the data subject so requests, the information may be provided

orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is demonstrated by other

means. »

14. Transparency is a fundamental aspect of the principles relating to the treatment of

personal data.8 The obligations in this area have been clarified by the

Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on transparency within the meaning of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which was adopted on April 11, 2018 (hereinafter:

“WP 260 rev.01” or the “transparency guidelines”).

 

These guidelines explain in particular the general rules of transparency

established by Article 12 of the GDPR, and which are applicable to the communication of information

to data subjects (Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR), to communications addressed

to data subjects regarding the exercise of their rights (Articles 15 to 22 of the

GDPR), and communications regarding data breaches (Article 34 of the

GDPR).9

They underline that a “primary aspect of the principle of transparency highlighted in

these provisions is that the data subject should be able to determine at

in advance what the scope and consequences of the processing encompass in order not to be

taken unawares at a later stage as to how his personal data

personnel were used”.10

15. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereafter: the “EDPS”), which

succeeded the Article 29 Working Party on 25 May 2018, took over and reapproved the

documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25, 2018, as

specifically the aforementioned guidelines on transparency11.

2. In this case

2.1. Regarding the requirement to provide information in a “concise and transparent” way

16. In the context of objective 212 the head of investigation expected, among other things, that “the

following information is accessible through the data protection policy,

in accordance with the appendix to the guidance of the Article 29 Working Party on

information to be communicated to a data subject under Article 13

or Article 14 of the GDPR:

[…] The categories of data processed (cf. Tests 5 and 16) […]”13.

CNPD officials therefore inspected “the register of processing activities to

identify whether, for each category of data listed in the register and for which

users of the website or platform are identified as a category of

persons concerned, mention is made in the policy. » 14

17. From the statement of objections it is apparent in this context that “[i]n the context of

the analysis of the processing carried out by the Controlee and the information provided by the

controller to the data subjects on said processing, it has been

found that the data protection policy did not mention the processing of

location data, although mentioned in the processing register. »

Thus, the head of the investigation held that "the conditions of article 12.1 of the GDPR with regard to the

principles of fairness and transparency have not been fully respected”.15

18. The Restricted Committee recalls that Article 12.1 of the GDPR requires, among other things, that

required information is provided in a transparent manner.

She notes that the Transparency Guidelines state that “an aspect

of the principle of transparency highlighted in these provisions is that the

data subject should be able to determine in advance what the scope and

the consequences of the processing include so as not to be caught unawares at a

later stage as to how his personal data has been

used. 16 It follows that the data controller must provide data subjects

concerned accurate and complete information on all processing

performed on their personal data.

19. The Restricted Committee notes that according to the register of processing activities that the

controlled sent by email dated September 19, 202017 to the head of investigation (hereinafter: the

“register”), location data could indeed be collected as part of

of three different treatments called "[...]", "[...]" and "[...]". On the other hand, the policy

of confidentiality extracted by the head of investigation from the website of the audited dated 19

August 202018 (hereinafter: the “Privacy Policy”) only mentioned that the

monitored may collect "traffic information for each call or session

Internet”19 without indicating the collection of location data.

 

20. Nevertheless, it results from a combined reading of the "[...]" and "[...]" tabs of the register of the

controlled only the persons concerned by one of the three processing operations in the context of which

location data is collected are not users of the site or

the controlled’s mobile application, but its employees20, while for the other two

processing in question, the controller acts solely as a subcontractor [of clients] .21

Based on the aforementioned limitations of the scope of the investigation in question22, that is to say

say that the survey focused on users of the website and the application

mobile and did not target other categories of data subjects such as employees

of the controlled, on the one hand, and that the CNPD agents only analyzed the

processing implemented by the controller as controller, on the other

hand, the Restricted Panel, after analysis, does not consider this breach of Article

12.1 GDPR in this specific context.

2.2. As to the requirement to provide information in an "easily accessible" way

2.2.1. Regarding updates to the privacy policy

21. In the context of objective 423 the head of investigation expected, among other things, that

“that all substantial updates to the data protection policy

are the subject of active communication (informative e-mail, pop-up on the website,

etc.) with a summary of the (main) modifications (cf. Test 5). »24

In this context, it emerges from the investigation report that according to the explanations of the controller

“in the event of a substantial modification of the data protection policy, only the

[customers] were

actively informed. Company A does not inform

systematically users […]. »25

22. For this reason, the head of the investigation held that the "conditions of article 12,

paragraph 1 of the GDPR regarding the accessibility of information (at the level of updates)

have not been respected. »26

23. Restricted Training refers in this context to the guidelines on the

transparency indicating that the "controller should respect the same

principles when communicating the initial opinion or declaration on the protection of life

privacy and any subsequent material changes to this notice or this

declaration” and “that a change notification should always be communicated

by a suitable means (for example, e-mail, postal mail, pop-up window on a

web page or other means that effectively captures the attention of the data subject)

specifically devoted to modification (for example, separate from a content of

direct marketing), and this communication must comply with the requirements of Article 12

[…]. The information contained in the privacy notice or statement

stating that the data subject should regularly check the notice or statement

on privacy in order to find out about any changes or updates are

considered not only insufficient. »27

24. It further notes that the obligation to inform data subjects in the event of

substantial changes to the privacy policy was the responsibility of the controlled

only with regard to users who have created an account on its website

or through the mobile app. Indeed, during the Restricted Training session of July 6

2022, the control explained that the [customers] assume the function of responsible for the

processing concerning the personal data of users who do not have

account and that it would therefore be incumbent, if necessary, on the said [clients] to inform these

users in the event of substantial changes to the privacy policy.

25. Said policy mentioned in this context that [if we change the policy in such a way

important, a notice will be posted on our site with the update].28 In addition, the

Restricted Training takes into account the affirmation of the controlled only in the event of changes

major incompatible with the purpose for which the data was collected, it

would require a renewal of consent.29

26. It nevertheless considers that these findings do not negate the fact that users with

created an account with the auditee were not systematically informed in a manner

active of a substantial modification of the privacy policy and that therefore the

inspected breached the obligation of transparency at the start of the CNPD investigation

arising from Article 12.1 of the GDPR, and more specifically from the requirement to provide the

information required in an easily accessible manner.

2.2.2. At the level of the links to the collection points in the mobile application

27. In the context of objective 830 the head of investigation expected, among other things, that on

"the mobile application, the information relating to the protection of privacy must be

easily accessible, before and after downloading the application (see Tests 3 and

4).»31

The CNPD agents therefore “inspected Company A’s mobile application to

assess the ease of access to information relating to the protection of privacy, a

once the mobile application has been downloaded. »

28. According to the statement of objections “it was found that certain collection points of

data on the mobile app contained broken links. 32 More concretely, the

“redirection link to the contact form as well as the link to the […] were

broken. »33

Thus, the head of investigation held that the conditions of article 12.1 of the GDPR "as to

the accessibility of

information

(in terms of communications) have not been

respected. »34

29. The Restricted Committee recalls that Article 12.1 of the GDPR requires, among other things, that

required information must be provided in an easily accessible manner.

She notes that the Transparency Guidelines state that “the criterion

"easily accessible" means that the data subject should not have to

search for information but should be able to access it immediately: for example, these

information could be communicated to the persons concerned directly or to the

means of a link that would be addressed to them”35 and that they recommend for a context in

line that a "link to the privacy statement or notice is provided

at the point of collection of the personal data, or that this information is

can be viewed on the same page where the personal data is

collected”36.

30. The Restricted Panel wishes to specify that it is not called into question once

the user connected to the mobile application after downloading it, a section

"Privacy Policy" appears clearly in the main menu on the left, even

if the user does not have a user account.37 However, it notes that it was

indeed documented by screenshots taken by CNPD officials38 only after

the download of said application, the links to the “Contact us” pages and to

the […] were broken.

It therefore considers that the unavailability of its two links does not meet the requirement of

GDPR Article 12.1 to provide the required information in an easily

accessible.

31. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of the head of investigation and

concludes that at the start of the CNPD's investigation, the control failed in the obligation to

transparency arising from Article 12.1 of the GDPR, and more specifically from the requirement of

provide the required information in an easily accessible manner.

32. As for the measures taken by control after the on-site visit by CNPD agents,

the Restricted Panel comes back to this in point 44, as well as in Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of this

decision.

2.3. As for the requirements to provide information in a way that is "understandable" and "in

clear and simple terms” in terms of information on cookies

33. In the context of objective 539 the head of investigation expected, among other things, in “what

concerns cookies and other tracers […] that specific information such as

defined in objective 2 are also understandable, specific and precise for

each type of cookie present on the site (cf. Test 4).”40

He noted in this context the following: “In the privacy policy there is

amalgamation between [service A] and [service B] which are 2 different services and not "a

service […]” (PIECE 1 p.13) which implies that one cannot use one without

the other (cf. Test 4).

There is an incomprehensible sentence in the privacy policy (PIECE 1 p.13) “

[…]”41

34. Based on these findings, the head of investigation therefore concluded in the communication of the

objections that “the conditions of Article 12(1) of the GDPR as to the nature

comprehensible information have not been complied with. »42

35. The Restricted Committee recalls that if the use of cookies leads, in addition to the deposit or

reading information on the user's terminal equipment regulated by law

of May 30, 2005 relating to the specific provisions for the protection of the person

with regard to the processing of personal data in the sector of

electronic communications, the collection (or any other processing) of personal data

personal nature (for example, when cookies are used to collect

data on the purchasing preferences of a specific user), all the rules of the

GDPR will also have to be respected, which implies that information in accordance with articles

12 to 14 of the GDPR will have to be provided to data subjects.43

Indeed, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union44 has confirmed that it is

possible that the processing falls both within the material scope of the Directive

“privacy and electronic communications”45 and that of the GDPR.46

36. Thus, Article 12.1 of the GDPR requires, among other things, that the required information must be

provided in an understandable way. The Restricted Committee notes that the lines

Transparency Guidelines state that “the requirement that such information be

“understandable” means that they should be able to be understood by the majority of the

targeted audience. Comprehensibility is closely linked to the requirement to use terms

clear and simple. A data controller knows the persons about whom

it collects information and can use this knowledge to determine what

that this audience would be likely to understand. »47

Furthermore, “the requirement for clear and simple terms means that the information should

be provided in the simplest way possible, avoiding phrases and structures

complex linguistics. The information should be concrete and reliable; they don't

should not be formulated in abstract or ambiguous terms or leave room for

different interpretations. More specifically, the purposes and legal bases of the

processing of personal data should be clear. »48

37. The Restricted Committee notes that the two points criticized by the head of investigation, i.e.

say the amalgam between the services "[A]" and "[B]", as well as the presence of a sentence

incomprehensible, were found in the same paragraph of the policy of

confidentiality of the control. The wording of the said paragraph, found in section

“Cookies and other technologies” of said policy, was the following: “[…]”

 

38. She considers that this information is not provided in the simplest way possible

and that they include complex linguistic sentences and structures. From reading the

two paragraphs involved, it is not clear to the person concerned how the

personal data collected by means of a cookie (IP address, time

access, access duration) via [services A and B] are processed for the purpose of analyzing

access to websites and improving the Internet presence of the controlled. It does not come out

for example not from the privacy notice if the data is automatically collected by

controlled and transmitted [to a third country], if the person concerned must give his

prior consent to this data collection and subsequent transfer or if it

must proactively disable tracking by services [A and B] in its browser.

 

Furthermore, this part of the privacy policy specifically mentions

incomprehensible that this follow-up by departments [A and B] "[...]" All the more so, as the

mentions the head of investigation in his statement of objections, there “was amalgam between

“[Service A]” and “[Service B]” in the Privacy Policy. These are two

different services and not of a single service […] as indicated in the policy of

Data protection. The wording used implies that one cannot

use a service without

the other. 49 In addition,

THE

term "[...]" is immediately

incomprehensible.

39. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of the head of investigation and

concludes that at the start of the CNPD's investigation, the control failed in the obligation to

transparency arising from Article 12.1 of the GDPR, and more specifically from the requirements of

provide the required information in a way that is understandable and in terms that are clear and

simple.

II. 2. On the fine and corrective measures

1. On the principles

40. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the National Commission has

41. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose fines

administrative as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against the State or

of the municipalities.

42. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that fines

administrative measures imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and the extent to which the controller or processor notified the

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

43. The Restricted Committee would like to point out that the facts taken into account in the context of the

this Decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

44. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the control to comply with the

the GDPR during the investigation procedure or to remedy the shortcomings identified

by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken into account by the

Restricted training as part of any corrective measures to be taken

and/or setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

45. In the statement of objections, the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel to

pronounce against the controlled an administrative fine relating to the amount of

3,700 euro.

46. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide, if

applicable, of the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel analyzes the criteria set

by article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As for the nature and seriousness of the violation (article 83.2 a) of the GDPR), it recalls in

with regard to the breach of Article 12 of the GDPR, that the applicable transparency

to the processing of personal data is an essential obligation weighing

on data controllers so that people are fully

aware of the use that will be made of their personal data, a

once collected. A breach of this article of the GDPR is thus constitutive

of an infringement of the rights of the persons concerned. The right to transparency and the

right to information have also been strengthened under the GDPR, which testifies

of their particular importance.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel finds

that these shortcomings have lasted over time, at least since the beginning of

the investigation and until, if necessary, a possible modification of the policy of

Data protection. It recalls that guidance relating to the principles and

obligations provided for in the GDPR was available from the CNPD, in particular on

its website.

- As for the number of data subjects (article 83.2. a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restricted finds that these are the […] users who are registered on […].50 Durant

the Restricted Training session of July 6, 2022, the controller specified that by

“users” are only referred to […]. The Luxembourg platform is by

elsewhere “used by more than […] [clients]. »51

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately or not

(by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel recalls that "no

deliberately” means that there was no intention to commit the violation, although

the controller or the processor has not complied with the obligation to

due diligence required by law.

In this case, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that the facts and breaches

observed do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of the

control.

- As to the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority (Article 83.2. f) of the

GDPR), the Restricted Panel takes into account the statement of the head of investigation according to

which the auditee has shown constructive participation throughout

investigation.52

- As for the categories of personal data concerned (article 83.2.g) of the

GDPR), it should be taken into account that, even if the control does not store any

document […], it nevertheless processes data […].53

- As for the measures taken by the inspected party to mitigate the damage suffered by the

persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of this decision

for the related explanations.

47. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR are not

neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the imposition of a fine

administrative and its amount.

48. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the control in order to

remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these were only adopted

following the launch of the investigation by CNPD agents on August 26, 2020

(see also point 43 of this decision).

49. Therefore, the Restricted Panel considers that the imposition of an administrative fine

is justified with regard to the criteria set out in Article 83.2 of the GDPR for breach of

GDPR article 12.1.

50. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel recalls that

Article 83.5 of the GDPR provides that violations of the rights enjoyed by individuals

concerned under Articles 12 to 22 of the GDPR may be subject to fines

administrative costs of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company,

up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, the amount

higher being retained.

51. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the Training

Restricted considers that the imposition of a fine of two thousand five hundred (2,500) euros

appears to be both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of

GDPR Article 83.1.

2.2 Regarding the taking of corrective measures

52. In the statement of objections, the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel

to adopt the following corrective measures: “within a period of 1 month from the

notification to Control of the decision taken by the Restricted Training:

Order, pursuant to Article 58 (2) d) of the GDPR, the Controlled to comply with

Article 12 (1) of the GDPR by making the following changes:

To. Update the data protection policy by including the information

regarding the processing of location data;

b. Review the methods used to communicate to the persons concerned the

update of the data protection policy in order to ensure that the modifications

can be read by most recipients with the use of a suitable medium

and specifically devoted to said modifications;

________________________________________________________________________

19/23

vs. Add redirect link to data protection policy to points

collecting information in the mobile application;

d. Clarify the information relating to cookies contained in the policy of

data protection by correcting the incomprehensible sentence on cookies and by

distinguishing between “[service A]” and “[service B]”54.

 

53. As to the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and with reference to point

44 of this decision, the Restricted Panel takes into account the procedures

carried out by the controller in order to comply with the provisions of article 12.1 of the GDPR,

as detailed in his emails of February 10, 2022 and July 7, 2022. More

in particular, it takes note of the following facts:

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under a) of point

52 of this decision concerning the update of the data protection policy

data including information on the processing of data from

location, the Restricted Panel refers to point 20 of this decision

concerning the limitations of the scope of the survey in question to users of the site

internet and the mobile application, as well as to the processing implemented by the controller

as controller. For these reasons, it does not rule on the

corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and repeated in point 52 of

this Decision under (a).

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under b) of point

52 of this Decision concerning the procedures used to communicate to

data subjects the updating of the data protection policy in order to

ensure that changes can be read by most recipients with

the use of a means adapted and specifically dedicated to the said modifications, the

Restricted Formation would first like to reiterate (see point 24 of this decision)

that the obligation to inform the persons concerned in the event of changes

substantial portions of the Privacy Policy rests with the Controller solely insofar as

which concerns users who have created an account on its website or via

the mobile application, whereas [clients] should inform users without

account.

In his email of February 20, 2022 addressed to the CNPD investigation department, the

controlled specified that it had developed a procedure to ensure that users

having created an account would be informed by e-mail in the event of modifications to the

processing related to their account. To this end, the amendments would be clearly

marked to guarantee transparent and easily accessible information,

allowing users to respond to such changes. The controlled there is by

elsewhere indicated that it intends to notify its users in the coming weeks on

adjustments made to the privacy policy.55

Following the request of the Restricted Panel during the hearing of July 6, 2022, the

controlled emailed July 7, 2022 evidence that an email with a link

to the new privacy policy was sent dated […] 2022 to the

users with an account.

However, by reading the said email, the Restricted Panel finds that, even if it is

specifically devoted to updating the privacy policy, it mentions

only with respect to the content of the changes that [the auditee revises its

privacy policy for the sole purpose of improving the distinction between its activities

commercial and the services and products offered to its customers], but that the

concrete changes compared to the previous version of the policy of

confidentiality are not further specified. By opening the link to the news

privacy policy included, changes are also not

specifically highlighted. This notification of modification therefore does not respect

not all the requirements of Article 12 of the GDPR, i.e. it is not

addressed to users in an easily accessible manner. However, the Restricted Formation

considers that users must be informed, at each update, of the

changes from the previous version of the data protection policy

data.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the control

in this case and point 44 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

as soon as it is necessary to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation

in this respect and taken up in point 52 of this decision under b).

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under c) of point

52 of this decision concerning the addition of a redirect link to the policy of

data protection at information collection points in the app

mobile, the controller has already indicated in his email of February 20, 2022 addressed to the

CNPD investigation service have immediately modified the broken links

concerned, stating that it was an "IT bug".

 

The Restricted Panel finds that the links in question now work.

 

In consideration of the sufficient compliance measures taken by the control

in this case and point 44 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

when there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this respect and taken up in point 52 of this decision under c).

 

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under d) of point

52 of this decision concerning the clarification of information relating to

cookies contained in the data protection policy by correcting the sentence

incomprehensible about cookies and making a distinction between [service A]” and

“[service B]”, the controlled indicated in his email of February 20, 2022 addressed to the

CNPD investigation department have adjusted these two points in its policy of

privacy.

By reading the version of the privacy policy emailed to him on July 7

2022, the Restricted Panel finds that the incomprehensible sentence mentioning

a "[...]" no longer appears there, while parts 10.1, 10.2 and 12.2 of said policy

separately specify the processing implemented by the different services used

of […].

In consideration of the sufficient compliance measures taken by the control

in this case and point 44 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

when there is no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this regard and taken up in point 52 of this decision under d).
