As of April 17, 2019, the National Commission for the Protection of

(hereinafter: “CNPD”) received a complaint informing the CNPD of

potential violations of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Parliament

European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 relating to the protection of natural persons

with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such

data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter: “GDPR”) by Mr. X,

dentist, through a video surveillance system installed in his

medical office located at L-[…], […].

 During its deliberation session on September 13, 2019, the Commission

Data Protection Authority sitting in plenary session (hereafter:

"Plenary Training") therefore decided to open an investigation with Mr. X, who

exercises a liberal activity as a dentist, on the basis of article 37 of the law

of August 1, 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the Protection of

data and the general data protection regime (hereinafter: "Law of 1 August

2018”) and to appoint Mr. Thierry Lallemang as head of investigation.

 The said decision specified that the purpose of the investigation conducted by the CNPD was to

monitor the application and compliance with the GDPR and the law of August 1, 2018, and more

precisely by setting up video surveillance systems where necessary

installed in the medical office of Mr. X, located at L-[…], […], and if necessary, by any

other entity concerned by the processing carried out on its behalf.

 During its deliberation of September 3, 2021, the Plenary Formation appointed

Alain Herrmann, commissioner, as head of investigation replacing

Mr Thierry Lallemang.

 By email of December 20, 2022, the head of investigation sent the file

of inquiry to the National Commission for Data Protection sitting in

restricted formation (hereinafter: the “Restricted Formation”), together with a

closure proposal pursuant to Article 10.2.a) of the Rules of Procedure of the

CNPD, while the natural person against whom the investigation had been opened

died so that the inquest became moot.

 The Restricted Panel examined the case during the deliberation session of the

January 18, 2023.

It appears from the investigation file that the CNPD agents presented themselves in

dated November 15, 2019 and November 9, 2022 at the medical office of Mr. X,

located at L-[…], […], but that neither Mr. X nor a representative of the medical practice could

be met on site. In addition, a letter sent by CNPD officials

to Doctor X dated December 1, 2022 remained unanswered. It turned out by

following that Mr. X, dentist, had died on […] 2022, as evidenced by

a funeral announcement of […] 2022 informing the public of the death of the

deceased, attached to the investigation file.

 Therefore, as the natural person against whom the investigation had

been opened has died, the Restricted Formation agrees with the proposal of the chief

of investigation and considers that the investigation should be closed in accordance with Article 10.2.a) of the

above-mentioned rules of procedure.

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation, after having deliberated, decides:

- to close the investigation opened during the meeting of September 13, 2019 of the

National Commission for Data Protection to the late Mr. X,

dentist, located at L-[…], […].
