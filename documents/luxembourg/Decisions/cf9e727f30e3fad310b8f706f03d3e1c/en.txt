personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter: the "GDPR

), the National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter: the “Commission

Nationale” or the “CNPD”) has decided to launch a thematic survey campaign on

the function of the DPO. Thus, 25 audit procedures were opened in 2018, concerning both

the private sector than the public sector.

 

2. In particular, the National Commission decided by deliberation n°[…] of 14 September

2018 to open an investigation in the form of a data protection audit with

Company A located […], L-[…] and registered in the trade and companies register

Luxembourg under the number[…](hereinafter: the “controlled”) and to designate Mr. Christophe

Buschmann as chief investigator. Said deliberation specifies that the investigation relates to the

compliance of the controlled with section 4 of chapter 4 of the GDPR.

 

3. […] the controlled [is active in retail trade in non-specialized stores in

food predominance].

 

4. By letter dated September 17, 2018, the head of investigation sent a questionnaire

preliminary to the control to which the latter replied by email of October 8, 2018. A

on-site visit took place on 27 February 2019 and a telephone meeting took place on 22

February 2021.

 

5. As part of this audit campaign, in order to verify the organization's compliance with

Section 4 of Chapter 4 of the GDPR, the head of investigation has defined eleven control objectives

included in the report of the visit of February 27, 2019, namely:

 

1) Ensure that the body subject to the obligation to appoint a DPO has done so;

2) Ensure that the organization has published the contact details of its DPO;

3) Ensure that the organization has communicated the contact details of its DPO to the CNPD;

4) Ensure that the DPO has sufficient expertise and skills to

carry out its missions effectively;

5) Ensure that the missions and tasks of the DPO do not lead to a conflict of interest;

6) Ensure that the DPO has sufficient resources to carry out effectively

of its missions;

II.

Place

 

 

A. On the failure to appoint a DPO

1. On the principles

11. According to Article 37.1 of the GDPR, “The controller and the processor designate

in any case a data protection officer when:

 

(a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or a public body,

the exception of courts acting in the exercise of their judicial function;

(b) the core activities of the controller or processor consist of

processing operations which, due to their nature, their scope and/or their

purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring on a large scale of people

concerned; Where

(c) the core activities of the controller or processor consist of

large-scale processing of special categories of data referred to in Article

9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and

offenses referred to in Article 10.

 

12. The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party adopted on 13 December

2016 DPO Guidelines which have been taken over and re-approved by

the European Data Protection Board dated 25 May 20183. These lines

guidelines provide clarifications concerning the notions of “basic activities” and

“large scale” which are found in article 37.1.b) and c) of the GDPR as well as concerning

the notion of “regular and systematic monitoring” found in Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

 

13. With regard to the notion of “core activities”, the guidelines specify that

“[t]he “basic activities” can be considered as the essential operations

to achieve the purposes of the controller or processor. They

also include all activities for which the processing of data is

an integral part of the activity of the controller or processor”.

14. With regard to the notion of “large scale”, it is recommended in the guidelines for

 

 

consider the following factors:

“- the number of persons concerned, either in absolute value or in relative value by

relation to the population concerned;

- the volume of data and/or the spectrum of data processed;

- the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activities;

- the geographic scope of the processing activity”5.

15. Finally, with regard to the notion of “regular and systematic monitoring”, the lines

guidelines clarify that tracking is not limited to the “online environment” 6. The term

“regular”, according to the guidelines, covers “one or more of the meanings

following:

- continuous or occurring at regular intervals over a period of time;

- recurring or repeating at fixed times;

- taking place constantly or periodically. »

As for the term "systematic", it covers "one or more of the meanings

following:

- occurring in accordance with a system;

- prearranged, organized or methodical;

- taking place as part of a general program of data collection;

- carried out within the framework of a strategy. » 7

 

2. In this case

 

16. As part of this audit campaign, for the head of investigation to consider the objective

1 as completed by the auditee, he expects the organization to have appointed a DPO on the 25

May 2018 if its processing falls within the scope of Article 37.1 of the GDPR.

 

17. It should be noted that the auditee carried out a documented analysis, as is

recommended by the DPD guidelines8, by which it arrived at the

conclusion that he was under no obligation to appoint a DPO. This analysis was

transmitted by the control with its answers to the preliminary questionnaire by e-mail from the

October 8, 2018.

 
 

 

18. It emerges in particular from this analysis that the auditee “considers that if [his] activities

may sometimes include a dimension of large scale or regular monitoring […] [its]

activities do not involve the two elements together. "It is also stated that

the controlled “does not carry out regular monitoring for customer activities (no profiling). The

purchases are sometimes recorded on the customer card (at the will of the customer) but are not

used for direct marketing purposes. These data are processed solely for the purposes

restocking, customer relations when the latter calls or for the calculation of his points and

to fulfill legal obligations. »

 

19. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation refers to this analysis on page 5, “[i]t

The investigation shows that [the auditee] did not appoint a DPO. CNPD officials

take due note that, in accordance with the Group's DPO guidelines

"article 29" working paper on data protection [the auditee] has documented an analysis

internally in collaboration with its consultants (…) in order to determine whether or not there is

instead of appointing a DPO. Based on this internal analysis, the position [of the controlled] is

that a DPO does not seem necessary with regard to the activities carried out. »

 

20. The head of the investigation then notes that the person checked “offers a loyalty card service to

its customers and that there are more […] active customer cards (i.e. used in

the year). As part of the management of these customer cards, [the auditee] carries out

data processing including purchase history and loyalty points. The cards

loyalty schemes (…) operate in all the stores [of the controlled], as well as in

other partner stores. “According to the head of the investigation, “the proposal of a

loyalty program is an integral part of the activity [of the controlled]”; it would be by

consequence of a "basic activity" of the control taking into account the clarifications provided

in the DPO Guidelines on this notion9.

 

21. As to the question of whether the auditee carries out systematic and regular follow-up on

database collected via the loyalty card, the head of the investigation considers that “[i]t

The elements of the survey show that the [loyalty] card makes it possible to track purchases

of a person through loyalty points. Follow-up is organized, occurs in accordance

                                                           
9 WP 243 v.01, version revised and adopted on April 5, 2017, p. 24

to a system ([…]) and is carried out within the framework of a strategy, here a strategy of

loyalty. The argument that the cardholder uses it "at will" is

inoperative. Indeed, (…) the loyalty program is part of a strategy that encourages the

cardholder to use it to earn points. As soon as a customer enters

the loyalty program, it enters into a systematic and regular monitoring system. Although

the purpose of "monitoring" may not be pursued as such by the person responsible for

processing, the fact remains that to achieve the purposes pursued (restocking,

customer relationship, etc.), the data controller has set up a monitoring system

systematic and regular. »

 
 

 

22. With regard to the notion of “large scale”, the head of investigation first notes “that it

there are more than […] active [loyalty] cards” […]. Then, with regard to the extent

geographic, he notes that said card "can be used in all the stores [of the

controlled] in the country as well as in many other partner brands. " Finally,

concerning the duration of the processing, the head of the investigation notes that the loyalty card

allows “to trace the purchases of its holder over a period of two years”. Leader

investigation concludes that “[g]iven the number of people involved, the

the geographical extent of the processing activity, as well as its duration (…) the map [of

fidelity] must (…) be considered as large-scale processing within the meaning of Article

37 paragraph (1) GDPR. »

 

23. Taking into account the criteria examined by the head of investigation in order to determine whether the control

was and remains under the obligation to appoint a DPO, the Restricted Committee concludes that this

are those of Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR, which is however not explicitly mentioned

in the statement of objections, which refers only to Article 37.1 of the

GDPR. The Restricted Committee also notes that it is essentially on the basis of

the analysis of the “management of customer cards” (or “[loyalty] card”) processing that the head

of investigation came to the conclusion that the controlled was and remains under the obligation to

designate a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

 

24. In its position paper of April 12, 2021, the auditee also returns in particular to

the processing in question and maintains that it does not constitute systematic monitoring,

considering that “the recording of data may possibly be considered

as systematic (after each purchase and presentation of the card) but in no case

the follow-up. The purpose of card processing is not to track purchases or

________________________________________________________________________

behaviors of its customers. (…) a mere registration cannot be considered

as a follow-up. »

 
 

 

25. The controlled further argues that the processing is not regular, considering that the

“customer card management” processing does not fall under any of the meanings of the term

"regular" retained by the guidelines for DPD10.

 

26. The auditee also indicates that the identification of the user of the loyalty card is not

not necessary to use it and that “[i]t is not uncommon for people to share

their card making any follow-up, which is not the case here, inoperative and ineffective. »

 

27. As mentioned in point 23 of this decision, it is essentially on the basis of

the basis of the analysis of the “management of customer cards” (or “[loyalty] card”) processing

that the head of investigation has come to the conclusion that the controlled person was and remains in

the obligation to designate a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR. There is therefore place

to examine whether the processing in question covers each of the criteria set out in Article

37.1.b) GDPR.

 

28. As to the question whether the “management of customer cards” (or “[loyalty] card”)

constitutes a basic activity of the controller, given the fact that the

DPO guidelines specify that core activities “include

(…) all activities for which data processing is an integral part of

the activity of the data controller”11, the restricted training concurs with the assessment

of the head of the survey according to which "the proposal for a loyalty program is part of

integral to the activity [of the controlled]” and therefore constitutes a basic activity of

this last.

 

29. As to the notion of “large scale”, in the light of the recommendations made

in the DPO Guidelines on this notion12, and in particular

taking into account the fact that the number of persons concerned "in relative value by

relation to the population concerned”, that “the geographical extent of the activity of

treatment" and that the duration of treatment are factors that should be considered

into consideration, the Restricted Committee concurs with the assessment of the Head of Investigation according to

which “the [loyalty] card must (…) be considered as a high-level treatment

scale within the meaning of Article 37 paragraph (1) of the GDPR. »

 

30. Finally, it should be examined whether the “customer card management” (or “customer card”

fidelity]”) constitutes a “regular and systematic monitoring” of the persons concerned.

 

31. The Restricted Committee admits that the “customer card management” (or “customer card”

[of loyalty]”) is carried out “in accordance with a system”. It nevertheless notes,

taking into account in particular the details provided by the auditee in its statement of 12

April 2021, referenced in points 24, 25 and 26 of this Decision concerning the

different aspects of this processing, that it does not appear from the investigation file that the said

the purpose of the processing would be regular monitoring of the data subjects or that such monitoring

would actually be carried out by the controller.

 

32. Therefore, it should be noted that it does not appear from the investigation file that the controlled

is found, due to the “management of customer cards” (or “[loyalty] card”) processing,

under the obligation to appoint a DPO under Article 37.1.b) of the GDPR.

 

33. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee concludes that the breach of Article 37.1

of the GDPR is not constituted.

 

 

III.

B. In the instant case

 

 

 

1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

 

36. In the statement of objections of 15 March 2021, the head of investigation proposes to the

restricted committee to pronounce an administrative fine against the auditee

relating to the amount of 80,000 euros “for breach of obligations arising from the

GDPR in relation to the appointment of the Data Protection Officer”.

37. Since the breach of Article 37.1 of the GDPR has not been established, there is no need to pronounce

against the audited the administrative fine proposed by the head of the investigation.

2. Regarding the taking of corrective measures

 

38. In the statement of objections of 15 March 2021, the head of investigation proposes to the

Restricted Panel to take the following corrective action, specifying that it should

be implemented "within 6 months, under penalty of a penalty payment of 1,000.-

Euros per day of delay”:

“Order the controller to appoint a Data Protection Officer

in accordance with Article 37, paragraphs (1) of the GDPR. »

39. Since the breach of Article 37.1 of the GDPR has not been established, there is no need to examine

the related corrective action.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to close the investigation opened by deliberation n°[…] of September 14, 2018 of the

National Data Protection Commission at Company A located […], L-

[…] and registered in the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number[…], in

the absence of breach found against him.
