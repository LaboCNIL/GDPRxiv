17. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, such as the aforementioned guidelines on transparency8.

2. In this case

18. Regarding the information of third parties as well as employees

as for the video surveillance system, the head of investigation noted in the communication

grievances that "during the on-site visit, it was noted that the presence of the

video surveillance is reported to the persons concerned (third parties and employees)

only by means of an old authorization sticker from the CNPD, affixed to

inside the premises as well as at the entrance door of the building housing the controlled premises.

The sticker affixed to the front door is accompanied by a second sticker

indicating the words "Protected by: Company B Alarm Video Fire", as well as the

telephone number and website of Company B”9.

19. According to the head of investigation "while some information is provided by the

controller to signal the presence of video surveillance, it is necessary to

find that in view of the requirements of the aforementioned article 13, this information is incomplete”10.

20. It noted in particular that neither the old CNPD vignettes nor the

vignette relating to Company B did not meet the conditions set out in Article 13 of the

GDPR.11

21. He also noted that “in his letters of June 3 and 24, 2021[12], the

checked specifies that it has affixed pictograms warning the persons concerned

the presence of a video surveillance system at the entrance door of the building housing

its premises as well as at the front door of its premises within this building. ", and

"In his email of July 12, 2021, the controlled further provides a detail of the content of the

pictogram affixed to the entrance door of the building housing its premises, which includes

the words "LOCAL UNDER SURVEILLANCE 24 hours a day" and "Protected by: Company D",

as well as two mobile phone numbers of Company D »13.

22. It took into account the auditee's desire to comply by

the affixing of pictograms, but he nevertheless found that the non-compliance was

acquired on the day of the site visit.14

23. He also found that the non-compliance remained established even after the

date of the on-site visit "given that the pictograms affixed subsequently

by the auditee do not fulfill all the conditions of the aforementioned article 13 either”15.

24. With regard to third parties, the head of investigation clarified as to the

"personal data information notice" for customers

that the control had given to the CNPD agents during the site visit that "although

this document contains certain information provided for in the aforementioned article 13, it does not contain

no mention of specific CCTV processing. Therefore this document is not

not such as to fulfill the conditions of the aforementioned article 13 with regard to the

specific processing of video surveillance”16.

25. Thus, the head of investigation was of the opinion that the control had failed in its obligation

to inform data subjects arising from Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, with regard to

concerns third parties.17

26. The controlled on his side explained in his letter of June 3, 2021 that he had

put stickers on the main entrance door and the front door to his office.

He attached to his letter photos showing the two doors.

27. By letter dated June 18, 2021, the controller explained that the sticker on the door

main entrance had been exchanged. He attached to his letter a photo showing this

gate. By email of July 12, 2021, the controlled provided a new photo of the door

entry showing the new sticker in more detail.

28. By email of September 20, 2021, the controller informed the head of investigation that he

would have continued to comply with GDPR regulations. He has

also expressed the opinion that “the information, in general, is subject to

adequate publicity”.

29. With regard to the employees, the head of the investigation specified that "the person inspected

provided the document entitled "SITE UNDER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE" as an appendix to his

letter of June 3, 2021, and specifies in this letter that it was signed by its employees. This

document also refers to "internal regulations" provided by the auditee in

appendix to his letter of June 24, 2021, which he specifies that it was communicated to his

employees on March 2, 2020. Finally, the auditor also provided in the appendix to its

letter dated March 24, 2021 a copy of an employment contract dated June 16, 2021, in

specifying that this contract corresponds to a new model including new mentions

with a view to informing all new employees at the time of signing their contract”18.

30. It took into account the desire of the auditee to comply by the

communication of several briefing documents to his staff, but he

nevertheless noted that the non-compliance was established on the day of the site visit.19

31. Thus, the head of investigation was of the opinion that the control had failed in its obligation

to inform data subjects arising from Article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, with regard to

concerns employees.20

32. The controlled on his side, in addition to the explanations concerning the affixing

of stickers set out in points 26 to 28 of this Decision, provided a copy of a

information note intended for its employees with its letter of June 3, 2021 as well as the

copy of its rules of procedure, which he indicated had been communicated to the employees

and signed by them, and a copy of his new employment contract with his letter of

June 18, 2021.

33. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.)”.21

34. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment like

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, the information having the

greater impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise the

data subjects22, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (e.g. via QR code or website address) 23. The

second level of information, i.e. all the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to the

third parties.24

2.1. Information from third parties

35. The Restricted Committee notes that at the time of the on-site visit the persons

third parties were only informed of the presence of the video surveillance system by means of

two old CNPD vignettes, indicating the reference of the old

points 114 and 117.
24 See WP260 rev.01, point 38.

authorization from the CNPD25, affixed to the entrance door of the building housing the premises of the

controlled as well as at the entrance door to the premises of the controlled, and another sticker

affixed to the entrance door of the building indicating the words “Protected by: Company B

Fire Video Alarm” as well as the Company’s telephone number and website

B.26

36. It also notes that the “information notice on the protection of

personal data” intended for the customers of the controlled, and of which the latter had

provided a copy to CNPD officials during the on-site visit, does not mention the

video surveillance.

37. It also notes that after the on-site visit, the controller affixed a new

sticker showing two camera pictograms and indicating the words "LOCAL

SOUS SURVEILLANCE 24h/24” and “Protected by: Company D” as well as two numbers

Company D mobile phone at the entrance door of the building housing the premises

of the controlled as well as at the entrance door to the premises of the controlled27. Restricted Training

also notes that the controlled has exchanged the other sticker relating to Company B which was

affixed to the entrance door of the building with a new sticker indicating the mention

“Protected by: Company D” as well as a mobile phone number of Company D28.

38. The Restricted Committee wishes first of all to point out that the former

authorizations from the CNPD in terms of video surveillance, as are the vignettes

related, have become obsolete, as they were issued by the CNPD under the former

authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002 on the protection of

persons with regard to the processing of personal data which has been repealed

by the law of August 1, 2018.

39. Next, she notes that neither the sticker in place during the site visit of the

CNPD officials, nor the stickers affixed after the said visit contain the

elements required by the first level of information. In particular, it lacks the details of

building) documented by CNPD officers during the on-site visit (summary of photos attached
in Minutes no. […]).
27 See photos attached to letters from the inspector dated June 3, 2021 and June 18, 2021 as well as the photo

the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of the rights of

data subjects, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level.

40. With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Formation

notes that such information intended for third parties did not exist at the

time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials. She has no

documentation showing that this has been changed in the meantime.

41. The assertion of the controlled in his email of September 20, 2021 that “the

information, more generally, is subject to adequate publicity” without

new supporting documents cannot undermine these findings.

42. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concurs with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the

has breached its obligation to inform third parties arising from Article 13 of the

GDPR.

2.2. Employee information

43. The Restricted Panel notes that at the time of the on-site visit the employees

were only informed of the presence of the video surveillance system by means of the two

old CNPD stickers, and another sticker of the subcontractor of the controlled at

the time (see point 35 of this decision).

44. She also notes that after the site visit this sticker was exchanged

against a sticker of the new subcontractor of the controlled, and that two stickers

additional have been affixed (see point 37 of this decision).

45. With regard to the first level of information, the Restricted Panel has

already noted that the old CNPD vignettes had become obsolete (cf.

point 38 of this Decision) and that the stickers affixed successively by the

checked do not contain the required information (see point 39 of this

decision).

46. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the information note intended

to employees entitled "SITE UNDER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE" that the controller has attached to

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

12/33



his letter of June 3, 2021, contains all the elements required by the first level

of information. This refers in particular to the provisions of the rules of procedure of the

control regarding the management of personal data for more information.

47. The Restricted Panel further observes that this note is undated and bears

the mention “Read and approved by all employees” as well as the signature of […]

people.

It should be emphasized in this context that the signing of an information note by the

employee can at most be considered as an acknowledgment of receipt allowing

the employer to document that he has indeed provided the information pursuant to Article 13 of the

GDPR, but can in no way be taken as valid consent of the employee to the processing of

given by his employer.29 Indeed, an employee, in view of the imbalance in the

force existing within the framework of labor relations, cannot respond freely to a

request for consent from his employer "without fear or incurring

negative consequences following this refusal. »30 Consent as a basis for the lawfulness of

data processing (article 6.1.a) of the GDPR) is therefore ineffective in this case due to

the nature of the employer/employee relationship.

48. The Restricted Committee then notes article [aa] relating to the protection of

data and article [bb] relating to video surveillance appearing in the copy of the new

employment contract that the controller attached to his letter of June 18, 2021.

Article [aa] relating to data protection does not mention video surveillance, and

does not contain all the elements required by the first level of information. It's missing

in particular the mention of the existence of the rights of the persons concerned, as well as a

reference to the more detailed information of the second level.

The provisions of article [bb] relating to video surveillance are almost identical to those

those of the aforementioned information note. Thus, this article contains all the elements

required by the first level of information. It also refers to the provisions of

                                                                 
29 See the definition of consent provided for in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, as well as the conditions
applicable to consent provided for in Article 7 of the GDPR.

49. With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Formation

note the copy of the internal regulations that the controller attached to his letter of June 18, 2021

specifying that it had been communicated to the employees and signed by them. It emerges from this

document that its effective date had been set for March 2, 2020.

The Restricted Committee notes, however, that neither the paragraph relating to the protection of

data, nor the paragraph relating to video surveillance contain all the information

information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR.

The paragraph relating to data protection is almost identical to article [aa]

of the aforementioned new employment contract. It does not mention video surveillance and does not

does not even contain all the elements of the first level of information because a mention of

the existence of the rights of data subjects, as well as a reference to the information

second level details are lacking.

The paragraph relating to video surveillance does not mention the recipients or

categories of recipients of personal data (article 13.1.e) of the GDPR),

the retention period of personal data (article 13.2.a) of the GDPR),

the existence of the right to request from the controller the rectification or erasure of

personal data, or a limitation of processing relating to the person

data subject, or the right to object to processing and the right to data portability

(article 13.2.b) of the GDPR), as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a

supervisory authority (Article 13.2.d) of the GDPR).

50. The Restricted Committee also notes that none of the documents intended

to the information of employees provided by the control after the on-site visit does not contain all

the elements of the second level of information. She has no documentation.

showing that this has been modified in the meantime.

51. The assertion of the controlled in his email of September 20, 2021 that “the

information, more generally, is subject to adequate publicity” without

new supporting documents cannot undermine these findings.

52. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the

has breached its obligation to inform employees arising from Article 13 of the GDPR.

B. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

1. On the principles

53. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

54. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance

implies that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve

the purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.31

55. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

56. Before installing a video surveillance system, the person in charge of the

processing must precisely define the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by

using such a system, and will not then be able to use the personal data

personal data collected for other purposes.32

57. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.33

2. In this case

58. During the on-site visit, “it was explained to the agents that the purposes of

in place of video surveillance are the protection of property, the securing of access to

private places as well as the organization of work according to a flexible schedule. It also

clarified that the data controller suffered a burglary around

the year 2015. Finally, it was clarified with regard to the purpose of organizing the work

on a rolling schedule that video surveillance aims to prevent employees from

swap their badges at the time clock”34.

The Restricted Committee notes that in the documents produced by the control after the

on-site visit by CNPD officials, it is however mentioned that the purpose of the

CCTV would be “the safety of people and property”.35

Furthermore, in his email of September 20, 2021 the controlled informed that the controlled

"continued to comply with GDPR regulations, which

makes it possible to confirm that the purpose of the processing is the surveillance of the premises outside

opening [hours]” and that “the legitimate aim sought by the person responsible for

treatment is the protection of the premises following a burglary”.

59. The Head of Investigation noted in the Statement of Objections that “during the visit

on site it was found that many fields of vision of cameras (referred to as:

« OFFICE 1 », « OFFICE 2 » and « OFFICE 3 ») allow monitoring in

permanence of employees in their place of work”.

60. In this context, he underlined that “such permanent monitoring can create

significant psychological pressure for employees who feel and know they are

observed, especially since the monitoring measures persist over time. The fact

that the employees concerned do not have a means of avoiding from time to time

of this monitoring is also likely to aggravate this pressure. Such a

permanent surveillance is considered disproportionate to the purpose sought

                                                                 
34 See Minutes no. […] point 8, finding 9.
35 See information note appended to the inspection letter of June 3, 2021 as well as paragraph
relating to video surveillance
appearing in the internal control regulations and article [bb] of the
new employment contract of the controller, documents attached to his letter on June 18, 2021.

and constitutes an excessive invasion of the private sphere of the employees occupied in their positions

of work. In this case, the fundamental rights and freedoms of employees must prevail.

on the interests pursued by the employer.

61. With regard to the field of view of the camera called "BUREAU 3",

the head of investigation recalled in particular that it had been found that it allowed the

permanent monitoring of the clock38. He stated that "surveillance

permanent employee time clock, is also to be considered as

disproportionate to the purposes indicated by the company. Indeed, installing a

The purpose of the clock is to manage and control working hours and working hours.

presence of employees in the workplace. The fact of including the pointer in the field of

vision of a camera results in additional monitoring that is not necessary

with regard to this purpose. Such processing is therefore to be considered excessive and

disproportionate to the purposes invoked by the company. »39

62. In addition, the head of investigation noted that “in his letter of June 3, 2021, the

monitored provides an overview of a camera's configuration indicating an absence of

operation of this camera from Monday to Friday for periods between 8:30 a.m.

and 5:30 p.m., and specifies that this preview corresponds to “the camera which operates for

specified periods » »40.

In this respect, he considered that "even if the fact of individually configuring a camera

in such a way as to exclude its operation for a determined period which may

correspond to the working hours of employees makes it possible to demonstrate a desire to

bring into conformity, it must be noted that the non-conformity with article 5 paragraph

(1) of the GDPR was acquired on the day of the on-site visit, insofar as all of the

four cameras forming the CCTV system was in operation

and allowed permanent monitoring of employees at their place of work that day. »41

63. The head of the investigation therefore held that the conditions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR

have not been respected. He was of the opinion that the controller had failed in his duty

arising from Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.42

64. The controller for his part informed in his letter of June 3, 2021 that a

camera would only work for set periods. He attached a capture

screen showing the configuration of the camera in question.

65. In the aforementioned letter, he also informed that he would have asked his

new subcontractor Company D to install a new video recorder, the old one

does not have a "blurring" function. He attached an estimate signed by his sub-

treating.

In his letter of June 18, 2020 he indicated that the new device had been installed.

In addition, in his email of September 20, 2021, the controller specified that following

the exchange of the video surveillance recorder “the work areas are now

darkened, the recordings having moreover been programmed outside the hours of the

work ".

66. La Formation Restreinte would like to point out that employees have the right not to

be subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace.

Indeed, compliance with the principle of proportionality implies that the employer must have recourse

to the most protective means of surveillance of the employee's private sphere. The respect

of this principle requires that, for example, automatic surveillance must be avoided

and continuation of employees.

Thus, for example, the employer could not monitor his employees inside an office,

an open-space, or even a workshop in which one or more

several employees, invoking the protection of his property. In this case, the employees

would be subject to video surveillance on an almost permanent basis and it is obvious that a

such monitoring can create significant psychological pressure for

employees who feel and know they are being watched, especially since the measures of

monitoring persist over time. Permanent monitoring is considered

as disproportionate to the aim pursued and constitutes an excessive interference with the

private sphere of the employee occupied at his workstation. In this case, the rights and freedoms

employees must prevail over the legitimate interests pursued by

the employer.43

The Restricted Panel also considers that there are other, less

invasions of privacy that the employer can implement to control the

working hours and the time of presence of its employees than video surveillance.

67. Similarly, permanent surveillance by third parties is not always

admitted.44

68. In addition, the placing of certain areas under video surveillance, such as

example a meeting room, may be admitted in certain cases, and not admitted in

other cases. Whether or not the video surveillance of such areas is proportionate

will depend on the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, situation or

configuration of the premises, the nature of the activity carried out by the controller and

the risks inherent in this activity, etc. It will also depend on the measures taken

by the controller in order to make video surveillance less detrimental to

the privacy of the persons concerned (for example, limitation of the field of vision of

cameras, use of masking/blurring techniques, etc.).45

69. Before examining the fields of view of the disputed cameras, the Panel

Restreinte first notes that no documentation submitted by the auditee

contains evidence that would establish that at the time of the site visit the cameras

litigious did not work all the time.

“BUREAU 1” documented by CNPD officials during the site visit.46

71. She notes that the field of vision of this camera allowed surveillance

permanently of the people concerned seated at the meeting table in this office.

It considers that permanent video surveillance of third parties and/or

employees seated at the aforementioned meeting table of the accounting firm is at

decision).

2.2 Field of vision of the camera called "DESKTOP 2"

She notes that the field of vision of this camera allowed surveillance in

She believes that permanent video surveillance of employees working in the office

in question is to be considered disproportionate to the aims sought (see point

58 of this decision).

It considers that the permanent video surveillance of the employee employed in the office in

question as well as the permanent video surveillance of the time clock are to be considered

as disproportionate to the aims pursued (see point 58 of this decision).

74. The information provided by the controlled in his email of September 20, 2021 that

following the exchange of the video surveillance recorder "the work areas are

henceforth darkened, the recordings having moreover been programmed outside the

work schedules”, without new supporting documents, cannot irritate the findings of the

Restricted Training.

75. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of Chief

of investigation and concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the

has breached its obligation under Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR with regard to the

cameras called “DESKTOP 1”, “DESKTOP 2” and “DESKTOP 3”.

II. 2. On the fine and corrective measures

1. Principles

76. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

21/33



f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

77. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

of the state or the municipalities.

78. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

survey no.[…] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

22/33



d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the breach”.

79. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

context of this decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

80. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training in the context of any corrective measures

_____________________________________________________________

to pronounce and/or the setting of the amount of a possible administrative fine to be

pronounce.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

81. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposes to the Panel

Restricted to impose an administrative fine on the control in the amount of 4,000 (four

thousand) euros.49

82. The controller explained in his email of September 20, 2021 “in terms of

corrective measures” that following the exchange of the video surveillance recorder “the

working areas are now darkened, the recordings having also been

scheduled outside working hours. He also pointed out that he “never

sought to harm any employee or third party, its approach to compliance

being responsive and transparent vis-à-vis the authorities”. He therefore appealed to the "high

benevolence” of the head of investigation “in order to cancel if not to propose to the Formation

Restricts a fine less than that of €4,000.00”.

83. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As to the nature and seriousness of the violation (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), it is

that with regard to breaches of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, they constitute

breaches of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and of the right to the protection of

data in general), namely the principle of minimization of data dedicated to the

Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

As for the failure to

the obligation to inform

the people concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations weighing on data controllers

so that people are fully aware of the use that will be made of

                                                                 
49 See Statement of Objections, page 9, Ad.C., point 34.

their personal data, once collected. A failure to

Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights of individuals

concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced under the GDPR,

which testifies to their particular importance.

It should be noted that at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents, neither the employees,

nor third parties were informed of the video surveillance in accordance with

GDPR Article 13.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel finds

that these breaches have lasted over time, at least since May 25, 2018

and until the day of the site visit. She recalls here that two years separated the entrance

into force of the GDPR from its entry into force to allow those responsible

processing to comply with their obligations. All the more, a

obligation to respect the principle of minimization, just like an obligation

comparable information already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1.b), 10.2 and 26

of the repealed law of 2 August 2002 relating to the protection of individuals with regard to

processing of personal data. Guidance on principles

and obligations provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular at

through mandatory prior authorizations in terms of video surveillance and

guidance available on its website.

- As for the number of data subjects (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restreinte notes that these are all employees working on the premises of the

controlled, as well as all third parties, i.e. customers, suppliers,

service providers and visitors to such premises.

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately or

not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel recalls that

"not deliberately" means that there was no intention to commit the violation,

although the controller or processor has not complied with the obligation

due diligence required by law.

In this case, it is of the opinion that the facts and breaches observed do not reflect

not a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of the controller.

- As for the measures taken by the inspected party to mitigate the damage suffered by the

persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

measures taken by the auditee and refers to Chapter II.2. Section 2.2. of this

decision for the related explanations.

84. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

85. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the control

in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these have only been

adopted only following the control of CNPD agents on January 29, 2020 (see

also point 79 of this Decision).

86. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR.

87. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, it recalls that the

paragraph 3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple infringements, such as

this is the case here, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for

the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

88. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Formation considers that the pronouncement of a fine of three thousand (3,000) euros

appears to be both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of

GDPR Article 83.1.

2.2 Regarding the taking of corrective measures

89. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation proposed to the Panel

Restricted to adopt the following corrective measures:

_____________________________________________________________

" has. Order the controller to complete the information measures intended for

persons concerned by video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of Article

13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR by providing in particular:- the identity and contact details

personal data as well as the legal basis for the processing; -  the interests

processing relating to the data subject; and - the right to lodge a complaint with

of a supervisory authority.

b. Order the controlled to process only relevant, adequate and limited data

to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting property and securing

access to private places as well as the organization of work according to a flexible schedule and

in particular, adapt the video surveillance system so as not to film employees

at their workstation and when passing through the time clock. Such a

adaptation can take place, for example, by removing and/or reorienting the cameras

in dispute (“OFFICE 1”, “OFFICE 2” and “OFFICE 3” cameras), and/or by adapting

the field of view of these cameras by means of blurring or darkening. »50.

90. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 80 of this decision, the Restricted Formation takes into account

the steps taken by the control, following the visit of the CNPD agents, in order to

comply with the provisions of Articles 5.1.c) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in

his letters of June 3, 2021 and June 18, 2021 as well as his emails of July 12, 2021 and

September 20, 2021. More specifically, it notes the following facts:

in question.

Nevertheless, the Restricted Committee finds that these stickers do not

do not contain the required elements of the first level of information because the

details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and

the existence of the rights of data subjects, as well as a reference to the

more detailed second level information is lacking.

With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Training

notes that such information intended for third parties did not exist at the

time of the on-site visit by CNPD agents and it has no

documentation that this has been changed in the meantime.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 80 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte therefore considers that there is reason to pronounce the corrective measure

proposed by the head of investigation in this regard51 and repeated in point 89 of this

decision under a. with regard to the information of third parties as to

to the CCTV system.

point 89 of this Decision concerning the introduction of measures

in accordance with the provisions of article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the Training

Restreinte observes with regard to the first level of information that the

stickers affixed successively by the controlled do not contain the

required information elements of the first level of information, because the details of

the purpose of the processing, the identity of the controller and the existence of

rights of the data subjects, as well as a reference to the information more

details of the second level are lacking.

However, it notes that the information note intended for employees entitled

"SITE UNDER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE" of which the controller has attached a copy to his

appearing in article [bb] of the new employment contract, the audit of which is annexed

copy to his email of June 18, 2021, contain all the elements of the first

level of information.

With regard to the second level of information, she notes the paragraphs

relating to data protection and video surveillance in the Regulation

internal control of which the latter attached a copy to his letter of

June 18, 2021. However, this document does not contain all the information

provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR.

The paragraph relating to video surveillance does not mention the recipients

or the categories of recipients of personal data (Article

13.1.e) of the GDPR), the retention period of personal data

(article 13.2.a) of the GDPR), the existence of the right to request from the controller the

rectification or erasure of personal data, or

limitation of processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose

to processing and the right to data portability (Article 13.2.b) of the GDPR),

as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

(article 13.2.d) of the GDPR).

informed in his letters of June 3, 2021 and June 18, 2021 that a new

video recorder has been installed, the old video recorder does not have

not a “blurring” function.

In his letter of June 3, 2021 he also indicated that a camera

would only work for certain periods of time. He attached a capture

screenshot of this camera's configuration showing that it is not recording

Monday to Friday between 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

In his letter of September 20, 2021, he specified that following the exchange of

the video surveillance recorder “work areas are now

darkened, the recordings having moreover been programmed outside the

working hours”. However, no documentation submitted by the control

does not demonstrate that the latter has adapted the fields of vision and the times

recording of all the disputed cameras after the on-site visit of the

CNPD officers.

The Restricted Panel notes first of all that the control has neither motivated nor

demonstrated how the video surveillance of the interior of the premises of the controlled

means of the disputed cameras is appropriate as well as adequate and necessary

to protect his property, and in particular to prevent burglary. She

considers that this observation would remain valid even if the cameras

operated only during off hours.

She also believes that the psychological pressure that the cameras

litigious exercise on employees and third-party visitors who

feel observed due to the presence of these, is however undeniable,

especially since they cannot assess whether the cameras are in service

or not.

Furthermore, the Restricted Committee is of the opinion that there are other less

invasions of privacy, which the controlled can implement to ensure

the purposes sought (see point 66 et seq. of this decision) that the

under video surveillance of the workstations of the employees or the table of

meeting.

For example, “when a data controller wishes to prevent any

damage to property, rather than installing a

video surveillance, he can also take other security measures such as

such as fencing the property, instituting regular patrols by security personnel,

security, use doormen, install better lighting, door locks,

security and tamper-resistant windows and doors, or apply coating or

anti-graffiti sheets on the walls. These measures can be as effective

that video surveillance systems against burglary, theft and

vandalism. The controller must assess on a case-by-case basis whether these

measures may be a reasonable solution. »53

The controller could also take, for example, measures

security such as installing surveillance cameras filming the accesses in order to

to achieve the purpose invoked by the auditee, namely the security of goods

(burglary, theft, etc.).

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 80 of this decision, the Panel

Restreinte therefore considers that it is necessary to pronounce one of the measures
