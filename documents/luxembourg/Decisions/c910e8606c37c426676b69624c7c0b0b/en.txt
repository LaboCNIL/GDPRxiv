not responded to its two requests of January 24 and 31, 2018 to access certain

images recorded by the company's CCTV system.

2. During its deliberation session on January 16, 2019, the National Commission

for data protection sitting in plenary session (hereafter: “Formation

[…] establishments […].

5. On January 29, 2019, CNPD agents carried out a visit to the

Company premises A.2

6. The controller reacted to the report drawn up by the CNPD agents by mail

of February 18, 2019.

7. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified the person inspected on 22

July 2019 a statement of objections detailing the shortcomings he considered

constituted in this case concerning the establishments […], and more specifically a non-

compliance with the requirements prescribed by article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR (right to information)

with regard to the persons concerned, i.e. employees and persons

non-employees, namely customers, suppliers, service providers and visitors

(hereinafter: "third parties"), non-compliance with the requirements of Article 5.1.c)

of the GDPR (data minimization principle), as well as non-compliance with articles

12 (methods for exercising the rights of the data subject) and 15 of the GDPR (right

access of the data subject).

8. A supplementary letter to the statement of objections was sent to the

checked on August 17, 2020. In this additional letter, the head of investigation

proposed to the Restricted Panel to adopt five corrective measures and to impose on the

controlled an administrative fine of 11,600 euros.

II. Place

II. 1. As to the reasons for the decision

A. On the breach related to the principle of data minimization

 

1. On the principles

13. In accordance with Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of the

purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

14. The principle of data minimization in video surveillance involves

that only what appears strictly necessary to achieve the target(s) should be filmed

purpose(s) pursued and that the processing operations must not be

disproportionate.3

15. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data must be

be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not be

further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes; […] (limitation of

purposes)”.

16. Prior to the installation of a video surveillance system, the controller

must define, precisely, the purpose(s) it wishes to achieve by resorting to

such a system, and may not subsequently use the personal data

collected for other purposes.4

17. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under

video surveillance, its location, configuration or attendance.5

2. In this case

18. During the on-site visit, it was explained to CNPD officials that the purposes

of the implementation of the video surveillance system are the protection of the property of

company, as well as user safety and accident prevention.6

2.1. With regard to the field of vision of cameras aimed at employees

19. During the said visit, the CNPD agents noted that the fields of vision

five cameras allow permanent monitoring of employees working

behind the counter, the small bar and behind the sink, while three cameras allow the

permanent monitoring of employees who prepare meals or who are busy in

the kitchen or in the bakery preparation area.7 The field of vision of a

camera also allows permanent monitoring of the person(s)

working in the managers office.8

20. With regard to the supervision of employees at their workstation, the head

of inquiry considered that "such permanent surveillance can create pressure

significant psychological impact for employees who feel and know they are being observed,

all the more so since the monitoring measures last over time. The fact that the

employees concerned do not have a means of avoiding from time to time

this monitoring is also likely to aggravate this pressure. Such a

permanent surveillance is considered disproportionate to the purpose sought

and constitutes an excessive invasion of the private sphere of the employees occupied in their positions

of work. In this case, the fundamental rights and freedoms of employees must prevail.

on the interests pursued by the employer. (statement of objections, point II.b, p.4).

21. The controlee for his part explained in his letter of September 23, 2020 that

the cameras in question were not intended to monitor staff, but

that they "only film the entrance, the cash desks, the cold room, the office and the

kitchens. The cameras were installed at neutral points but strategically

important in order to protect us from damage to our property. »

22. La Formation Restreinte would like to remind you that employees have the right not to be

subject to continuous and permanent supervision in the workplace. To reach the

purposes pursued, it may seem necessary for a data controller

installing a CCTV system in the workplace. On the other hand, respecting

the principle of proportionality, the controller must use the means of

most protective of the employee's private sphere and, for example, limit the

fields of vision of the cameras to the only surface necessary to reach the

purpose(s) pursued.

23. The Restricted Committee notes that the appendix to the audit letter of September 23

2020 contains photos of the disputed cameras' fields of view, which are

identical to the photos taken from the fields of vision of the cameras by the CNPD agents

during their on-site visit on January 29, 2019,9 that is to say that they are still aiming

permanence of employees who work behind the counter, the small bar, behind the sink,

who are busy in the kitchen or in the bakery preparation area or who

work in the manager's office. However, she noted that the camera which was aiming

employees who prepare meals seems to be disabled.

24. In view of the foregoing, it therefore considers that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c)

of the GDPR had been acquired on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents with regard to

relates to the aforementioned cameras.

2.2. With regard to the field of vision of cameras aimed at controlled customers

25. During the on-site visit of January 29, 2019, CNPD officials noted

that the fields of view of six cameras allow continuous monitoring of

people seated at the bar and parts of the consumption tables.10

26. In his Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation was of the view that a

surveillance of consumption areas “is disproportionate when customers

present will be permanently subject to video surveillance while they

choose a restaurant as a meeting place to have a good time around

a meal, to communicate, have fun or relax. However, customers who stay in

this type of place for a more or less long period of time, must be able to legitimately

expect not to be filmed during these private moments. The use of cameras

in consumer spaces is likely to film the behavior of each

customer seated at a table and can create discomfort or even psychological pressure for the

customers who feel observed throughout their presence in the restaurant. Such a

permanent monitoring constitutes an invasion of the client's private sphere. »

(statement of objections, point II.b, p.4).

27. As for his staff, the controller explained in his letter of 23

September 2020 that the disputed cameras were not intended to be surveillance

customers, but that they "only film the entrance, the checkouts, the cold room,

office and kitchens. The cameras were installed at neutral points but

strategically important in order to protect us from damage to our property. »

28. The Restricted Panel wishes to recall that even if a certain risk of theft or

vandalism may exist inside a dining room with tables

of consumption or at the counter of a café, the customers present will be,

permanent, subject to video surveillance as they choose a restaurant or a

cafe as a meeting place to have a good time over a meal, to

communicate, entertain or relax. She thus agrees with the observation of the head of the investigation

(see point 26 of the decision) that such permanent monitoring is therefore to be considered

                                                           
10 See findings 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of minutes no. […]. These are the cameras […].

as disproportionate to the purpose sought and constitutes an attack on the sphere

privacy of the client.11

29. The Restricted Committee notes that the appendix to the audit letter of September 23

2020 contains photos of the disputed cameras' fields of view, which are

identical to the photos taken from the fields of vision of the cameras by the CNPD agents

during their on-site visit on January 29, 201912, that is to say that they are still aiming

permanence of people seated at the bar and parts of the consumption tables.

30. In view of the foregoing, it therefore considers that the non-compliance with Article 5.1.c)

of the GDPR had been acquired on the day of the site visit by CNPD agents with regard to

relates to the aforementioned cameras.

B. On the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

 

1. On the principles

31. According to paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the GDPR, the “controller

take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14

as well as to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article

34 with regard to the treatment to the data subject in a concise manner,

transparent, understandable easily accessible, in clear and simple terms […]. »

32. Article 13 of the GDPR provides the following:

“1. Where personal data relating to a data subject is

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests

sued by the controller or by a third party;

 

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; and

 

(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a

means of obtaining a copy or where they have been made available;

 

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

to the data subject, at the time the personal data is

obtained, the following additional information which is necessary to guarantee

fair and transparent treatment:

 

a) the retention period of the personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

 

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to

personal character, the rectification or erasure of these, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to oppose the processing and

right to data portability;

 

c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or on Article 9,

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

 

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

have been collected, the data controller provides the data subject beforehand

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

 

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply where and to the extent that the person

concerned already has this information. »

33. The communication to data subjects of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in the context of compliance with

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR.13 These obligations have been

explained by the Article 29 Working Party in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

34. It should be noted that the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter:

“EDPS”), which has replaced the Article 29 Working Party since 25 May 2018, took over

                                                           
13 See in particular Articles 5.1.a) and 12 of the GDPR, see also recital (39) of the GDPR.

and reapproved the documents adopted by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25

2018, as precisely the aforementioned guidelines on transparency.14

2. In this case

35. CNPD officials noted during their on-site visit that the presence of the

video surveillance system is not signaled to the persons concerned at the entrance to the

the establishment.15 With regard to employees, the inspector specified by letter dated 18

February 2019 that the latter are informed of the presence of the

video surveillance by a charter appended to their employment contract.16

36. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation took note of the explanations

of the audit contained in its aforementioned letter of February 18, 2019, while retaining that

the “persons concerned preparing to access the establishments run by the

responsible for the treatment are not informed of the presence of the system of

video surveillance, in the absence of any signage. (statement of objections,

p3.).

37. It appears from the letter of the control of September 23, 2020 concerning the information

third parties that a sticker was affixed after the departure of the CNPD agents

at the entrance to his establishment informing of the use of video surveillance, but that he

considered that this sticker "is not sufficient to achieve the purpose of information

adequate and compliant with GDPR requirements. The company will therefore set up a

new decal […]”. Concerning the information of employees, the control specified in the

aforementioned letter that it is planned to attach a document entitled “GENERAL REGULATIONS

ON DATA PROTECTION (GDPR 2016/679”) to all employment contracts.

38. The Restricted Committee would first like to point out that Article 13 of the GDPR makes

reference to the obligation imposed on the data controller to “provide” all the

information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial here and it "means

that the data controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the person concerned or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link

direct, a QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).

39. She also believes that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects can be used in a

offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

for example personal data collected by means of a system of

video surveillance. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most important information

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the

processing and the existence of the rights of data subjects, as well as the information

having the greatest impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise

the persons concerned, as well as a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level (for example, via a QR code or a website address).17 The

second level of information, i.e. all of the information required under

of Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

such as a copy of the privacy policy emailed to

employees or a link on the website to an information notice with regard to

third parties.18

2.1. Information from third parties

40. The Restricted Committee notes that during the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD, third parties were not informed of the presence of the security system.

video surveillance.

41. In his letter of September 23, 2020, the controller indicates in this context

that a new sticker will be affixed at the entrance to the building. Nevertheless, the training

Restricted finds that this sticker does not contain all the required elements of the first

level of information, because the identity of the controller and a reference to the

and 117.).

more detailed second level information is lacking. Furthermore, she does not have

no documentation that this sticker has been displayed in the meantime.

42. With regard to the second level of information, the Restricted Committee notes

that such information intended for third parties did not exist at the time of the

on-site visit by CNPD agents and it has no documentation other than this

has been modified in the meantime.

43. In view of the foregoing, it concludes that at the time of the on-site visit by the agents

of the CNPD, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the control in terms of

video surveillance for third parties.

2.2. Employee information

44. With regard to

informing employees about the system of

video surveillance, the Restricted Panel notes that during the on-site visit by the agents

of the CNPD, employees were informed of the presence of the video surveillance system

by a charter annexed to their employment contract.19 Nevertheless, the said document does not

not all of the information within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR, because it lacks

in particular the legal basis, recipients or categories of recipients,

the existence of the right of rectification, erasure, limitation, opposition and

portability, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with the CNPD.

45. It notes, however, that in its letter of September 23, 2020, the controller

specified that it is planned to append a document entitled “GENERAL REGULATIONS ON THE

DATA PROTECTION (GDPR 2016/679”) to all employment contracts. By

elsewhere, during the Restricted Training session of June 30, 2021, the controller indicated

that following the control of the CNPD agents, a form informing of the video surveillance

would have been displayed on a bulletin board and the aforementioned charter and annexed to any contract

of work would have been updated. By email dated June 30, 2021, the Claimant sent a

copy of the said charter and a sheet containing a pictogram of a camera and indicating

that "FOR YOUR SAFETY, THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS UNDER VIDEO-

MONITORING »20.

46. The Restricted Team assumes that this sheet is the one displayed on the board

display of the controlled, but she has no documentation that she was there

actually put, on the one hand, and like the identity of the data controller, the existence

of the rights of data subjects and a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level are missing, said sheet does not contain the information of the first level

information, on the other hand.

47. With regard to the second level of information, she notes that the audited

specified that it is planned to append a document entitled “GENERAL REGULATIONS ON

DATA PROTECTION (GDPR 2016/679”) to any employment contract.21 However, this

document does not contain all the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR. He

In particular, it lacks the legal basis, updated information on the duration of

retention of data and the right to lodge a complaint with the CNPD. By

elsewhere, it has no documentation that this document was actually

annexed after the on-site inspection by CNPD officials to the employment contracts of the

employees.22

48. The Restricted Panel also notes that Article 3 of the aforementioned document indicates

the following: "By signing this appendix, the employee acknowledges having been informed

personal data likely to be collected and stored by the employer

as well as the installation of a video surveillance system capable of filming it.

He declares that he agrees to the computerized and/or automated processing of all of

this personal data, in compliance with the legislative provisions and

regulations in force.” It should be emphasized in this context that the signing of a

information sheet by the employee can at most be considered as an acknowledgment of

receipt allowing the employer to document that he has indeed provided the information in

under Article 13 of the GDPR, but cannot in any case constitute valid consent of the

employee to the processing of data by his employer.23 Indeed, an employee, in view of the

imbalance in the balance of power existing within the framework of labor relations, cannot

not respond freely to a request for consent from their employer

“without fearing or incurring negative consequences as a result of this refusal. »24 The

consent as the basis for the lawfulness of data processing (Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR)

is therefore inoperative in this case because of the nature of the employer/employee relationship.

49. With regard to the charter annexed to the employment contracts, the Training

Restricted notes that it also does not contain all of the information provided

in Article 13 of the GDPR. In particular, it lacks the legal basis, the recipients or the

categories of recipients, the existence of the right of rectification, erasure, limitation,

opposition and portability, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with the

CNPD.

50. The Restricted Committee also notes that Article 14 of the aforementioned charter

refers to deliberation n° […] of the CNPD. She would like to point out that the old

authorizations from the CNPD in terms of video surveillance, as are the vignettes

related, have become obsolete, as they were issued by the CNPD under the former

authorization regime of the amended law of 2 August 2002 on the protection of

persons with regard to the processing of personal data which has been repealed

by the law of August 1, 2018.

51. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Panel concludes that at the time of the visit

on site by CNPD agents, article 13 of the GDPR was not respected by the control

in terms of video surveillance for employees.

C. On the breach related to the obligation to respect the terms of the exercise of the

rights of the data subject and the right of access of the data subject

 

1. On the principles

52. With regard to the modalities of the exercise of human rights

data subject, Article 12 of the GDPR provides that “[…] 3. The controller shall provide

to the data subject information on the measures taken following a request

formulated in application of articles 15 to 22, as soon as possible and in any state of

cause within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this

187), adopted July 13, 2011.

deadline may be extended by two months, taking into account the complexity and the number of

requests. The controller informs the data subject of this

extension and the reasons for the postponement within one month of receipt of

Requirement. When the person concerned submits his request in a form

electronically, the information is provided electronically when possible,

unless the data subject requests otherwise. 4. If the

controller does not respond to the request made by the person

concerned, he shall inform the latter without delay and at the latest within one month from

receipt of the request, the reasons for its inaction and the possibility of introducing

a complaint to a supervisory authority and to lodge a judicial appeal. »

53. With regard to the data subject's right of access, Article 15.1 of the

GDPR provides the following: "The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller

processing confirmation that personal data relating to him or her are or

are not processed and, when they are, access to said personal data

as well as the following information:

a) the purposes of the processing;

b) the categories of personal data concerned;

c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data

personal have been or will be communicated, in particular the recipients who are

established in third countries or international organisations;

d) where possible, the retention period of the personal data

personnel envisaged or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to

determine this duration;

e) the existence of the right to request from the controller the rectification or

the erasure of personal data, or a limitation of the processing of

personal data relating to the data subject, or the right to

object to this processing;

f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

16/31

g) when the personal data is not collected from the

data subject, any available information as to their source;

h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in

Article 22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information

regarding the underlying logic, as well as the importance and consequences

intended for this processing for the data subject. »

2. In this case

54. During the on-site visit, CNPD officials observed that the length of the

conservation of images from the video surveillance system installed in the

establishments […] is 14 days.25

55. By letter dated February 18, 2019, the controller confirmed that due to a

misunderstanding with the company in charge of installing the cameras, the images were indeed

until this date kept for 14 days, but that this duration has been modified and

that the images are now only kept for five days before being

erased.26

56. In the Statement of Objections, the Head of Investigation specified that the Complainant

exercised his right of access to the video surveillance images of the controlled on two occasions,

know dated January 24, 2018 aiming at images from January 15, 2018, as well as dated

dated January 31, 2018 targeting images from January 2 to January 19, 2018.27 Due to

the absence of a response from the controller, the claimant would thus have seized the CNPD

in accordance with Article 77 of the GDPR (see also points 1 and 2 of this decision).

57. The head of investigation also indicated that in the context of the investigation of the

complaint, the person checked would have confirmed "twice, by letter dated August 21, 2018

and of December 6, 2018, that the images were kept for a period of 5 days

whereas, during the on-the-spot investigation, it turned out that the retention period was

                                                           
25 See finding 5 of minutes no. […].
26 See letter of February 11, 2019 attached to the letter of the audit of February 18, 2019 in which the
Company B confirms having installed the controlled video surveillance system and having modified the
shelf life of 14 to five days.
27 The deposit receipts for dispatches by registered letter by the claimant can be found in
appendix to his complaint and demonstrate that the requests were sent on the said dates.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

17/31

14 days. He thus retained in this context that as society "kept the images

video surveillance for a period of 14 days, it had to grant the requests

claimant's access for all recordings dating back less than 14 days to the

time of receipt of these requests” and that it “should have kept the images of

video surveillance upon receipt of access requests, even if the delay

retention expired during the one-month period available to you

to comply with requests. Moreover, he considered that the controlled party did not inform the

complaining in accordance with Article 12 of the GDPR (statement of objections, p.5).

58. By letter of September 23, 2020, the controller referred again to the letter

from 11

February 2019 in

which

the company installing its system

CCTV explained that the images are now kept for five

days before being erased.28 Furthermore, he mentioned that “when […] requested

to have access to the images, we were no longer in possession of them. Consequently,

we could not respond favorably to his request. »

59. The Restricted Committee thus notes that since February 11, 2019, the duration of

retention of images from the controlled video surveillance system is five

days and that before that date, the images were kept for 14 days. At the time

of the complainant's access requests, i.e. in January 2018, the images were from

then kept for 14 days.

60. As the complainant's first request for access sent by letter

recommended dated January 24, 2018 and targets images from January 15, 2018, said

images should still have been available to the controlled and he should have granted the said

request. With respect to the Complainant's second access request sent by

registered letter dated January 31, 2018 for images from January 2 to 19

January 2018, the controller should have granted this request for all

records that are less than 14 days old at the time of receipt. Furthermore, she

agrees with the observation of the head of the investigation according to which the person checked "should have kept the

video surveillance images upon receipt of access requests, even if

even the retention period expired during the one-month period of which

you have to comply with the requests. »

18/31

61. The Restricted Panel thus considers that at the time of the on-site visit by the agents

of the CNPD, article 15 of the GDPR was not respected by the auditee.

62. Finally, it notes that, even if the controlled person would no longer have been in possession of the

images in question at the time of the Complainant's access requests, as he claims

moreover, in its letter of September 23, 2020, article 12.4 of the GDPR requires that if the

controller "does not respond to the request made by the person

concerned, he shall inform the latter without delay and at the latest within one month from

receipt of the request, the reasons for its inaction and the possibility of introducing

a complaint to a supervisory authority and to lodge a judicial appeal. »

63. Thus, as the controlled party did not respond at all to the access requests of the

claimant of January 24, 2018 and January 31, 2018, the Restricted Panel considers that at

At the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials, Article 12.4 of the GDPR was not in any way

condition not respected by the controller.

II. 2. On corrective measures and fines

1. On the principles

64. In accordance with article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD has the

power to adopt all the corrective measures provided for in Article 58.2 of the GDPR:

"(a) notify a controller or processor of the fact that the operations of the

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this Regulation;

(b) call a controller or processor to order when the

processing operations have resulted in a breach of the provisions of this Regulation;

(c) order the controller or processor to comply with requests

submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights under this

these regulations;

d) order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable, of

specific manner and within a specified time;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

19/31

(e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject a

personal data breach;

f) impose a temporary or permanent restriction, including prohibition, of processing;

g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to the recipients to whom the personal data have been disclosed

pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 2, and Article 19;

(h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to Articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to the certification

are not or no longer satisfied;

(i) impose an administrative penalty under section 83, in addition to or in addition to

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics

specific to each case;

j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in a

third country or an international organisation. »

65. In accordance with article 48 of the law of 1 August 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

the state or municipalities.

66. Article 83 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that the

administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate and

deterrents, before specifying the elements that must be taken into account to decide

whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide on the amount of this

fine :

“(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects

affected and the level of damage they suffered;

b) whether the breach was committed willfully or negligently;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

20/31

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the

damage suffered by the persons concerned;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, account

given the technical and organizational measures they have implemented under the

sections 25 and 32;

e) any relevant breach previously committed by the controller or

the subcontractor ;

f) the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority with a view to remedying the breach

and to mitigate any negative effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether,

and to what extent the controller or processor notified the breach;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been

ordered against the controller or processor concerned for the

same purpose, compliance with these measures;

(j) the application of codes of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or

certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of

the species, such as the financial advantages obtained or the losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, as a result of the violation. »

67. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the context

of this Decision are those found at the start of the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

68. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the control to bring itself into compliance

with the GDPR during the investigation process or to remedy breaches

noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken into account by

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

21/31

the Restricted Training within the framework of any corrective measures and/or

setting the amount of any administrative fine to be imposed.

2. In this case

2.1 Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

69. In the supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 17 August 2020,

the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel to impose an administrative fine

control of an amount of eleven thousand six hundred (11,600) euros.

70. In his letter of September 23, 2020, the auditee estimated that the amount of

the fine is disproportionate and excessive due to the corrective measures implemented

place following the statement of objections, while he added in his email of June 30

2021 that financially the last 15 months were, due to the current health crisis,

very difficult and a fine of such an amount would therefore be even more serious.

71. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the elements provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- As to the nature and seriousness of the violation (Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), it is

that with regard to the breach of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, it constitutes a

breach of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and of the right to the protection of

data in general), namely the principle of minimization of data dedicated to the

Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR. It should be noted that at the time of the site visit by the

CNPD officers, nine cameras enabled the permanent surveillance of

employees at their place of work, while six cameras allowed live surveillance

permanence of people seated at the bar and parts of the consumption tables.

- As to the breach of the obligation to inform the persons concerned

in accordance with article 13 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that

information and transparency relating to the processing of personal data

personnel are essential obligations weighing on data controllers

so that people are fully aware of the use that will be made of

their personal data, once collected. A failure to

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

22/31

Article 13 of the GDPR thus constitutes an infringement of the rights of individuals

concerned. This right to information has also been reinforced under the GDPR,

which testifies to their particular importance.

The Restricted Training takes into account in this context that during the visit to

site by CNPD agents, third parties were not informed at all

the presence of the video surveillance system, while the employees were

informed by a charter appended to their employment contract which, as there was no

in particular the legal basis, recipients or categories of recipients,

the existence of the right of rectification, erasure, limitation, opposition and

portability, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with the CNPD,

did not contain all the information within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR.

- As regards the breach of the obligation to comply with the terms of the exercise of

rights of the data subject, as well as the data subject's right of access

in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the GDPR, the Restricted Training recalls that the

right of access is one of the major requirements of the right to data protection, because

it constitutes the “gateway” allowing the exercise of rights other than the GDPR

confers on the person concerned, such as the rights to rectification and erasure

provided for in Articles 16 and 17 of the GDPR.

- As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel finds

that these breaches have lasted over time, at least since May 25, 2018

and until the day of the site visit. She recalls here that two years separated the entrance

into force of the GDPR from its entry into force to allow those responsible

processing to comply with their obligations. All the more, a

obligation to respect the minimization principle, as well as obligations

comparable to respect the right to information and the right of access of persons

concerned already existed pursuant to Articles 4.1.b), 10.2, 26 and 28 of the law

repealed from August 2, 2002 relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing

personal data. Guidance on the principles and

obligations provided for in the said law was available from the CNPD, in particular at

through mandatory prior authorizations in terms of video surveillance and

the guidance available on the CNPD website.

23/31

- As for the number of data subjects (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restreinte notes that this is, except for the breach of the obligation to respect

the procedures for exercising the data subject's rights and the right of access

same, […] employees29 working in the two establishments in question from

controlled, as well as

all

the people

third parties visiting

said

establishments.

- As to whether the breaches were committed deliberately or

not (by negligence) (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), the Restricted Panel recalls that

"not deliberately" means that there was no intention to commit the violation,

although the controller has not complied with the duty of care which

is incumbent on him under the law, which is the case here.

- As for the measures taken by the inspected party to mitigate the damage suffered by the

persons concerned (article 83.2.c), the Restricted Training takes into account the

measures taken by the auditee and refers to chapter II.2. section 2.2. of this decision

for the related explanations.

72. The Restricted Committee notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR

are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the imposition of a

administrative fine and its amount.

73. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the control

in order to remedy in whole or in part certain shortcomings, these have only been

adopted only following the control of CNPD agents on January 29, 2019 (see

also point 67 of this decision).

74. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria laid down by article 83.2 of the GDPR for

breach of Articles 5.1.c), 12.4, 13 and 15 of the GDPR.

75. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, she recalled that paragraph

3 of Article 83 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is the case in

case, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount fixed for the violation the

                                                           
29 Site information […].

worse. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5, 12.4, 13 and 15 of the GDPR

is accused of the controlled, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld is

€20 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater

being retained.

76. With regard to the relevant criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the

Restricted Panel considers that the imposition of a fine of four thousand nine hundred

(4,900) euros appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the

requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.

2.2 Regarding the taking of corrective measures

77. In its supplementary letter to the statement of objections of 17 August 2020

the head of investigation proposes to the Restricted Panel to adopt the corrective measures

following:

“a) Order the controller to put in place measures

information intended for third parties (customers, suppliers and other visitors)

affected by video surveillance, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13,

paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR by providing in particular the identity of the person responsible

of the processing, the contact details of the data protection officer (if applicable),

the purposes of the processing and its legal basis, the categories of data processed, the

legitimate interests pursued by the controlled, recipients, retention period

of the data as well as the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of

exercise.

b) Order the controller to complete the information measures

intended for employees affected by

video surveillance,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the GDPR in

indicating in particular the identity of the data controller, the contact details of the

data protection officer (if applicable), the purposes of the processing and its

legal basis, the categories of data processed, the legitimate interests pursued by

the controlled, the recipients, the retention period of the data as well as

the indication of the rights of the person and the manner of exercising them.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

25/31

 

 

 

c) Order the controller to process only relevant data,

adequate and limited to what is necessary with regard to the purposes of protecting the

goods, the safety of users and the prevention of accidents and, in particular, adapting the

video device so as not to film employees at their workstations, nor to film

third parties in areas in which such surveillance is deemed to be

disproportionate, for example by removing or reorienting the cameras.

d) Order the data controller to implement a duration policy

retention of personal data in accordance with the provisions of e)

of Article 5 of the GDPR, not exceeding the duration necessary for the purposes for which

they are collected, and in particular by not keeping the images of the video stream longer

of a week.

e) Order the controller to implement a policy

allowing the exercise of the rights of data subjects, in accordance with the

provisions of Chapter III of the GDPR. »

78. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by reference

in point 68 of this decision, the Restricted Panel takes into account the

steps taken by the controller, following the on-site visit by CNPD agents, in order to

to comply with the provisions of articles 5.1.c), 12, 13 and 15 of the GDPR, as

detailed in its letters of February 18, 2019 and September 23, 2020, as well as in its

email dated June 30, 2021. More specifically, it notes the following facts:

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under a) of point

77 of this Decision concerning the introduction of information measures

intended for third parties concerned by video surveillance, in accordance with

to the provisions of article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller specified in his letter

September 23, 2020 that a new sticker will be affixed at the entrance to the building.

Nevertheless, the Restricted Committee finds that this sticker does not contain all the

required elements of the first level of information, because the identity of the person responsible for the

treatment and a reference to the more detailed information of the second level make

default. Furthermore, it has no documentation that this sticker was

displayed in the meantime. Regarding the second level of information, the

Restricted Training notes that such information intended for third parties was

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

26/31

non-existent at the time of the on-site visit by CNPD officials and it does not have

no documentation that this has been changed in the meantime.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 68 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the

head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 77 (a) with regard to

informing third parties about the video surveillance system.

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under b) of point

77 of this Decision concerning the introduction of information measures

intended for employees affected by video surveillance, in accordance with the

provisions of article 13.1 and 2 of the GDPR, the controller specified during the

the Restricted Training of June 30, 2021 only following the control of CNPD agents,

a card informing about video surveillance would have been posted on their board

display and an updated charter would have been appended to any employment contract. By

email of June 30, 2021, the complainant sent a copy of the said charter and a file

containing a pictogram of a camera and indicating that "FOR YOUR

SECURITY, THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS UNDER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE”.

The Restricted Formation assumes that this sheet is the one displayed on the board

display of the controlled, but she has no documentation that she was there

actually put. Like the identity of the data controller, the existence of the rights

data subjects and a reference to the more detailed information of the

second level are missing, said sheet therefore does not contain the information of the

first level of information.

With regard to the second level of information, it notes that the controller has

specified that it is planned to append a document entitled “GENERAL REGULATIONS ON

DATA PROTECTION (RGPD 2016/679”) to any employment contract. Gold,

this document does not contain all the information provided for in article 13 of the

GDPR. In particular, it lacks the legal basis, updated information on the

data retention period and the right to lodge a complaint with

the CNPD. Moreover, it does not have any documentation that this document has

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with Company A

 

 

 

27/31

actually annexed after the on-site inspection by CNPD agents to the

employee employment contracts.

With regard to the charter appended to the employment contracts, Restricted Training

notes that it also does not contain all of the information provided for in

GDPR Article 13. In particular, it lacks the legal basis, the recipients or

the categories of recipients, the existence of the right of rectification, erasure,

limitation, opposition and portability, as well as the right to lodge a complaint

with the CNPD.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 68 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the

head of investigation in this respect as set out in point 77 (b) with regard to

informing employees about the video surveillance system.

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under c) of point

77 of this Decision regarding the obligation to process only personal data

relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of

protection of property, the safety of users and the prevention of accidents and, in

particular, adapt the video system so as not to film employees at their workstation

work, nor to film third parties in areas in which such surveillance

is considered disproportionate, the Restricted Committee notes that the appendix to the

control letter of September 23, 2020 contains photos of the fields of vision

cameras, which, except for the camera which aimed at the employees who prepare the meals

which seems to be deactivated, are identical to the photos taken from the fields of mink

cameras by CNPD agents during their on-site visit on January 29, 2019,

that is to say that they always allow permanent monitoring of employees

at their place of work, as well as people sitting at the bar and parts of the tables

of consumption.

In view of the insufficient compliance measures taken by the

controlled in this case and point 68 of this decision, the Restricted Panel

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the

head of inquiry in this regard as set out in point 77 (c).

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under d) of point

77 of this decision concerning the obligation to implement a policy

retention period of personal data in accordance with the

provisions of Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR, not exceeding the duration necessary for the

purposes for which they are collected, and in particular by not keeping the

images of the video stream more than a week, the Restricted Training takes into account the

letter from the control of February 18, 2019 which contains in annex a letter dated 11

February 2019 whereby the company in charge of installing the cameras confirms that the

images were indeed until this date kept for 14 days, but that this

duration has been modified and that the images are now only kept for

five days before being deleted.

In consideration of the sufficient compliance measures taken by the control

in this case and point 68 of this decision, the Restricted Panel considers

when there is no need to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the chief

investigation in this regard as set out in point 77 (d).

- As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation mentioned under e) of point

77 of this decision concerning the obligation to implement a policy

allowing the exercise of the rights of data subjects, in accordance with the

provisions of Chapter III of the GDPR, the Restricted Panel notes that the audit did not

did not respond to the Complainant's requests for access, but which he asserted during the

session of the Restricted Training of June 30, 2021 that procedures have been put

in place to respond quickly to a request for access from a person

concerned. However, as the Restricted Formation does not have any

documentation that such procedures have actually been put in place, it

therefore considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the

head of investigation in this regard as set out in point 77 (e).
