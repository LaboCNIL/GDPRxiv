16. During the Restricted Training session of May 31, 2021, the head of investigation

presented his oral observations in support of his written observations and he replied to the

questions asked by the Restricted Panel. [The public body] was not present

during the session.

17. By letter dated July 7, 2021, the Restricted Panel requested clarification

on a specific point concerning the starting point of retention periods, to which

[the public body] responded on July 14, 2021.

II. Place

II. 1. On the material competence of the National Commission

18. First of all, it should be specified that the law of 1 August 2018 on the

processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security

transposes in Luxembourg Directive 2016/680 (EU) of the European Parliament and of the

Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the

processing of personal data by the competent authorities for the purposes of

prevention and detection of, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.

matter or execution of criminal penalties, and to the free movement of such data, and

repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (hereinafter: "Directive 2016/680

(EU)”). The said law applies “to the processing of personal data implemented

works for the purposes of prevention and detection of criminal offences, investigations and

prosecution in this regard or the execution of criminal penalties, including the protection

against threats to public security and the prevention of such threats, by any

competent public authority or any other body or entity to which has been entrusted, for these

same purposes, the exercise of public authority and the prerogatives of public power. »4

19. [The public body] specifies in its letter of October 5, 2018 to the complainant

that the processing of personal data implemented by [the organization

public] and affected by this Decision pursue the aforementioned purposes. Thereby,

given that [the public body] is to be considered as the "competent authority" in

                                            
4 Article 1 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data in the field of
criminal justice and national security.

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

5/18

meaning of article 2 point 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

personal nature in criminal matters and national security, the processing concerned by

this decision fall within the scope of that law.

20. Then, according to article 4 point 3) of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization

of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime on the

data protection and article 39 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of

personal data in criminal matters and national security, the Commission

National Authority is responsible for monitoring and verifying whether the data subject to processing

are processed in accordance with the provisions of the said law of 1 August 2018 relating to the

processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security.

21. Therefore, the Restricted Panel considers itself competent to analyze and verify

the compliance of the personal data processing operations in question

carried out by [the public body] with the law of 1 August 2018 on the processing of

personal data in criminal matters and national security.

22. […] Moreover, like the decision of the Plenary Formation of 26 September

2019 to open an investigation is based specifically on the complaint lodged on

of April 17, 2019, in which the complainant complains that [the public body] did not

respected his right to erasure, on the one hand, and as the statement of objections

expressly states that the purpose of the investigation was to verify compliance with the right to

the deletion of the claimant provided for in article 15 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the

processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security,

on the other hand, this decision will be limited to verifying compliance with the right to erasure of the

claimant by [the public body].

II.2. As to the reasons for the decision

1. On the failure to respect the right to erasure of the person

concerned

 

1.1 On the principles

23. According to the provisions of article 15.2 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to

processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security, the

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

6/18

controller is obliged to delete "as soon as possible the data to be

personal character of the person concerned when the processing of these data

constitutes a violation of the provisions of Articles 3, 7 or 9, or when the

personal data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation

to which the controller is subject. »

24. Paragraph (4) of the aforementioned Article 15 provides that the controller

must notify the data subject in writing of any refusal to erase personal data

personal character, as well as the reasons for the refusal. It may also “limit, in whole or in

party, the provision of this information, since such a limitation constitutes a

necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, having regard to the purpose

of the processing concerned, and taking due account of the fundamental rights and

legitimate interests of the natural person concerned for:

(a) avoid interfering with official inquiries, research or proceedings, or

judicial;

(b) avoid prejudicing the prevention or detection of criminal offences,

investigations or prosecutions in the matter or the execution of penal sanctions;

c) protect public safety;

(d) protect national security and national defence; Where

e) protect the rights and freedoms of others. »

1.2. In this case

25. By letter dated October 30, 2018, the complainant exercised his right to erasure

with [the public body] relating to the personal data contained in the

four [first files] on the basis of article 15 of the law of August 1, 2018 relating to the

processing of personal data in criminal matters and national security.

26. […]

27. By letter dated December 19, 2018, [the public body] confirmed the deletion

personal data relating to [the file] (3) […] explaining that “[…],

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

7/18

the personal data collected by [the public body] in the context of

these [folders] will be erased”. With regard to [the file] (1) […] [the organization

public] will also erase your data. On the other hand, she refused

the erasure of personal data relating to [files] (2) and (4), […] in

explaining that the retention periods had not yet expired for these two

[folders] […].

28. By this same letter of December 19, 2018, [the public body] also

refused the deletion [of the file] (5) […].

29. By letter dated January 30, 2019, the complainant reiterated his request for erasure

for the [folders] (2) and (4), as well as requested the erasure [of the folder] (5). By mail

of February 15, 2019, [the public body] maintained its position arising from the letter

cited above on December 19, 2018.

30. During the on-site visit by CNPD officials on March 3, 2020,

[the public body] […] also presented to the CNPD the file [of their database

data] concerning the claimant in which [files (2), (4) and (5) were located].

31. […]

32. The [files] (1) and (3) were therefore no longer in the file concerning the

claiming. However, even if [said records] (1) and (3) had been deleted, the

CNPD officials noted that the files […] were found in a file

"trash", a kind of buffer folder allowing temporary storage in theory

in order to recover a folder deleted by mistake. However, they found that the

“content of this “trash” folder is never erased in practice, so that

many documents are there for a very long period of time […]”

(Statement of Objections, point 34).

33. Despite the information that the [files] (1) and (3) would have been the subject

of a deletion dated December 19, 2018,5 CNPD officials noted

that on the day of the site visit of March 3, 2020, the [files] […] (1) and (3) were located

                                            
5 As indicated by [the public body] to the claimant in its letter of December 19, 2018.

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

8/18

in the “trash can” file for approximately 13 months (see statement of objections, point

35).

34. The Restricted Committee considers in this context that the analysis of respect for

claimant's right to erasure must be divided between the [different records], i.e.

say be done separately for [folders] (1) and (3), [folders] (2) and (4), as well

only for [the file] (5).

1. As to the [files] (1) and (3) concerning the Claimant

35. […]

36. The CNPD officers, on the other hand, noted that the two [above-mentioned files]

concerning the claimant were after their alleged deletion, at the time of

their on-site visit in a so-called "trash" file.

37. The Restricted Committee first notes that a dustbin is a component

computer analogous to a wastepaper basket. It makes it possible to offer a second

luck to the files that the user has decided to delete from the database

operational, while preparing for their final disposal. In this context, it is

of the opinion that, even if the support of a competent technician is required for the restoration

of a folder in the “trash” file, moving a folder in said file

"trash" is not sufficient to respect the right to erasure of the person

concerned. Thus, the claimant's right to erasure relating to these two [files] has not

respected by [the public body]], while the latter claimed to have carried out

the permanent deletion of these two [files].

38. In view of the foregoing, it considers that the non-compliance with Article 15.2 of the Law

of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data in the field

criminal justice and national security had been acquired on the day of the on-site visit by the agents of the

CNPD with regard to [files] (1) and (3).

2. As to the [files] (2) and (4) concerning the Claimant

39. By letter dated December 19, 2018, [the public body] refused to erase the

personal data relating to [records] (2) and (4) explaining that the

retention periods have not elapsed for these two [files] […].

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

9/18

40. The Restricted Panel considers first of all that the retention period of […]

years raised by [the public body] during the site visit of March 3, 2020 is in

contradiction with the period of […] years mentioned to the claimant in the letter dated 19

December 2018. It will therefore only analyze in this part whether the duration of

conservation indicated to the claimant, i.e. […] years, was respected by [the organization

audience].

41. By letter dated July 14, 2021, [the public body] told the Panel

Restricts only the departure dates causing the retention periods of the

documents in [their database] are the dates of registration […] in [the database

of data]. She specified that [the file] (2) of the Claimant […] was registered on 22

May 2013, while [the file] (4) […] was registered on October 10, 2016.

42. Thus, the Restricted Panel finds that on December 19, 2018, the date of the refusal

erasure by the [public body] of the complainant's [files] (2) and (4), the time limit for

retention applicable at that time by [the public body], i.e. […] years, was not

not yet elapsed. Therefore, it considers that [the public body] was entitled to

refuse on this date the deletion of the [files] (2) and (4) concerning the complainant.

3. As to [the file] (5) concerning the Claimant

43. By letter dated December 19, 2018, [the public body] refused the erasure [of the

file] (5) […].

44. By letter dated January 30, 2019, the complainant reiterated his request for erasure

[of the file] (5) […].

45. By letter dated February 15, 2019, [the public body] maintained its position

arising from the aforementioned letter of December 19, 2018.

46. The Restricted Committee notes in this context that according to Article 15.4 of

the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data in

criminal matters and national security, the controller may limit the provision

information on a refusal to erase the data, since such a limitation

constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society,

regard to the purpose of the processing concerned, and taking due account of the rights

_____________________________________________________________

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

10/18

fundamental and legitimate interests of the natural person concerned for, between

others, avoid interfering with investigations or interfering with the prevention or detection

of criminal offenses, in the investigation or prosecution thereof or in the execution of

penals sanctions.

47. As [the public body] informed the claimant that his [case] (5) cannot

not yet be erased, because […], the Restricted Panel considers that [the public body] has

legitimately used its powers provided for in paragraph 4 of the aforementioned article 15. So she

considers that [the public body] was entitled to refuse the erasure [of the file] (5)

regarding the claimant.

II. 3. On corrective measures and fines

 

1.1. The principles

48. Pursuant to Article 57 of Directive 2016/680 (EU), a directive transposed into

Luxembourg by the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

personnel in criminal matters and national security, the sanctions provided for by the States

members in the event of violations of the provisions adopted "must be effective,

proportionate and dissuasive”.

49. In accordance with article 14 of the law of 1 August 2018 organizing the

National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data protection, the CNPD has the following powers under the law of

August 1, 2018 on the processing of personal data in criminal matters

and national security:

“1° obtain from the controller or the processor access to all the data

of a personal nature that are processed and to all the information necessary for the exercise

of its missions;

 

2° notify a data controller or a processor of the fact that the data processing operations

envisaged treatment are likely to violate the provisions adopted under the

Law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of individuals with regard to the

processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in matters of

national security;

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

11/18

3° order the controller or the processor to put the operations of

processing in accordance with the provisions adopted under the law of 1 August 2018

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data

personal character in criminal matters as well as in matters of national security, the case

where appropriate, in a specific manner and within a determined period, in particular by ordering the

rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of

processing pursuant to article 15 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data in

criminal matters and matters of national security;

4° temporarily or permanently restrict, including prohibiting, processing;

5° to advise the data controller in accordance with the consultation procedure

prior procedure referred to in article 27 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data in

criminal matters and matters of national security;

6° issue, on its own initiative or on request, opinions for the attention of the Chamber

Members of Parliament and its Government or other institutions and bodies as well as the

public, on any question relating to the protection of personal data. »

50. Article 47 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the processing of personal data

personal character in criminal matters and national security provides that:

(1) Violation of sections 3 to 15, 18 to 30, and 34 to 38 of this law shall be punishable

an administrative fine of 500 to 250,000 euros which is imposed, by way of

decision, by the supervisory authority. An appeal against this decision is open to the

Administrative tribunal which rules as a judge on the merits.

(2) The competent supervisory authority may, by decision, impose a penalty payment

of 100 euros per day of delay in order to force the controller to

comply with injunctions issued by the National Commission for the Protection of

data pursuant to article 14, points 1°, 3° and 4° of the law of 1 August 2018 on

organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the regime

general on data protection, or issued by the judicial control authority in

application of article 43, letters b) and c).

_____________________________________________________________

Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of

Survey No. […] conducted with [the public body].

 

 

 

12/18

The penalty runs from the date fixed in the decision pronouncing the penalty. This

date cannot be earlier than the date of notification of the decision. An appeal against

this decision is opened before the Administrative Court which decides as judge on the merits.

 

[…]”

 

51. The Restricted Committee wishes to specify that the facts taken into account in the

of this Decision are those found during the investigation. The possible

changes relating to the data processing under investigation

subsequently, even if they make it possible to establish in whole or in part the

conformity, do not make it possible to retroactively cancel a breach noted.

52. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the controller to put themselves in

compliance with the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

criminal and national security personnel during the investigative process or

to remedy the shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the communication

grievances, are taken into account by the Restricted Panel within the framework of the

any corrective measures and/or setting the amount of any fine

administrative to pronounce.

1.2. In this case

 

2.1. Regarding the imposition of an administrative fine

53. In his Statement of Objections of 3 September 2020, the Head of Investigation

proposed to the Restricted Panel not to impose an administrative fine on

[the public body] (see statement of objections, paragraphs 55 and 56).

54. While Article 48.1 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the

National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Regime

data protection does not allow the CNPD to impose administrative fines

against the State and the municipalities, the Restricted Committee finds that under

article 47.1 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

personnel in criminal matters and national security, the CNPD can however impose

administrative fines of 500 to 250,000 euros to the competent authorities falling

13/18

within the scope of the said law for violation of its articles 3 to 15, 18 to 30, and

34 to 38.

55. In order to decide whether to impose an administrative fine for

breach of article 15.2 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to data processing

of a personal nature in criminal matters and national security, the Restricted Training

considering that the said article has not been complied with by [the public body], and to decide,

where applicable, the amount of this fine, the Restricted Panel takes into account

the following elements :

 It considers that the nature of the violation is particularly serious, whereas the law

of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data in

criminal matters and national security conferring on the persons concerned

rights relating to the processing of their personal data, in order to

allow the latter to keep control over them, has not been respected.

This is all the more important in the case of highly sensitive data processing.

sensitive in the specific field of activities […] of the competent authorities

within the meaning of that law. […] it is essential to respect these rights, including the right to

erasure, as they are part of the essence of the aforementioned law. A protection

of personal data […] throughout the Union requires

particularly to “strengthen the rights of data subjects and the

obligations of those who process personal data. »6

 The Restricted Committee also notes that in general, the more the number of

people involved, the greater the potential consequences of a

violations are numerous. However, it considers that in the present case the violation may

also have serious consequences even for a single

person, i.e. the complainant, the categories of personal data

personnel concerned by the violation, which by their nature, as well as by the

quality of the data controller, a character that is particularly sensitive to the

regard to his private life.

 It is also of the opinion that the facts and the breach found do not reflect a

deliberate intention to violate the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of

personal data in criminal matters and national security in the

head of [public body]. On the other hand, given that the deleted documents

by [the public body] [from their database] are systematically found

in a "trash" folder, for a temporary period in order to be able to

recover in case of deletion error, but that in practice the content of said

file is never erased and that the [files] (1) and (3) of the claimant are

found for at least 13 months, negligence is to be noted.

56. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that in the present case, the delivery of a

administrative fine in the amount of one thousand (1,000) euros is justified for breach

to article 15.2 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

personnel in criminal matters and national security and that such an amount is both effective,

proportionate and dissuasive.

2.2. Regarding the taking of corrective measures accompanied by a penalty payment

57. The adoption of the following corrective measures, which should be implemented

within one year, under penalty of a penalty payment of 100 euros per day of delay,

been proposed by the head of investigation to the Restricted Training in his communication of the

grievances:

" has. As regards respect for the data subject's right to erasure:

 Warn the auditee that the latter does not comply with its obligations arising from the

articles 7, paragraph 2, and 15, paragraph 2, of the law of 1 August 2018 relating

to the processing of data in criminal matters with regard to the existence of a

"bin" file in the controller's computer system

in which are listed all the deleted documents [from their database] and

whose content is not subject to control or deletion.

 Order the controlled party to bring its data processing into conformity with

personal character by implementing a means of permanently deleting its

data when such deletion is required, so that it is not

possible to find deleted documents, as is currently the case with

the "trash" folder. Although several options would achieve this

objective, a possible solution would be the adoption of a due process of

control and deletion of this "trash" folder. Such compliance

must be done within a reasonable time and at the latest within one year from

from the decision of the Restricted Panel.

b. As for the requirement of transparency vis-à-vis the persons concerned:

 Warn the controller that, in the context of a request for information by a

data subject in order to enable him to exercise his rights, the controller

of the processing must give exact information as to the retention periods

applicable to the personal data of the said data subject. »

58. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation, the Panel

Restricted takes note of the following facts:

 As regards respect for the data subject's right to erasure, the Training

Restricted does not have documentation demonstrating that [the public body]

has in the meantime deleted the personal data of the

claimant contained in [files] (1) and (3). Thus, she considers it necessary

to order the erasure of the aforementioned data within the month following the

notification of this decision.

 As for [the dossier] (2) of the Claimant […], the Restricted Panel notes that [it] was

recorded on May 22, 2013. As the retention period for data at

personal character of […] years, indicated to the claimant by [the public body] in

his letter of December 19, 2018, expired on May 22, 2019, so

even before the on-site visit by CNPD agents, the Restricted Training

considers that [the public body] must proceed in the same way as for [the

file] (1) […].7 Thus, it considers it necessary to order the erasure of the

personal data of the complainant contained in [the file] (2)

within one month of notification of this decision.

                                            
7 As specified by [the public body] in its letter of December 19, 2018.

The Restricted Panel still believes that it should attach the injunction to carry out

the definitive erasure of the complainant's personal data contained

in the [cases] (1), (2) and (3) of a penalty payment of one hundred (100) euros per day of

delay from a period of one month following the notification of this decision.

 With regard to the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation and recovery

under (a) second indent of point 57 and with reference to point 22 of this

decision, the Restricted Panel considers that there is no need to pronounce the said

corrective action. Furthermore, it considers that, in view of the shortcomings identified

in this decision, it is not necessary to warn [the public body] that

the planned processing operations are likely to violate the provisions

of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing of personal data

in criminal matters and national security, while the Restricted Panel finds

that there is a violation of article 15.2 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to

processing of personal data in criminal and security matters

national.

It therefore considers that there is no need to pronounce the corrective measures

proposed by the head of investigation under a), first and second indent of point 57 below

before.

 With regard to the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation and recovery

under (b) of point 57 and with reference to point 22 of this Decision, the

Restricted Formation considers that there is also no need to pronounce the said

corrective action.

 

In view of the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted formation and deliberating unanimously decides:

 

- to uphold the breach of Article 15.2 of the law of 1 August 2018 relating to the processing

personal data in criminal matters and national security;

 

- to pronounce against [the public body] an administrative fine of one

amount of one thousand (1,000) euros with regard to the breach of article 15.2 of the law of the 1st
