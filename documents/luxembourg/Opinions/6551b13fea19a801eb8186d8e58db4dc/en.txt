Deliberation n° 34/AV28/2021 of October 12, 2021

In accordance with Article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of Regulation (EU) n°2016/679 of 27
April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of data
of a personal nature and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “GDPR”), to which
refers to article 7 of the law of August 1, 2018 on the organization of the National Commission
for data protection and the general data protection regime, the
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the "Commission
National" or the "CNPD") "advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the
national, government and other institutions and organizations about the measures
legislative and administrative measures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals
with regard to the treatment”.

By email dated October 8, 2021, the Minister of Health invited the Commission
to rule on draft law no. 7897 amending: 1° the amended law
of July 17, 2020 on measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic; 2° of the amended law
of March 8, 2018 relating to hospital establishments and hospital planning; 30
of the amended law of 22 January 2021 relating to: 1° modification of articles L. 234-51, L. 234-52
and L. 234-53 of the Labor Code; 2° temporary derogation from the provisions of Articles L. 234-
51, L. 234-52 and L. 234-53 of the Labor Code (hereinafter “Bill No. 7897”).

According to the explanatory memorandum, bill no. 7897 "proposes to bring some
ad hoc adaptations to the current version of the amended law of 17 July 2020 on
measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic which expires on October 18, 2021.

The CNPD notes in this context that the new paragraph (2) of Article 2 of the draft
Law No. 7897 provides that henceforth within catering and bar establishments
beverages, customers and all staff of the establishment concerned are
compulsorily subject to the Covid check regime,' while article 3septies of the said draft
grants the option to any business manager or head of administration to invest all or
only part of his business or administration under the Covid check regime
in order to protect the safety and health of the workers concerned.

The customers, or even the employees concerned in the event of the choice of the Covid check regime by
the employer, are therefore obliged to present a certificate of vaccination, recovery or
Covid-19 test indicating a negative result as referred to in Articles 3bis, 3ter or 3quater of the
bill n° 7897. However, it is not clear from the said bill, nor from the
commentary to the articles, if the processing of personal data would be
carried out by the employer or the operator of the catering establishments and
drinks, following the presentation by a customer or an employee of such a certificate.

1 See the new definition of the “Covid check regime” provided for in article 1, point 27 of bill no. 7897.

Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection on the draft

law no. 7897 amending: 1° the amended law of 17 July 2020 on

measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

1/4

Will the employer or operator collect or record the data contained in these
tests or the said certificates following their presentation? Indeed, an employer, how can
or will he have to manage the Covid Check regime on a daily basis in practice from a protection point of view
personal data? Will he subject all employees daily to a
Covid Check control or for convenience will keep a file with the data
employees who are vaccinated or recovered. The bill does not provide an answer to these
questions and lack of precision on this subject.

It should also be recalled that the GDPR will only apply when a
processing of personal data will be carried out2, for example if the fact that a
employee or client presented a certified rapid antigen test result, a certificate of
vaccination or a serological screening test certificate is required to be recorded in
a file by the employer or operator.

In addition, in the event that data processing is carried out within the framework of the
Bill No. 7897, these must be based on one of the bases of lawfulness listed in Article
6 of the GDPR as well as fulfilling one of the conditions referred to in Article 9, paragraph (2) of the
GDPR insofar as data relating to the health of the persons concerned would be
likely to be processed.

In this respect, it should be recalled that the processing of personal data collected
and processed under a legal obligation must have a legal basis in accordance with
Article 6, paragraph (3), of the GDPR, read together with its paragraph (1), letters c).
According to Article 6(3) of the GDPR this legal obligation should define the
purposes of the processing and contain "specific provisions to adapt the application of the
rules of this regulation, among others: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of the
processing by the controller; the types of data that are subject to processing;
the people concerned; the entities to which the personal data can be
be communicated and the purposes for which they may be communicated; purpose limitation;
retention periods; and processing operations and procedures, including
measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those provided for in other
special processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX”.

Recital 41 of the GDPR further specifies that this legislative measure should be clear and
precise and its application should be foreseeable for litigants, in accordance with the
case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Rights
of man 3.

However, it must be noted that if data processing were to be carried out on the basis
of Bill No. 7897, these could not validly be based on such a basis of lawfulness
whereas the device under review does not comply with the legal requirements set out above.

In view of the above observations, the National Commission considers that
in the event that data processing is carried out by the organizations
concerned, the text under opinion does not meet the requirements of clarity, precision and
foreseeability to which a legal text must respond, in accordance with the case law of the

Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights', and
cannot, therefore, pronounce in more detail on the possible aspects which would be linked to the
Protection of personal data.

With regard more specifically to the Covid check regime, the CNPD understands
that after scanning the QR code of the CovidCheck certificate, the result is displayed
instantly: the screen is green if the certificate is valid and red otherwise.
However, it turns out that other additional information is also displayed on
the screen during the check. For example, in the case of a vaccinated person, these are the
following information: the surname and first names of the person concerned, their date of birth,
the reference to the Covid-19 disease or virus, the name of the vaccine, the holder of the
the marketing authorization or the manufacturer of the vaccine, the date of vaccination, the State
in which the vaccine was administered, the issuer of the certificate and its identifier.

In accordance with Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c) of the GDPR, the personal data
personnel must be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in view of
of the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”. Furthermore, all
processing of personal data must be necessary and proportionate to the purpose
continued by said treatment.

Although the CNPD understands that the purpose of the CovidCheck.lu application is to simplify the
verifications of certificates, the CNPD wonders about the need to make visible all
information mentioned above, systematically during each check. Indeed, he
Seems the same goal could be achieved by just displaying the status of the certificate
CovidCheck (valid — green; invalid — red). Furthermore, an employer or a restaurateur
can he validate a certificate by reading the information that accompanies the QR code, if by
example the application is unavailable, if there is no network reception or if the device for
scan no longer works?

The general conditions of use of the CovidCheck application available on the site
https://covid19.public.lu/covidcheck further specify that the Apple App Store platforms and
Google Play Store may process personal data
communicated directly or indirectly by the user as part of the download
of the app. It should therefore be emphasized that, in view of the fact that the CovidCheck application
contains data concerning health, it is important to be particularly vigilant
use adequate technical and organizational measures in accordance with Articles
25 paragraph (2) and 32 paragraph (1) of the GDPR so that these cannot be
accessible to unauthorized persons.

Finally, although these issues do not fall within the domain of the protection of
data, the CNPD had already questioned itself in terms of labor law in its opinions of 28 May
20215 and 8 June 20216 on the consequences of an employee's refusal to submit to
the obligation to present one of the certificates mentioned in articles 3bis, 3ter or 3quater of the
Bill No. 7897. The same question also arises for employees who are neither
vaccinated, nor recovered. Will they have to present a certified Covid-19 test every other day
indicating a negative result to be able to work?
