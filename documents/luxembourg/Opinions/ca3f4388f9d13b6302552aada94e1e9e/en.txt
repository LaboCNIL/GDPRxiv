Deliberation n°27/2020 of December 2, 2020

 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of April 27, 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (Regulation
general on data protection) (hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”), to which article
7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the protection
data and the general data protection regime, the National Commission for
Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the “National Commission”) “advises,
in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the government and other
institutions and bodies on legislative and administrative measures relating to the
protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to processing”.
 
By letter dated August 12, 2020, Madam Minister of Consumer Protection
invited the National Commission to comment on the draft Grand-Ducal regulation setting the
procedures for registering establishments of food business operators (hereinafter referred to as
referred to as the "draft Grand-Ducal regulation").
 
It appears from the explanatory memorandum that according to European regulations, any operator of the
food sector must register with the competent authorities each of the
establishments for which he is responsible and which intervene in the food chain.
 
At the national level, article 6 of the law of 28 July 2018 establishing a system of control and
sanction relating to foodstuffs relates to this registration by providing that “(…) any
food business operator notifies the [Government Commissioner for Quality,
Fraud and Food Safety], for registration purposes, each of the establishments in which it
is responsible for and who implement one of the stages of production, processing
and food distribution. To this end, the Commissariat is authorized to use
a file, and the data entered therein will be transmitted to the authorities responsible for the control
foodstuffs. »
 
Paragraph 2 of the said article continues that “[a] Grand-Ducal regulation specifies the procedures
as well as the procedures for registering the establishments referred to in paragraph 1 of this
article. »

The draft Grand-Ducal regulation is part of the implementation of Article 6
aforesaid, even if, in fact, a computerized notification system has been operational since
2016.
 
The National Commission will limit its observations to the provisions of the draft grand-
ducal without examining in more detail the European and national legislation on the basis of which the
draft Grand-Ducal regulation has been adopted.
 
Article 3 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation lists the information that the operators of the
food sector must notify the government commissioner for quality, fraud and
food safety, namely (i) the trade name of the establishment, (ii) the address
location where the activities take place, (iii) the contact details and address of the operator, (iv)
activities related to the stages of production, processing and distribution of
foodstuffs and (v) when the operator is a legal person, the natural person
designated as recipient of official control reports and as contact person in the event of
incidents related to foodstuffs on behalf of this legal entity.
 
Based on the information available to it, the National Commission considers that the
categories of personal data to be notified are adequate, relevant and limited to what is
necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, namely the control of
food business operators1, so that the principle of data minimization laid down in
Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c) of the GDPR is complied with.
 
Article 5 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation provides that the government commissioner for
quality, fraud and food safety maintains a register of the establishments in which
the data notified in accordance with article 3 and that the data, regularly updated,
are kept for a maximum period of 5 years after the end of the activities related to the
stages of food production, processing and distribution.
 
The National Commission considers that, given the fact that the law of 28 July 2018 establishing a system
control and penalties relating to foodstuffs provides for correctional penalties
prescribed by 5 years, the limitation of the retention of data to a maximum duration of
5 years complies with the principle of limiting the retention of personal data provided for
in article 5, paragraph 1, letter e) of the GDPR.
 
 

                                                 
1 Even if the purpose of the processing emerges from reading the various normative texts, it could be useful to
refer to Article 1 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.

With regard to the term “register” used in article 5 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation, the
National Commission considers that it would be preferable to use the same term as that already
employed in article 6 of the aforementioned law of July 28, 2018, namely “file”. Not only this
way to do this would highlight the fact that it is indeed the same file, but this
term also has the advantage of being defined by the GDPR2.
 
Finally, the National Commission wonders whether there might not be a possible inconsistency
between the law of 28 July 2018 establishing a control and sanction system relating to foodstuffs
foodstuffs and the draft Grand-Ducal regulation. Indeed, article 6 of the aforementioned law sets out
that the data entered in the file will be transmitted to the administrations in charge of the
control of foodstuffs while the draft Grand-Ducal regulation, while remaining
silent on this subject in the body of the text, indicates in its explanatory memorandum that “in order to avoid
including duplication and to enhance the effectiveness of official controls, it appears
essential to have a centralized register of establishments in the food chain”.
 
According to the understanding of the CNPD, the aforementioned law of July 28, 2018 does not allow
administrations responsible for food control direct access to audit
file insofar as the data entered therein is transmitted to them by the police station of the
government to quality, fraud and food safety. By evoking a "register
centralised", the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation seem however to want to create a
file directly accessible to the administrations in charge of food control
food.
 
For all intents and purposes, the National Commission takes the liberty of pointing out that access to files
third parties containing personal data and the transmission of such data to
third parties constitute an interference with privacy and therefore, under Article 11,
paragraph 3, of the Constitution, a matter reserved for formal law. In this case, the main
of the normative framework must appear in the law3. In the case of direct access, the law should in particular
list the administrations that can access the file in question, as well as the purposes of
this access.
