Second complementary opinion of the National Commission for the Protection

 

 

relating to bill n° 6961 on 1. creation of the National Security Authority and 2.

amendment 1) of the amended law of 15 June 2004 relating to the classification of coins and

Article 28 paragraph (6) draft of the amended law of 15 June 2004 on the
classification of parts and security clearances (amendment 9)
 
Proposed section 28(6) provides as follows:
 
“(6) The computer system by which any access is operated is arranged so that:
 
1° the members of the ANS may consult the files to which they have access only by indicating
as to their personal digital identifier, and
 
2° the information relating to the members of the NSA having carried out the consultation, as well as
the information consulted, the date and time of the consultation are recorded and
kept for a period of five years, so that the reason for the consultation can be
retraced. The personal data consulted must have a direct link with the
facts giving rise to the consultation. »
 
The CNPD considers positive the fact that the log files will henceforth be settled in
detail by the text in its amended version. It also suggests providing that the reason for the
consultation must be entered into the system at the time of the consultation and kept
also for five years.
 
Indeed, the information relating to the agents who carried out the consultation, the information
consulted, the date and time of the consultation do not necessarily make it possible to trace the
motive up to five years after the consultation.
 
 
Draft article 29 bis of the amended law of 15 June 2004 relating to the classification of
documents and security clearances (amendment 10)
 
Proposed article 29 bis provides the following:
 
" Art. 29bis. – Security of processing
 
(1) Any person who acts under the authority of the controller and who accesses
data may only process it on the instructions of the controller, except under
legal obligations.
 
(2) The controller must implement all technical and
appropriate organization to ensure the protection of the data it processes against the des-
accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, alteration, distribution or unauthorized access
authorized, in particular when the processing involves the transmission of data in a
network, as well as against any other form of unlawful processing.
 
(3) Depending on the risk of invasion of privacy, as well as the state of the art and the associated costs
when implemented, the measures referred to in subsection (2) must:
 
(a) prevent any unauthorized person from gaining access to the facilities used for processing
data processing (control at the entrance to the facilities);

(b) prevent data carriers from being read, copied, modified or moved

(f) ensure that the identity of third parties to whom data can be verified and ascertained
be transmitted by transmission facilities (transmission control);
 
(g) guarantee that the identity of persons who have had
access to the information system and what data was entered into the system, at what
when and by whom (control of entry);
 
(h) prevent the communication of data and the transport of data carriers from

(transport control);
 
(i) save the data by making backup copies (control of the
availablity).
 
 
(4) Anyone who carries out processing in violation of the rules relating to confidentiality or
security referred to in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) is punished by imprisonment for eight days
six months and a fine of 251 to 125,000 euros or one of these penalties only. The
court seised may order the cessation of processing contrary to the provisions of the
paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) under pain of a penalty payment, the maximum of which is set by said
jurisdiction. »
 
The National Commission notes that the text reproduces the terms of Articles 22 and 23 of the law
repealed of August 2, 2002 relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and will complement the current provisions of Articles 22, 24 and
28 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in matters of
national security.
 
On the other hand, the texts mentioned above are not fixed by the retention periods.
exact log files provided therein. The CNPD suggests specifying in the draft
law a retention period of 5 years for the log files relating to the
consultation of data in the data processing systems of the ANS. It suits
to note that the statute of limitations for offences, (and in particular criminal offenses provided for by
law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
personal data in criminal matters as well as in security matters
national, by the draft article 29 bis paragraph (4) of the amended law of 15 June 2004 relating to
