further formulate, in addition to its initial opinion n°13/2020 of June 8, 2020, the observations which
follow.
 
By amendment 3 of bill n°7606, the authors have notably inserted a paragraph
2 new in article 5 of the said draft and which concerns passenger transport activities by
collective means as part of an organized trip. Thus, in order to follow the evolution of the
spread of Covid-19 in the context of an organized trip, the operator of a collective means
transport of persons "is required to transmit as far as possible, on request,
to the doctor from the Department of Health or to health professionals authorized in the
framework of this law by the director of health the surname, first name, telephone number and
email addresses of people who have experienced high-risk exposure due to
situations referred to in Article 2, point 4°. The commentary to the amendment adds that the
data relating to passengers at high risk of being infected and which are sent to the
Directorate of Health on request further specify "the means, date and time of transport
and, if applicable, the car and seat occupied by the index case. »
 
It follows, as the authors of the amendment specify, that the operator of a
such a means of transport already has passenger identification data as a basis
having used the means of transport concerned and in which one or more persons

infected could be located. However, while the initial purpose of this data collection
of a personal nature of passengers is rather the organization of a trip, the CNPD includes
that the authors of the amendment aim for another purpose by this obligation to transfer to
requests passenger data by the operator of a collective means of transport of
people at the Health Department: set up a tracking system to identify the
as soon as possible anyone at risk or at high risk of being infected in order to put in
implement the necessary precautions (such as quarantine) and thus prevent the
dissemination of the infection by these people who are in turn contagious.
 
The CNPD does not call into question the principle that this processing is necessary in order to
pursue the aforementioned purpose and in order to provide the Health Department with the means to
contact potentially exposed passengers as soon as possible.
 
Nevertheless, it wishes to make two remarks in this context:
 

 The commentary to the article specifies that the terms “operator of a collective means of
transport of people” relate to “land transport (long-distance buses)
distances, especially during summer holidays, long-distance trains),
air and river”. However, the CNPD wonders more particularly what it takes
understand by "organised trip". Do individual trips and "no
organized” (such as a simple return flight from the airport of
Luxembourg or a train journey by TGV from Luxembourg-city station)
are not covered by the provision in question and that therefore, even if we are in the presence
of an operator of a collective means of passenger transport, this obligation to
transmit passenger data to the Health Department on request
not apply in this case?
 

 As mentioned above, in order to be able to proceed with the transfer of the surname, first name, number
phone numbers and email addresses of people who have been exposed to high
risk to the Department of Health, the operators of a collective means of transport of
people must first already be in possession of said data. the
commentary to the amendment in question specifies in this regard that "the passenger concerned
by this measure must give his prior consent. »
 
Nevertheless, the CNPD is of the opinion that it is implicit in the use of the words “is
required to transmit” in the body of the text of Article 5 paragraph (2) of the draft
law n°7606 as amended, that it is not a simple option for operators in
depending on the passenger's agreement to transmit on request to the Health Department
the aforementioned data, but that, on the other hand, they are obliged to proceed with said transfer.
Moreover, it doubts that the consent of the passengers would respect, in the case
where applicable, all the conditions provided for by the GDPR to be lawful, in particular with regard to
concerning its free character.

 
Generally concerning the retention period of personal data
personnel, the CNPD refers to its remarks relating thereto made in its aforementioned opinion of 8
June 2020 on bill n°7606. With regard to the specific retention period of
personal data of passengers with the operator, the authors specify
in the commentary to the amendment that it “shall not be longer than 14 days (duration
maximum incubation period, in the event of contamination during the trip, the contaminated passenger
will already be ill himself); at the end of this period, they are destroyed . » The CNPD cannot
only support this short deletion period which seems to be proportionate to the purpose

continued by the processing in question, i.e. sending the data relating to the
passengers at high risk of being infected to the Directorate of Health to ensure that they
self-quarantine in an attempt to break the chain of transmission of the virus. Gold,
for reasons of clarity and legal certainty, the CNPD suggests inserting this clarification
on the retention period of the data in the body of the text of Article 5 paragraph (2)
of the amended bill n°7606.
