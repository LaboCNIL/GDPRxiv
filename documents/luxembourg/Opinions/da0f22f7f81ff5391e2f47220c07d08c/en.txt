The explanatory memorandum further notes that "through this, the Army intends to meet the current challenges
and future, the most important of which lies in the recruitment of a sufficient number of personnel
military and civilian in order to carry out a growing range of missions in its field
of traditional action (terrestrial component), but also in the fields of action more
recent ones, such as the space and cyber domains, to name but a few. Modernization,
the extension and diversification of military careers should in particular contribute to
increasing the attractiveness of the Army”.
 
The National Commission intends to limit its observations to the questions raised by the
provisions of the bill and the draft Grand-Ducal regulation under examination which deal with
aspects related to respect for privacy and the protection of personal data,
i.e. Articles 17 and 18.
 
Article 17 aims to establish a legal basis for access by Army personnel
in the national register of natural persons (hereinafter “RNPP”) and in the file relating to
affiliations of employees, the self-employed and employers (managed by the Joint Center for
social security, hereinafter "CCSS"), in connection with the recruitment and management of personnel
of the Army.
 
The purpose of article 18 is to set up a good repute investigation which is carried out
with regard to each candidate who wishes to integrate the Luxembourg Army, necessary to
performance of Army personnel duties.

I. Ad article 17

 

has. Paragraph 1

 
According to the comments of the articles, this article constitutes the legal basis for the access of the members
of Army personnel to the RNPP and to the file managed by the CCSS as part of recruitment
and management of Army personnel.
 
The authors of the bill explain that this article is inspired by article 43 of the amended law of
18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police. However, while the latter article provides for access to
RNPP, to the file managed by the CCSS and to other files for members of the Grand Ducal Police
having the status of judicial police officer or administrative police officer in the context of
exercise of their judicial police and administrative police missions, it should be noted
that access to such files by Army personnel would not take place in
the same framework but within the framework of the recruitment and management of Army personnel.
 
However, if the CNPD can understand access to these files for the purposes of judicial police missions
and administrative police, it does not see the need to access these files for the purposes of
Human Resource Management.
 
Indeed, with regard to the file managed by the CCSS, the National Commission understands that
candidates must in any case provide the necessary data, to allow
the Army (like any employer who hires personnel in the public sector), to carry out
a declaration of entry to CCSS1. She therefore does not understand why the Army should have
access to the file managed by the CCSS.
 
Nor does it understand the need for the Army to access the RNPP for the purposes of
recruitment and human resource management.
 
In the event that the authors of the bill nevertheless intend to maintain this
provision, the CNPD recalls, following the example of what it had already noted in its opinion on the
Bill No. 7543 amending this amended law of July 18, 2018 on the Grand Police
ducale2, that access to the RNPP should in any case take place in accordance with the

procedure provided for in article 10 of the amended law of 19 June 2013 relating to the identification of
natural persons as well as Articles 5 to 7 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 28 November 2013
laying down the terms of application of the aforementioned law.
 

b. Paragraph 2

 
According to the commentary to the articles, “paragraph 2 refers to the conditions and limits under which
the Army computer system must be set up to ensure compliance with the
legal provisions regarding the processing of personal data”.
 
In the event that the first paragraph of this article 17 is maintained despite the absence
in the eyes of the CNPD, the need for access to the RNPP and to the file managed by the CCSS for
recruitment and personnel management, such conditions and limits would then appear
indispensable. It further notes that the list of administrations which have consulted data
personal in the RNPP during the last 6 months can in any case be
consulted in the private area of the MyGuichet.lu site to which each user has access.
 
Paragraph (2), first paragraph, 1o establishes an access tracking procedure, which allows
to avoid in particular unauthorized access to data, data leaks or
unwanted changes. Such a procedure constitutes a guarantee with regard to the principle
of integrity and confidentiality, enshrined in Article 5, paragraph (1), letter (f) and the obligation to
security of processing detailed in Article 32 of the GDPR. It consists of ensuring that only the
people who need it in the performance of their duties and professional tasks
are entitled to have access to the data necessary for recruitment and management purposes
Staff.
 
Paragraph (2), first paragraph, 2o provides for an access logging system.
Thus, it will be possible to trace any unjustified or disproportionate access to data by
Army personnel. In this context, the CNPD stresses the importance of carrying out
proactively internal controls. To this end, it is appropriate in accordance with Article 32,
paragraph (1), letter d) of the GDPR to implement a procedure “aimed at testing, analyzing
and to regularly assess the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure
security of processing”.
 
The second paragraph refers to the principles of necessity and proportionality, in connection with that
minimization of data pursuant to Article 5, paragraph (1), letter (c) of the GDPR.

relating to bill no. 7880 on the organization of the Luxembourg Army and amending:
1° the amended municipal law of 13 December 1988; 2° the amended law of 27 July
1992 relating to the participation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in operations

of July 23, 1952 concerning the military organization

4/14


Finally, the third paragraph provides that the National Commission for Data Protection
controls and monitors compliance with the conditions of access provided for by the article under examination. To his eyes,
this provision however appears superfluous, whereas it falls within its missions
in accordance with Article 57 of the GDPR.
 
Moreover, although the CNPD understands that this is indeed within its competence,
she wonders why the authors referred to Article 2, paragraph 1, point 15,
letter a, of the law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data in criminal matters as well as in security matters
national. Indeed, with regard to the processing of data for the purposes of managing recruitment and
human resources, this emerges from the “general” missions of the CNPD, detailed in
article 12 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, which refers to Article
58 GDPR.
 
Furthermore, it should be recalled that on the basis of the principle of liability provided for in Article 5,
paragraph (2) of the GDPR, it is primarily up to the controller himself, i.e.
tell the Luxembourg Army, to ensure compliance with the principles of the GDPR and in particular
those mentioned above (namely the principles of integrity and confidentiality, necessity and
proportionality).
 
In this context, the CNPD considers it necessary for the Army to regularly monitor the data
accessed through access tracking, to identify and remediate unnecessary access
or disproportionate, where appropriate by communicating a possible data breach to
data subjects or to the CNPD, in accordance with Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR. It's not
only a posteriori that the National Commission will be called upon to exercise its power of investigation or to

adopt corrective measures, in accordance with Article 58, paragraph (2) of the GDPR.
 
In this respect, the National Commission wonders about the added value of devoting a part
relating to the performance of its control mission which will be carried out under Article
under review, as part of its report sent annually to the Minister having the protection
data in its attributions, in execution of article 10 of the law of August 1, 2018 on
organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the general regime
on data protection. In fact, as indicated above, this emerges in any case from
because of the general missions of the CNPD. Furthermore, it does not seem logical to him to dedicate

II. Article 18

 

has. Paragraph 1

 
According to the commentary on the articles, “Article 18 sets up a good repute investigation which is
carried out with regard to each candidate who wishes to join the Luxembourg Army, regardless of
regardless of the status to which he wishes to access, which aims to verify that the candidate for a job in a
categories of salaries and allowances for military and civilian personnel or those on voluntary service,
does not constitute a threat to self or others, or even to national security”. On
the concept of a good repute inquiry, the National Commission refers to its opinion on the draft
law no. 76913.
 
The CNPD welcomes the fact that this article, from the point of view of legal certainty, constitutes the basis
legality of the good repute investigation carried out by the Luxembourg Army in this context,
in accordance with Article 6 paragraph (3) of the GDPR.
 
The second paragraph of paragraph 1 lists the elements to be taken into account during this
integrity investigation, this “for reasons of transparency and clarity as to the criteria
verified” according to the article comment. However, among these criteria, some pose
question.
 
Thus, the third criterion (which falls under the jurisdiction of the State Intelligence Service,
according to the commentary of the articles), namely “the relationship of the interested party with persons
suspected of acting on behalf of or obeying the orders of a foreign secret service and who may
threaten national security" should be clarified, in order to know what is needed more
exactly to understand by "relationship".
 
Furthermore, the fifth criterion (“indictment in court cases”) poses
question under the principle of the presumption of innocence. Indeed, as noted by the

Council of State in its additional opinion of the Council of State of December 19, 2020 relating to the
Bill No. 7425 on weapons and ammunition 4, the attention of the authors of the bill should be drawn
of law on the fact that “a minute or a report are not the equivalent of a decision of
justice having retained a person in the bonds of prevention and that the principle of
presumption of innocence must prevail. Furthermore, the term "court cases" is missing.
precision in the eyes of the CNPD: is it an indictment against any
misdemeanor, misdemeanor and/or felony? Is the seriousness of the criminal offense taken into account? From
at what stage of the criminal investigation such an indictment will be taken into account in
candidate assessment?
 
Similarly, the sixth criterion (“the existence of one or more disciplinary antecedents of
the interested party”) is quite vague, whereas this concept could cover a variety of acts of
very different severities. Are these disciplinary sanctions pronounced by the Army, by other
administrations and/or by private employers, in Luxembourg or abroad? Is it held
account of the seriousness of these disciplinary sanctions, and if necessary whether they can be
constitute criminal offenses under Luxembourg law? What if these sanctions
disciplinary proceedings have been challenged, where appropriate before the administrative tribunal or the tribunal du
Work ? What would be the scope of the secrecy of the investigation in relation to the rules of procedure
administrative non-contentious and contentious 5?
 
For these reasons, the National Commission wonders whether the criteria referred to in paragraph (1),
2nd paragraph, 3o, 5o and 6o would not be too vague and therefore, if they would respect the
principle of predictability and precision to which any legal or regulatory text must comply 6.
 
Finally, the last paragraph of paragraph 1 provides that a candidate who does not have
the required good repute may be refused admission to the position concerned. However, without prejudice to
the in concreto assessment that would be carried out in this area, it is regrettable that neither the project

of law under opinion, nor the comments of the articles specify which criteria or which degree of
seriousness of the antecedents are taken into account by the Chief of Staff of the Army to assess

the good repute of the persons concerned. In the absence of such details, it is difficult
to assess whether the principle of data minimization would be respected. It should be recalled that in
under this principle, only personal data which are
strictly necessary for the achievement of the purposes pursued.
 

b. Paragraph 2

 
The commentary to the articles explains that "research and information gathering
as part of the integrity check are not carried out by the Army itself. In effect,
paragraph 2 provides that the information is collected by the Grand Ducal Police, on
request of the Chief of Staff of the Army, who has by law the legal bases for him
allowing access to databases, insofar as this consultation is necessary
in relation to the desired end”.
 
The National Commission welcomes the establishment of such a mechanism, which prevents
Army personnel are granted direct and unrestricted access for the purposes of
determination of good repute as defined in paragraph 1.
 
Nevertheless, it is worth noting in this respect the draft law n°7741 amending 1° of the
amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police, 2° of the amended law of 5 July 2016
reorganizing the SRE and 3° of the Penal Code, filed on December 30, 2020. Said draft
law aims in particular to regulate the processing of personal data
carried out in the files of the Grand Ducal Police, and more specifically in the central file.
Particular attention should be paid to access to the passive part of the central file. His
access is, in fact, strictly limited to the purposes listed in paragraph (19) of Article 43-
2 of bill no. 7741 (administrative inquiries are not covered therein) and is subject to
the consent of the State Attorney General. Therefore, the authors of the bill should ensure that
the good coherence and articulation between the two draft texts.
 
In the commentary to the articles, the authors of the bill specify that “the authority carrying out
on the basis of its attribution this administrative investigation, must guarantee the respect of the private life
within the meaning of Article 11 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms on the one hand and the national provisions and
with regard to the processing of the personal data of the other”.

As already mentioned above8, with regard to the indictment in cases
legal proceedings, as well as the existence of one or more disciplinary records of the person concerned, the
authors of the bill should also pay particular attention to the secrecy of
instruction.
 
However, the National Commission welcomes the fact that the first paragraph provides a temporal framework for
facts to which the information provided by the Grand-Ducal Police relates, insofar as it
provides for maximum delays between the commission of an act, likely to be taken into account in
the framework of the integrity investigation, and the moment when it can be taken into account.
 
The second subparagraph of paragraph 2 refers to the principle of purpose limitation,
provided for by Article 5, paragraph (1), letter b of the GDPR, which would be applicable in this case to the
Grand Ducal Police. The National Commission understands that the Police would act in this context
as a subcontractor within the meaning of the GDPR, while the Chief of Staff of the Army will remain
controller and as such also subject to the principle of purpose limitation.
 
Finally, paragraph 3 provides that “[t]he information concerning the facts referred to in paragraph 1 is
communicated to the Chief of the Army Staff in the form of the entirety or extracts of
verbal or police reports, or any other document or process containing the
relevant information”. It should be recalled in this regard that Article 10 of the GDPR provides that "[t]he
processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offenses or related security measures based on Article 6(1) cannot be
carried out only under the control of public authority, or if the processing is authorized by the law of
Union or by the law of a Member State which provides appropriate safeguards for the rights and
freedoms of the persons concerned”. The said article further specifies that "[a]ny complete register
criminal convictions can only be held under the control of public authority”.
 
In this context, it is essential that safeguards be provided for in the bill, in
in particular in the event of transmission of such data in the form of the entire report
or police reports. Otherwise, the persons concerned (candidates and members
Army personnel) would see a duplication of their data relating to
criminal convictions or indictments by multiple jurisdictions. Collection
such data during the administrative investigation could lead to the holding of a kind of
new "bis locker" by the Chief of Staff of the Army. The latter would have, if necessary, to
at the end of the investigation, copies of all or extracts of police reports, court proceedings,

verbal, judgments, or even information that would be necessary provided by the SRE
(as referred to in paragraph 5 of the same article).
 
In addition, there is still room to question the issue of the accuracy and updating of the
data that would be transmitted by the Grand Ducal Police or by the SRE to the Chief of Staff,
whereas the envisaged system does not provide for a return of these authorities to the Army. By
example, this question could arise in the event that data transmitted by the
Grand-Ducal Police or the SRE, and relating to facts concerning a candidate would lead to a
decision of non-suit, or a dismissal9 10.
 
The CNPD therefore considers it essential that guarantees be provided by the authors of the draft
law, like those referred to in paragraph 7, second paragraph of the same article. The transmission
a detailed opinion from the Grand Ducal Police instead of transmissions of the full or
extracts from the minutes, currently provided for by the bill, could constitute a
alternative11.
 

vs. Paragraph 3

 
According to the commentary on the articles, this paragraph has the effect of ensuring that the
Grand-Ducal Police does not communicate data that would go beyond the elements that are
taken into account by the Army in its integrity investigation. The National Commission welcomes
of the introduction to this paragraph, in connection with the principle of purpose limitation enshrined in
Article 5, paragraph (1), letter b of the GDPR. For the rest, it refers to its developments
in paragraph 2.
 

d. Paragraph 4

 
Paragraph 4 grants the possibility for the Minister and the Army Chief of Staff to
request the issuance of an extract from bulletin No. 2, in accordance with Articles 8 and 8-1 of the law
of March 29, 2013 relating to the organization of criminal records.

It is appropriate to wonder about the added value of this paragraph, if not to repeat the
aforementioned provisions. Indeed, article 1 of the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 July 2016
fixing the list of administrations and legal persons governed by public law who may request a
bulletin N°2 or N°3 of the criminal record with the written or electronic agreement of the person
concerned, point 15 provides that "[t]he bulletin No. 2 may be issued on request and with the agreement
expressly in writing or electronically from the person concerned (…) to the Minister having
Defense in its attributions for the instruction of the applications for employment of the military career and
civil service and requests for voluntary service in the Army”.
 
Furthermore, Article 8-1 concerns Bulletin No. 3, and the National Commission is asking itself
why does paragraph 4 of the bill under consideration refer only to the
bulletin number 2.
 

e. Paragraph 5

 
This paragraph should be read in conjunction with paragraph 1, paragraph 2, points 2 and 3, which concerns two
criteria taken into consideration in order to verify whether the candidate has the good repute necessary to
the performance of the duties of Army personnel, namely the membership of the person concerned in a
group likely to be considered terrorist or extremist, on the one hand, and the
relations of the person concerned with persons suspected of acting on behalf of or obeying the orders of a
foreign secret service, on the other hand.
 
In addition to the considerations expressed above concerning the notion of “relationships”12, it is necessary to
ask how personal data will be transmitted in practice, while
paragraph 5 simply provides that they will be exchanged “on request or in a manner
spontaneous”.
 
Furthermore, the National Commission wonders whether this collaboration with the Service de
State intelligence falls within the framework of the latter’s cooperation with the
administrations, as referred to in article 9 of the amended law of 5 July 2016 on
reorganization of the State Intelligence Service. If so, it might be useful to
refer to in this paragraph of the bill.

f. Paragraph 7

 
According to the commentary to the articles, paragraph 7 is intended to "establish a legal basis for
the Chief of Staff of the Army, to initiate a good repute investigation in the event of an indication that a
member of the Army personnel is likely to pose such a threat”. However, it is appropriate
to regret that neither the text of the bill nor the commentary to the articles specify which
could be “information likely to cast doubt on the good repute of a member of the
military or civilian personnel.
 
However, the commentary to the articles explains that “the integrity investigation carried out by the
chief of staff in the process of engagement of a member of the personnel of the Army will be subject to
the authorization of the Minister, preceded by a reasoned request from the Chief of Staff", which
would allow, according to the authors of the bill, to “limit, or even avoid abuses”. The
CNPD welcomes the establishment of such a guarantee, even if, in its opinion, any abuse
could not be definitively ruled out.
 
The second subparagraph of paragraph 7, for its part, provides for the possibility for the Chief of Staff to
the Army to receive necessary information from the State Attorney General
regarding possible preliminary investigations or preparatory instructions in relation to
the facts referred to in paragraph 1.
 
The authors of the bill recognize that this is a “rather delicate situation, whereas
this information generally falls under the secrecy of the instruction”. Nevertheless, they justify
this exception to the principle of the secrecy of the instruction by the fact that "it would be contrary to the purpose
of this integrity investigation not to be able to use this information, while it
important to avoid that a person, against whom a preparatory instruction or a
preliminary investigation is in progress because of a recent event, can occupy a position within
the Army. Moreover, they indicate that this exception “will be strictly framed and limited to the
strictly necessary, in particular with regard to the information that the Attorney General of State
forward to the Army Chief of Staff. Thus, the personal data which
would, if necessary, be forwarded to the Army General Staff for as long as the facts in question
cause are covered by the secrecy of the instruction, are exhaustively listed in the second
subparagraph of paragraph 7.

The CNPD refers on this subject to its developments relating to the secrecy of the instruction13. She believes
essential that safeguards be provided by the authors of the bill. In this regard, she welcomes
the fact that the integrity check carried out by the Chief of Staff in the process of hiring a
member of the Army personnel is subject to the authorization of the Minister, preceded by a
reasoned request from the Chief of Staff. Furthermore, it notes with satisfaction that unlike
the procedure applicable to new candidates referred to in paragraph 2 of the same article, the head
of staff will not receive all or extracts of official reports or police reports,
but only the surname, first name, national identification number as well as the qualification
of the facts with which he is charged and which are criminalized by the legal provisions referred to
in paragraph 3.

She wonders, however, why these safeguards are not included in the framework of the
recruitment provided for in paragraph 2 of the same article, with regard to new candidates 14.

In any event, particular attention should be paid to compliance with the principles of
limitation of the conservation, as well as that of accuracy and updating of the data, detailed
in the following paragraphs of this notice.
 

g. On the principle of limitation of storage

 

According to Article 5, paragraph (1), letter e) of the GDPR, personal data must only be
not be kept longer than necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for
which they are collected and processed. Beyond that, the data must be deleted or
anonymized.
 
However, article 18 of the bill does not indicate for how long the data that will be
collected by the Army or transmitted to the Chief of Staff would be retained. Therefore, the
National Commission is not in a position to assess whether, in this case, the principle of duration
limited data retention would be respected.
 
It is essential that clarifications on this subject be provided, all the more so in view of the
nature of the personal data in question. Thus, the shelf life should be
defined in the bill or it should at least specify the criteria that would be taken into

account in order to determine what is the proportionate retention period for each

administrative.
 

h. On the principle of data accuracy

during investigations

In accordance with Article 5, paragraph (1), letter d) of the GDPR, personal data
must be “accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; all reasonable measures must
be taken so that personal data which is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes
for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay”.

However, it should be noted that the device under opinion does not provide for any provision relating to the
updating of data obtained in the context of administrative surveys. However, taking into account
of the data collected, the authors of the bill should be drawn to the fact that it
there is a significant risk that data relating to a person whose case has been closed
without action or who has in the meantime been acquitted of an offense of which she has been accused are
still in the records of the administration, without an update or related rectification, and
this is all the more so since no retention period is currently provided for in the bill.
