On July 2, 2021, the Director of the Treasury, on behalf of the Minister of
Finance, forwarded government amendments to the bill to the CNPD to
notice.
 
The CNPD welcomes the changes made by amendments 16 and 18, to articles 28 and
32 of the bill, which now specify that the necessary data can be
collected by the Caisse de Consignation, which it had advised in the aforementioned opinion.
 
Amendment 16 further aims to specify the procedures for transmitting the request for
consignment at the Consignment Fund. Following the amendment, Articles 28 and 32 provide
that the transmission of the consignment request as well as the information and documents
additional information must be made "by way of electronic filing on a state platform

which adds a paragraph 6 to article 32 stipulating that the consignment fund is
consider to be the controller within the meaning of Article 4. 7) of the GDPR of the
processing implemented on the basis of the article in question, as it had suggested in
his opinion.

However, it regrets that the authors of the amendments did not consider it appropriate to give
following the other points raised by the CNPD, in particular concerning the processing of
personal data carried out by establishments and companies
insurance companies, the retention period of the data processed by the persons in charge of
data processing and transmissions to and between public bodies. She reiterates
therefore the recommendations made in its opinion of February 1, 2019.
 
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on August 6, 2021.
