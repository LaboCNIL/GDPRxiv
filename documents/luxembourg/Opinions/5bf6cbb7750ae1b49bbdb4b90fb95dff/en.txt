1. On the amendments adopted by the Committee on Internal Security and

Defense

 

- Ad Amendment 1

 

The purpose of Amendment 1 is to modify paragraph (1) of the new article 43bis of the law
amended on July 18, 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police. This modification consists of the addition of

                                           
1 Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection relating to draft law no. 7498 amending the amended law
of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police, deliberation n°04/2020 of 28 February 2020.
2 Complementary opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection relating to draft law no. 7498 amending

purposes “as they appear in Article 17, paragraph 1, letter (a) of the amended law of 2
August 2002 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
staff” 3.
 
The National Commission welcomes this addition as it had suggested in its
opinion of February 28, 2020 relating to the bill4, following the example of the Council of State in its opinion of February 10
March 20205.
 
With regard to the replacement of the words "particular risk of commission of crimes or
offenses or attacks on the security of persons or property” by the notion of “particular risk
commission of criminal offences", it should be noted that this amendment takes up
substantially the terms of article 17, paragraph (1) letter d) of the amended law of 2 August 2002
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data6.
 
This amendment is guided by the intention of the drafters of the bill not to “limit the
video surveillance to specific categories of offences”7. However, these latter
seem to want to exclude contraventions from the scope of the bill under notice.
 
Indeed, the authors of the bill specify that “[t]he use of the terms “offences
penalties", which include those qualified as contraventions, does not in any way mean that
the intention is to extend video surveillance to places where offenses are committed”8.
 
If the will of the authors of the bill is not to extend video surveillance to places where
contraventions would be committed, there is reason to question the relevance of the
terminology used. Therefore, should we not take up the proposal of the Council of State in
its opinion of March 10, 2020 in that it proposes to refer to the terms “crimes or misdemeanors”9?
 
Finally, insofar as the change in terminology entails a broadening of the field
application of video surveillance, the CNPD takes the liberty of insisting on the importance of
the impact analysis that should be carried out in particular with regard to the justification of the
necessity of the video surveillance with regard to the criteria defined in paragraph (2) of the article
43bis new and the purposes pursued.

conditions referred to under (a), a security zone video surveillance system. Is to be considered as such any place accessible
to the public which by its nature, location, configuration or frequentation presents an increased risk of committing offenses
criminal. The safety zones are fixed under the conditions provided for by Grand-Ducal regulation”.

- Ad Amendment 2

 

With regard to the replacement of the words "crimes or misdemeanors or security breaches
persons or property” by the words “criminal offences”, the CNPD refers to its
comments above.
 
The National Commission welcomes the other modifications but nevertheless wishes
to reiterate its comments made in its additional opinion of April 17, 2020 relating to the
bill10 in that it suggests, following the example of the Council of State11, the deletion of point 4° of the
paragraph (2) of the new article 43bis of the amended law of July 18, 2018 on the Grand Police
ducal.
 

- Ad Amendment 3

 

The National Commission welcomes the fact that the authors of the bill have replaced the term "zone
of security” by “place”, as it had suggested in its additional opinion of April 17
2020 relating to the bill12, like the Council of State13.
 

 

- Ad Amendment 4

 

The authors of the bill are to be congratulated on the amendments made to Article 43bis
new, paragraph (5), paragraph 2, in that these provisions provide that “[t]he use of
facial recognition techniques is excluded”.
 
The authors of the bill followed in particular the suggestion made by the CNPD in its opinion
of February 28, 2020 relating to the bill. The National Commission regrets, however, that the text
under notice does not take up its suggestion concerning the exclusion of sound recording14.
 
Moreover, the authors of the bill further specify in their commentary on the amendment
under the opinion that “[t]he ban on the use of facial recognition techniques is therefore not
not to be understood as a general prohibition and does not imply in particular that these
techniques cannot be used in the context of criminal prosecution to elucidate
criminal offenses according to the rules of criminal procedure”.
 
In this regard, the attention of the authors of the bill should be drawn to the fact that the use of
facial recognition techniques in the law enforcement field, currently under discussion at the

European level, is still very questionable from a data protection point of view
and privacy.

 

- Ad Amendment 5

 

The CNPD welcomes the fact that the authors of the bill have integrated the proposals made in
its opinion of February 28, 2020 on the draft law with regard to paragraph (6) of Article
43bis new of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police.

 

- Ad Amendment 6

 

The purpose of this amendment is in particular to delete the reference made to "[t]he Grand-Police
ducale, represented by its director general" in his capacity as controller.
 
This deletion occurs “[in] the light of the work to develop a legal basis
specific relating to the processing of personal data carried out by the Police
grand-ducal”15.
 
Indeed, it should be noted that article 4 of bill n°7741 inserts a new article 43-3
in the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand-Ducal Police, which designates the Grand-Ducal Police
ducale as data controller for the processing of personal data
that she performs.

 

- Ad Amendment 7

 

This amendment supplements paragraph (9) of the new article 43bis in that it provides that the
data would not be erased after a period of two months for the cases referred to in the new
paragraph (11), introduced by the said amendment.
 
This new paragraph (11) of the new article 43bis provides that “[t]he processing of data
of a personal nature for the purposes of the prevention, research and observation of offenses
criminal cases may be used by the Police for the purposes of analysis of the flow of operations, including
including the review of incidents with the objective of improving plans and procedures
intervention, as well as for internal training purposes”.
 
The National Commission notes the introduction of such a purpose in a legal basis, which is
indeed necessary in accordance with Article 8, paragraph (1) of the law of 1 August 2018 relating
to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personnel in criminal matters as well as in matters of national security.
 
On reading the commentary to the amendment under opinion, the National Commission understands that
the “recorded images” would be used by the Grand Ducal Police to “carry out the analysis
the course of the intervention, as well as for internal training purposes, with the aim of
to improve the plans and procedures for future interventions of the same type”.
 

                                           
15 Comment by the authors of the bill under “Amendment 6”, parliamentary document no. 7498/06, page 5.

2018 on the Grand Ducal Police.

 

However, as noted by the Council of State in its second additional opinion of 23
February 2021 “the use of the terms “[t]he processing of personal data for the purposes of
prevention, research and determination of criminal offences” leads one to believe that
all the data used by the Grand Ducal Police for the purposes of prevention,
research and observation of criminal offenses could be used for other purposes
set forth therein. Such a provision, apart from the fact that it does not correspond to the intention of the authors
as explained in the commentary to the amendment, would go beyond the purpose of the draft law”16.
 
The CNPD again agrees with the questions raised by the Council of State insofar as it
“asks whether it is necessary to use all the data collected through the
video surveillance or if it would not be enough to target only data relating to interventions
large-scale police forces and of interest in the context of the analysis of the conduct of
intervention and internal training”17.
 
Furthermore, in the absence of details as to the technical measures that would be taken (for
technical example of masking or blurring of the faces of the persons concerned) in order to
to use images from video surveillance "for the purpose of analyzing the progress of
operations, including the review of incidents with the objective of improving plans and
intervention procedures, as well as for internal training purposes”, the National Commission
is not in a position to assess whether the principle of data minimization is respected in
the species.
 
The authors of the bill should therefore specify what data would be
consulted for the purposes set out in paragraph (11) of the new article 43bis as well as the
technical means that would be taken to reuse images from video surveillance
for such purposes.
 
By way of comparison, it is interesting to note that in Belgium, article 25/7 paragraph (2) of
the amended law on the police function of August 5, 1992 provides that “[a]fter anonymization, the
personal data and information referred to in paragraph 1 may be used for
didactic and pedagogical purposes as part of the training of members of the services
from police ".
 
It should be noted that the anonymization of personal data has the following
consequence that once anonymized, the data are no longer subject to the GDPR and their
distribution or reuse has no impact on the privacy of the persons concerned.
 
If the intention of the authors of the bill is not to provide that the data be
anonymized, the National Commission regrets that the retention period of the images for
the purposes indicated in paragraph (11) of the new article 43bis have not been specified.
 
It should be recalled that according to Article 5 paragraph (1) letter e) of the GDPR, the data to be
personal character should not be kept longer than necessary for the

amended on July 18, 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police, parliamentary document no. 7498/08, page 5.

fulfillment of the purposes for which they are collected and processed. Beyond that, the data
should be deleted or anonymized.
 
However, in the absence of such details in the bill under opinion, the National Commission is not
not in a position to assess whether this principle is respected.
 
Therefore, the CNPD considers that the retention period should be defined in the draft law.
or that it should at least specify the criteria that would be taken into account in order to determine
what is the proportionate retention period for data from video surveillance
and processed for the purposes set out in paragraph (11) of new Article 43bis.

 

2. On the advice of the Union of Luxembourg Towns and Municipalities18

 
Reference is made to the developments of the CNPD in its opinion of February 28, 2020 and its opinions of
March 15, 2019 relating to the video surveillance of public spaces and places for security purposes
public (deliberation No. 36/2019) and of May 10, 2019 relating to the use of video surveillance
by the municipalities (deliberation n°39/2019) on the need to introduce a legal framework
allowing a municipality wishing to set up, as data controller, a
video surveillance device in public spaces for public security purposes, including
general safety of people and property.
 
The National Commission again refers to its opinions of February 28, 2020 and March 15 and May 10
2019 mentioned above with regard to the interactions between the police and the mayors, whereas neither
the municipal law of December 13, 1988 nor the amended law of July 18, 2018 on the Grand Police
ducale do not specify the competences of the mayors in matters of administrative police.
 
Finally, it should be noted that the bill under consideration currently provides that only the
Director General of the Grand Ducal Police may take the initiative, with the authorization of the Minister,
to extend the VISUPOL video surveillance system to other municipal areas than
that of the City of Luxembourg. In the event that this system is extended to other
municipal territories, shouldn't we provide a system that would not be based only on the
sole initiative of the Director General of the Grand Ducal Police?
 
The CNPD wonders whether the initiative to place a public place or space under surveillance does not
could not also be taken on the initiative of the territorially competent mayor, such as
suggested by the Union of Luxembourg Towns and Municipalities in its opinion of 25 January
2021 relating to the bill19. Nevertheless, the National Commission has reservations about the
proposal for reformulation of new article 43bis, paragraph (1), made by SYVICOL
in its aforementioned opinion, whereas neither the aforementioned municipal law nor the law on the Grand-Ducal Police
mentioned above does not specify the competences of the mayors in matters of administrative police.
 
The CNPD emphasizes once again that VISUPOL is a video surveillance system operated by
the Grand-Ducal Police as the data controller, which will not, a priori, be intended to

be extended to other municipal territories than that of the City of Luxembourg and that the
issue of the lawfulness of surveillance by video cameras of public spaces or places
carried out on the initiative of the Commons is not resolved by the bill under consideration. Of the
Therefore, the National Commission can only reiterate its observations made in its opinions of the
March 15, 2019 relating to the video surveillance of public spaces and places for security purposes
public (deliberation No. 36/2019) and of May 10, 2019 relating to the use of video surveillance
