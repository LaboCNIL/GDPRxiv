Deliberation n° 9/AV8/2021 of March 3, 2021

 
 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “the GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as "the National Commission" or
"the CNPD") "advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to treatment”.
 
On January 21, 2021, the Minister of Social Security referred the matter to the Commission
request for an opinion on bill n°7751 amending 1° the Security Code
social; 2° the Labor Code; 3° the amended law of 15 December 1993 determining the framework
staff of social security administrations, services and courts; and 4°
the amended law of 28 July 2000 having as its object the coordination of statutory pension schemes
(hereinafter: “Bill of Law No. 7751”).
 
According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of bill n°7751 is to make corrections to the
Social Security Code for various reasons, including updating cross-references
to other laws, the rectification of material errors or the necessary adaptations following
the entry into force of other laws having an impact on social security legislation, such as
the law of March 8, 2018 relating to hospital establishments and hospital planning.
Moreover, the authors of the bill specify that "in accordance with the wishes of the
National Commission for Data Protection, the provisions concerning the duration of
storage of the data processed in the shared care file, which currently appears
in a Grand-Ducal regulation, are incorporated into the law in Article 60quater of the Code of
social Security. »
 
The National Commission thus intends to limit its observations to the provisions of the draft
Law No. 7751 affecting privacy and data protection
of a personal nature, and more particularly its article 1st point 19 which aims precisely to
amend the aforementioned Article 60quater of the Social Security Code.

Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection on the draft
Law No. 7751 amending 1° the Social Security Code; 2° the Labor Code; 3° the

 

amended law of 15 December 1993 determining the personnel framework of

social security administrations, services and courts; and 4° the law
amended on July 28, 2000, the purpose of which is to coordinate the legal regimes of

 

pension.

Ad article 1st point 19 of bill n°7751
 
 
Currently, the retention period for data entered into the shared care file
is provided for in Article 10 paragraph (5) of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 6 December 2019
specifying the terms and conditions for setting up the shared care file.
 
Article 1 point 19 of draft law no. 7751 under opinion “aims to include the principle of
retention period of the data processed with the derogations guaranteeing flexibility,
as retained at the time of the development of the Grand-Ducal regulation, in article 60quater
of the Social Security Code. »1
 
Already in its opinion of 5 April 2018 relating to the draft Grand-Ducal regulation specifying the
terms and conditions for setting up the shared care file, the CNPD had considered
that in view of the principle of lawfulness of the processing of personal data which must be
read in the light of Article 8 paragraph (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights
concerning the right to respect for private life, as well as Article 52 paragraphs (1) and (2)
of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union2, the provisions concerning the
retention period of data at the DSP should be provided for in the law in the strict sense
of the term and more specifically by article 60quater of the Social Security Code, and not
in a regulatory act.
 
In general, the CNPD can therefore only support the aforementioned modification
to insert a paragraph (6) in Article 60quater of the Social Security Code on the
retention period of the data entered in the shared care file. However,
it notes that the last two paragraphs of Article 10 paragraph (5) of the Grand-
of December 6, 2019 specifying the terms and conditions for setting up the file
shared care were not taken up by the authors of bill n°7751. Thus, the CNPD
recommends that they complete the new paragraph (6) of article 60quater of the Code of
social security by the following two paragraphs:
 

“The holder’s agreement is dated and recorded in his personal expression space
in the shared care record application.
 
By way of derogation from the first paragraph, information relating to the personal expression of the
holder of the shared care file are kept until the latter
modify or delete them. »

 
Finally, in its aforementioned opinion of April 5, 2018, the CNPD had estimated that on the basis of the
above-mentioned principles, the provisions regulating the rights of minor holders not
emancipated persons and adult holders protected by law should also be provided for in the law at
strict sense of the term and more specifically by article 60quater of the Social Security Code,
and not in a regulatory act.
 
 

                                                 
1 See commentary to article 1 point 19 of bill no. 7751.
2 For more details, the CNPD refers to its deliberation no. 242/2018 of 5 April 2018.

In its additional opinion of 18 October 2019 relating to the draft Grand-Ducal regulation
specifying the terms and conditions for setting up the shared care file,3 the
National Commission had noted that the authors of the said project had quite simply
deleted former article 7 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation concerning minor holders
non-emancipated persons and adult holders protected by law for the following reasons: "The opinions
of the Council of State and the National Commission for Data Protection establish
that article 7, at least in part, derogates from the rules relating to minors and adults
protected by law as provided for in the Civil Code.
 
Thus, in order to respect the hierarchy of norms, article 7 is deleted, the
provisions which introduce specific rights for certain minors which must be included
in the particular laws governing their rights. »
 
However, unless it is mistaken, the CNPD notes that no bill has been submitted to the
Chamber of Deputies, with a view to adopting the necessary legislative measures to take
into account the said considerations on the rights of unemancipated minor holders and
adult holders protected by law. She therefore wonders why the authors of the project
of Law No. 7751 did not take advantage of the bill under consideration to introduce the measures
legislation in question.
 
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on March 3, 2021.
