By letter dated March 25, 2020, the Minister of Homeland Security invited the
National Commission to decide on the draft Grand-Ducal regulation on: 1°
fixing of the conditions and methods of the special test of the examination-competition for admission
at the training period for treatment categories A and B and treatment group C1 of the police officer

On the bill
 

1. Preliminary remarks

 

The National Commission welcomes the fact that Article 58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the
Grand-Ducal Police, from the point of view of legal certainty, constitutes the legal basis for
the morality investigation carried out by the Grand-Ducal Police in the context set out above,
in accordance with Article 6 paragraph (3) of the GDPR2.
 
Indeed, it should be recalled that the processing of personal data collected and
processed in the context of the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of
the official authority vested in the controller must have a legal basis
in accordance with Article 6 paragraph (3) of the GDPR, read together with its paragraph (1) letters
c) and e) 3 which provides that: “The basis for the processing referred to in paragraph 1, points c) and e), is
defined by :

has. Union law; Where
b. the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject.

The purposes of the processing are defined in this legal basis or, insofar as
relates to the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, are necessary for the performance
of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of the official authority of which
invested the controller. This legal basis may contain
specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation,
among others: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of the processing by the
controller; the types of data that are subject to processing; them
persons concerned; the entities to which the personal data
may be disclosed and the purposes for which they may be disclosed; the
purpose limitation; retention periods; and the operations and procedures of
processing, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as

                                                           
2 It should be noted that the Law of 1 August 2018 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data in criminal matters as well as in matters of national security is not intended to apply in the case
present while the processing implemented by the Grand Ducal Police is for recruitment purposes
3 Article 6, paragraph (1), letters c) and e) provides that: “Processing is only lawful if and insofar as at least one of the
following conditions is met: (…) c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller
treatment is submitted; (…) e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or relating to the exercise of
the official authority vested in the controller; (…)”

than those provided for in other specific processing situations such as
provides for Chapter IX. »
 

the entities to which

This article provides for a specific constraint related to the lawfulness of data processing
necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task in the public interest or
relating to the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In
these two scenarios, the basis and purposes of the data processing must
specifically be defined either by the law of the European Union or by the law of the State
member to which the controller is subject.
 
In addition, recital (45) of the GDPR specifies that it should “[…] belong to Union law or
the right of a Member State to determine the purpose of the processing. Furthermore, this right could
specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of the processing of
personal data, establish the specifications aimed at determining the person responsible for the
processing, the type of personal data being processed, the persons
concerned,
personal data can be
communicated, purpose limitations, retention period and other measures aimed at
to guarantee lawful and fair processing. […]”.
 
Pursuant to the above provisions, these legal bases should establish provisions
aimed at determining, among other things, the types of data processed, the persons
concerned, the entities to which the data may be communicated and for which
purposes, the data retention periods or the operations and procedures of
treatment. Recital (41) of the GDPR further states that "Where this Regulation makes
reference to a legal basis or legislative measure, this does not necessarily mean
that the adoption of a legislative act by a parliament is required, without prejudice to the obligations
provided for under the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, this basis
legal or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be
foreseeable for litigants, in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the Union
European Union and the European Court of Human Rights. ". At the national level a base
legal act can therefore constitute a legislative or regulatory act, which is the case here.
of the bill and the draft Grand-Ducal regulation under examination.
 
Thus, the National Commission must emphasize the fundamental importance of the principle of
lawfulness of personal data processing which must be read in the light of Article 8
paragraph (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to
privacy, as well as article 52 paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Charter of Rights
fundamentals of the European Union. In essence, these two articles, together with the
consistent case law of the European Court of Human Rights, hold that a
___________________________________________________________________________

data processing carried out by a public authority may constitute interference with the
right to respect for private life or limit the exercise of the right to data protection. This
interference or limitation may be justified provided that it:
 

is provided for by a law accessible to the persons concerned and foreseeable as to its
repercussions, i.e. formulated with sufficient precision;
is necessary in a democratic society, subject to the principle of
proportionality;
respects the essential content of the right to data protection;
effectively meets objectives of general interest or the need to protect
rights and freedoms of others.

-

-

-

 

As regards the first condition, according to the case law of the European Court of
human rights, an interference with the right to respect for private life is not "in accordance with the law",
within the meaning of Article 8 paragraph (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights4, that
if it is based on an article of national law which has certain characteristics. The expression
"provided by law" therefore implies, according to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights
human beings that internal legislation must use terms that are clear enough to indicate to everyone
sufficiently in what circumstances and under what conditions it empowers the power
to resort to measures affecting their rights protected by the Convention5. The legislation
internal must be “accessible to the persons concerned and foreseeable as to its
repercussions”6. A rule is foreseeable "if it is formulated with sufficient precision to
allow anyone – possibly benefiting from appropriate assistance – to adapt
behavior”7 as well as “The degree of precision required of the ‘law’ in this regard will depend on the
subject in question. »8.
 

                                                           
4 Article 8 paragraph (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that: “There shall be no interference by a
public authority in the exercise of this right only insofar as this interference is prescribed by law and constitutes a measure
which, in a democratic society, is necessary for national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the country,
the defense of order and the prevention of criminal offences, the protection of health or morals, or the protection of
rights and freedoms of others”

In order to fulfill these criteria of accessibility and predictability of the “law”, on the one hand, and thus limit
possible arbitrary and abusive behavior on the part of public authorities, on the other hand,
national law can therefore provide for and regulate more specifically the processing of data
personal nature carried out by such authorities, such as the Grand Ducal Police. This
legal framework would also guarantee the principle of legal certainty for the benefit of
persons concerned, candidates for police careers. Legal certainty is
even a general principle of European Union law, requiring in particular that a
regulations resulting in adverse consequences for individuals are clear and
precise and predictable application for litigants. The regulations should allow
interested parties to know the exact extent of the obligations it imposes on them, must
allow them to know their rights and obligations unambiguously and allow them
to make their arrangements accordingly.
 
This is why the European Court of Human Rights within its
jurisprudence affirms that "domestic law must offer some protection against attacks
arbitrary actions by the public authorities to the rights guaranteed by Article 8(1)”10. By
Consequently, the internal legislation “must define the extent and the methods of exercise of the power
with sufficient clarity – taking into account the legitimate aim pursued – to provide the individual with a
adequate protection against arbitrariness”. The Court of Justice of the European Union considers that
case of limitation of the protection of personal data or the right to respect for the
privacy a legal text “must provide clear and precise rules governing the scope and
application of the measure in question and imposing a minimum of requirements so that the
persons whose data have been retained have sufficient guarantees allowing
to effectively protect their personal data against the risk of misuse as well as
against any unlawful access and use of such data.
 
Therefore, insofar as the data processing implemented by the Grand Ducal Police
within the framework of the draft law and the draft Grand-Ducal regulation constitutes an interference in
the right to respect for the privacy of candidates for police careers, the bill and the
draft Grand-Ducal regulation should provide a more specific framework for such processing
in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. This
legal framework would also guarantee the principle of legal certainty for the benefit of

persons concerned, candidates for police careers. Legal certainty is
even a general principle of European Union law, requiring in particular that a
regulations resulting in adverse consequences for individuals are clear and
precise and predictable application for litigants. The regulations should allow
interested parties to know the exact extent of the obligations it imposes on them, must
allow them to know their rights and obligations unambiguously and allow them
to make their arrangements accordingly.
 
In addition, the protection of personal data constitutes at national level a
matter reserved for the law insofar as it concerns the protection of the privacy of citizens (article
11 paragraph (3) of the Constitution). According to Article 32, paragraph (3), of the Constitution,
in the said matters reserved to the law by the Constitution, "the Grand Duke cannot take
regulations and decrees only by virtue of a specific legal provision which sets, in addition to the objectives,
the principles and essential points of the implementing measures. » 14.
 
The essential elements15, objectives and principles16 must therefore be included in the law at
strict sense of the term.
 
Thus, and although the investigation of morality has a legal basis, as provided for by article
58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police, the National Commission falls
that the terms and conditions of the processing implemented during the morality investigation do not
are not specified in the aforementioned article 58, as amended by article 1 of the bill, then
that this investigation constitutes an interference with the right to respect for private life and the right to
Data protection.
 

2. On the investigation of morality

 

The National Commission welcomes that the morality inquiry is provided for by a legal basis, such as
than provided for in Article 58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police. Likewise
that it is pleased that the aforementioned article 58, as amended by article 1 of the bill, specifies
henceforth the consequences of the lack of the moral qualities necessary for the execution of one of the

functions of the police officer. However, and as set out above, certain details
deserve to be provided.
 

has. On the lack of definition of the moral qualities required by candidates

to one of the functions of the police officer in the law

 
Indeed, in the absence of definition of the moral qualities required by the candidate for one of the
functions of the police officer, it is difficult to grasp the contours and scope of the investigation of
morality.
 
In addition, the lack of definition of the moral qualities required by candidates for one of the
functions of the police officer, which is nevertheless one of the essential conditions for their admission to the
internship, does not meet the requirements of precision and predictability that must be met by a
legal text. A law must be clear and precise enough to allow people
concerned to know the extent of the limitations, as well as the possible consequences for
they17.
 

i.

Principles identified by administrative case law

 
If article 58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand-Ducal Police, as amended by
the bill, remains silent as to the definition of the notions of moral qualities, it is necessary to
note that administrative case law provides some answers as to what
covers such concepts.
 
It follows in particular from the principles established by administrative case law that morality
of a candidate for one of the functions of the police officer is assessed on the basis of broad criteria which do not
are not based solely on the assessment of the applicant's criminal record (for example
the candidate’s state of mind, his sense of responsibility)18. This is further corroborated by the
parliamentary work relating to bill n°7045 on the reform of the Grand Ducal Police
which specify in the parliamentary document 7045/0919 that: "the police are responsible for
to ensure internal security and are equipped for this purpose with means of constraint, which justifies
that their moral conditions are not assessed on the basis of the criminal record alone”.

                                                           
17 See among others CourEDH, Zakharov e. Russia [GCL n"47413/06, § 228-229, December 4, 2015.
18 Indeed, administrative case law specifies that the notion of morality implies an overall assessment “of the moral qualities
of a candidate for the exam and in particular his state of mind, his sense of responsibility, his social skills, his attitude
relating to compliance with the standards of the country, given that the members of the Grand Ducal police have the precise mission of ensuring
internal security by ensuring the maintenance of public order and compliance with and enforcement of laws and regulations. ". See in this sense
judgment of 2 April 2019 of the Administrative Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 4th chamber, roll number 39804, and judgment
of 18 January 2019 of the Administrative Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 4th chamber, roll number 41619.
19 Pages 29 and 30.

It also emerges from administrative case law in this area that the assessment of the
morality of a candidate must be made in concreto20 and falls within the discretionary power of the Police
Grand Ducal21.
 
Therefore, insofar as it is not the law that defines which elements relate to
the morality investigation or what are the criteria or the degree of seriousness of the antecedents taken into
account but the administrative jurisprudence and this while the investigation of morality constitutes a
undeniable interference with the right to privacy and data protection of candidates, the
National Commission considers it necessary that Article 58, as referred to in the draft law, reflect the
principles identified by administrative case law regarding the notion of moral quality.
 
Indeed, the current text lacks transparency and does not allow the candidate to know which
are the criteria or what degree of severity of his or her history, if any, is taken into account
by the Grand Ducal Police, in order to assess whether he has the necessary moral qualities. During
of this investigation, is the Grand-Ducal Police required to consult state files,
internal files of the Grand Ducal Police or other files? An enumeration of
files consulted, rather than the current formula used22, would allow the candidate to have a
better understanding of the conditions he must fulfill in order to access one of the functions of the
police officer.
 
Furthermore, by way of example, the attention of the authors of the bill should be drawn to the fact
that the law of June 15, 2004 relating to the classification of documents and security clearances,
as amended, provides for the procedures for the security investigation to which the
State officials and State employees assigned to the Intelligence Service, in order to
check in particular whether they have guarantees of morality. Although this law does not define
the notion of "guarantee of morality", it is however more precise with regard to access
to the database consulted as part of the security investigation and the processing of
data collected during such an investigation (see Articles 21 to 23 of the aforementioned law).
 
 
 

                                                           
20 Case law states that: “the power to appoint is not required to take into consideration only qualified facts
criminally directly related to the function to be exercised, just as he is not bound by the assessment of certain facts made by
correctional judges, in that the objective of his intervention is different from that of the latter who have to sanction
reprehensible behavior within the meaning of the law, whereas the Minister must ensure, through an assessment in concreto, that the
conditions set by law for police candidates, particularly from the point of view of their morality. ". See in this sense
judgment of 2 April 2019 of the Administrative Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 4th chamber, roll number 39804, and
judgment of January 18, 2019 of the Administrative Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 4th chamber, roll number 41619.
21 Judgment of 2 April 2019 of the Administrative Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
22 Article 58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 provides that the Grand-Ducal Police “may consult the files which are
legally accessible and insofar as this consultation is relevant for the purpose sought”

ii.

The national legal framework compared to that in Belgium and France
 

In the context of the recruitment of police officers, it is interesting to note that both Belgian law and
French law provide for a condition similar to that required by article 58 of the amended law of 18
July 2018 on the Grand-Ducal Police, namely that the candidate for one of the functions of the executive
police officer must have the “moral qualities necessary for the performance of one of the functions of the
police officer”.
 
Indeed, in Belgium, a candidate for one of the posts in the operational framework within the police must
in particular "to be of irreproachable conduct and not to present risk factors which
constitute an obstacle to enlisting in the police”. The Belgian law also specifies that
the aforementioned conditions result from: "a) a certified copy of the criminal record
complete dating from less than three months on the date of submission of the application; b) an investigation
environment and background, including an interview with the candidate at home
and at the place of possible residence of the latter, carried out by the local police force; c) of all
the available information transmitted by the intelligence and security services and by
the Coordinating Body for Threat Analysis; d) all available information
relating to municipal administrative sanctions imposed for a mixed offence; e)
judicial data, communicated by the police services, with the authorization of the
competent judicial authorities; f) other validated data and information available to
police services. »24.
The ministerial decree of December 28, 2001 implementing certain provisions of the decree
of March 30, 2001 on the legal position of police service personnel (hereinafter
the “royal decree of 30 March 2001”) clarifies the contours and scope of the community investigation
and background. Section 3 entitled “The background and background survey” details the
persons carrying out the survey and specifies the list of databases consulted.
 
In France, in the context of recruitment within the police, one of the conditions required by
the candidate is that he must not have any "entries on bulletin no. 2 of his record
judiciary incompatible with the exercise of functions”25. In addition, an administrative inquiry is
also carried out, as provided for in article L.114-1 of the Internal Security Code
which essentially provides that “Administrative decisions on recruitment, (…) concerning
either public employment involved in the exercise of State sovereignty missions, or
public or private jobs in the field of security or defense (…) can be
preceded by administrative inquiries intended to verify that the behavior of persons

natural or legal persons concerned is not incompatible with the exercise of the functions or
envisaged missions" and that "These surveys may give rise to the consultation of
automated processing of personal data covered by Article 31 of Law No. 78-
17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and freedoms, with the exception of files
identification. The conditions under which interested persons are informed of this
consultation are specified by decree. ".
 
According to article 31 of law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 relating to data processing, files and
freedoms, the processing of personal data implemented on behalf of the State

prevention, research, observation or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution
criminal convictions or security measures, including the processing carried out by
the national police and gendarmerie services, must be authorized by order of the
competent ministers, taken after publication of a reasoned opinion by the National Commission for
data processing and freedoms (the French counterpart of the CNPD). Said treatments are thus
all framed legally, such as the file of criminal records26, the file
serial analysis27 or the file of wanted persons28.
 
Consequently and contrary to the current national legal framework, respectively to the draft law
and draft Grand-Ducal regulation under consideration, it should be noted that both Belgian law and the
French law provide a much more precise framework for the processing of data carried out
as part of these recruitment procedures. In order to meet the requirements of precision and
predictability that a legal text must meet, the CNPD recommends that the authors of the
draft law and the draft Grand-Ducal regulation to draw inspiration from it.
 

b. On access to files that are legally accessible to the Grand Police

ducale during the morality investigation

 

The National Commission welcomes the fact that Article 58 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 provides
that the Grand-Ducal Police "may consult the files which are legally accessible to it and for
as long as this consultation is relevant for the purpose sought”.
 
The CNPD understands that the Grand Ducal Police therefore has access to all the
files referred to in article 43 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police. In
the lack of precision as to the categories of data contained in such files and which
would actually be consulted as part of the morality investigation, the Commission

                                                           
26

 Provided for by articles 230-6 to 11 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.
27 Provided for by articles 230-12 to 18 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.
28 Provided for by article 230-19 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure

national authority cannot, however, assess whether such access is justified and proportionate
relation to the purpose sought, namely the recruitment of a candidate for one of the functions of the
police officer. This is all the more so since the access provided for the files listed in article 43 of
the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police are used for different purposes,
namely in the exercise of the judicial and administrative police missions of the members of the
Police with the status of judicial officer or administrative police officer.
 
 
In addition, the CNPD considers that the bill should specify the possible access of the Police
Grand Ducal to its own files, like the Belgian and French laws. This all the more in view
recent concerns of citizens regarding respect for civil liberties and the protection of
their personal data in the police and judicial field, it is therefore important that
clarifications on access to the aforementioned files and systems can be found at the level
of the law in the formal sense.
 

vs. On the criteria to be taken into account when assessing moral qualities

of the candidate

 
The National Commission welcomes the fact that the authors of the bill have specified in Article 1 of the
bill amending article 58 of the amended law of 18 July on the Grand-Ducal Police which
would be the consequences of the candidate's lack of moral qualities. Indeed, when
such qualities are lacking, the candidate is not admitted to the internship.
 
However, no details as to the criteria taken into account by the Grand Ducal Police when
of the assessment of the moral qualities of the candidate does not appear in the said article or in the
comments from the authors of the bill. However, it is necessary that the criteria taken into
account or the degree of seriousness of the antecedents taken into account by the Grand-Ducal Police are
previously specified in order to draw the consequences, namely the refusal of the admission of the
trainee candidate.
  
For the rest, the National Commission refers to its developments under point I. 2. A. of the
this notice.
 

 

d. On the retention period of personal data

 

It should be recalled that pursuant to Article 5 paragraph (1) letter e) of the GDPR, the data to be
personal character should not be kept longer than necessary for the
fulfillment of the purposes for which they are collected and processed.
 
___________________________________________________________________________

The National Commission regrets that the draft law does not indicate the retention period of the
data collected relating to a candidate and therefore wonders what the criteria would be
used to determine such duration. Clarifications on this subject should be provided.
by the authors of the bill.
 
Therefore, the CNPD is not in a position to assess whether the principle of limited retention period
data is respected.
 

3. Final remarks

Finally, it should be noted that on the basis of the current wording of Article 58 of the amended law
of July 18, 2018, the National Commission does not have all the information available to it.
necessary to enable it to fully assess whether the processing carried out in the
framework of the morality investigation comply with the GDPR.
 
Moreover, in the absence of details, certain questions remain unanswered: what are the
categories of data collected as part of these morality surveys? The right to
information (Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR) of the persons concerned is respected when
implementation of the processing generated by the morality investigation?
 
In addition, the National Commission notes that in order to access certain professions it is
conducted background checks or character or good repute investigations or
more administrative investigations. Such investigations or verifications are in particular
performed for:

-

-

-

-

the persons targeted by the background check procedure provided for by the
Chapter 3 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation on civil aviation security and
conditions of access to Luxembourg airport;
State officials and State employees assigned to the Intelligence Service of
the state. A security investigation is carried out against them in order to verify in particular
whether they have guarantees of morality29;
the candidate for a state employee position who must offer the "guarantees of morality
required »30;
Candidates for the competitive examination for legal attachés. Candidates for admission to
the examination-competition must “present the required guarantees of good repute”31;

                                                           
29 See articles 21 to 23 of the law of 15 June 2004 relating to the classification of documents and security clearances, as amended
30 Article 3, paragraph (1), letter c) of the law of 25 March 2015 determining the regime and compensation for State employees
31 Article 2, paragraph (2), 2) of the law of 7 June 2012 on legal attachés

the agent who wishes to carry out the activity of guarding and surveillance. This one must
meet the necessary conditions of good repute32;
persons requesting the granting of an authorization, approval or permit in
material of arms.

 
Although this list is not exhaustive, it already makes it possible to realize the
disparities that exist in Luxembourg law with regard to investigations or verifications
antecedents which would be expedited by the administrations or public authorities for access
to certain professions.
 
For the sake of consistency, the National Commission wonders if it would not be appropriate
to harmonize all of these procedures by using similar terminologies, for example.
In fact, each of the special laws uses their own terminology, whereas
certain notions seem to overlap. This is the case, for example, with the notions of good repute
and morality. The use of a common terminology would thus make it possible to ensure in law
national coherence between these various disparate special laws which nevertheless pursue
a similar purpose.
 

II.

On the draft Grand-Ducal regulation
 

The purpose of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation is to specify the special stages
organized by the Grand-Ducal Police to be passed for candidates wishing to access
to police careers in order to take into account the changes in terms of recruitment within
of the Police following the alignment of the examination-competition procedures for access to careers
police officers in the general framework of the Public Service.
 
In order to have a better reading of the regulatory text relating to recruitment in the
police careers, it was decided not to modify the Grand-Ducal regulation of 17 August 2018
relating to: 1° fixing the conditions of recruitment of the personnel of the police framework; 2° repeal
of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 31 October 2001 determining the national services and the
international bodies in which police personnel may be employed by order of the
Government (hereinafter the “Grand-Ducal Regulation of 17 August 2018”) existing, but of
repeal it and replace it with the draft Grand-Ducal regulation under consideration.
 

                                                           
32 Article 8, 1) of the law of 12 November 2002 relating to private security and surveillance activities
33 New article 14 of draft law n°7425 on arms and ammunition (parliamentary document n°7425/07)

The National Commission intends to limit its observations to the questions raised by the
provisions of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation under examination which deal with aspects relating to the
privacy and the protection of personal data.
 

1. On the investigation of morality

 
Due to the repeal of the Grand-Ducal regulation of 17 August 2018, it should be noted that the
this draft Grand-Ducal regulation does not provide as a condition of eligibility for
the special test for admission to the internship that the candidate offers the "guarantees of morality
required in the light of the morality investigation ordered by the Minister", contrary to what is
specified in the Grand-Ducal regulation of 17 August 201834.
 
However, the CNPD notes that this condition is intended to be maintained, as shown
of article 1 of the bill under consideration. Since this condition is included in the bill, it
it is therefore not necessary for it to also appear in the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
 

2. On the medical examination

 

It follows from article 23 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation under opinion that the candidate before each
admission to the internship is subject to a thorough medical examination, as detailed in article 24
of said project.
 
It should be recalled that the personal data brought to be collected within the framework of
these examinations are to be qualified as sensitive data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR, because they
relate to the health of the candidates. The processing of such data therefore requires
specific protection35 and are subject to stricter requirements.
 
The National Commission welcomes the fact that the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation have specified
in detail the medical examinations to which candidates are subjected. Just as she
welcomes the fact that the criteria for incapacity for such examinations are specified in Annex A of the draft
grand-ducal regulation.
 
                                                           
34 See Articles 2 point 3°, 5 point 4° and 15 point 5° of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 17 August 2018 as regards the conditions
eligibility for the examination.
35 See the cases rendered by the CJEU of 8 April 1992, C-62-90, point 23 and of 5 October 1994, C-404/92, point 17

In addition, the CNPD understands that the doctor from the Public Sector Occupational Health Division,
the Public Sector Medical Services Administration, in charge of such examinations
medical, will only transmit to the competent service of the Grand-Ducal Police the information
that the candidate is fit or unfit in accordance with Article 3 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation
of 5 March 2004 concerning health and safety at work and medical checks in the function
public, as amended.
 

3. On access to the national register of natural persons

 

Paragraph (3) of Article 19 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation lists the documents which
must be produced by the candidate when applying for the special stage.
 
The last paragraph of the paragraph of the aforementioned article, however, provides that the latter "has not
need to provide a copy of his identity card or an extract of the birth certificate when the
data concerning his surname and first name(s), his date of birth and his nationality are qualified
accurate in the national register of natural persons and if he has his habitual residence in
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ".
 
The National Commission understands that the Grand-Ducal Police is therefore carrying out the verification
of the aforementioned information of the candidate in the national register of natural persons.
 
However, if article 43, 1° of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand-Ducal Police provides for access
in this register to members of the Grand Ducal Police having the status of judicial police officer
or administrative police officer in the exercise of their police duties
judicial and administrative police, it should be noted that access to such data in the
present case is not carried out within the same framework but is carried out within the framework of a recruitment
(see our developments in point I. 2. c. of this opinion).
 
Access to this file for the purpose of recruiting candidates for police careers is therefore not
not provided for in article 43 of the amended law of 18 July 2018 on the Grand Ducal Police. He
it would therefore be appropriate for this purpose to be provided for in the aforementioned article.
