government amendments to bill no. 7683 have been approved by the Council of
government in its session of October 26, 2020.
 
Amendment 5 of bill n°7683 aims to modify the new article 6 (former article 5) in
meaning that infected persons must provide information on their state of health
and on the identity of the people with whom they have had contact likely to
generate a high risk of infection, to the director of health or his delegate, to civil servants
and employees designated for this purpose by the Director of Health, and henceforth also to employees
made available to the Ministry of Health pursuant to Article L. 132-1 of the Labor Code
relating to the temporary loan of labour.
 
It appears from the commentary to the aforementioned amendment 5 of bill no. 7683 that its purpose is
“to be able to have recourse, in addition to civil servants and employees, to employees made available
from the Ministry of Health as part of a labor loan in application of the
provisions of the Labor Code relating thereto, in order to collect information on the state
of health of infected persons and on the identity of the persons with whom they have been
in touch. »

Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection relating to

Government Amendments to Bill No. 7683 Amending the Amended Law

 

of 17 July 2020 introducing a series of measures to combat the

 

Covid-19 pandemic.

The CNPD fully understands that due to the vigorous increase in news
infections in recent days and correlatively of the workload of the tracing team
contacts of the health department, it is necessary to increase in parallel the number
of employees of the said team. Nevertheless, it notes that Article 10 paragraph (3)
bill n°7683, providing who is authorized in the context of contact tracing
to access the data of persons infected or at high risk of being infected contained
in the information system set up for this purpose, has not been modified in order to add the
aforementioned employees.
 
Thus, the CNPD recommends to the authors of bill n°7683 to insert in article 10
paragraph (3) of the said draft after “Only doctors and health professionals as well as
civil servants and employees” the words “and employees made available to the Ministry of
health pursuant to Article L. 132-1 of the Labor Code”. Article 10 paragraph (3) of the
Bill No. 7683 would then read as follows:
 
“Only doctors and health professionals as well as civil servants and employees
and employees made available to the Ministry of Health pursuant to Article L.
132-1 of the Labor Code, named by the Director of Health, are authorized
to access data relating to the health of people who are infected or at high risk of being
infected. They access health-related data strictly to the extent that access is
necessary for the performance of the legal or contractual missions entrusted to them for
prevent and combat the Covid-19 pandemic and are bound by professional secrecy in
the conditions and subject to the penalties provided for in article 458 of the Penal Code. »
 
This addition would also have the consequence that said employees would also be subject
in this context to the penal sanctions provided for in article 458 of the penal code in the event of non-
respect for professional secrecy. Under these restrictive conditions, the CNPD considers that the
additional access to the information system appear legitimate.
 
 
 
Thus decided in Esch-sur-Alzette on October 27, 2020.
