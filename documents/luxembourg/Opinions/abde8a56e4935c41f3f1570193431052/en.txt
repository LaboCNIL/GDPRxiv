Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection relating to the
Bill no. 7787 on the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2017/821
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 laying down obligations

Deliberation n°19/AV15/2021 of May 14, 2021

 
 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter the “GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the "National Commission" or
the “CNPD”) “advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to treatment”.
 
On March 18, 2021, the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs entered
the National Commission for a request for an opinion on draft law no. 7787 relating to the implementation
implementation of Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017
setting out supply chain due diligence obligations
for Union importers importing tin, tantalum and tungsten, their
Minerals and Gold from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (hereafter the “Bill”).
 
It appears from the explanatory memorandum that the objective of the bill is to take at national level
the measures necessary for the implementation of the aforementioned Regulation (EU) 2017/821, which
aims to stem the trade in tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores and gold (here
after “3TG”) from conflict-affected or high-risk areas by imposing on
European Union importers a number of obligations. More concretely, the
companies falling under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/821 are therefore
encouraged to do what is necessary to ensure that 3TG imported into Luxembourg does not come
of conflict areas.
 
This notice will be limited to matters relating to the data protection aspects
of a personal nature raised by sections 5 to 8 of the bill.
 
However, it is not clear from these articles what data processing would be carried out.
implemented by the Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs (hereinafter “the authority
authority”) and by the Customs and Excise Administration, or what would be the
categories of personal data which would, where applicable, be collected by
the competent authority and by the Customs and Excise Administration.

Thus, article 5 of the bill lists the “information” that could be provided to
the competent authority and the Customs and Excise Administration. However, it is difficult
for the National Commission to know whether personal data would be
actually contained in this information. Remember that Article 4 number (1) of the
GDPR defines the notion of personal data as “(…) any information
relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "person
concerned”); is deemed to be an "identifiable natural person" a natural person
which can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to a
identifier, such as name, identification number, location data, identifier
online, or to one or more specific elements specific to its physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social”. In this context,
it understands that "the names of the persons in charge of the supervision of the internal process
according to Article 4, letter c), of Regulation (EU) 2017/281", referred to in Article 5, paragraph (2),
number 2 of the bill could actually constitute personal data
personal within the meaning of the GDPR.
 
Articles 6 and 7 of the bill relate to the exchange of information, between
the Customs and Excise Administration and the competent authority (Article 6), and with the
European Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States (Article 7),
without it appearing precisely from these articles whether or not this information would include
personal data.
 
Finally, article 8 of the draft law is limited to indicating that the competent authority and the Administration
Customs and Excise have the status of "joint data controllers
without, however, specifying the related data processing. Note in this regard that the article
26 GDPR provides that joint data controllers “define
their respective obligations in a transparent manner in order to ensure compliance with
requirements of the [GDPR], in particular with regard to the exercise of personal rights
concerned, and their respective obligations with regard to the communication of the information referred to
in Articles 13 and 14, by agreement between them, unless and to the extent that their
respective obligations are defined by Union law or by the law of the Member State
to which the controllers are subject”. The National Commission allows itself by
elsewhere to point out a small clerical error: the term “du” should be added between
“section 26” and “regulation”.
 
In view of the above developments, the National Commission recalls that the
definition of joint controllers in this Article 8 would only be relevant
provided that personal data is actually processed.
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on May 14, 2021.
