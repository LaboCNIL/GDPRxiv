Deliberation n°18/AV14/2021 of May 14, 2021

 
 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter the “GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the "National Commission" or
the “CNPD”) “advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to treatment”.
 
On March 2, 2021, the Minister of Housing seized the National Commission
a request for an opinion on bill no. 7763 1. introducing a works fund;
2. amending the amended law of 16 May 1975 on the status of the co-ownership of buildings built
(hereinafter the “draft law”) and draft Grand-Ducal regulation amending the Grand-Ducal regulation
ducal prescribing the measures for implementing the law of 16 May 1975 on the status of the
co-ownership of buildings (hereinafter the "draft Grand-Ducal regulation").
 
It appears from the explanatory memorandum that the bill aims to establish a work fund
mandatory for condominiums of buildings built with the aim of promoting renovation,
in general, and more specifically energy renovation. The said works fund
should also contribute to raising owners' awareness of the need
build up sufficient cash to meet the costs of maintenance and optimization of
the rational use of the resources of their real estate assets, without being limited to the effort
granted for the acquisition of an immovable, as well as to prevent, in general, the
degradation and insalubrity of the buildings built in joint ownership.
 
This notice will be limited to matters relating to the data protection aspects
of a personal nature raised by article 1 of the bill, the draft grand-
ducal not raising questions relating to the protection of personal data
personal.
 
Article 1 of the bill provides for the insertion of a new article 11 bis in the amended law of
May 16, 1975 on the status of the co-ownership of built buildings, which establishes an obligation
on the part of the co-owners to set up a works fund to meet the cost of the
works decided by the general meeting. This fund is financed by an annual contribution
compulsory paid by each of the co-owners. The payment of these contributions is attached
to the lots and definitively acquired by the syndicate of co-owners. It is apparent from reading the

commentary on the articles that the contributions paid under the works fund are
calculated taking into account the general rules of load distribution.
 
The new article 11 bis of the bill further provides that in the event of the sale of a lot by one of the
co-owners, the buyer interested in acquiring this lot “must be able to consult a
extract showing the current balance of the contributions to the works fund acquired by this lot”. The
authors of the bill specify on this subject that in practice "the trustee will establish these extracts and
will make them available to owners, so that they can meet their obligations
consultation and communication vis-à-vis (future) buyers and sellers”.
 
In the absence of precision on the content of such an extract in the commentary of the articles and
in the bill, the CNPD understands, however, that personal data
would be likely to appear on such a document, in particular data of a
personnel relating to the co-owner putting his lot up for sale.
 
Therefore, the authors of the bill are to be commended for providing a legal basis in
under which the syndic will draw up this extract to make it available to the co-owner in order to
that it meets its legal obligation of consultation and communication with regard to the
future buyers and sellers.
 
Finally, the National Commission takes advantage of the opportunity, following its referral, to share a
problem it has encountered in the processing of requests
of information and complaints, which concern the transparency of information
communicated by the trustee to the co-owners. In this respect, it might be useful to specify
in the provisions of the Grand-Ducal regulation of 13 June 1975 prescribing the measures
implementing the law of May 16, 1975 on the status of co-ownership of buildings, and in
particular in its article 5, if and under what conditions the transmission by the trustee of the
detailed individual accounting situation of a co-owner to the other co-owners
(respectively to the members of the co-ownership council) is possible. In fact, outside
of such a legal provision, the National Commission does not see what other condition of
lawfulness within the meaning of Article 6 of the GDPR would be intended to legitimize such a transmission of
given by the trustee to third parties.
