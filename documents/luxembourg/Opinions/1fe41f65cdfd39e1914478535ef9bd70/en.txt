Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection relating to
the draft Grand-Ducal regulation relating to the determination and
the organization of training for technical and administrative staff
for different forms of sports activities.

Deliberation n°6/AV5/2021 of February 24, 2021

 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of April 27, 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (Regulation
general on data protection) (hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”), to which article
7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the protection
data and the general data protection regime, the National Commission for
data protection (hereinafter referred to as the “National Commission” or the “CNPD”)
“advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the government and
other institutions and bodies on legislative and administrative measures relating
to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to processing”.
 
By letter dated December 2, 2020, the Minister of Sports invited the Commission
national authority to decide on the draft Grand-Ducal regulation relating to the determination and
the organization of training for technical and administrative staff for the various forms
sporting activities (hereinafter referred to as the “draft Grand-Ducal regulation”).
 
According to the explanatory memorandum, sport in Luxembourg encompasses physical activity in all its
forms, such as school sports, health sports, sports for the disabled, sports
for all, sport-fitness, leisure sport, competitive sport and high-level sport. In order to
that the entire population can practice these physical or sporting activities in a
way that is adapted to their needs, they must be supervised by people who have
adequate training and therefore the necessary skills for this purpose.
 
It also emerges from the explanatory memorandum that the current regulatory framework dates from the 1990s
so that it has become necessary to adapt it to contemporary reality and to repeal the
Grand-Ducal regulation of 16 January 1990 restructuring the training courses for
coaches in the interest of sports federations and societies as well as Grand-Ducal regulations
of 16 January 1990 restructuring the training of sports-leisure leaders.
 
In addition, the draft Grand-Ducal regulation constitutes the continuation of the "subsidy
quality+” introduced by the Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 December 2016 concerning subsidies

granted to sports clubs affiliated with an approved sports federation and granted on the basis
the qualification of coaches of young people under the age of 16.
 
In this opinion, the National Commission will address issues related to the protection of
personal data raised by Title V, entitled "Electronic Register", of the
draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
 
 

1. Ad article 55 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation

Article 55 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation provides for the creation, under the authority of the minister having
in its attributions for Sports, of an electronic register, entitled “patent register”, which has
for purposes “the organization, management and administrative follow-up of initial training and
continuous, aimed at obtaining the various patents, state patents, approvals and licenses
ENEPS thereto, as well as the exemptions granted”. Thus, the National Commission
Congratulates that the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation have taken care to determine the
controller and the purposes of this register.
 
The commentary to the articles specifies that “[t]he establishment of such a database
electronics is part of the digitization efforts undertaken by the administrations
Luxembourg” and aims to facilitate and optimize the administrative tasks of ENEPS. In this
In this regard, the National Commission would like to point out that the GDPR applies not only to
computerized files but also to paper files which, where applicable, already exist1.
 
 

2. Ad article 56 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation

 
Article 56, paragraph 1, of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation states that the register of
patents is subdivided into three parts, while specifying the categories of personal data
staff who will appear in the different parts.
 
The CNPD welcomes the fact that the draft Grand-Ducal regulation defines the categories of data to be
personal character which will be entered in the patent register. However, she insists on
recall the importance of the principle of data minimization enshrined in Article 5, paragraph
1, letter c) of the GDPR according to which the personal data must be adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
processed. In view of the explanations provided in the commentary to the articles, the data to be

personal character entered in the patent register seem to be limited to what is
necessary with regard to the purposes set out in Article 55 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
 
Article 56, paragraph 2, of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation continues that “[t]he data referred to
in points 1° to 3° of paragraph 1 may be communicated to the controller
of the database in connection with the execution of the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23
December 2016 concerning subsidies granted to sports clubs affiliated with a
accredited sports federation.
 
According to the commentary of the articles, this communication is carried out with a view to the attribution
the “quality +” subsidy governed by the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 23 December 2016.
authors state that “[t]his communication may indeed be essential, because obtaining and
the amount of the “quality +” subsidy depends on the quality of the supervision offered to young people
by affiliated sports clubs.
 
The use of data from the patent register for the purpose of awarding the “quality +” subsidy
seems to be a purpose compatible with those described in Article 55 of the draft Grand-
ducal, especially since the Minister having in his attributions the Sports is also the
responsible for processing the database provided for by the amended Grand-Ducal regulation
of December 23, 2016.
However, the brief explanations provided by the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation
do not allow the National Commission to assess whether there is a real need to
communicate the data contained in the patent register. In any case, it seems
it is unlikely that it will be necessary to communicate all the data contained in the register
patents, such as telephone number or email address. However, the principle of minimization
of data requires that only the data actually necessary for the award of the grant
"quality +" are transmitted.
 
 

3. Ad article 57 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation

Article 57 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation provides that the minister having in his attributions
les Sports is the data controller within the meaning of the GDPR and attributes to the director of ENEPS
the quality of subcontractor within the meaning of the GDPR.
 
This article continues that “[l]access to files is secured and information relating to the
person who carried out the consultation, the information consulted, the date, time and
file reference, as well as the specific reason for the consultation can be traced. " Being
given that this provision is found in the second paragraph of article 57 relating to sub-

processing, it would be possible to deduce that it only applies to accesses carried out by the sub-
treating. However, the CNPD considers that this provision should apply to all accesses, i.e.
i.e. also to access made by the data controller himself, and offers from
when inserting it in a separate paragraph.
 
Furthermore, the National Commission notes that the draft Grand-Ducal regulation does not define
the retention period of the personal data contained in the patent register.
The data controller must nevertheless ensure compliance with Article 5, paragraph
1, letter e) of the GDPR according to which the personal data stored in a form
allowing the identification of the persons concerned for a period not exceeding that
necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. The National Commission
considers it necessary for the draft Grand-Ducal regulation to specify the retention period(s)
data or at least the applicable criteria for determining the retention periods.
 
Finally, the CNPD wishes to recall that the rights of data subjects provided for by the
GDPR must be respected. Thus, under Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, the person responsible for the
processing is obliged to provide the persons concerned with a certain amount of information
when personal data is collected directly from them or
indirectly through a third party, for example through a club or a federation.
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on February 24, 2021.
