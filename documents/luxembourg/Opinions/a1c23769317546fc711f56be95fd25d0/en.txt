1° the amended electoral law of 18 February 2003;
2° of the amended law of 27 July 1991 on electronic media

Deliberation n°28/AV12/2022 of July 1, 2022.

 
 
Pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter c), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter the “GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
national body for data protection (hereinafter the “National Commission” or the “CNPD”)
“advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the government and
other institutions and bodies on legislative and administrative measures relating
to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to processing”.
 
By letter dated September 2, 2021, the Prime Minister, Minister of State, invited
the National Commission to decide on the bill amending the electoral law
amended on February 18, 2003 (hereinafter the "draft law"). By letter dated November 16, 2021, the
National Commission informed the Prime Minister, Minister of State, that it had not
could identify data protection issues so that it did not consider
necessary to issue an opinion on this bill. By letter dated May 19, 2022, the
CNPD was invited to comment on the amendments adopted by the Committee on
Institutions and Constitutional Review at its meeting of May 2, 2022. By email from
June 14, 2022, the amendments adopted by the Committee on Institutions and Revision
at its meeting of May 20, 2022 were submitted to the CNPD for an opinion.
 
This opinion will limit its observations to questions dealing with aspects relating to the
data protection, particularly raised by parliamentary amendments
which were adopted on May 20, 2022 (hereinafter the “parliamentary amendments”).
 
The amended electoral law of 18 February 2003 provides in paragraph 3 that "[a]ny citizen may
take inspection and request in writing a copy of the updated lists as well as the parts
mentioned above to the municipal secretariat up to and including the fifty-eighth
day before election day. The copy will be delivered either in paper or digital form
in the applicant's own hands or by a secure means of communication in a

appropriate The citizens' data contained in the lists cannot be used for
purposes other than electoral. The bill, as originally introduced, proposed to give
citizens the possibility of having a copy of the electoral lists delivered the next day
their temporary suspension, during the period of inspection of the electoral lists by the public, which
extends from the 54th to the 47th day before the elections. Thus, it would have been possible to inspect
and to obtain a copy of the provisional electoral lists during the period from the 54th to the
47th day, then in a second phase, to take inspection and to be issued a copy
updated voter lists from the 44th to the 30th day before the elections.
 
The parliamentary amendments seek to remove the right of citizens to request, in the
within the framework of the inspection of the electoral lists, the delivery of a copy of the lists. The comment
of the articles specifies in this respect that “[t]he issuance of copies of the electoral lists constitutes
in our country a long-standing tradition that is an integral part of our electoral system
and which has been maintained to this day. As the electoral law limits the use of data to
personal character contained in the electoral lists for purely electoral purposes, it
in fact served the interests of political parties to use it for prospecting purposes
politics in the context of electoral periods. However, given the rules applicable to
of general data protection and the general trend which is increasingly
towards strengthening the protection of personal data, maintaining the right to
advantage of any citizen to request a complete copy of the electoral lists is no longer appropriate
Nowadays. It is therefore proposed to abolish it since the right for the citizen to inspect
of the electoral list to the secretariat of the municipality which is maintained satisfied on its own already at the
electoral purpose pursued. »
 
In its opinion on draft law no. 5859 amending the amended electoral law of
18 February 20031, the National Commission had already warned against the risk that
data from the electoral lists, after communication to the citizens, can be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with their electoral purpose. More recently, the CNPD has
published a communication on the use of electoral lists for canvassing purposes
elections2 as well as guidelines aimed at raising the awareness of political actors
on the risks associated in particular with the collection and processing of personal data
voters for electoral purposes. It should also be noted that the CNPD has received in the past
complaints in connection with the use of personal data appearing on the
copies of voters lists.
