bill n°7836 amending the amended law of 17 July
2020 on measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
 

Deliberation n°24/AV19/2021 of June 8, 2021

 
 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “the GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as "the National Commission" or
"the CNPD") "advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to treatment”.
 
On June 4, 2021, the Minister of Health seized the National Commission of a
request for an opinion on draft law no. 7836 amending the amended law of 17 July
2020 on measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic (hereinafter “Bill of Law No.
7836"). Amendments were sent on June 8, 2021.
 
According to the explanatory memorandum, this bill aims to propose new
relaxations compared to the measures currently applicable under the aegis of the law
amended of July 17, 2020 on the measures to combat the pandemic and which find their
basis in the current epidemiological situation and in the general evolution
favorable evaluation indicators.
 
Article 3 of bill n°7836 intends to introduce a system of self-diagnostic tests
mandatory tests used for SARS-CoV-2 screening for staff members,
external service providers and visitors over the age of six in the
hospitals, as well as in certain structures and services that house or
care for the elderly or disabled. According to paragraphs (1) paragraph 3 and (2)
paragraph 3 of said article 3, the persons concerned cannot access their workstation,
provide services or visit a patient, resident or user if the outcome
of the self-diagnostic test is positive or if the persons concerned refuse or are in
the impossibility of presenting one of the required certificates.
 
The commentary to the articles specifies that article 3 of bill n°7836 is inspired by the
bill n° 7808 of the honorable deputy Michel Wolter. Thus, the CNPD would like to refer
to the comments made in its opinion of May 28, 2021 concerning specifically the
bill n°7808 of the Deputy Michel Wolter relating to the strategy of
screening for the Covid-19 virus in structures for vulnerable people and in
support and care networks.1

The CNPD wondered, among other things, whether the processing of personal data
would be carried out by the employer or the operator of one of the structures and services mentioned
following the presentation by a visitor, an employee or an external service provider, of the
negative or positive result of the rapid antigen test or Covid-19 PCR test, a certificate
of vaccination or a serological screening test certificate proving the presence
anti-coronavirus antibodies in the blood.
 
This observation is also part of the “Covid Check regime” defined in Article
1st point 28 of this bill n°7836 in the sense that the CNPD questions whether the
establishments welcoming a public or organizing demonstrations or events whose
entry is exclusively reserved for people who can claim either one of the
certificates as referred to in articles 3bis, 3ter, 3quater of bill no. 7836, or a test
self-diagnostic test used to screen for the SARS-CoV-2 virus carried out on site and whose
result is negative, process personal data.
 
Furthermore, although these issues do not fall within the area of the protection of
data, the CNPD wondered, in terms of labor law, about the consequences of a
refusal by an employee or an external service provider to submit to such
obligations.
 
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on June 8, 2021.
