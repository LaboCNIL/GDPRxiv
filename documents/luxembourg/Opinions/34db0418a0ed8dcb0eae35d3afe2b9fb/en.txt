Deliberation n° 30/2020 of December 22, 2020

 
 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “the GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as "the National Commission" or
"the CNPD") "advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to treatment”.
 
On December 21, 2020, the Minister of Health seized the Commission
request for an opinion on draft law no. 7738 amending: 1° the amended law of 17
July 2020 introducing a series of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic;
2° the law of 19 December 2020 having as its object the establishment of a temporary contribution
from the State to the uncovered costs of certain companies; 3° the amended law of 4 July 2008
on Youth (hereinafter “Bill No. 7738”).
 
The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the national health system can
continue to function adequately for the benefit of all patients and that the
number of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections could decrease significantly. He is
therefore proposed to maintain certain measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic already
in place, strengthen others and adopt new ones that will apply during the
period from December 26, 2020 to January 10, 2021.
 
The CNPD would like to point out that given the urgency of the bill under opinion, it is not possible for it
analyze the proposed changes in depth and that its opinion has been drawn up and adopted
solely on the basis of the information available to it to date. The opinion is given under
subject to possible future considerations.
 
 
1. Ad article 9 of bill n°7738
 
 
Article 9 of draft law no. 7738 aims to modify article 5 paragraph (3) of the amended law of
July 17, 2020 introducing a series of measures to combat the pandemic
Covid-19 by specifying that the transmission by health professionals to the director of the
health of certain personal data of persons whose result of a test
diagnosis of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was negative is intended not only to

follow the evolution of the spread of the virus, but also to acquire the knowledge
fundamentals of this development.
 
Furthermore, according to article 5 paragraph (3) point 2 new of the amended law of July 17, 2020
introducing a series of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the
medical analysis laboratories are obliged to transmit to the director of health the
surname, first names, gender, identification number or date of birth, municipality of residence
or the address of the people who underwent a serological test, as well as the result
of this test. These data are anonymized by the director of health or his delegate at the end
for a period of two years. According to the explanatory memorandum, as “the level of antibodies against the
SARS-CoV-2 decreases over time, this immune signature of the infection has no value
only for a limited time. For this reason, the most appropriate shelf life
turns out to be two years. »
 
In this respect, the National Commission refers to point 2.3 of this opinion, subject to
future considerations on his part.
 
 
2. Ad article 10 of bill no. 7738: the collection of personal data in
part of the vaccination program
 

2.1. Preliminary remarks

 
With regard to the legal basis on which the processing carried out by director is based a priori
of health in order to follow the evolution of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, more
precisely the public interest under Article 6 paragraph (1) letter e) as well as Article
9 paragraph 2) letter i) of the GDPR, the CNPD would like to refer to its comments relating thereto
in its initial opinion on draft law no. 7606 introducing a series of measures
concerning natural persons in the context of the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus
(COVID-19).1
 
Nevertheless, it wishes to specify that Article 6 paragraph (3) of the GDPR provides for a constraint
particular related to the lawfulness of data processing necessary for compliance with an obligation
law or the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of authority
public authority vested in the controller. In these two cases, the
basis and purposes of data processing must be specifically defined either
by the law of the European Union, or by the law of the Member State to which the controller
treatment is submitted.
 
In addition, recital (45) of the GDPR specifies that it should "[...] belong to Union law
or the right of a Member State to determine the purpose of the processing. [...]". Recital 41
of the GDPR further specifies that this legislative measure should be clear and precise and its
application should be predictable for litigants, in accordance with the case law of the
Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights.

Thus, if a national or supranational normative text does not specifically prescribe
data processing, “the purpose of the processing must however be precise, in the
insofar as the text leading the administration to process data must allow
administered to deduce the nature of the data and the purposes for which they are
used” 2.
 
 

2.2. As for the purpose pursued by the collection of data within the framework of the
vaccination program

 
 
The new article 10 paragraph (1) of the amended law of 17 July 2020 introducing
of a series of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic provides that the system
system put in place by the Director of Health with a view to monitoring the evolution of
propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus now pursues an additional purpose: "to monitor
and continuously assess the efficacy and safety of vaccines against Covid-19. »
 
Under article 10 point 2° of bill no. 7738, the new point 3 of article 10
paragraph (2) of the amended law of July 17, 2020 introducing a series of measures
of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic provides as well as the information system set up
by the director of health relates, in addition to the data initially contained therein,3 to a whole
series of personal data collected as part of the vaccination program
concerning the vaccinator, on the one hand, i.e. the doctor in charge of placing or
confirm the indication for vaccination and prescribe the vaccine in order to implement this
surveillance system,4 as well as the person to be vaccinated, on the other hand.
 
Nevertheless, on the basis of the information currently available to it, the Commission
national government has difficulty in grasping the precise purpose of the collection and recording at the
information system of all these personal data concerning the vaccinator
and the person to be vaccinated. Article 5 paragraph (1) letter (b) of the GDPR indeed requires that the
personal data must be “collected for specific purposes,
explicit and legitimate, and not further processed in a manner inconsistent with
these purposes”.
 
The explanatory memorandum is quite vague in this respect, stating only that it should
“to ensure specific monitoring of the quality and effects of the various vaccines, in particular in order to
to build public confidence in vaccination" and that this "monitoring includes
also the usual activities of measuring vaccination coverage, measuring
vaccine efficacy and pharmacovigilance. […] Indeed, it is necessary to verify
the real usefulness of vaccination in order to identify its benefits. Finally, this monitoring allows
adjust the vaccination strategy and the deployment plan. »

Considering government statements that vaccination against the coronavirus does not
will not be mandatory, the CNPD therefore wonders what exactly is the purpose
continued by the processing of the personal data of the vaccinator and the
person to be vaccinated. Does the purpose as indicated fall within or is it limited to a
context of pharmacovigilance5 or requirements of the law of July 4, 2000 relating to the
responsibility of the State in terms of vaccinations enshrining the responsibility of the State in
certain cases of sequelae due to legal vaccination, regulatory or recommended by
the state?
 
Given the urgency and lack of precision in the commentary on the articles, the CNPD was not
able to research and analyze the legal texts on the subject. She therefore wonders
also if similar data is collected and recorded in state files
in the context of vaccinations against other diseases or pathologies, in particular those
listed in the amended Grand-Ducal regulation of 18 October 2001 determining the list of
recommended vaccinations.
 
Finally, the National Commission wonders in this context whether the authors of the bill
do not, moreover, implicitly refer to further processing of the data
collected for the purpose of scientific research?
 
In order to meet the forecasting and predictability requirements that a
legal text, with reference to European case law, and for the sake of transparency and
of legal certainty, the CNPD recommends that the authors of the bill specify in the
body of the text in more detail what are the explicit and determined purposes
actually prosecuted by the collection of this large amount of personal data
concerning the vaccinator and the person to be vaccinated.
 
 

2.3. Regarding the retention period of the data collected as part of the
vaccination program

 
 
Article 5 paragraph (1) letter (e) of the GDPR provides that personal data
must be "kept in a form which permits the identification of the persons
concerned for a period not exceeding that necessary with regard to the purposes for
which they are processed. It also follows from recital (45) of the GDPR that when
the processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or relating to the exercise
of the official authority vested in the controller, it should belong to the law
of the Union or the right of a Member State to establish, inter alia, the retention period of
data.
 
Thus, the retention period must be determined according to the purpose that led to the storage.
data collection in question. Once this objective is achieved, these data should be
deleted or anonymized (in order to produce statistics in particular).

series of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic; 2° the law of 19 December

Point 4° of article 10 of bill no. 7738 provides in this context that the data to be
personal character of the vaccinators are anonymized at the latest after a period of
two years after their collection, while the personal data of the persons to
vaccinate are anonymized no later than twenty years after their collection.
 
The explanatory memorandum specifies in this context that "the data of vaccinated persons
will be kept for twenty years from the date of collection, minimum period
to ensure optimal follow-up of the vaccination, with a view to protecting
people vaccinated over the long term. Indeed, we must not forget that we are in
presence of a new vaccine that is being deployed and whose effects will manifest themselves in time
real. It is therefore in the very interest of the vaccinated person that the data
concerning are kept for as long as possible in order to verify whether an effect
appearing after several years can, where appropriate, be related to the
vaccine or not. On the other hand, with regard to the data of the vaccinators, these will be
kept for two years. This is explained by their necessity in order to ensure the follow-up of
adverse effects in the short and medium term only. This collection having another
objective, the principle of proportionality requires shorter retention periods. »
 
With regard to the GDPR, it is necessary and essential to define a retention period for
data within the health directorate's information system that is proportionate to the
regard to the purpose pursued. Therefore, it is necessary to define objective criteria
justifying an adequate shelf life.
 
However, the National Commission does not have the scientific expertise and
necessary epidemiological analysis, in order to assess whether the retention of personal data
vaccinated for twenty years from the date of collection is really necessary and
proportionate, in view of the vague and imprecise purpose as indicated in the text of the
law Project.
 
The CNPD takes this opportunity to underline the fundamental importance of the right to information
of the persons concerned. Pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, the person responsible for the
processing is indeed obliged to provide data subjects with certain information
when personal data is collected directly from them or
indirectly through a third party. Precise and appropriate information must therefore be provided
to the persons concerned in a particular health context, both to vaccinators and
especially to persons to be vaccinated, in particular any subsequent use of their data,
bearing in mind that the expected data retention period is twenty years.
 
Finally, in the absence of precision in the text of bill n°7738, the CNPD wonders
what is the origin of the personal data of vaccinators and people
vaccinated, i.e. who is obliged to collect, as well as transmit and record the
data in question in the information system of the health department. Are these the
vaccinators themselves who are in charge of the vaccination program in the centers of
vaccinations?6 Or is it also planned in the short and medium term that doctors
referents can directly vaccinate their patients and in this case, they would be obliged to
transmit the data in question to the health department? In addition, there is reason to question
what happens to the data thus collected by the vaccinators and then transmitted
to the health department. Are the data collected by the vaccinators
