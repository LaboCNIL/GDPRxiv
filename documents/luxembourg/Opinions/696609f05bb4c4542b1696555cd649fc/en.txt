Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection on the draft
Law No. 7622 introducing a series of measures to combat the pandemic

Covid-19.

The CNPD refers in this context to its opinions n°13/2020 of 8 June 2020 and n°14/2020 of 16
June 2020 relating to bill no. 7606 which became the law of June 24, 2020 introducing a
series of measures concerning natural persons in the context of the fight against
Covid-19 pandemic and amending the amended law of April 11, 1983 regulating the
marketing and advertising of medicines. She welcomes that the majority of her
remarks made therein have been taken into account by the authors of bill n°7606.
 
It notes that the authors of Bill No. 7622 under examination have taken over almost all
the data protection provisions provided for by the law of June 24, 2020.
Indeed, article 5 of bill n°7622 largely repeats the provisions of article 4
of the law of 24 June 2020 concerning contact tracing, while article 10 of the said project
of law incorporates the provisions of article 8 of the law of 24 June 2020 on the creation of a system
information from the health director.
 
Articles 5 paragraph (1) and 10 paragraph (3) of bill n°7622 are subject to additions
in the sense that alongside the director of health or his delegate, civil servants or employees
designated for this purpose by the said director are authorized in the context of contact tracing
to process the data of people who are infected or at high risk of being infected,
respectively to access their data contained in the aforementioned information system.
 
It appears from the commentary to article 10 of bill n°7622 that due to the increase
new infections in recent days and correlatively the workload of
health directorate's contact tracing team, as well as the lack of "doctors
and healthcare professionals in sufficient numbers to carry out this work, it is proposed to
give the health director the possibility of having recourse, for the performance of these tasks, to
also to officials or employees designated by him for this purpose. »
 
It is also specified in article 10 paragraph (3) of the bill under opinion that all those
who can access the information system, including civil servants or employees
designated for this purpose by the Director of Health, are subject to professional secrecy and that
the provisions of article 458 of the penal code are applicable. Under these conditions
restrictive, that therefore the breach of professional secrecy in this context is subject to the
criminal sanctions provided for in article 458 of the criminal code, the CNPD considers that access
additional to the information system appear legitimate.
 
 
 
Thus decided in Esch-sur-Alzette on July 8, 2020.
