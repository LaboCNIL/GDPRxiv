 
Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection
relating to bill no. 7526 amending the amended law
of May 30, 2005 relating to the specific provisions for the protection of
the person with regard to the processing of personal data
in the electronic communications sector and relating
modification of articles 88-2 and 88-4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Deliberation n° 11/2020 of April 24, 2020

 

 
In accordance with article 57, paragraph 1, letter (c) of regulation n° 2016/679 of 27 April
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
personal character and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(General Data Protection Regulation) (hereinafter “the GDPR”), to which refers
article 7 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime, the Commission
National Commission for Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as "the National Commission" or
"the CNPD") "advises, in accordance with the law of the Member State, the national parliament, the
government and other institutions and organizations regarding legislative measures and
administrative procedures relating to the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons
with regard to the treatment”.
 
By letter dated March 3, 2020, the Minister of Communications invited the
National Commission to decide on draft law n° 7526 amending the law
of May 30, 2005 relating to the specific provisions for the protection of the person to
with regard to the processing of personal data in the communications sector
electronics and amending Articles 88-2 and 88-4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 
The bill tends to set up one or more geolocation systems for authors
more precise emergency calls than the current geolocation carried out exclusively at the
through mobile phone network terminals.
 
It anticipates the transposition of only Article 109 paragraph 6 of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the code of
European electronic communications.
 
The National Commission notes that the proposed new Article 5 paragraph (5bis) does not specify
who is to provide the data in question. It can be deduced that this paragraph
creates obligations exclusively for service providers or operators
mentioned in article 5 paragraph (5) letter (a). If, however, other companies, such as
for example companies offering operating systems or software installed on
devices or companies offering WIFI access without being service providers
or operators, were required to participate – in any way – in the systems
of geolocation in question, it should be mentioned in the text.
 
The CNPD also wonders about the meaning of the terms "... the most appropriate..."
used in the sole article of the bill and which are taken literally from article 109
paragraph (6) of the aforementioned Directive (EU) 2018/1972. Indeed, with a view to transposition
correctness of the provision of the European directive in question, she wonders whether, in
depending on the national situation or organization relating to reception centers
