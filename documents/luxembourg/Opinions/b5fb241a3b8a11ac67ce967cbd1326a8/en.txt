On March 5, 2021, the Minister of Health seized the National Commission
a request for an opinion on bill no. 7784 amending the amended law of 17
July 2020 on the measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic (hereinafter the "draft law
No. 7784").
 
It is clear from the explanatory memorandum that this draft law aims to maintain the restrictions
currently in place until April 2, 2021 inclusive, while creating “a legal basis for
the application of temporary measures that may be taken in the context of the fight against
Covid 19 pandemic at the level of national education and with regard to the measures
reorganization and suspension having an impact on childcare facilities. »
 
The CNPD notes that article 3 of bill no. 7784 provides for the insertion of a new
article 4ter in the amended law of 17 July 2020 on measures to combat the pandemic
Covid-19 listing in its 1st paragraph a whole series of temporary measures which may
be taken as part of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, in the presence of a
local or national resurgence of infections involving health risks for the
local or global population with significant chains of infections in structures
referred to in paragraph 2 of said Article 4ter. One of these measures1 is the transition to a
distance learning for some or all schools
public and private as defined in points 1 and 2 of paragraph 2 of the new article 4ter of the
amended law of July 17, 2020 on measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
In general, the CNPD congratulates the authors of bill no. 7784 under examination for having
created a legal basis allowing, under certain conditions, the transfer to an education at
distance for some or all public and private schools.
However, it regrets that the draft Grand-Ducal regulation provided for in the new article 4ter
paragraph (3) of the amended law of 17 July 2020 on measures to combat the pandemic
Covid-19, which should determine the “temporary measures taken in application of the
conditions provided for in paragraph 1 of this article, the duration of their application, as well as
that the structures and activities targeted by the application of the said measures”, is not attached

                                                 
1 As provided for by point 2° of paragraph 1 of the new article 4ter of the amended law of 17 July 2020 on
measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
