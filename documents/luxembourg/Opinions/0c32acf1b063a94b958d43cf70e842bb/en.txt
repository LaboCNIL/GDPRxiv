Therefore, the purpose of the bill is precisely “to introduce a dedicated legislative framework
specific transport services organized by the Minister having Transport in his
attributions. »
 
The National Commission congratulates the authors from the outset for having included in the draft law a
chapter 5 dedicated specifically to the processing of personal data, especially
that it involves processing of special categories of personal data
personnel governed by Article 9 of the GDPR, known as “sensitive data”, and more specifically
health data concerning the beneficiaries of one of the specific transport services
as defined in article 1st point 1° of the bill.
 
It will therefore limit, except for two preliminary remarks, its observations to Chapter 5,
that is to say in articles 17 to 20 of the bill under consideration and it will end with a few
comments on the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
 

I. Preliminary remarks

 
First of all, the CNPD notes that article 5 of the bill provides that in the event that the cell
evaluation decides that the verification of the eligibility conditions for the transport service
specific to the request requires a medical examination carried out by a doctor-member of
said cell, it falls to the Minister having Transport in his or her attributions (hereinafter: "the
Minister”) to send the applicant a summons for such an examination.
 
On the other hand, if in the context of a review of the decision relating to the refusal of access to the service of
specific transports, the review committee decides that the verification of the conditions
eligibility for said service requires a medical examination carried out by a doctor-member of said
commission, it is not up to the minister, but to the chairman of the review commission
to send the applicant a summons for such an examination in accordance with Article 16.2 of the
law Project.
 
In order to therefore respect the parallelism of forms and considering that article 20 point 4 of the
bill expressly provides that the Minister does not have the right to access the results of the
medical examinations, ordered if necessary as mentioned above by the assessment unit or
review commission, the CNPD recommends that the authors of the bill provide that
the president of the evaluation unit must send the applicant the invitation to the examination
medical to be carried out by a doctor-member of the said cell.
 
Then, based on the explanatory memorandum and the commentary on article 10 of the bill, the
CNPD understands that at present the so-called CAPABS transport (Complementary Transport
Accessibility for People with Special Needs), i.e. for structures

relating to bill no. 8005 on specific transport services and amending the

xxx on specific transport services.

listed in Article 10.1 of the draft law (hereinafter: “the structures”), are governed by contracts
the deadline for which has been postponed to mid-2022.
 
Article 11 of the bill provides that the said structures sign an agreement with the State
represented by the Minister and who determines "1° the form and deadlines for the transport request
; 2° the methods of organization and execution of this specific regular transport service
specialized for structures; 3° the methods of cooperation between the parties
contractors; 4° the exchange of data necessary for the transport request of the beneficiaries
and to ensure their safety during transport. »
 
Thus, unlike the specific regular specialized transport services provided for in
Articles 9, 12 and 13 of the bill and for which it is provided that the form, content of the
request and the operating conditions are determined by Grand-Ducal regulation,1 the framework
of the transmission service to the structures will be regulated by an agreement. The authors of
draft law specify in this context that the "form of the transport request made by
the structures for the applicants, the methods of organization and execution of transport
forming part of this chapter are to be established rather between the State and the structures served;
thus, and like the organizations benefiting from financial participation from the State, it is proposed
establish a standard agreement and conclude such an agreement with each structure
served, also to enable compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
in the context of data exchange. » 2
 
Nevertheless, without prejudice to the possibility of concluding an agreement with each structure
specific, the CNPD recommends providing for the four points mentioned above and listed
currently in the draft law in article 11 in the body of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
Moreover, as in this specific case the transport request is not made by the
applicant, but by the structures themselves as provided for in article 10.3 of the bill,
details in the draft Grand-Ducal regulation on the exchange of personal data
personnel between the structures and the minister are essential.
 
This regulatory framework would guarantee the principle of legal certainty for the benefit of
persons concerned, i.e. disabled persons with reduced mobility who travel
to one of the structures as determined in article 10 of the bill.

II. Regarding chapter 5 of the bill – Processing of personal data

 
According to the authors of the bill, it is “essential to process data concerning the
health as part of the request for access to specific transport, in particular to check
eligibility criteria for services. 3 The CNPD can only concur with the comment of the article
20 of the bill considering that in this case, the “request for explicit consent in
application of Article 9(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation does not
is hardly an appropriate solution, whereas consent must be given freely and
that it must be specific, informed, unambiguous, clear and free of power imbalances. If he does not give
without his consent, the applicant cannot have access to the transport service. the
consent cannot therefore be considered a reliable and solid basis for the processing
health data. »
 
In addition, the authors of the bill specify that to remove the legal uncertainty about the
processing of health data, it is necessary to introduce a legal provision at the level
national on the basis of article 9.2 letter g) of the GDPR, because they consider that the “organization of
specific forms of transport participate in a mission of public interest since they make it possible to promote
the inclusion of people with disabilities in society and remedy the total non-accessibility of the
public transport network. The National Commission would like to point out that this legal basis for
Luxembourg law must, specifically in application of article 9.2 letter g) of the GDPR, be
proportionate to the objective pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and
provide for appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and
the interests of the data subject. It notes that such measures are listed in
section 20 of the bill and she congratulates the authors.
 
On the other hand, the fact that the list of measures to be implemented is preceded by the words "such
that” could be interpreted as meaning that this list is exemplary and that the
Minister can simply choose without justification which measures he wants to put in place. Gold,
such an interpretation would run counter to the purpose of this list, which consists of enumerating
additional guarantees to be provided by the Minister in addition to the legal guarantees and measures
technical or organizational usually necessary in accordance with the state of the art,
as required by article 9.2 letter g) of the GDPR.
 
The CNPD also notes that the wording of Article 20 of the bill under consideration is inspired
of article 65 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for the
data protection and the general data protection regime and concerning the
processing of special categories of personal data implemented for the purposes
scientific or historical research. However, contrary to article 20 of the bill, said article
65 provides that the controller must document and justify for each project of

Opinion of the National Commission for Data Protection

 

 

 

 

relating to bill no. 8005 on specific transport services and amending the

articles 1 and 12 of the amended law of 5 February 2021 on public transport and the draft

Grand-Ducal regulation determining the conditions for implementing the provisions of the law of

xxx on specific transport services.

seeks the exclusion, if any, of one of the measures listed therein. Subject to its
comments under “1. On the relationship between the Minister and the Transport Authority
public”, the CNPD therefore recommends that the authors of the bill provide in the body of the
text that this list of measures is mandatory and that the Minister in his function of
responsible for the “processing of personal data strictly necessary for
the organization of specific transport services”4 can only derogate from it if it can
argue and document it.
 
Finally, the National Commission notes that Article 20 point 4° of the bill imposes
a ban on the Minister having access to additional medical certificates and results
medical examinations requested by the assessment unit or the review committee.5
On the other hand, even if article 3 of the bill specifies that the medical certificate which must
accompanying the request for access to transport specific to the request should be sent to
doctor-member of the evaluation unit in sealed envelopes, the CNPD recommends adding to the
above-mentioned point 4° a prohibition for the Minister to access said medical certificates.
 

  On the relationship between the Minister and the Public Transport Authority

 

According to article 17 of the bill under consideration, the minister is responsible for the
processing of personal data necessary for the organization of the services of
specific transport. On the other hand, clause 21 of the bill provides that the “Minister shall give
responsibility to the Public Transport Administration, within the framework of its missions defined
article 6 of the amended law of 5 February 2021 on public transport, to execute all or part
its obligations under this law. » Article 5 of the amended law of 5
February 2021 on public transport provides for the creation of the Transport Administration
(hereinafter: “ATP”) under the authority of the Minister, while Article 6 of the said law lists
its various missions.
 
The CNPD notes in this context that the commentary to article 21 of the bill specifies
that the ATP may be entrusted with “the management of the processing of personal data for
the purposes provided for in Article 17” within the framework of its organizational management mission,
administrative, technical, financial and accounting as well as the control of the services of
specific public transport.6 The explanatory memorandum mentions in this respect that the ATP “considers
obviously a register of beneficiaries of specific transport, and must ensure
regularly updated. This data processing is essential for the organization
and the proper execution of the transport. »
                                                           
4 As provided for in article 17 of the bill under consideration.
5 As provided by article 4.5, points 1° and 2° and by article 16.1 points 1° and 2° of the bill.
6 As provided for in article 6, point 8 of the amended law of 5 February 2021 on public transport.

However, even if the ATP is subject to the authority of the Minister, the CNPD wonders whether, as the ATP has
its own management and staff,7 whether it is a single controller or two
separate controllers. Thus, for lack of precision in the text of the bill, it is not
not easy to identify the exact role of the ATP in the management of personal data
staff involved. The question of the definition of the controller is nevertheless
essential for the persons concerned, because it is with the said person in charge that they must
exercise their various rights provided for in Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR. Three different hypotheses
appear possible:
 

− The ATP could be considered to act as a subcontractor8 of the Minister. In this case,
it is important that the processing of personal data carried out by the ATP
on behalf of the Minister is governed by a contract or other legal act in accordance
in Article 28 of the GDPR.
 
On the other hand, if the minister considers that the ATP is an integral part of his ministry and
that by entrusting the management of the processing of personal data to the ATP it does not
only use as controller of its own resources within
of its organization, in this case, there is no subcontractor. The European Committee for
data protection (hereinafter: "EDPS") specifies in this context in its lines
guidelines on the notions of controller and processor that
“employees and other persons who act under the direct authority of the manager
processing, such as temporary staff, are not considered to be subcontractors.
processors since they process personal data within the framework of the entity of the
controller. In accordance with Article 29, they are also required to follow
instructions from the controller. »9

 

− The notion of “joint liability” introduced by Article 26 of the GDPR could also
be taken into account in this context. The National Commission is of the opinion that it could,
where applicable, emerge from the general scheme of the bill under opinion, as well as from the
amended law of 5 February 2021 on public transport that the Minister, on the one hand, and the ATP,
on the other side, participate jointly in the achievement of the aims and means of the
processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the organization of
specific transport services.

− Since the status of data controller or processor must be assessed at the
with regard to each set of data or processing operations, it is also
conceivable that the Minister and the ATP are independent controllers
depending on the processing of personal data in question. The EDPS clarifies
in this respect that it “may also happen that various actors deal successively with the
same personal data in a chain of processing operations,
each of these actors having an independent purpose and means in their part of
chain. In the absence of joint participation in determining the purposes and
means of the same processing operation or set of operations, it is necessary
to exclude joint responsibility for processing and the different actors must be
considered as independent and successive data controllers. » 10

 
The identification of the data controller is also important in order to know who must provide
the information provided for in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR to the data subject. the
commentary to article 18 of the bill mentions in this regard that “personal data
are collected either directly from the applicant via a form, or from the
structures concerned by an exchange of data as provided for in Article 11.
 
The National Commission would therefore like to point out that in the first case it is a collection
of personal data and the Minister (subject to further comments
high on ATP function) must provide individuals who apply for benefit
of a specific transport service, at the time the data in question is obtained,
all the information listed in article 13 of the GDPR. On the other hand, in the second case, that is
mean the obtaining by the Minister through the personal data structures of the
people who have access to one of the aforementioned services, we are in the presence of an indirect collection
of personal data and the Minister must provide the persons concerned with the
information provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR within the time limits provided for in Article 14.3 of the GDPR.
 
Finally, with regard to the function of the structures, the CNPD observes that they address
transport requests to the Minister in the name and on behalf of persons traveling
in such a structure in accordance with Article 10.3 of the bill, and that they transmit as soon as
therefore necessarily to the Minister of personal data concerning said persons.
In this case, and unless there are additional explanations from the authors of the bill, the CNPD
considers that the structures are to be considered as data controllers independent of the
minister. The EDPS specifically mentions in this context that “the exchange of the same
data or sets of data between two entities without them jointly determining

the purposes or means of the processing should be considered as a communication of
data between separate controllers. » 11
 

  On the quality of subcontractor of service providers

 
Clause 18 of the bill provides that “to the extent required for the management,
the organization and security of specific transport services, personal data
personal in question are transmitted to the providers of the services in question who process them
as subcontractors. The commentary to article 18 contains no explanation for this.
regard.
 
The CNPD wonders in this context who is concretely targeted by these “providers of
services ". Are they the vendors implementing the software solution behind the register of
beneficiaries of specific transport12 or rather transport companies that take care of
to bring the beneficiaries of the various services from A to B? In the latter case, the presentation of
reasons specifies that “the driver to whom a route is assigned is aware of a certain
amount of information on his passenger, not only on the technical aid used by the
passenger, but also on blindness or visual impairment, or even on the particular attention that he
must, where applicable, be insured towards the passenger and which is linked to his disability; information is
more important in the event of an incident or road accident. »
 
As these are specific transports, the National Commission can understand that, as
mentioned above, the driver needs to know certain information about his passengers.
Nevertheless, it wishes to emphasize in this context the importance of the principle of minimizing
data enshrined in article 5.1. c) of the GDPR, i.e. the Minister can only
transfer data that is absolutely necessary for management purposes,
organization and safety of specific transport services.
 
Furthermore, it refers again to the aforementioned EDPS Guidelines which
recall that "all service providers who process personal data
in the context of the provision of a service are not "processors" within the meaning of the GDPR.
The role of processor does not derive from the nature of the entity processing the data, but from its
concrete activities in a specific context. […] In practice, when the service provided does not
does not specifically target the processing of personal data or where such processing

the processing and sharing of a certain number of data, and it is understood that the supply contract therein
relating contains the necessary provisions for the protection of personal data, in particular
the definition of the obligations of the subcontractor supplier in this area”

does not constitute an essential part of the service, the service provider may be able to
to independently determine the purposes and means of the processing which is
necessary for the provision of the service. In this case, the service provider should be considered
as a separate controller and not as a processor. A case analysis
by case remains necessary in order to determine the effective degree of influence of each entity
on the determination of the purposes and means of the processing. On the other hand, a “provider of
services can always act as a subcontractor even if the processing of personal data
personal is not the main or primary purpose of the service, provided that the customer of the service
always determines the purposes and means of processing in practice. » 13
 
To conclude, in the absence of details in the current text, the CNPD recommends that the authors of the
bill to specify, for reasons of legal certainty, who these service providers are.
services and to verify on a case-by-case basis whether they really act as subcontractors of the Minister
or if, on the other hand, they are rather to be considered as separate data controllers.
 

III. As for the draft Grand-Ducal regulation

 
First of all, the CNPD would like to congratulate the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation for having
explicitly mentioned on the medical certificate form, as provided for in Article
3 second paragraph of the bill, that said certificate is "to be attached to the application in a sealed envelope
and intended for the doctor-member of the assessment unit. »
 
It then notes that according to the fourth paragraph of Article 2 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation
the members and the secretariat of the evaluation unit “are subject to professional secrecy and
may not disclose to third parties information they have obtained in the performance of
their mission”, while article 6 of the said draft provides as follows: “The members of the unit
committee, members of the review panel, members of the secretariat and
experts are bound by confidentiality regarding the files submitted to them. »
 
For reasons of consistency, it recommends that the authors of the draft Grand-
ducal authorities to provide that all the persons involved mentioned in the aforementioned article 6 are
obligations to professional secrecy under the conditions and subject to the penalties provided for in Article 458
of the Penal Code.
 
Finally, the CNPD noticed that the form for requesting a transport service
specific regular specialized for pupils, as provided for in article 12 of the bill, makes
default in the draft Grand-Ducal regulation.
