Finance and Budget Committee at its meeting of May 3, 2022 (hereafter the
“parliamentary amendments”).
 

1. Ad amendment 1 concerning the new article 15bis

 

In its opinion of March 4, 2022 relating to the new article 15bis, as introduced by the draft
law, the CNPD had wondered whether access to the “register of companies of the minister having the
authorizations of establishment in its attributions”, with a view to verifying the exact
collection of VAT, referred to the business register, as defined in Article 32, paragraph
(1) the amended law of September 2, 2011 regulating access to the professions of craftsman,
trader, industrialist as well as certain liberal professions.
 
The authors of the parliamentary amendments are to be commended for making it clear that it
it was indeed the business register referred to in Article 32, paragraph (1), of the law
amended on September 2, 2011 mentioned above.
 
Nevertheless, although the register for which access is granted has been specified, it is necessary to
regret that the terms of access to such a register are not specified. This all the more
whereas article 15bis provides for direct access by the Administration to the registration,
domains and VAT to such a register.
 
Thus, there is reason to wonder whether this access relates to all the data that would be
processed in this register, namely the data listed in Article 1, paragraph (2), of the
Grand-Ducal Regulation of 28 April 2015 establishing data processing at
personal character necessary for the execution of article 32 of the law of September 2, 2011
regulating access to the professions of craftsman, tradesman, industry as well as to certain
liberal professions2.
 
In the absence of such details, the National Commission takes the liberty of reiterating its
observations made in its aforementioned opinion in that it recalls “that under the principle
data minimization, only personal data that is necessary
the achievement of the purposes pursued by the controller, namely the verification
of the correct collection of VAT, should be consulted”.

 

 

                                                 
2 Article 1(2) provides that “[t]he database of persons subject to a business permit or
to a prior declaration includes, in accordance with the requirements of Article 32, the following information:
a) the surnames, first names, contact details and, where applicable, the company name of the applicants for and beneficiaries of an authorization
establishment;
b) the surnames, first names and contact details of the technical manager of the legal person requesting or receiving an authorization
establishment;
c) the dates of issue, extension, revocation or cancellation of business permits;
d) the activities authorized under a business permit;
e). any other information provided by the citizen or by other administrations, which is required by the law of September 2
2011 for the processing of business permit files”.

relating to bill no. 7872 amending 1° the amended law of 19 December 2008

aimed at inter-administrative and judicial cooperation and the strengthening of

means of the Administration of direct contributions, the Administration of the registration

2. Ad amendment 2 concerning the new article 15ter

 

The authors of the parliamentary amendments are to be commended for clarifying the
purposes of the processing envisaged in the new article 15ter, as suggested by the Council
of State in its opinion of February 1, 2022 on the bill3 and by the CNPD in its opinion
aforementioned.

 

This amendment further intends to specify the categories of data which would be covered by
said provisions following the observations made by the National Commission in its
aforementioned opinion.

 

Thus, a paragraph (3) is introduced in the new article 15ter which provides that “[f]or the
purposes of this provision, only the information appearing in the
minutes or reports drawn up by the public authorities referred to in paragraphs
1st and 2nd, in particular surname, first names, address, personnel number, date of birth, activity
economic and place of exercise of this activity”.
 
The CNPD therefore understands that the minutes and reports themselves, which
would be drawn up by the Agency for the development of employment or by the Administration of
registration, domains and VAT would not be transmitted.
 
 
For the rest, the National Commission would like to reiterate its observations made in its
opinion of March 4, 2022 and more specifically those relating to the provisions of Article 15quater4
as well as all of its developments relating to the right to information5 and security
treatment6.
 

 

Thus decided in Belvaux on May 13, 2022.
