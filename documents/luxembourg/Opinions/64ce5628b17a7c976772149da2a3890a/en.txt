1. Ad Amendment 1

 
The authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation specify in the commentary to Article 2, as

or the sexual orientation of a natural person will be processed on the basis of Article 9,
paragraph (2), letter j), of the GDPR.
 
While such clarifications are to be welcomed, the CNPD reiterates its observations made in its
opinion of June 1, 2021 regarding the additional appropriate measures that will have to be implemented

August 2018 on the organization of the National Commission for Data Protection and the
general regime on data protection, with those of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation3.
 

2. Ad Amendment 2

 
The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a new article 3 which provides that “[t]he census
will collect the following information for administrative purposes:
a) surname and first name;
b) the identification number within the meaning of the amended law of 19 June 2013 relating to identification
some people.
This information will only be used to combine data from administrative records as well as
than those collected through the questionnaires”.
 
In the commentary to the new article 3, the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation specify
that these data would be used "only" to combine the various administrative registers and
that no statistical use of these data would be planned by STATEC.
 
For a better understanding of the device under review and insofar as STATEC will be
the controller, the term “census” should be replaced by the
“STATEC”.
 
With regard to the data listed in points a) and b) of the aforementioned article, which would be
now collected for administrative purposes by STATEC (and not for statistical purposes), it
there is reason to wonder about the meaning of such purposes.
 
It should be remembered that the purposes of processing personal data
correspond to the objective pursued by the data controller when the latter puts
implement such processing. In this case, the CNPD understands that STATEC will collect such
data because they will be necessary for the proper organization of the census.
 
Furthermore, the use of the national identification number “for internal administrative purposes”,
as referred to in Article 2, paragraph (2), of the amended law of 19 June 2013 relating to the identification
natural persons, is to be understood, for example, as the use by a
administration of the registration number of one of its constituents as part of the processing of his file.
 
Consequently, the National Commission wonders whether the terminology used to designate the
purposes provided for by the new Article 3, reflects the purposes which would actually be pursued
by STATEC in such a context.
 
In any case, the terminology used is too vague and does not comply with the requirements
clarity, precision and predictability that a legal text must meet, in accordance with
the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Rights
of man 4.

In addition, with regard to the use of the national identification number, the CNPD reiterates its
observations made in its opinion of June 1, 2021 according to which it considers that, failing
appropriate legal basis in the amended law of 19 June 2013 relating to the identification of
natural persons, the use of the national identification number within the framework of the
census should be regulated by law5.
 

3. Ad Amendment 3

 
The authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation are to be congratulated for having modified Article 3,
paragraph 3, of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation following the observations made by the CNPD in
its opinion of June 1, 2021.
 
Just as the National Commission welcomes the details provided by the authors of the draft
of the Grand-Ducal Regulation, according to which “[T]ATEC will not have direct access to the register
of the Common Center. Only the data mentioned will be provided to STATEC by the Inspection
General Social Security”.
 

4. Ad Amendment 4

 
The purpose of this amendment is to modify Article 4, last paragraph, of the draft grand-
ducal in these terms “[o]nce these two operations are completed, this information will be
deleted as soon as the identification of natural persons is no longer necessary in
the statistics production chain. This deletion of data must be done
within a maximum of three years after the census date so that no
nominative data does not appear in the computer file established on the basis of the data of the
census. ".
 
According to the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation, this amendment takes into account the
remarks of the National Commission and “this in order to be consistent with article 16 of the law
amended on July 10, 2011 on the organization of STATEC. The conditions mentioned in
this article are even stricter than those found in the STATEC law because these
operations must be carried out within three years from the date of the census”.
 
Although the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation are to be congratulated for taking into account
account the considerations of the CNPD in its opinion of June 1, the criteria, which
justify that the data be deleted within the 3-year period, are not indicated
in the text of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation or in the comments to the article.
 
Therefore, in the absence of such details, the National Commission is not in a position to
to assess whether, in this case, the principle of limited data retention would be
respected.
 

                                           
n"47413/06], § 228-229, 4 December 2015, ECtHR, Vavřička and others v. Czech Republic (applications n°47621/13 and 5 others), §
276-293, April 8, 2021.

For the remainder and with regard to the retention period of data processed for purposes
statistics and not covered by the aforementioned article, it is appropriate to reiterate the observations made
by the CNPD in its aforementioned opinion6.
 

5. Ad Amendment 5

 
The authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation should be commended for having specified the elements
that make up the identification key.
 
Moreover, although article 9 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation, as modified by the amendment
5, provides that “[t]his technical key is unique per person, does not allow the user to find the
number and is only used for administrative purposes", no details as to the link between
this key and the national identification number were provided by the authors of the draft
grand-ducal regulations.
 
However, STATEC in its opinion of 9 March 2021 relating to the draft Grand-Ducal regulation had
indicated that this key would allow "the merging of administrative data and those from
questionnaires at the individual level, will be used in addition to the registration number so that this
data fusion is optimal. This data fusion is a key step in the success of the
census of the population. Without this fusion, the collected data will not be
exploitable and STATEC will not be able to meet the obligations of European regulations".
 
Therefore, in the absence of such details, the CNPD is not in a position to enter the
possible problems that could arise from the point of view of the protection of
data.
 
Moreover, insofar as this key would constitute a unique identifier, she wonders if a
such a key would not be analyzed as a "new registration number".
 

6. Ad Amendment 6

 
The authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation are to be congratulated for having expressly provided
in article 10 of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation that STATEC will be responsible
processing within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR.
 
However, details on the roles of municipalities, enumerators and the CTIE,
were not provided by the authors of the draft Grand-Ducal regulation. Therefore, the CNPD
reiterates on this subject its observations made in its opinion of 1 June 20217.
 
In addition, this amendment introduces a new paragraph 4 to article 6 of the draft grand-
ducal which specifies that the communes will take advantage of the census “in order to control, by their
own resources, the exhaustive nature of their population register”, while providing that
the data collected by the latter, within the framework of the census, cannot be
used “to update their population register”.

                                           
6 See point II.7., page 16.
7 See point II.2., page 7.

__________________________________________________________________________________

 

 

 

 

 

  

 


However, although the principle of non-reuse of data collected by municipalities, in
the framework of the census, now appears in the aforementioned article, there is reason to wonder about the
means that would allow the municipalities to check the exhaustive nature of their register of
the population, if not precisely by reusing the data that the latter will collect
as part of the census.
 

7. Ad Amendment 7

 
This amendment follows the observations of the National Commission formulated in its opinion
of June 1, 2021 and proposes the introduction of a new article 21, the purpose of which is to specify the
derogations that would be made to the rights of data subjects.
 
Nevertheless, in accordance with the principle of the hierarchy of legal norms, which imposes the
parallelism of forms, such provisions, which intend to derogate from the rights of persons
concerned, as provided for in article 63 of the law of 1 August 2018 on the organization of the
National Commission for Data Protection and the general data protection regime
data, should be included in a law and not in a Grand-Ducal regulation.
 
 
The National Commission reiterates all of its observations made in its
opinion of June 1, 2021 relating to its questions regarding the compliance of the draft regulation
Grand Ducal to the provisions of Articles 11, paragraph (3) and 32, paragraph (3) of the
Constitution, while it would regulate essential points of a matter reserved for the law, in particular
when it defines who is the data controller, the purposes of the processing that would be
implemented, in that it provides for access to administrative files by STATEC, or even in
that it provides for the use of the national identification number8.
 
 
Thus decided in Belvaux on July 2, 2021.
