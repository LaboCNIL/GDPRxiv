In this sense, the initiation of administrative proceedings before the CPDP is related to the presence of a person who processes personal data in his capacity as a controller of personal data. As not every person who processes personal data has the status of "personal data controller" with the provision of Art. 3, para. 1 and para. 2 of the LPPD gives a legal definition of the concept, namely: personal data controller is a natural or legal person, as well as a body of state power or local government, which alone or together with another person determines the purposes and means of personal data processing , as well as when the type, purposes and means of processing are determined by law. From an official reference made in the Electronic Register of personal data controllers and the registers kept by them, it was established that the company has fulfilled its obligation under Art. 17, para. 1 of the LPPD, has submitted an application for registration and is registered as a controller of personal data and two registers have been requested. An opinion was submitted to the Commission for Personal Data Protection by Dr. H.Y.B., filed with Reg. № С-286 / 11.05.2017, alleging that his doctor's office is equipped with expensive and modern equipment. It is stated that in the last two years there have been three robberies of sites located in the immediate vicinity of the above-mentioned cabinet. For each of them, he was asked by the investigative bodies of RUP-Petrich to take recordings from the cameras. It is alleged that he has 5 cameras, two of which are aimed at the two entrances to the apartment and his office, and the other three to the garden around the house. It is pointed out that on 30 August 2016 the applicant, Mr. V.A.V. with a metal pipe he broke two of the cameras aimed at the entrances of Mr. B.'s house, and a complaint was filed with the Petrich Regional Police Department, and Mr. V.A.V. detained for twenty-four hours. The investigation into the case has not been completed. It is stated that Mr. V.A.V. for his part, for many years he owned two video surveillance cameras, which he removed after the specific situation. The respondent party points out that on 06.02.2017 in a state of intoxication the complainant Mr. V.A.V. and his friends staged a threat from Mr B., which led to the arrival of MoI officers. After checking the video footage, he found that no such attack had taken place.Mr. B. claims that he has a contract with V.S. Ltd. on a site with address ****** and a sign is placed in a prominent place, which indicates that the site is under video surveillance.
As a result of the evidence gathered in the administrative proceedings and after analyzing the relevant legal provisions, the Commission ruled on the merits of the complaint, taking into account the reasons set out below.
Pursuant to Art. 1, para. 1 and para. 2 of the LPPD, this law regulates the protection of the rights of individuals in the processing of their personal data. The purpose of the law is to guarantee the inviolability of the person and private life by ensuring the protection of individuals in the event of improper processing of related personal data in the process of free movement of data.
In connection with the evidence gathered and the established factual situation, the relevant legal provisions regarding the legality of the video surveillance are considered.
According to Art. 4, para. 1 of the LPPD, the processing of personal data is admissible only in the cases when there is at least one of the conditions listed in item 1 - item 7 of the same norm.
According to Art. 4, para. 1, item 7 of the LPPD, the processing of personal data is admissible when necessary for the realization of the legitimate interests of the personal data controller or a third party to whom the data is disclosed, except when the interests of the natural person take precedence over these interests. which the data is disclosed.
This condition for the admissibility of the processing of personal data implies equal rights and interests of citizens, except when the interests of the data subject take precedence over the interests of the person processing personal data, in this case video surveillance.
The above is part of the constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the citizen of the Republic of Bulgaria such as the right to life, personal liberty and inviolability on the grounds of Art. 28, Art. 30, para. 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria.
Given the dynamic development of technological and social relations in general, and the growing relevance of issues related to peace, health and life of the individual in modern reality, there is an increasingly urgent trend to consider the rights and interests of citizens namely from the point of view of their equality, as well as the application of the meaning of the spirit of the law and its conformity with reality.
Lack of consent for the installation of video cameras does not lead to the mechanical conclusion that it is illegal, as consent is one of the conditions for admissibility of processing, but in order to accept inadmissibility or illegality, it is necessary to establish the absence of any of the other grounds in Art. 4, para. 1, item 1 - item 7 of LPPD.
In conclusion of the above and in accordance with the application of Art. 4, para. 1, item 7 of the LPPD as a ground for admissibility of the processing, no preconditions are established for accepting the conclusion that the interests of the complainant have priority over the interests of the respondent party.
In connection with the above and on the grounds of Art. 38, para. 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Personal Data Protection Commission ruled as follows
ANSWER:
1. Dismisses as unfounded the complaint with reg. № Ж-51 / 09.02.2017, filed by V.А.В. against IPSMPOB OM - Dr. B. EOOD - in view of the established on the grounds of art. 4, para. 1, item 7 of the LPPD admissibility of the processing of personal data of the complainant, through video surveillance performed by the respondent in a way that does not establish an advantage of the interests of the complainant over those of the personal data controller, in compliance with the principles Art. 28 and Art. 30, para. 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria for the right to life, personal liberty and inviolability of every Bulgarian citizen, due to which there is no violation of the rights of the complainant in accordance with the provisions of the LPPD;
The decision of the Commission for Personal Data Protection may be appealed to the Administrative Court of Sofia - city within 14 days of receipt.
