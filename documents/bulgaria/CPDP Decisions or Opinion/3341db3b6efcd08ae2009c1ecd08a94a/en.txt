The company's legal representative maintained the written opinion expressed during the proceedings, asking the Commission to take into account the fact that the infringement was first of all for the medical establishment and did not cause any damage to the complainant when ruling on the merits of the complaint. In his capacity of administrative body and in connection with the need to establish the truth of the case, as a basic principle in administrative proceedings, according to Art. 7 of the APC, requiring the existence of established facts, given the evidence gathered and the allegations, the Commission considers that considered on the merits of the complaint № PPN-01-192 / 29.11.2017 is justified in respect of both controllers of personal data - „А.С.К. UMBAL EOOD and MHAT-V. “Ltd. The same is the subject of illegal processing of the personal data of the complainant by "MHAT-V. EOOD in connection with a contract registered with the NRA and a social security declaration submitted by the company to the complainant for June 2017. The subject of the complaint are also the allegations of illegal processing of personal data of Mr. JSP, in the hypothesis of their provision by “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD of MBAL-V EOOD for the purposes of the contract.  From the evidence gathered in the file it was established, and it is not disputed between the parties, that the applicant was in an employment relationship with “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD in the period 05.01.2016 - 25.05.2017, in connection with which Mr. J.S.P. has provided the medical institution with his personal data - names, PIN, address, as well as a copy of documents related to the specifics of his position, namely a diploma of higher education in Medicine, Certificate of Recognition in Gastroenterology and Certified for membership in the Bulgarian Medical Union. It is evident from the evidence gathered that on 29.06.2017 “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD electronically from the e-mail address **** provided to MHAT-V. EOOD at the official e-mail address - ****** copy of documents issued to the complainant, containing his personal data, namely - diploma of higher education in the specialty "Medicine", Certificate of recognized specialty in Gastroenterology and Certificates of membership in Bulgarian Medical Union. On 5 July 2017, a copy of the applicant's identity card was provided from the e-mail address **** to the e-mail address ******. The allegations that the indicated e-mail addresses were used by "A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD and MHAT-V. “EOOD are not disputed. The data contained in the documents about the complainant undoubtedly have the character of personal data within the meaning of Art. 2, para. 1 of the LPPD, as through them the person can undoubtedly be individualized, and the actions for their provision is a form of processing of personal data contained therein and as such should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the LPPD and in particular in compliance with Art. 23, para. 1 of the LPPD. This provision obliges the controller of personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect data from accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, from unauthorized access, alteration or dissemination, and from other illegal forms of processing, including and from illegal provision and use. The allegations of the complainant that his personal data were processed, in the case of providing by “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD of MHAT-V. “EOOD without his knowledge and consent correspond to the evidence gathered in the file. Despite the provided to “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD legal opportunity the company has not engaged evidence in the opposite direction. In view of the distribution of the burden of proof in the process, it is necessary to conclude that the submitted by Mr. J.S.P. the complaint is well-founded and the personal data of the complainant have been processed - provided by “A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD of MHAT-V. EOOD in violation of Art. 23, para. 1 of the LPPD - without the personal data controller having taken technical and organizational measures for protection of the personal data of the complainant, as a result of which the rights of the person referring to the CPDP have been violated. In the context of its operational autonomy, the Commission considers that, in view of the nature of the infringement found, the imposition of coercive administrative measures (mandatory prescribing or setting a deadline for remedying the infringement) is inappropriate and inappropriate in this case. of its performance and is irremovable. Giving a deadline for eliminating the violation is pointless. It, as a coercive administrative measure, is applicable in a case in which the commission of the respective violation continues or the same is remediable. In the present case, as noted, this is impossible. The Commission for Personal Data Protection has the power to issue a mandatory prescription to the controller of personal data, but it concerns situations in which the controller has not fulfilled its obligation, which omission can be remedied by performing the missed actions and objectifying the required by law conduct. Only the property sanction, as a measure of administrative coercion, is the most appropriate and effective measure. It should be noted that in addition to a purely sanction measure, a reaction of the state to the violation of the statutory rules, the property sanction also has a disciplinary effect, in view of the non-commission of the same violation in the future. The administrator is obliged to know the law and to comply with its requirements, moreover, that he owes the necessary care provided by the LPPD and arising from his subject of activity, human and economic resources. Motivated by the above and within its operational independence, the Commission imposes on the controller of personal data - "A.S.K. UMBAL EOOD administrative penalty for violation of the provisions of the LPPD, considering that the same will have an educational impact and will contribute to compliance by the administrator of the established legal order. In determining the amount of the administrative penalty, the Commission considers as an aggravating circumstance and grounds for imposing a sanction above the minimum provided by law for this violation the large amount of personal data of the complainant provided by the company to "MHAT-B. EAD, including a copy of the identity document of the person. It should be noted that in the course of the proceedings another violation of the provisions of the LPPD was established by “A.S.K. UMBAL ”EOOD, namely storage of a copy of the identity document of the complainant in connection with the labor relations between the parties. The latter is in violation of the principles on which the processing of personal data should be based and in particular the principle of proportionality of the data specified in Art. 2, para. 2, item 3 of the LPPD, according to which the processed data should be relevant, related and not exceeding the purposes for which they are processed. In this connection, the Commission considers it appropriate to indicate to the company that it should destroy the kept copy of the complainant's identity card, given that the collection by the employer and the keeping of a copy of the identity document in the employees' employment record is incompatible. and goes beyond the purposes for which the employee's data are processed, namely in relation to the employment relationship between them. The evidence gathered in the case established a violation of the applicant's rights by MHAT-V. “Ltd. The personal data of the complainant in a volume of three names, PIN, address and ID card number were processed by "MHAT-V. “EOOD for drawing up a civil contract № ***** between the parties: Assignor - MHAT-V. EOOD and Contractor - J.S.P. with the subject "consultations as a gastroenterologist", which was not signed by Mr. J.S.P. It is also undisputed that in connection with the contract on 07.08.2017 the company provided to the NRA personal data - names and a unique civil number to provide the complainant in connection with the contract on 01.06.2017. The processing of personal data of the complainant by “MHAT-V. EOOD, in the above hypothesis - use for drawing up a civil contract, storage and provision to the NRA are in violation of Art. 4, para. 1 of LPPD - were performed without the consent of the complainant and without any of the other conditions for admissibility of the processing specified in Art. 4, para. 1, items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of LPPD. Given the fact that the violation is the first for the controller of personal data - "MHAT-B. EOOD, as well as given the fact that the data have been provided to a state body NRA, which already has them, in connection with other contracts registered with the person, the Commission considers it appropriate to issue a mandatory prescription to MHAT-B. EOOD pursuant to the provisions of the LPPD and its obligation to lawfully process personal data, the provision of personal data to individuals to the NRA in connection with the registration of contracts and submission of data for insurance to take place after the conclusion of the employment or civil contract between countries. Guided by the above and on the grounds of Art. 10, para. 1, item 7, in connection with Art. 38, para. 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Commission for Personal Data Protection, DECIDES: 1. Declares the complaint № PPN-01-192 / 29.11.2017 as well-founded. 2. On the grounds of art. 42, para. 1 of the LPPD imposes on “A.S.K. UMHAT “EOOD with UIC ***** with registered office and address of management *****, in its capacity of administrator of personal data property sanction in the amount of BGN 1,000 (thousand BGN) for violation of Art. 23, para. 1 of the LPPD. 3.
