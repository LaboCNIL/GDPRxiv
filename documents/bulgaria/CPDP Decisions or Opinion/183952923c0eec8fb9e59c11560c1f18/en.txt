The application was registered in KAIS by D.Y. employee of "G.I. Ltd.

In this regard, information on the progress and results of the initiated proceedings has been requested ex officio from the SRP, and in the case of the expert report prepared for the case/expertise on the signatures placed under the process documents, a copy of the same. In response, the SRP informs that the preparation of expert examinations assigned to the case is pending, but they refuse to provide additional information and materials from the prosecutor's file.

In order to exercise its powers, the commission must be validly referred. The complaint contains the mandatory required details: data about the complainant, the nature of the request, date and signature, the passively legitimized party is indicated and the date of knowledge of the violation, in view of which the complaint is regular. The complaint was filed by a natural person with a legal interest against the proper party "GI" OOD - personal data controller within the meaning of Art. 4, para. 7 of the General Regulation EU 2016/679.  The subject of the complaint is unlawful processing of the personal data of Mrs. T.A. - three names, uniform civil number, address and mobile phone number, from "G.I. " Ltd. in connection with an application submitted to the AGKK *******. The Commission was notified on 21.01.2021, less than two months after the alleged violation was committed, which makes it necessary to conclude that the complaint was filed within the period under Art. 38, para. 1 of the Labor Code. Referred to is competent to rule - CPLD, which according to its powers under Art. 10, para. 1 of the Labor Code in connection with Art. 57, § 1, letter "f" of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, examines complaints filed by a data subject against acts and actions of personal data controllers that violate the rights of natural persons related to personal data processing, as there are no exceptions under Art. 2, § 2, letter "c" and Art. 55, § 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 given the fact that the case does not concern processing activities carried out by an individual in the course of purely personal or domestic activities and/or activities carried out by courts in the performance of their judicial functions. For the stated reasons and given the absence of the negative prerequisites specified in Art. 27, para. 2 of the APC, at a meeting of the commission held on 30.03.2022, the complaint was accepted as admissible and the following were constituted as parties to the proceedings: complainant - T.A. and respondent - "G.I. Ltd. An open hearing has been scheduled to consider the merits of the complaint on 18.05.2022 at 1:00 p.m., of which the parties are regularly notified and are informed of the expertise prepared for the case, a copy of which has been provided to them for perusal and opinion. Disregarded, as not relevant to the subject of the dispute, was the evidentiary request made by the complainant that the commission ex officio demand from AGKK all documents issued by "G.I. Ltd. on the application, as well as information on what changes in the cadastral register of real estate were made based on it. In order to clarify the case from a factual point of view, internal rules and/or policy for the protection of personal data have been requested from the defendant again, in which the procedure for processing personal data by the company, in its capacity as a personal data administrator, is specified, by whom it is provided Certificate of spouse and family ties, attached to the application submitted to the AGCC, as well as evidence of how, when and by whom the service was commissioned according to the application. It has been specified that the copy of the Internal Rules for the security of information and personal data, attached by the defendant to the opinion dated 01.11.2021, are without date and specifics for the company to which they refer. The statement of the company was sent to the AGCC for information, that the reason why the address and telephone number of the petitioner Mrs. T.A. were entered in the procedural application. is that "When writing the EGN (Bulstat) or the name of an individual or company, the SGKK system itself generates the rest of the data, such as address, phone, email, which the AGKK system has". In this regard, the agency has requested information on whether, before 13.11.2020, data about the applicant was stored in the AGKK system and in what volume, as well as whether it was generated automatically when specifying the person's personal identification number in an application ****** * according to the inventory of AGKK, submitted electronically. In response, ****** from AGKK does not deny the statements made by the defendant. They specify that "when an application is submitted by a legally competent person, in the event that the applicant was a client of AGKK in connection with a certain administrative proceeding, for which he provided his data, the system stores and visualizes them on a screen, and there is an option by pressing a button "Editorial", the same to be used, deleted and amended by the legally competent person". They add that in connection with a submitted application ent. No. ****** from the complainant, the AGKK information system stores her personal data for address, telephone, three names and social security number. On 18.05.2022, half an hour before the hearing, the defendant filed an uncertified copy of the title page of the Internal Rules for the Security of Information and Personal Data presented at an earlier stage in the proceedings of "G.I. " Ltd., dated 20.02.2018 and certificate No. 0016649 for administrator of personal data. It clarifies that the source of the processed personal data of the complainant is the arrays of AGKK. It states that the certificate of kinship, attached to the application submitted to the AGCC, as well as all the evidence certifying the co-ownership of the applicant, which coincides with that of the applicant, are submitted by the co-owner or an authorized person - a lawyer, and these documents are available to every co-owner and are receive from the relevant administrative offices of the municipalities. They claim that service on the application was requested by the attorney (attorney G.) of a co-heir of the applicant and was provided on the date it was recorded as having been received. At a meeting of the commission held on 18.05.2022, the complaint was examined on its merits. The complainant - regularly notified appears in person and through an attorney. N. with a power of attorney on the file. The respondent - regularly notified, is not represented at the meeting before the commission. The complainant and Adv. N. state that they are familiar with the evidence collected in the file, including the evidence and information submitted by the defendant before the hearing. They do not point to new evidence, they have no requests for evidence. They support the complaint and ask the commission to accept it as well-founded. In its capacity as an administrative body and in connection with the need to establish the truth of the case, as a basic principle in administrative proceedings, according to Art. 7 of the APC, requiring the existence of established actual facts, and given the evidence collected and the allegations made, the commission accepts that the substantively examined complaint No. PPN-01-63/21.01.2021 is well-founded. The subject of the complaint are allegations of unlawful processing of the personal data of Mrs. T.A. - three names, uniform civil number, address and mobile phone number, from "G.I. " Ltd. in connection with an application submitted to the AGKK ******* From the evidence gathered in the case file, it was established, and it is not disputed between the parties, that in the cadastral-administrative information system (KAIS) of the AGKK, an Application with No. **** from T.A., filed through "G.I. Ltd. The application was submitted electronically and it requested an amendment to the cadastral register of real estate, the issuance of a sketch of a landed property with the identifier ***** and a scheme of an independent object with the identifier ********. The application was registered in KAIS by D.Y. employee of "G.I. " Ltd., a legally competent person according to the cadastre, who is included in the specialized composition of the company and is designated as a person to carry out the activity of administrative service with cadastral information. The application contains three names and the applicant's social security number, as well as an address and contact telephone number, in her capacity as a petitioner requesting the service. A contract for the sale of state residential property issued in the name of the deceased parents of the applicant S.S. was attached to the application submitted to the AGCC. and P.P.S., certificate of 2007 heirs of S.S. and certificate of spouse and relationship of P.S. with ext. No. **** of the Metropolitan Municipality, "Serdika" district, in which certificates contain personal data - names, TIN of the applicant and family ties. It is not in dispute that the complainant is not a requester of the service, a fact which is confirmed by the defendant, and also by a graphic examination prepared for the case, reflected in Protocol No. ******* of 22.03.2022, according to the inventory of the NIK, with the conclusion that the signature in the column "Signature" in the lower right corner of a copy of Application ******* according to the inventory of AGKK is a copy of a signature that was not signed by T.A. It is not disputed that Mrs. T.A. did not provide her personal data to G.I. " Ltd. that there is no contractual relationship between the parties, that she did not authorize the company to submit an application on her behalf to AGKK for the specific service and that there is no consent for the company to process her personal data. Given the above, it is necessary to conclude that the applicant's personal data were processed, in the hypothesis of use, by "G.I. " Ltd. for submitting the application on behalf of the complainant to the AGCC without grounds and in violation of Art. 6, § 1 of the GDPR. The company only recognizes that the applicant for the service is a person other than the applicant, namely St.S., her nephew, but the applicant was wrongly named as the applicant in the submitted application and the latter's social security number was entered in the application. The fact that the rest of the applicant's data - names, address and telephone number - contained in the application were not indicated/entered by the company, but were automatically generated by the AGCC, does not change the conclusion that the company unlawfully processed the personal data of Ms. T.A. in connection with the service requested before the AGCC, insofar as the data entered in the application have been confirmed by the sender D.Y., an employee of "G.I. " Ltd., a legal entity according to the cadastre, although Mrs. T.A. is not an applicant for the service, a fact known to the company and the legal entity at the date of submission of the application. In addition, the system allows "editing" of the information filled in the application, which was not done, therefore the principle of accuracy of the processed data was not respected. In this regard, the commission does not credit the company's claims of a technical error, as the application is given the appearance that it originates from the complainant and is signed by her, which testifies to the purposefulness of the actions of the sender, knowing that the complainant is not a requester of the service insofar as the company does not have a contract with it for the assignment of the service. The complainant's claims that her personal data were processed by the company without her knowledge and consent for the purposes of the submitted application correspond with the evidence collected in the file. There is no evidence to justify the legality of the processing based on a contract concluded between the parties for the implementation of any necessary processing of personal data of Mrs. T.A. or to take steps at the data subject's request prior to entering into the contract. There is no legally established obligation of the company to process personal data of the person for the stated purpose. The hypothesis of the existence of a legitimate interest of the administrator that is superior to the interest of the affected natural person is not applicable. The remaining conditions are irrelevant - they are applicable in other, different and incompatible with the present hypotheses, which refer to the processing of personal data for the purpose of protecting vital interests related to the life and health of the data subject or the performance of a task of public interest, as well as in the exercise of official powers, which in the present proceedings have not been found to have been delegated to the company.An analysis of the collected evidence leads to the conclusion that the applicant's personal data were processed in violation of Art. 6, § 1 of the Regulation, without any of the conditions specified in the regulation for the legality of the processing, as the rights of the person who referred the CPLD were violated.
Due to the nature of the detected violation and in the conditions of operational independence, the commission considers that, in view of the established factual situation and the collected evidence, the measures under Art. 58, § 2, letter "a", "c", "e", "f", "g", "h" and "j" of Regulation EU 2016/679 are inapplicable, and the imposition of corrective measures under Art. 58, § 2, letters "b" and "d" of the GDPR is inappropriate and disproportionate to the violation and the circumstances in which it was committed by the controller. Considers it expedient, dissuasive and proportionate, given the gravity of the violation, the large volume of processed personal data and the fact that the same was completed and purposeful, the involvement of the administrative-criminal liability of the company with the imposition of a pecuniary sanction for violation of Art. 6, § 1 of the GDPR.
When determining the type and amount of the corrective measure imposed on the administrator, the commission qualifies as aggravating the circumstances that the processed personal data is in a large volume, the violation has been completed, the actions of the representative of the administrator are targeted, and the violation has become known to the CPLD as a result of the referral from the injured person. As mitigating factors, the commission considers the following circumstances: it concerns a violation of the rights of an individual; until now, in relation to the administrator, CPLD has not exercised corrective powers; the company is a micro-enterprise within the meaning of art. 3, para. 3, item 1 of the Law on Small and Medium Enterprises insofar as the announced average number of personnel is 10 people, and the total value of the assets, according to the last published report for 2020, is BGN 259,000. The circumstances under Art. 83, § 2, letters "b" and "i" of the Regulation are irrelevant insofar as it concerns an administrator - a legal entity that does not constitute guilt, and at the time of the offense approved codes of conduct, respectively approved certification mechanisms are not introduced.
Based on the stated considerations, the commission considers that, in view of the principle of proportionality between the severity of the violation and the amount of the penalty, the imposed sanction should be in the amount of BGN 3,000 (three thousand BGN) - an amount around the minimum and well below the average provided for in the regulation on this violation.
Taking into account the purpose of the punishment, which should have a deterrent and warning function, the nature and severity of the violation, the public relations it affects, the categories of personal data affected, the commission considers that the corrective power exercised in terms of type and amount undoubtedly meets the requirements of the LLPD and Regulation 2016 /679 effectiveness and deterrent effect, while at the same time not violating the principle of proportionality and the requirement of proportionality.
Based on the above and based on Art. 38, para. 3 of the Polish Data Protection Authority, the Commission for the Protection of Personal Data,
RESOLVE:
1. Declares complaint No. PPN-01-63/21.01.2021 as well-founded.
2. Based on Art. 83, § 5, letter "a" in connection with Art. 58, § 2, letter "i" of Regulation EU 2016/679 imposes on "GI" OOD with EIK *******, an administrative penalty - a property sanction in the amount of BGN 3,000 (three thousand BGN ) for violation of Art. 6, § 1 of the Regulation.
The decision is subject to appeal within 14 days of its delivery, through the Commission for the Protection of Personal Data, before the Administrative Court of Sofia - city.
After the entry into force of the decision, the amount of the imposed penalty should be transferred by bank transfer:
