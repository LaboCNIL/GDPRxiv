For the respondent G.N. is K.N. - mother and proxy, with a proxy presented at the meeting. The parties refuse to enter into an agreement. The complainant maintains the complaint, does not point to new evidence. Requests the commission to allow the witnesses O.Y. and K.K. The commission removed the identity of the witnesses O.Y. and K.K. According to the persons, they are not related to the parties in the proceedings, and to the defendant G.N. have civil cases and conflictual relations between neighbors. It is officially known to the CPLD that the witnesses are parties to administrative proceedings initiated in 2021 at their initiative in the CPLD under Art. 38, para. 1 of the Labor Code, filed against G.N. complaints. The witnesses were shown a copy of the procedural claim attached to the case file, which was allegedly "stuck in a prominent and generally accessible place at the entrance of the cooperative" on 02/22/2021. The witness O.Y. declares that he is the owner of an independent apartment in a residential building with the address Sofia, *******. He says that in February 2021, three co-operators called him, who informed him that on the inside of the doorman at the entrance to the building, a claim was stuck in connection with a lawsuit filed by K.K. case against the condominium and prosecutor's decree. He adds that "the next morning" he personally saw the pasted claim containing the names of the complainant K.B., the personal number of the lawyer and the address of the law firm. After presenting a copy of the procedural claim attached to the file, he states that the claim he saw stuck on the inside of the doorman at the entrance of the residential building at the address Sofia, ******* is identical to the document submitted for review . He cannot specify specific dates for his claims, but he is adamant that it concerns events from the month of February 2021. He states that he did not see who and when he pasted the claim, but claims that only G.N. and her mother have access to the concierge and are the ones who post notices about the condominium. The witness K.K. states that upon returning to the apartment building at the address on 02/22/2021, at approximately 4:30 p.m., he saw that "the N. family was taping something to the inside of the door."

At the request of the defendant's legal representative, B.N. was also admitted to questioning as a witness in an open session. After taking down the identity of the witness, the commission proceeded to question the person. Mr. B.N. stated that in February 2021 he installed an information board at the entrance of a residential building with the address Sofia, *******. It states that the dashboard key was broken in transit and the dashboard was installed unlocked. He states that at the end of March 2021 he visited the building and changed the cartridge on the dashboard, and from February 2 to March 28 he was outside the city of Sofia. The parties have no other requests for evidence. New evidence does not point. The complainant maintains the complaint, asks for sanctioning the defendant and imposing a fine for unlawful processing and distribution of her personal data. Claims expenses in the amount of BGN 500 (five hundred BGN) - attorney's fees, attaches a list of expenses, a contract for legal protection and assistance dated 02.08.2022 and a copy of a power of attorney in favor of the attorney. M.M. The procedural representative of the defendant contests the complaint as groundless and asks the commission to disregard it. In its capacity as an administrative body and in connection with the need to establish the truth of the case, as a basic principle in administrative proceedings, according to Art. 7 of the APC, requiring the existence of established actual facts, and considering the evidence collected and the allegations made, the commission accepts that the substantively examined complaint No. PPN-01-236/15.03.2021 is unfounded. The subject of the complaint are allegations of unlawful processing of the complainant's personal data, contained in a claim to the Sofia District Court, submitted by K.K., through attorney. K.B., against a condominium at the address Sofia, *******, by distributing them to an unlimited circle of persons by means of "sticking" the claim on 22.02.2021 in a prominent and generally accessible place in the entrance of the condominium. The parties do not dispute that on the date of the alleged violation - 22.02.2021, the defendant G.N. is the Chairman of the management board of a condominium located at the address Sofia, *******. It has been established that there is a civil legal dispute between the condominium and K.K., a person owning an independent object in the condominium, which has been referred to the Sofia District Court. A civil case No. **** was established according to the court inventory initiated by Mr. K.K. with a claim filed against the EU, through Adv. K.B. It has been established that the claim contains data on Adv. K.B. in a volume of two names, profession - lawyer, office address, court address (which matches the office address), telephone number and personal number of the lawyer registered in the Sofia Bar Association. From the presented evidence, it cannot be established whether the claim bears the signature of the sender, Adv. K.B. The claim does not contain information about the applicant's uniform civil number and/or e-mail address, as claimed by Mrs. K.B. The latter is also confirmed by the testimony of J. and K. It is not disputed that the claim is addressed to the condominium represented by G.N. A copy of the claim was not personally received by the defendant G.N. It was established that the notice with which files from the claim and the attachments to it were delivered to the defendant in case No. **** according to the inventory of the Sofia District Court, Civil Department, Section 40 - Condominium ownership of a residential building located in the city of Sofia, *******, for an answer under Art. 131, para. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure was received on 22.02.2021 by K.N. It is not disputed, and it was also confirmed from the oral evidence collected in the case file that on 22.02.2021 a copy of the claim was available, pasted on the inside of the doorman in the entrance of the condominium at the address Sofia, ** *****. The information about the applicant contained in the invitation has the quality of personal data, given the fact that by means of it the person can be unambiguously individualized. In this regard, it is indisputable that the actions of placing a copy of the claim at the entrance of the building should be qualified as processing - distribution, of personal data within the meaning of Art. 4, item 2 of the GDPR, to an unlimited number of persons, including residents and visitors of the building, and as such they should meet the requirements of the GDPR and the GDPR.The file lacks evidence of the applicant's alleged distribution of her personal data to an unlimited circle of persons, by placing the claim by G.N. in a visible and generally accessible place at the entrance to the EU on 22.02.2021. The fact that the invitation was received on 22.02.2021 by the addressee, through his representative, does not change this fact, insofar as there is no evidence of its placement, distribution by G.N. in the manner described by the complainant, especially since the defendant is not the only person who owns the claim. A copy of the same is also available with its sender, the applicant, in the present proceedings, and her trustee, with whom Mrs. G.N. is in a complicated relationship, the same subjects and in a civil case **** according to the inventory of the Sofia District Court, according to a claim with a legal basis, Art. 109 of the Property Act filed by Mr. Y. against Mrs. G.N.
However, it is a fact that on 22.02.2021 the claim was available in a publicly accessible place - pasted on the inside of the doorman at the entrance to the condominium at the address Sofia, *******. Even if it is accepted that it was the defendant who placed a copy of the claim in the specified place, there are grounds for leaving the complaint without respect, as unfounded insofar as the data contained in the claim about the lawyer. K.B. are publicly known and accessible, as part of the register of the Sofia Bar Association of which the applicant is a member. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the published and generally available data about the applicant in the register are even larger than that contained in the claim, with the patronymic and e-mail address of Adv. K.B.
The Commission disregards the request of Mrs. K.B. for self-reporting on her allegations of unlawful processing of personal data of her client - K.K., in connection with the distribution of his personal data contained in the claim and its qualification as a signal, insofar as the same is blanket. Apart from this, there are no statements from Mr. K.K. and actions on his part to initiate proceedings before the CPLD for a violation of his rights in the specific case, regarding the published claim, although he had established the alleged violation as early as 22.02.2021, given the fact that he was called as a witness by Ms. K.B. for its execution. For completeness, it should be stated that Mr. K.K. is familiar with the procedure for the exercise of rights insofar as he appealed to the CPLD with a complaint PPN-01-288/2021 filed against the defendant in the present proceedings, but with a subject different from the present one on which the commission ruled.
Given the outcome of the dispute, the costs claimed by the applicant are not due, and for the sake of completeness it should be noted that attorney's fees are not awarded in the proceedings under Art. 38, para. 1 of the Labor Code, to the extent that they are outside of those specified in Art. 47, paragraph 2 of the APC expenses, as such are not provided for in the special law.
Based on the above and based on Art. 38, para. 3 of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Personal Data Protection Commission,
RESOLVE:
1. Declares complaint PPN-01-236/15.03.2021 unfounded.
2. Disregards the request for self-referral to the commission.
3. Dismisses the attorney's fees claimed by the applicant.
The decision is subject to appeal within 14 days of its delivery, through the Commission for the Protection of Personal Data before the Administrative Court of Sofia - city.
