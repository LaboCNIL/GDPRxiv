In this regard, S.S. visited the office of "BTK" EAD in the city of A. to submit an application for closing the phone. On the spot in the office he was informed that he had a contract concluded on August 22, 2017 for a period of 24 months. S.S. he was amazed, for his memory had not yet betrayed him. Points out that the contract with "BTK" EAD or any other document has not been signed for at least 3-4 years, respectively has not concluded a contract dated 22.08.2017. He requested to be provided with a contract, his request was granted and on 11.05.2018 received a copy of the same. S.S. found that that contract constituted an additional agreement which lacked the requisites, namely particulars of the person who had concluded it. It contained only his data - names and a unique civil number. A declaration was attached to the agreement. Both documents were "signed" by him. Given the situation, S.S. he contacted the police department in the town of A., presenting a sample of his signature for graphological examination.
