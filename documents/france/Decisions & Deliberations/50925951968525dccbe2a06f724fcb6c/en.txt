Makes the following observations:
Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter the GDPR), and in particular its article 5, point 2, provides that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected.
Article 9(4) of the GDPR clarifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data relating to health.
Thus, pursuant to the amended law of 6 January 1978 (hereinafter the Data Protection Act), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health is authorized by the National Commission data processing and freedoms (hereinafter the Commission).
The Commission can approve and publish reference methodologies, under the reference systems mentioned in II of Article 54 of the Data Protection Act, established in consultation with the National Institute for Health Data (hereinafter the INDS). , as well as with public and private bodies representing the players concerned.
Among the most common treatments are the treatments carried out by persons producing or marketing the products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311-1 (hereinafter health products) of the Public Health Code (hereinafter CSP) from data centralized by the Technical Agency for Hospitalization Information (hereinafter ATIH), i.e. data from the program for the medicalization of information systems (hereinafter PMSI).
The PMSI consists of a synthetic and standardized collection of administrative and medical information within health establishments, public or private, for-profit or non-profit, whose main objectives are to organize hospital care on French territory. (planning) and to finance establishments according to their activity (activity-based pricing).
Governed by articles L. 6113-7 and L. 6113-8 of the CSP, the PMSI was generalized in the 1990s and is now applied regardless of the hospital sector but with different collection methods depending on the categories of supported. It includes data on the following activities:
- medicine, surgery, obstetrics and odontology (MCO);
- follow-up and rehabilitation care (SSR);
- collection of medical information in psychiatry (RIM-P);
- hospitalization at home (HAD).
A specific file is used to link all the PMSI data concerning the same patient (ANO file).
These treatments make it possible in particular to prepare the files for discussions with the competent authorities and committees, mainly in the field of medicinal products and medical devices (marketing, price discussions, CE marking, etc.) and the carrying out of studies under actual use.
In view of these needs, the Commission considered that the framework of a reference methodology was appropriate to facilitate and supervise the numerous data processing operations carried out by persons producing or marketing the products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311- 1 of the CSP from PMSI data.
Data controllers who send a commitment to comply with this reference methodology are authorized to implement processing as long as it meets the conditions provided for by these provisions.

The implementation of personal data processing occurring within the framework of the study is carried out under the responsibility of the data controller, and of the research laboratory or design office acting on its behalf, in compliance with the provisions articles 24, 25, 28, 32 to 35 of the GDPR, as well as the decree of March 22, 2017 relating to the security reference system applicable to the SNDS and the decree of July 17, 2017 relating to the reference document determining the confidentiality criteria, expertise and independence for research laboratories and design offices.
The systems making the PMSI data available must therefore comply with the security reference system applicable to the aforementioned SNDS; two methods of provision are included in the framework of this reference methodology:
- the data is made available to the research laboratory or design office via the secure access service provider designated by ATIH;
- the data is exported to a research laboratory or a design office having a secure solution and having concluded an agreement with ATIH.
The Commission recalls that it is up to the data controller, in accordance with the reference framework set by the aforementioned decree of July 17, 2017, to ensure that the contract concluded with the research laboratory or design office specifies the measures and conditions certificate attesting to compliance with the decree of March 22, 2017 mentioned above. Title V: SUBCONTRACTORS
As part of this reference methodology, the data controller never accesses PMSI data and must use, for all processing, a research laboratory or an independent design office, subcontractor, having declared compliant with the Commission with the reference system determining the criteria of confidentiality, expertise and independence for research laboratories and design offices, set by decree of July 17, 2017. In accordance with this decree and article 28 of the GDPR, the respective commitments of the controller and the research laboratory or design office are formalized in a contract whose content is defined by these texts.
In particular, the contract must provide that this subcontractor:
- only processes data on documented instructions from the data controller and takes all required security measures;
- does not subcontract without the written authorization of the data controller;
- helps the data controller to guarantee compliance with his various obligations (rights of individuals, security of processing, notification of breach, impact analyses, etc.);
- provides the data controller with all the information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations and to enable audits to be carried out;
- immediately informs the data controller in the event of an instruction which, in his opinion, constitutes a violation of the GDPR or the Data Protection Act.
In addition, this subcontractor:
- appoints, where applicable, a data protection officer in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR;
- keep a register of the categories of processing carried out on behalf of the controller, in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR.
The controller undertakes to:
- not have any links of interest with the research laboratory or the design office and the purpose of the processing likely to constitute a conflict of interest;
- not seek to access the personal data made available to the research laboratory or the design office;
- not to use the results provided for one of the prohibited purposes. Title VI: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY
6.1. Formalities
Each controller appoints a data protection officer, pursuant to Article 37 of the GDPR. This data protection officer will in particular be responsible for monitoring compliance with the processing implemented according to this methodology.
Data controllers send the Commission a single commitment to comply with this methodology for all the processing operations they implement provided they are carried out in compliance with all the provisions of the methodology. A request for an opinion from the expert committee for studies in the field of health (CEREES) is not required.
In accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR, the data controller keeps up to date, within the register of processing activities, the list of processing operations implemented within the framework of this methodology.
6.2. Principle of transparency
The provision of data from the SNDS and its components is designed to account for their use to civil society. To this end, article L. 1461-3 of the CSP makes access to data from the SNDS and its components subject to the communication to the INDS of several elements by the data controller, before and after the study.
Thus, the data controller undertakes to register with the public directory kept by the INDS each study carried out within the framework of this reference methodology. This registration, to be carried out by the data controller or the person acting on his behalf, before the start of each study, is accompanied by the transmission to the INDS of a file comprising:
- the protocol, including the justification of the public interest, as well as a summary, according to the model made available by the INDS;
- in relation to the subject of the study, the declaration of interests of the data controller and that of the research laboratory or the design office, as provided for in article 5 of the decree of July 17, 2017 aforementioned.
At the end of the study, the method and the results obtained must be communicated to the INDS with a view to their publication in compliance with business secrecy and intellectual property.
The recording of the processing and the transmission of the results are carried out in accordance with the methods defined by the INDS.
6.3. External audits
The data controller undertakes to have an independent external audit carried out within it every three years from the commitment to comply with this reference methodology and then every three years after the first audit carried out, with a view to ensure compliance with the principles laid down by law, in particular compliance with prohibited purposes. The audit covers the purposes pursued and the use by the data controller of the results of the studies carried out.
The audit report is sent to the chairman of the SNDS audit committee provided for by the Data Protection Act. Title VII: ENTRY INTO FORCE
This reference methodology comes into force as of its publication in the Official Journal.
This deliberation will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.
