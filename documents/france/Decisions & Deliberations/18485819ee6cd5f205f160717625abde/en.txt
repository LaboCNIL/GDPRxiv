Finally, in general, the office wishes to raise the awareness of professionals in the sector about this difficulty while the number of complaints relating to the use of video surveillance is experiencing strong growth and thus reveals a growing concern of people. , the office of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties decides to make public decision no. 2018-024 of the Presidency notice from the CNIL giving formal notice to company X.
