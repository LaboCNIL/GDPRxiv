Legal bases of the processing17/ Each purpose of the processing must be based on one of the legal bases set by the regulations (article 6.1 of the GDPR). (see, for an explanation of the rule: The lawfulness of processing: the essentials of the legal bases provided for by the GDPR).18/ It is up to the data controller to determine the appropriate legal base(s) before any processing operation, after having carried out a reflection, which he can document, with regard to his specific situation and the context of implementation of the processing. Having an impact on the exercise of certain rights provided for by the GDPR, these legal bases are part of the information that must be brought to the attention of the persons concerned.19/ The table reproduced below aims to provide data controllers with assistance to identify the legal bases likely to be used in the most common cases.20/ These elements must be adapted to the specific situation of each organization concerned. Thus, for example, depending on whether the body in question is in the private or public sector, certain processing operations nevertheless serve the same purpose (for example, those linked to the instruction, management and, where applicable, the payment of aid optional) may be based on different legal bases (eg legitimate interest in the private sector, performance of a task in the public interest in the public sector). Please note: in the context of social and/or medico-social support, the Commission draws the attention of organizations to the need to exercise the greatest caution in the use of consent as a legal basis for their data processing. in particular with regard to the existing imbalance between the organizations and the persons concerned. In general, when this legal basis is retained, the data controller must ensure compliance with the conditions for obtaining consent and more particularly the free, specific, informed nature and unequivocal consent. In addition, it is recalled that the young adult or the legal representative of the minor who provides his consent may at any time withdraw it, ending the possibility of processing the data concerning him for the future.

Personal data concerned5.1. Principles of relevance and minimization of data21/ Under the principle of minimization of data, the data controller must ensure that only the data strictly necessary for the pursuit of the purposes of the processing are actually collected and processed.

The processing of the social security number (NIR), sensitive data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences23/ Certain categories of data call for increased vigilance due to their particularly sensitive nature. Benefiting from specific protection, they can only be collected and processed under conditions strictly defined by the texts. This is: the NIR, which is the subject of specific regulations and can only be recorded in the processing in the context of exchanges with health professionals or social security or provident organisations. In this respect, the Conseil d'Etat decree n° 2019-341 of April 19, 2019, taken after the opinion of the CNIL, determines the categories of data controllers and the purposes of this processing in view of which the latter may be implemented. implemented when they relate to data including the NIR (see also All about the NIR framework decree in the field of social protection); the national health identifier or INS (articles L. 1111-8-1 and R 1111-8-1 and following of the Public Health Code) which can only be used to list and find health data and administrative data relating to a person benefiting or called to benefit from health care or medico-social.

These data cannot be collected, except as provided for by the texts. PLEASE NOTE: Due to the extreme sensitivity of this data, the Commission points out that it must be collected and processed with the utmost care. They can only be collected if they are strictly necessary for social, socio-educational, medico-social and legal support and fall within the missions of the organization. In addition, their processing must be surrounded by guarantees: reinforced security measures, staff awareness of the processing of this data; strict clearance measures; impossibility of carrying out searches specifically on the basis of requests relating to this data, etc.Example n° 1: Data relating to health may be collected, provided that this data is collected for the purposes of: administering care, processing , medical diagnoses, preventive medicine or management of health services (article 44 of the Data Protection Act). The processing in which this data is integrated must be implemented by a member of a health profession or by another person on whom, by reason of his duties, the obligation of professional secrecy is imposed, the breach of which is repressed by article 226-13 of the penal code; or the delivery of a social benefit intended for the child/young adult/young parent(s)/future mother, provided for by a legislative or regulatory text, provided that this information is strictly necessary for the delivery of the said service (article 9.2.h of the GDPR) (e.g.: in the context of the delivery of home help, information relating to the applicant's health may be collected by the departmental council in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 222-1 et seq. of the CASF); or for examining applications and renewals of approvals for maternal and family assistants, in accordance with the provisions of Decree No. 2012-364 of 15 March 2012 relating to the reference system setting the criteria for the approval of childminders and decree no. 2014-918 of 18 August 2014 relating to the reference system setting the criteria for the approval of family assistants. When the collection of health-related data is necessary for the social support provided but does not fall within one of the three situations referred to above, this may exceptionally be provided after obtaining the consent of the young adult or the legal representative of the minor (p. ex. : a housekeeper or a social and family intervention technician can receive communication of a person's state of health when this information is necessary for the social support provided at home; the staff of a structure welcoming the minor or young adult can have knowledge of all useful information concerning the health of the child during his stay such as the medical treatments to be followed, the diseases contracted, the allergies, the possible health difficulties, precautions to take, vaccinations). In this respect, the data controller must ensure compliance with the conditions for obtaining consent and more particularly the free, specific, informed and unequivocal nature of the consent. Example no. 2: As part of the assessment of the situation of the minority, information revealing the alleged racial origin or ethnic origin or even the religious beliefs of the persons concerned may be collected by the departmental councils when this information is necessary for the social assessment carried out by the services of the ASE and, in particular, to the statement of reasons for leaving the country of origin, in accordance with the provisions of the decree of November 20, 2019 issued in application of article R.221-11 of the CASF relating to the methods of assessment people presenting themselves as minors and temporarily or permanently deprived of the protection of their family. t also be collected data relating to religious beliefs subject to (cumulative conditions): being collected from the young adult or the minor's legal representative, after obtaining express consent.

Example: In the context of social and medico-social support for minors or young adults, sensitive data, in particular religious beliefs (cf. example n° 3), or even data which reveals the alleged racial origin or ethnic origin are likely to be processed by the data controller. Consequently, if the legal basis of the processing is based on the legitimate interest or the mission of public interest, the specific consent of the legal representative or the young adult must be obtained in order to be able to process this information.25/ The table reproduced below provides illustrations of the data that the CNIL considers to be in principle adapted according to the purposes of the treatment.Data Categories

(non-exhaustive list): with regard to data processed by a person subject to professional secrecy, professionals and any member of staff who may or may not be part of the same care team and who do not practice within the same establishment, subject to the the latter case of obtaining the consent of the person concerned, in accordance with the provisions of article
L. 1110-4 of the CSP, who contribute to one or more of the aforementioned purposes; professionals and any staff member of an external establishment subject to professional secrecy and who implement the child protection policy defined in article L. 112-3 of the CASF or who provide it with their assistance, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 226-2-2 of the CASF; the partner structures which support young adults in their housing project and/or social reintegration (the national union of local committees for autonomous housing for young people, accommodation and social reintegration centres, etc.); the departmental observatory for child protection (ODPE) and the Observatory National Child Protection Agency (ONPE), under the conditions set by Decree No. 2016-1966 of 28 December 2016 organizing the transmission of information in anonymous form to the ODPEs and the ONPE; the services of the prefecture as soon as the Chairman of the Board departmental requests the assistance of the State in carrying out the procedure for evaluating the minority, in accordance with the provisions of article R. 211-11 of the CASF; the Ministry of Justice, in particular with regard to the transmission of the total number of minors temporarily or permanently deprived of the protection of their family, who have been entrusted to the president of the departmental council by court order and are present within the ASE on 31 December of the previous year or who will be subject to temporary emergency accommodation, in accordance with the provisions of article R. 221-14 of the CASF; the judicial authorities (eg. legal protection services for young people, etc.); organizations that instruct and pay social benefits; organizations that finance and manage them, exclusively concerning previously anonymized data, with the exception of those authorized by a legal provision or regulatory to obtain the communication of personal data of the persons supported.6.3. Processors34/ The GDPR defines the processor as the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.35/ It can be act, for example, IT service providers (hosting, maintenance, etc.) or any organization offering a service or provision involving the processing of personal data on behalf of another organization (e.g. .: the management of the payroll of employees or agents).36/ In this respect, the data controller who wishes to use a subcontractor must ensure that he only calls on organizations offering sufficient guarantees. A contract defining the characteristics of the processing as well as the various obligations of the parties in terms of data protection must be established between them (article 28 of the GDPR).37/ For more information, a guide for subcontractors, published by the CNIL , recalls these obligations and gives examples of clauses to be included in contracts.6.4. Authorized third parties38/ The legally authorized authorities are likely, within the framework of a particular mission or the exercise of a right of communication, to ask the data controller for the communication of personal data (e.g.: social security organizations in the context of the fight against fraud, the administration of justice, the police, the gendarmerie).39/ In this case, the data controller must ensure the binding nature of the provision on which the authority is based and only transmit the data provided for by the text or, if the latter does not list them, the only data essential with regard to the purpose of the right of communication in question.40/ For more information, the organization has the possibility of consulting the authorized third-party practical guide on the CNIL website.6.5. Transfers of personal data outside the European Union41/ To ensure the continuity of the protection of personal data, their transfer outside the European Union (EU) is subject to specific rules. Thus, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 44 and following of the GDPR, any transmission of data outside the EU must: be based on an adequacy decision; or be governed by internal corporate rules (BCR), standard clauses protection, a code of conduct or a certification mechanism approved by the CNIL; or be governed by ad hoc contractual clauses previously authorized by the CNIL; or comply with one of the derogations provided for in Article 49 of the GDPR.42 / To find out more, the organization can consult the section Transferring data outside the EU on the CNIL website.7. Data retention43/ A precise data retention period must be set according to each purpose; this data cannot be kept for an indefinite period.44/ The data retention period or, when it is impossible to set it, the criteria used to determine this period, are part of the information that must be communicated to the data subjects.45/ Under these conditions, it is the responsibility of the data controller to determine this duration before carrying out the processing.7.1 Storage periods46/ In principle, it is recommended that the data collected and processed for the purposes of the social and medico-social support for minors and young adults are not kept in the active database for more than two years from the last contact from the person who was the subject of this support (e.g.: last e-mail or letter sent by the data subject/their legal representative), unless otherwise provided by law or regulation or in a particular case. This retention period is that recommended by the Commission with regard to all of the purposes covered by the reference system, with the exception of processing for the purpose of: ensuring the assessment of the situation of the person concerned's minority; to manage the collection, processing and evaluation of worrying information relating to children in danger; to investigate and manage applications and renewals of authorization for maternal and family assistants.47/ The data may also be kept longer longer than the durations mentioned above, in intermediate archiving, in certain specific cases, in particular if the data controller has a legal obligation to do so (for example, to meet accounting, social or tax obligations) or if he has need to constitute evidence in the event of litigation and within the limit of the applicable limitation/foreclosure period, in matters of discrimination for example. The duration of the intermediate archiving must however respond to a real need, duly justified by the data controller after a preliminary analysis of various factors, in particular the context, the nature of the data processed and the level of risk of a possible dispute. 48/ When the data pass from the active base to the intermediate archiving base, they must no longer be consultable by all the operational staff initially provided for but only by specially authorized persons, having an interest in knowing about it because of their functions ( for example, the service in charge of litigation).49/ At the end of these periods, the data is destroyed in a secure manner or archived under conditions defined in accordance with the provisions of the heritage code relating to the obligations of archiving of public sector information for bodies subject to these provisions on the one hand, or in accordance with the provisions of the deliberati on of the CNIL adopting a recommendation concerning the methods of electronic archiving of personal data for organizations in the private sector, on the other hand.50/ In the public sector (for public structures and for organizations entrusted with a public service mission), the CNIL recommends contacting the territorially competent departmental archives service (for decentralized services and local authorities and their groupings) or the archives mission of the supervising ministry (for central administration departments) which can provide information on the obligations applicable to the data controller and guide him in their implementation (determination of the duration of administrative usefulness and the final fate).51/ The following table contains examples for which the retention period is in principle adequate with regard to the texts or considered as such by the Commission (non-exhaustive list):
Processing activities
active base
Intermediate archiving
Reference textsInstruction and management of the assessment of the situation of minority
The time of the evaluation of the situation of minority
Once the person concerned has been recognized as an unaccompanied minor, the data necessary for their care and social support will be kept for a maximum of two years on an active basis by the ASE services (ref. retention period recommended by the CNIL in the context of social and medico-social support for minors and young adults).
The data used for the evaluation of young people who have not been considered as unaccompanied minors will be kept until the extinction of ordinary and extraordinary remedies
No legislative/regulatory provision governs these retention periods. Also, it is a recommendation of the Commission (not to be confused with the provisions of article R. 221-15-6 of the CASF which governs the retention periods concerning the processing of personal data entitled support to the evaluation of the minority implemented by the Ministry of the Interior). Management of the collection, processing and evaluation of worrying information relating to children in danger
All data entered, including financial aid: two years from the last transaction recorded or the last social measure decided, for all data entered, including financial aid
For transmission to the ONPE and the ODPEs: fifteen months longer than the duration previously indicated (transmission no later than April 30 of the year following the calendar year during which the measures or services were implemented , renewed or terminated.)
When there is an appeal against a third party or a dispute, the data is kept until the intervention of the final decision.
At the end of these periods, the data is destroyed in a secure manner or archived under conditions defined in accordance with the provisions of the Heritage Code relating to the obligations of archiving public sector information for the organizations subject to these provisions, d on the one hand, or in accordance with the provisions of the deliberation of the CNIL adopting a recommendation concerning the methods of electronic archiving of personal data for organizations in the private sector, on the other hand.
Provisions of circular AD 98-6 of July 6, 1998 relating to the processing of archives produced in the context of social assistance for minors and decree no. 2016-1966 of December 28, 2016 organizing the transmission of information in anonymous form to the ODPE and the ONPE.
Information relating to children benefiting from educational actions in an open environment: five years from the last operation recorded or the last social measure decided

For transmission to the ONPE and the ODPEs: fifteen months longer than the duration previously indicated (transmission no later than April 30 of the year following the calendar year during which the measures or services were implemented , renewed or terminated). Examination and management of requests and renewals of approvals for maternal and family assistants
The data is kept on an active basis for the duration of the management of requests and renewals of approval of maternal and family assistants, with the exception of data relating to offenses (excerpt from bulletin no. 2 of the criminal record) which should only be kept in an active database for a maximum of three months and then be securely deleted.
The data is then kept in intermediate archiving for ten years (the duration of the approval is five years and five more years from the date of the cessation of activity of the maternal or family assistant).
Regarding refused approvals: five years from the closing of the file.
Provisions of circular AD 98-6 of July 6, 1998 relating to the processing of archives produced within the framework of social assistance for minors. 7.2 Retention of anonymized data 52/ Regulations relating to the protection of personal data does not apply, in particular with regard to retention periods, to anonymized data. These are data which can no longer, by anyone, be related to the natural person to whom they relate.53/ Anonymization must be distinguished from pseudonymization for which it is technically possible to find the identity of the data subject through third-party data. In fact, the pseudonymization operation is reversible, unlike anonymization, which is based on an irreversible process.54/ Thus, the data controller can keep the anonymized data indefinitely. In this case, the organization concerned must guarantee the anonymized nature of the data in a permanent way.55/ To find out more, the organization can consult the following CNIL guides: Security: Secure archiving; data retention;Practical guide: retention periods.Anonymization is a processing operation that consists of using a set of techniques in such a way as to make it impossible, in practice, to identify or re-identify the person by any means whatsoever and this irreversibly. Also, once anonymized, the data can no longer be linked to a person (For more information, you can refer to the guidelines on anonymization).8. Information to individuals56/ Processing of personal data must be implemented in complete transparency vis-à-vis the individuals concerned.8.1 Content of the information to be provided57/ Information communicated to individuals must be provided under the conditions provided by articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.58/ From the stage of the collection of personal data, the persons concerned must in particular be informed of the existence of the processing, of its essential characteristics (including the identity of the person in charge processing and the objective pursued) and the rights they have.59/ Examples of information notices are available on the CNIL website and can be consulted in the GDPR section: examples of information notices .8.2 The methods of information60/ In order to fully comply with the principles of fairness and transparency and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, individuals must first ncipe to be directly informed at the time the data is collected.61/ If the GDPR does not impose any specific form, written information must be preferred, so as to be able to justify its content, as well as the time when it was issued. 62/ As part of the social and medico-social support of individuals, the data controller informs minors and young adults and, where applicable, their legal representatives by any appropriate means (p. ex. : mentions of information inserted in the welcome booklet of the establishment/home, of the CJM, of the employment contract, of the project for children, of the forms for applying for social benefits, of letters addressed to users), in an understandable language and according to methods appropriate and adapted to the age of minors or young adults (e.g.: pictogram, orally, playful images, drawings, simplified texts, translation into the language of the country of origin for UAMs) in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the GDPR. In general, the Commission recommends oral information in addition to written information in order to ensure that the person concerned fully understands the information communicated.63/ Children must be informed in clear and simple terms that they can easily understand.Caution:With regard to the information of the parents or holders of parental authority in the context of the collection of worrying information, the Commission recalls that it is in the best interests of the child not to provide systematic information to parents or persons exercising parental authority or any person concerned, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 226-2-1 of the CASF. In concrete terms, the CRIP will decide to communicate information to the legal representatives of a child after a period allowing the contact of the social service concerned to be made in order to ensure that this communication will not harm the child. In addition, the professional may dispense with obtaining the consent of the person or persons having parental authority over the medical decisions to be taken when preventive action, screening, diagnosis, treatment or intervention is necessary to safeguard the health of a minor, in the event that the latter expressly opposes consultation of the holder or holders of parental authority in order to keep his state of health secret. However, the healthcare professional must first endeavor to obtain the consent of the minor to this consultation. In the case where the minor maintains his opposition, the doctor or midwife can implement preventive action, screening, diagnosis, treatment or intervention. In this case, the minor is accompanied by an adult of his choice (article L. 1111-5 of the CSP).9. Rights of persons64/ The persons concerned have the following rights, which they exercise under the conditions provided for by the GDPR (to go further, see the section entitled Understanding my rights on the CNIL website): the right to access allows the data subject to know whether data concerning him or her are processed by the data controller and, in this case, to obtain details of the conditions of this processing and, at his request, to obtain a copy of the data concerning him held by this person in charge; the right of rectification allows the person concerned to request the rectification of inaccurate or incomplete information concerning him; the right to erasure allows the person concerned to request the erasure of data concerning him subject to the conditions for exercising this right pursuant to the provisions of Article 17 of the GDPR (e.g.: the data is erased by the data controller to comply with the terms retention periods set by legislative or regulatory texts; the person has withdrawn the consent on which the processing is based); the right to limit processing (for example, when the person disputes the accuracy of their data, they can ask the organization to temporarily freeze the processing of their their data, while the latter carries out the necessary checks); the right to portability, under the conditions provided for by the GDPR, offers the person concerned the possibility of directly recovering part of the data concerning them in an open format and machine-readable in order to reuse them for personal purposes or to transmit them to another professional. This right only applies if the following three conditions are met: limitation to personal data provided by the person concerned; application only if the data is processed automatically (excluding paper files) and on the basis of the prior consent of the data subject or the performance of a contract concluded with the data subject; respect for the rights and freedoms of any third parties; the right to object to the processing of data concerning them, subject to the conditions for exercising this right provided for in Article 21 of the GDPR (if the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, the person cannot oppose the processing of their personal data). concerned may oppose the processing of his data, provided that he invokes reasons relating to his particular situation, and only when the processing is implemented on the legal basis of the legitimate interest of the data controller or for the performance of a mission in the public interest or of a mission relating to the exercise of public authority (e.g.: the data controller may refuse the data subject to exercise his right of opposition as soon as when the processing of information concerning her is part of the investigation and management of applications and renewals of approval of maternal and family assistants). The controller may refuse to respond to this request for opposition if he demonstrates that he has legitimate and compelling interests which prevail over the rights and freedoms of the applicant. Caution: When the minor wishes to remain silent about his state of health, the doctor may dispense with obtaining the consent of the parents or holders of parental authority if the minor expressly opposes this consultation in order to keep his state of health secret. The doctor must then endeavor to obtain the consent of the minor to this consultation. If the refusal persists, the doctor may implement preventive action, screening, diagnosis, treatment or intervention, on the condition that the minor is accompanied by an adult of his choice, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 1111-5 of the CSP.65/ The controller must respond to requests received as soon as possible and within a maximum of one month. If additional time is necessary to process the request (for example, due to its complexity), the data subject must be informed within this same period of one month. In all cases, a response must be provided within a period that may not exceed three months.66/ The exercise of rights by individuals must be facilitated by the data controller and be free of charge. The persons concerned must be informed of their possibility of lodging a complaint with the National Commission for Computing and Liberties if they are not satisfied with the processing of their personal data. Security67/ The organization must take all useful precautions with regard to the risks presented by its processing to preserve the security of personal data and, in particular at the time of their collection, during their transmission and their storage, to prevent them from being distorted. , damaged or that unauthorized third parties have access to it.68/ In particular, in the specific context of this reference system, the organization is invited to implement the following measures, or to be able to justify the implementation equivalent measures or their lack of necessity or possibility (individuals processing a small volume of data take, for example, basic security measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data they process):

Relations with service providers who process data in the name and on behalf of the data controller (the employing body) must be the subject of a written agreement.
This agreement must contain one or more specific clauses relating to the respective obligations of the parties resulting from the processing of personal data.
The agreement must in particular provide for the conditions for the restitution and destruction of the data. It is the responsibility of the data controller to ensure the effectiveness of the guarantees provided (security audits, visits, etc.).
For more details, you can refer to the subcontracting guide and the examples of subcontracting clauses. Securing exchanges with other organizations
Do not transmit files containing the personal data of users in clear via general public messaging.
Favor means of communication other than general public messaging to communicate information relating to the people accompanied to other social workers or organizations (e.g.: secure exchange platforms, internal messaging)

Strictly regulate free comment areas
Test on fictitious or anonymized dataUse cryptographic functions
Use recognized algorithms, software and libraries
Keep secrets and cryptographic keys securely69/ To do this, the data controller can usefully refer to the Personal Data Security Guide. It should be noted that the implementation of a system for managing the authorizations of software users makes it possible to limit access to only the data that is strictly necessary for them. Thus, differentiated levels of authorization must be created according to the needs of users to fulfill their missions. In addition, a trace and incident management system makes it possible to identify fraudulent access or misuse of personal data or to determine the origin of an accident. The data controller will thus be in a better position to be able to react to a data breach. Caution: In the event of the hosting of personal health data carried out on behalf of organizations providing social or medico-social monitoring by a service provider IT, it must be approved or certified for the hosting, storage, preservation of health data, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 1111-8 of the Public Health Code.11. Data protection impact assessment (DPIA) 70/ Processing for the purpose of social and medico-social support for individuals is included in the list of types of processing operations for which a DPIA is required: they must therefore systematically give rise to the prior completion of a DPIA.71/ This reference system constitutes an aid to the completion of a DPIA. In this respect, it is based on two pillars: the fundamental principles and rights set out in particular by the GDPR and the Data Protection Act and which must be respected regardless of the nature, gravity and likelihood of the risks incurred; the management risks to privacy, which makes it possible to determine the appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data. To carry out an impact study, the data controller may also rely on: - the principles contained in this reference system; - as well as on the methodological tools offered by the CNIL on its website. If the organization has appointed one, the DPD/DPO must be consulted. the CNIL prior to the implementation of the processing if the impact analysis indicates that it fails to identify sufficient measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.
