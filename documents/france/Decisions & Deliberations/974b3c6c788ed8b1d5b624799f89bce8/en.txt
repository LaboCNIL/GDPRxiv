Article 12 of the law of July 24, 2019 relating to the organization and transformation of the health system modified article L. 2223-42 of the general code of local authorities in order to to allow students in the course of 3rd cycle of medical studies, retired doctors and practitioners with a foreign diploma outside the European Union authorized to pursue a course of consolidation of skills in medicine, to establish death certificates. The draft decree of which the Commission is seized modifies Articles R. 2213-1-1 to R. 2213-1-5 and Article R. 2213-1-7 of the General Code of Local Authorities.
Its main purpose is to specify the conditions under which retired doctors, students and doctors with a foreign diploma from outside the European Union can draw up a death certificate. With regard to retired doctors, the committee notes that the draft article R.2213-1-2 of the general code of local authorities provides in particular that the departmental council of the College of Physicians ensures the capacities and updates the list of voluntary retired doctors. The Commission recalls, in the absence of specific elements other than the mention of the recipients of the information, that this list constitutes a processing of personal data, the implementation of which must therefore take place in accordance with the provisions of the general regulations on data protection and the Data Protection Act. Moreover, as it had already pointed out with regard to doctors, in its deliberation n°2017-067 of March 16, 2017 providing an opinion on a draft decree relating to the death certificate amending the general code of local authorities, the Commission notes that the draft text does not refer either to the traceability of access by doctors and students to the forms making up the death certificate, or to a policy of management of authorizations. The other provisions of the draft do not call for comment. The President Marie-Laure DENIS
