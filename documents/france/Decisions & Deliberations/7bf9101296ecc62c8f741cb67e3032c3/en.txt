Data controllers must implement all appropriate measures (technical and organizational) to guarantee the protection of the personal data processed, both from the design of the processing and by default. They must also demonstrate this compliance throughout the life of the treatments. The processing of personal data implemented within the framework of this standard must also be recorded in the register of processing activities provided for in article 30.1 of the GDPR.3.5. The principles set out by the CNIL, in this reference document, constitute an aid to carrying out the impact analysis relating to data protection (AIPD) that the data controllers concerned must carry out (article 14 of this reference document). Data controllers will thus be able to define the measures allowing them to ensure the proportionality and necessity of their processing, to guarantee the rights of individuals and to control the risks presented by their processing.4. Controllers and processors4.1. In the context of this standard, the organization or establishment within which the collection of personal data is ensured, acts as a subcontractor for the collection and transmission of personal data to the controller. These establishments and, where applicable, the health professionals involved in the care of the patient remain responsible for the processing for which they define the purposes and means, in particular for the purposes of keeping and managing medical records.4.2. Is also qualified as a subcontractor, any organization involved in the processing and meeting the definition of article 1.5 of these standards, in particular the supplier of an electronic platform for entering personal data relating to the follow-up of the patient treated by a medicinal product with compassionate access authorization.4.3. In the event of recourse to a subcontractor, the service must be carried out under the conditions provided for in Article 28 of the GDPR. A subcontracting contract must be concluded between the service provider and the data controller. This contract must in particular: specify the distribution of responsibilities relating to security measures and the management of data breaches between the various actors; provide for the conditions for the restitution and destruction of data; provide the procedures for the data controller to ensure the effectiveness of the guarantees provided (security audits, visits, etc.); specify the terms and conditions under which the subcontractor helps, as far as possible, the data controller to fulfill his obligation to follow up to requests to exercise the rights of data subjects.4.4. Each subcontractor must keep a record of the processing activities carried out on behalf of a data controller under the conditions of article 30.2 of the GDPR.4.5. In the event that the data controller uses the services of a subcontractor for the hosting, storage or retention of health data, this subcontractor must be an approved or certified health data host according to the provisions of CSP.5.

Accounts shared between several users are to be avoided.SEC-AUT-2Set up user authenticationThe data controller sets up strong multi-factor authentication involving at least two distinct authentication factors for all users and administrators, for example by using an identifier coupled with a password and a one-time password generated via a cryptographic protocol. Authentication of healthcare professionals, in the event that data collection is carried out by means of an interface allowing the electronic entry of data, is provided by the dematerialized service provided for in II of article R. 5121-74-5 of the CSP. In any case, this authentication must comply with the requirements of the PGSSI-S, in its section relating to the electronic identification of actors in the health, medico-social and social sectors, applicable to natural persons.SEC-AUT-3 Adopt a user password policy that complies with the recommendations of the CNIL of a recommendation relating to passwords and other shared secrets, and repealing deliberation n° 2017-190 of June 22, 2017, or any other subsequent update of this recommendation.SEC-AUT-4Require the user to change his password after resetThe user must change any password assigned by an administrator or automatically by the system during account creation or a reset.SEC-AUT-5Limit the number of attempts to access an accountThe data controller must provide for a limit on the number of attempts to access any electronic platform used to collect the data processed in the context of processing governed by this standard and set up a temporary blocking of access when the limit is reached.Manage authorizationsSEC-HAB-1Define authorization profilesDifferent authorization profiles must be provided in order to manage access to data as needed and exclusively, for a fixed and limited period.A granularity of access to data must be provided for each type of profile, for example access only to aggregated data, access to pseudonymised data or access to directly identifying data. Access to health data should also be distinguished from access to other data. Privileged access with extended rights, in particular for administration and maintenance, must be reserved for a restricted team and be limited to what is strictly necessary.SEC- HAB-2Remove obsolete access permissionsAccess permissions must be withdrawn as soon as authorizations are withdrawn, for example after the departure of an employee.SEC-HAB-3Perform an annual review of authorizationsA review of authorizations must be carried out regularly and at least annually.Secure exchanges with other bodiesSEC-ÉCH-1Secure the collection of information via an electronic platformIf the collection of personal data is done in electronic format using a dedicated platform, the person in charge of processing provides for the data to be sent in encrypted form: either by directly encrypting the data; or by using an encrypted communication channel (via protocols such as HTTPS, SFTP). In all cases, the encryption algorithms used must meet the SEC-CRY-1 requirements. The confidentiality of secrets (encryption key, password, etc.) must be ensured by transmitting them via a separate communication channel (for example, deposit of the encrypted file on the platform and communication of the password by telephone or SMS). SEC-ÉCH-2Secure transmissions by e-mailAs regards data transmissions by e-mail, these must be secured, for example by encrypting personal data using an asymmetric encryption algorithm with a private key held solely by the recipient of the data. The confidentiality of the secrets (encryption key, password, etc.) must be ensured by transmitting them via a separate channel (for example, sending the encrypted file by email and communicating the password by telephone or SMS). When transmitting by e-mail, the sender must ensure that it is the correct recipient, in order to prevent personal data from being accidentally disclosed to an unauthorized third party.SEC-ÉCH-3Secure the sending by fax If the paper format is used and transmissions are made by fax, the following security measures must be implemented: The fax must be located in a physically controlled room and accessible only to authorized personnel; The printing of messages must be subject to the introduction of a personal access code; When messages are sent, the fax machine must display the identity of the recipient fax machine in order to be sure of the recipient's identity; fax addresses must pre-register, as far as possible, the potential recipients in order to avoid any recipient error. , including those listed in the requirements SEC-EXH-1, SEC-EXH-2 and SEC-EXH-3, in order to transmit the summary reports to the competent authorities. The use of a secure electronic document exchange platform is preferred. Use cryptographic functions SEC-CRY-1 Use recognized algorithms, software and libraries Personal data must be encrypted at rest by algorithms and file sizes key compliant with appendix B1 of the general security reference system (“RGS”). An operational key management procedure must be formalized. The backups of this data must also be encrypted in accordance with Annex B1 of the RGS. All data transmissions are carried out via encrypted communication channels and ensuring source and recipient authentication (HTTPS type, with the most up-to-date version of TLS possible). SEC-CRY-2Keep secrets and cryptographic keys securelyThese secrets must be protected, at least by the implementation of restrictive access rights and a secure password.Trace accessSEC-JOU-1Provide a system logging (logs)User actions must be the subject of logging measures, in particular, at a minimum, user accesses, the timestamp of their accesses as well as the details of the actions carried out (such as read or write operations). writing) as well as the reference of the record concerned.Logging traces must be kept for a period of between six months and one year.SEC-JOU-2Inform users of the implementation of the logging systemUsers participating in processing covered by this standard must be informed of the implementation of the logging system, the nature of the data collected and the retention period of these traces.SEC-JOU-3Protect logging equipment and logged informationThe architecture of logging must be centralized and the logs must be subject to special protection measures. Access to the logs is restricted to only those who have obtained specific authorization based on strict necessity. SEC-JOU-4 Checking the traces Automatic or semi-automatic control - automatic traces must be carried out regularly and at least every two months, in order to detect any anomalies. Manage incidents and data breaches SEC-VIO-1 Provide procedures for security incidents A security incident management policy is implemented in order to respond immediately to any possible security incident and to identify whether the incident leads to a breach of the personal data processed by the data controller. The policy provides in particular for a procedure aimed at implementing actions remediation to reduce the severity of the harm to a person affected by the data breach and to correct the vulnerabilities caused by security incidents.SEC-VIO-2Provide procedures for personal data breach notificationsThe data controller provides a procedure to determine the seriousness of a data breach (i.e. any breach, even temporary, of the confidentiality, availability or integrity of the data) for the persons concerned .If necessary, if there is a risk for the persons concerned, the data controller must notify the violation to the authority in charge of the protection of personal data competent in the territory in which the data controller has its main establishment and, in the event that the data controller is not established on the territory of the European Union, at the CNIL under the conditions provided for in article 33 of the GDPR. If this risk is considered high, the controller must communicate the breach to the persons concerned under the conditions provided for in Article 34 of the GDPR. The controller must internally document any data breach regardless of its level of seriousness. business continuitySEC-SAU-1Perform frequent backups of dataWhether the data is in paper or electronic form, full backups must be scheduled at regular intervals. The process of restoring data from backups should also be tested regularly.SEC-SAU-2Store backup media in a safe placeBackup media (external hard drive, USB key, etc.) should be kept in a safe place different from the place where the data is stored. The media to be favored are those with sufficient longevity.SEC-SAU-3Provide security means for the transport of backupsWhen backups are transmitted by the network, it is advisable to encrypt the backup transmission channel when they are transmitted via a public network.SEC-SAU-4Regularly plan and test business continuityThe data controller provides an IT business recovery and continuity plan, even a summary one. He must ensure that users and subcontractors know who to contact in the event of an incident. This continuity or disaster recovery plan as well as the restoration of backups must be regularly tested.

To carry out and document its impact analysis, the data controller may refer to: the principles contained in this reference system; the methodological tools offered by the CNIL on its website.14.3. If necessary, the data controller may draw up a procedure relating to the DPIA allowing the involvement of the relevant actors and persons for its implementation, in particular the data protection officer (DPD/DPO), who must be consulted. 14.4. The DPIA will have to be reviewed and updated regularly, in particular if significant changes are planned in the processing or if the risks for the data subjects have evolved (such as the pursuit of an additional purpose, the use of a new processor , new data collected, data leak allowing re-identification, etc.).14.5. In accordance with Article 36 of the GDPR, the data controller must consult the CNIL prior to the implementation of the processing if, following the impact analysis, he is unable to identify and set up sufficient measures to reduce the risks to an acceptable level (residual risk remaining too high).________________________________________________________(1) See deliberation no. 2019-057 of May 9, 2019 adopting a reference system relating to the processing of personal data implemented works for health vigilance management purposes.(2) Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR.(3) Recommendations 01/2020 on measures which complement the transfer instruments intended to ensure compliance with the EU level of protection of personal data.(4) The use of the derogations referred to in Article 49 should be limited to specific situations.
