The office met for this purpose on January 20, 2020. After deliberation, the office considers that the publication of the formal notice is justified by the nature of the breach of the GDPR, the number of people concerned and the characteristics of the processing implemented. Indeed, failing to specifically collect the consent of people for the display of their data on a daily basis and the more complete and detailed display of data on a half-hour basis, the company does not validly collect the consent of the persons concerned. The publicity of the formal notice also appears necessary in order to remind the organization of its obligations and make customers aware of the rights they have ent, in particular that of choosing the way in which the data from their meter will be processed. The office considers that it is essential that customers can keep control of such data, which can reveal information about their and sleeping, periods of absence, possibly the number of people present in the accommodation).In addition, the number of customers concerned is particularly high since the distribution network operator plans to install 35 million here 2021. In this respect, the office considers that due to the number of people concerned, the publicity of the formal notice would make it possible to inform all the customers but also the potential prospects of company x of the existence of these shortcomings and the measures that the company is asked to take to remedy them. Consequently, the office of the National Commission for Computing and Freedoms decides to make publishes decision No. MED-2019-036 of the President of the CNIL giving formal notice to company X. The office recalls that this formal notice is not in the nature of a sanction. As such, no follow-up will be given to the procedure if the organization concerned complies in all respects with the requirements of the formal notice within the time limit. If this is the case, it will be closed, which will also be made public. President Marie-Laure DENIS
