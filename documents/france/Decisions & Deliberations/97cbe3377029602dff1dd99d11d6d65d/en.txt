After hearing the observations of Mrs. Nacima BELKACEM, Government Commissioner,
Makes the following observations:
Article 35.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides that a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out when processing is likely to create a high risk for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.
Article 35.3 of the GDPR sets out three types of processing that may present a high risk. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has itself identified nine criteria for characterizing processing likely to create a high risk.
Article 35.4 of the GDPR requires supervisory authorities to draw up and publish a list of the types of processing operations for which a data protection impact assessment is required.
Article 35.6 of the GDPR provides that, when this list concerns processing activities linked to the offer of goods or services to data subjects or the monitoring of their behavior in several Member States, or which may significantly affect the free movement of personal data within the Union, it must be subject to the consistency check mechanism and must be communicated to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).
On 14 June 2018, a draft list was adopted by the committee and submitted to the EDPS on 6 July 2018. The EDPS adopted an opinion on this draft on 25 September 2018, which was notified to the committee on 2 October 2018 .
Decided :
The adoption of the list annexed to this deliberation relating to the types of processing operations for which a data protection impact assessment is required.
This list is not exhaustive. In accordance with Article 35.1 of the GDPR, a DPIA must be carried out when the processing is likely to create a high risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
This list is based on the EDPS guidelines relating to the impact assessment relating to data protection (DPIA) which it completes and clarifies for specific processing operations.
This deliberation will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.
