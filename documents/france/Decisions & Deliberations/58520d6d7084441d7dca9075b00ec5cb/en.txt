On the proposal of Mrs Valérie PEUGEOT, commissioner, and after having heard the observations of Mrs Nacima BELKACEM, government commissioner,
Gives the following opinion:
The draft decree submitted for the opinion of the Commission (hereafter the draft) is intended to define the conditions of application of article L. 1453-1 of the CSP concerning the links of interest between companies producing or marketing health products for human use and persons who, in the media or on social networks, present one or more health products in such a way as to influence the public. As such, the draft defines the nature of the information that must be made public on the Transparency Health website with regard to these influencers in order to take into account the legislative changes resulting from the law of July 24, 2019.
Pursuant to these new provisions, the aforementioned companies are required to make public the existence of the agreements they conclude with these persons. These companies will also have to make public, beyond a threshold set by the decree whose modification is envisaged, the remuneration paid and the advantages granted to them.
On the scope of Article L. 1453-1 of the CSP:
Article L. 1453-1 of the CSP states that: Companies producing or marketing the products mentioned in II of Article L. 5311-1 with the exception of those mentioned in 14°, 15° and 17° or ensuring services associated with these products are required to make public, on a single public website, the precise object, the date, the direct beneficiary and the final beneficiary, and the amount of the agreements they conclude with: (…)
7° bis Persons who, in the media or on social networks, present one or more health products in such a way as to influence the public;
Article 1 of the draft specifies the information that must be made public by these companies for past agreements when it is an influencer within the meaning of 7° bis of I of article L. 1453-1 of the CSP .
The Commission therefore notes that the decree summarizes the definition laid down by law by the term "influencer", of which it thus endorses the legal definition.
On the nature of the information made public:
Article 1 of the draft text provides for supplementing Article R. 1453-3 of the CSP by specifying the nature of the influencer's identification data which must be made public when companies producing or marketing health products for human use enter into agreements, pay remuneration and benefits to them.
The draft article R. 1453-3 of the CSP provides that, in addition to the identity of the company including its corporate name, its corporate purpose and the address of the registered office, the name under which the influencer exercises his activity of influence. Added to this is the date of signature of the agreement, its expiry date, its precise purpose and its total amount as well as the nature and amount of the benefits in kind and compensation granted.
Insofar as the identification data published, with regard to health professionals and students, who are natural persons, are in particular the surname, first name, professional address or, for students, that of the establishment of education or organization and, where applicable, the personal identifier in the shared directory of health professionals, the Commission wonders about the scope of the notion of name with regard to influencers, which would be the only data of identification made public concerning them.
She also wonders about the use of the term denomination, more commonly used to designate an element of a trademark, within the meaning of the provisions of Article L. 711-1 of the Intellectual Property Code or to designate a moral person.
It recommends, insofar as the information which seems to have to be made public could be similar to a pseudonym within the meaning of the provisions of Article L. 113-6 of the Intellectual Property Code, that particular vigilance be given the maintenance of the confidentiality of the data allowing the direct identification of the persons concerned, in particular when the latter do not carry out their activity under their civil identity.
The other articles of the draft decree do not, as they stand and with regard to the amended law of 6 January 1978, call for any further observations by the Commission.
For the President:
Deputy Vice-President,
S. Lambremon
