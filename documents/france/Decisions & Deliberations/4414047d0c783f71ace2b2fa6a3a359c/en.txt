By letter dated February 2, 2021, the chairman of the Restricted Committee asked the company for additional information, in particular concerning the procedures for the retention by the company of data relating to its customers. The company responded to this request on April 7, 2021 and then supplemented its response with additional mailings on December 16, 2021 and February 2, 2022.II.Reasons for the decisionA.On the measures taken in connection with data minimizationThe restricted committee is concerned that the responses and supporting documents provided by the company show that it has ceased to record, for the purposes of training its employees, all the telephone calls received by the employees of its customer service department and that it has reduced by substantially the proportion of the recordings it carries out. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the company has complied with this aspect of the injunction. B. On the measures taken in connection with the retention of data Firstly, if concerning the management of employee access to the personal data necessary for the performance of their duties, it appears from the answers and supporting documents provided by the company that only the three people, whose functions within the company justify it, now have access to the data (for example, to carry out research and analyzes in the event of fraud, complaint or judicial requisition). The Restricted Committee considers that these measures satisfy this part of the injunction.Secondly, with regard to the retention of data for prospecting purposes, the Restricted Committee notes that in its response to the injunction, the company indicated that it had changed the starting point from which the period allowing to determine the inactivity of a prospect was calculated, to no longer take into account the simple opening of an email but for example the last order or the last connection to the account. In addition, the company has justified having deleted the data which was retained pursuant to its former retention period policy. The Restricted Committee considers that, under these conditions, the appropriate measures have been put in place to comply with the injunction and it observes that keeping prospects' data for three years from these identified starting points to calculate the duration of inactivity of prospects is not excessive within the meaning of Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR.Thirdly, with regard to the retention of data beyond a period of three years from the inactivity of the users in a form that no longer allows the identification of the persons to whom they relate, the Restricted Committee notes that during the investigation of the follow-up to the injunction, the company gradually changed the storage methods envisaged so that the stored data no longer made it possible to re-identify the s people. In this sense, the company has in particular: reduced the number of fields kept in its database; stopped keeping the internal identifier assigned to each customer; divided the data kept into three separate tables, in which the data relating to a same person are paid at different times, so that it is not possible to make the link between the data relating to the same person between the three tables. The Restricted Committee considers that the measures taken by the company are such as to no longer allow people to be re-identified. Finally, with regard to keeping the email addresses and passwords of former customers in hashed form in order to allow them to reconnect to their account, the company indicated stop offering this functionality and therefore end the retention of this information for this purpose. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers the company has satisfied this section of the injunction.C.On the measures taken with regard to the information of personsIn the first place, with regard to the information of employees regarding the recording of telephone calls, it appears from the answers and supporting documents provided by the company that the latter has had each of its employees sign an information note, containing all the information referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR.Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company has completed the confidentiality policy accessible on its website in order to include a description of the legal bases on which its processing is based. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the company has complied with this aspect of the injunction. D. On the measures taken in link with the security of the processingThe company has produced supporting documents from which it appears that the passwords allowing access to customer accounts must now be composed of at least 8 characters, including at least minus one lowercase, uppercase, number or special character. It explains that it also implemented a measure to delay access to accounts. The Restricted Committee considers that these measures satisfy this part of the injunction. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that Company X has satisfied all of of the injunction. This decision will be made public as was deliberation no. SAN 2020-003 of July 28, 2020. FOR THESE REASONS there is no need to liquidate the penalty; to make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, its deliberation, which will no longer identify company X by name as of August 5, 2022.
