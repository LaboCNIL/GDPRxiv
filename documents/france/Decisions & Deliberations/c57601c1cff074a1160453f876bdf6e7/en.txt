Who is this reference for? This reference is intended for the certifying bodies mentioned in article 8 of the Data Protection Act who wish to obtain an authorization allowing them to certify according to the criteria of a certification mechanism approved under Article 42 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).2. Scope of the standard This standard sets the requirements that the certifying body must meet in order to obtain and then maintain its approval. It constitutes the general framework applicable for certification according to the certification mechanisms approved under Article 42 of the GDPR when t has been decided, in accordance with the cooperation agreement concluded between the CNIL and the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC), that the latter proceed with the approval of certification bodies. In this case, the accreditation issued by COFRAC takes the place of approval within the meaning of Article 43 of the GDPR. This general framework can be supplemented by application procedures specific to a certification mechanism. In this case, rules specific to the implementation of the certification mechanism specify the requirements of this reference system for the evaluation of certification bodies. This reference system is not applicable when the CNIL decides to carry out all or part of the approval of certifying bodies.3. Accreditation methods The candidate certification body submits an accreditation application file to COFRAC. This file specifies the scope of its accreditation application by indicating the certification mechanism approved under Article 42 of the GDPR for which it wishes to issue certifications. During the transitional period between submitting its file and obtaining accreditation, the certification body is authorized to begin its certification activity provided it has received a favorable response from COFRAC following the review of its application for accreditation, called operational admissibility in accordance with the COFRAC accreditation regulations. This transitional period cannot exceed 12 months: the certification body has a period of 12 months from the date of the favorable response from COFRAC to obtain accreditation. The cooperation agreement signed on May 20, 2020 between the CNIL and COFRAC sets out the roles, responsibilities and operational procedures related to the accreditation of certification bodies for approved certification mechanisms under Article 42 of the GDPR.4. Duration of approval The duration of approval is that of the accreditation issued by COFRAC.5. Obligations of the certification body To obtain its accreditation, the certification body must: (1) Be able to demonstrate to COFRAC its compliance with the requirements defined in part 6 of this reference system; (2) Establish a procedure to investigate and respond, in writing and as soon as possible, to any request for information from the CNIL concerning the provision of aggregated data relating to the certification activity (statistics) or data relating to compliance with the requirements of this reference system , in particular for the requirements relating to the handling of complaints and appeals in connection with the certification activity.
He must inform COFRAC:(3) If he is the subject, or has been the subject, of an inspection, a sanction decision and/or recent corrective measures pronounced by the CNIL or by another competent supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR;(4) Any other binding decision which could constitute non-compliance with this standard, including the decisions of competent judicial authorities;(5) In the event of significant changes in its status legal or any other situation affecting its activity which would be likely to call into question its compliance with this standard;(6) Other changes before their implementation when the certification mechanism introduces new rules which substantially modify the conditions of accreditation (e.g. substantial modifications relating to the evaluation methodology) or when the criteria of the certification mechanism are updated.
He must inform the CNIL:(7) Before starting to operate a European data protection seal approved by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in a new Member State from a satellite office. In this case, the certification body must also inform the competent control authority of this Member State. It is also subject to the following obligations:(8) In the event of suspension of the accreditation, it is no longer authorized to issue certificates until the suspension is lifted by COFRAC. During this period, the certification body must nevertheless continue to monitor valid certifications;(9) In the event of withdrawal or termination of accreditation, cessation of certification activity, or when the certification body certification was authorized to start its certification activity following the admissibility of its accreditation request but did not manage to obtain accreditation from COFRAC within the time limits, it is no longer authorized to issue certificates. Certificates already issued by the certification body remain valid for a period of 6 months. He must inform the organizations holding a certificate issued by the certification body (certified organizations) or in the process of being certified. They choose another certifying body accredited or in the process of being accredited by COFRAC to transfer their certification.6. Requirements to be met by certification bodies

In particular, the certification body must ensure that the candidate and the data processing operations it wishes to submit for assessment are within the scope of the certification mechanism with regard to:
- the candidate's responsibilities for the proposed object of certification, taking into account the applicable data protection regulations (data controller, joint data controller, subcontractor, subsequent subcontractor, etc.);
- the type of data processing operations of the object of certification, taking into account the data processing operations for which the certification criteria have been designed and approved under Article 42 of the GDPR; b) That it has evaluation methods adapted to the target of evaluation, taking into account:
- the rules defined by the certification scheme concerning the methods to be applied for the assessment of the compliance of data processing operations with the certification criteria;
- the regulations applicable to the target of evaluation in terms of data protection;
- the control actions in progress or the decisions of sanction and/or recent corrective measures pronounced by the CNIL or other competent control authorities. The certification body describes the evaluation methods used for the conformity assessment of the processing operations to the certification criteria in a uniform manner, ensuring that comparable evaluation methods are used for the evaluation of comparable evaluation targets and conclude with comparable results; c) That he has the legal skills and techniques necessary in terms of data protection, in accordance with the requirements of §6 of this standard, to carry out the certification activity, in particular when the certification body does not have subsequent experience of evaluating the same type of object of certification or a similar scope of certification.7.3(3) When the certification scheme defines rules for calculating the duration of the assessment activity (p. ex. : in days), the certification body must set up a procedure for calculating the duration of the audit. For the application of the evaluation method, this procedure must take into account the following factors: a) The extent of the processing of personal data within the scope of certification; b) The nature of the personal data processed; c) The risks for the persons concerned by the data processing; d) The complexity of the evaluation of the technologies used for the data processing; e) The use of subcontractors to carry out the data processing; number of structures/establishments of the candidate in which the processing of personal data is carried out. this calculation according to the rules defined by the certification scheme and determine if the calculated duration is sufficient to carry out its assessment tasks or if this duration must be increased. It keeps the justification and a record of the duration chosen. The duration of the audit chosen by the certification body is indicated in the certification contract. certification body in requesting the transfer of its certification, the certification body follows the rules defined by the certification scheme that apply. In particular, the certification body must: a) Check that the candidate has a certificate valid at the time of application; b) In addition to the information listed in §7.2 of this reference system, obtain from the candidate:
- a copy of the certificate issued;
- the last audit report;

Note: In the absence of receipt of all or part of the documents listed above or in case of doubt on compliance of the target of evaluation with the certification criteria, the certification body will not be able to transfer the certification as is and will have to start a new certification process starting with an initial audit, as provided for in § 7.4 of this standard.7.4. Assessment7.4(1) In addition to the requirements of §7.4 of ISO 17065, the certification body must have an assessment plan (audit plan). The audit plan must enable the implementation of the assessment method established in the certification contract, in accordance with requirement §4.1.2(2) b) of this standard. assessment may require an assessment at the customer's premises to make the findings necessary to establish compliance with the certification criteria. Any deviation from the assessment method must be justified by the certification body.7.4(2) The certification body must apply the assessment methods established in the certification contract during its assessment, for example by applying: a) A method for assessing the necessity and proportionality of data processing operations with regard to the objective pursued and the safeguarding of the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject; b) A method for assessment of the extent, type and assessment of all the risks envisaged by the controller and the processor with regard to their obligations in accordance with Articles 30, 32, 35 and 36 of the GDPR, and of the appropriateness of the technical and organizational measures provided for in Articles 24, 25 and 32 of the GDPR, insofar as the aforementioned articles apply to the subject of the certification; c) A method for the evaluation of the corrective actions, including safeguards, safeguards and procedures to ensure the protection of personal data for the data processing involved in the TOE. carry out the assessment tasks, taking into account the rules defined by the certification scheme. The certification body ensures that the personnel involved in the certification assessment tasks, whether these resources are internal to the organization or external, meet the skill requirements, as specified in §6 of these standards. In particular, for each assessment, the certification body ensures that the team in charge of the assessment, as a whole, has the legal and technical skills as defined in §6 of these standards. Exceptionally, when the certification body involves in evaluation a person who cannot prove skills meeting the qualification requirements as a technical profile or a legal profile, as defined in §6 of this reference system, it justifies the particular need for the intervention of an expert with specific skills to carry out the assessment (e.g.: a person specialized in a particular technology, in a sector of activity involving the processing of particular categories of data or for which national regulations are applicable ). In this case, the result of the evaluation tasks carried out by the person with an expert profile must be supervised, during the evaluation process, by a staff member in charge of the evaluation and who meets the qualification requirements as a technical profile or a legal profile (e.g. the audit team leader).7.4(4) In addition to the requirements of §7.4.5 of ISO 17065 and in the As part of the application review process in §7.3 of ISO 17065, when the certification body relies on the result of a certification obtained before its assessment, the certification body must: a) Ensure that the certificate will be valid at the time of the evaluation and that the certification obtained is relevant for the target of evaluation; b) Document how and to what extent the results of the certification previously obtained can be taken into account for the evaluation of the certification criteria, in compliance with the rules defined by the certification scheme; c) Establish the consequences for the assessment still to be carried out and on the assessment method to be applied, for example by defining a correspondence matrix between the criteria of the two certification mechanisms for the TOE context. ensure compliance of the target of evaluation with all the criteria of the approved certification mechanism. In particular, the certification body must: a) Have access to the entire evaluation report of the certification previously obtained (and not only the certificate of conformity or a similar certificate); b) Document its own findings by:
- referring to the relevant results of the pre-existing evaluation report (the reproduction of the findings in the evaluation report is not required);
- making its own findings when they are necessary for the assessment of the additional criteria of the approved certification mechanism. If deviations from the findings of the assessment report of the certification previously obtained are identified by the certification body during its evaluation of the criteria of the approved certification mechanism, the evaluation is extended to the certification criteria concerned and, if necessary, for the entire target of evaluation already certified.7.4(6) In addition to the requirements of §7.4.6 of ISO 17065, the certification body must define in its procedures the way in which the client is informed of the results of the assessment, including non-conformities, taking into account the rules defined by the certification scheme, particularly with regard to the form of this information and the time when it is provided to the client.7.4(7) In addition to the requirements of §7.4.9 of ISO 17065, the certification body must document its findings, to each certification criterion, in accordance with the rules defined by the certification scheme. At a minimum, the evaluation report includes: a) The description of the target of evaluation; b) The evaluation plan (including updates made during the evaluation); c) References to the documents and records examined ;d) References to the processing of personal data which have been assessed; e) The function of the persons who were the subject of the interview; description of the non-conformities which identifies the certification criteria which are not met and which assesses the severity and scope of the non-conformities. The certification body asks its client to propose the implementation of measures aimed at correct all non-conformities so that they can be taken into account by the certification body when making its certification decision (see requirement in §7.6 of ISO 17065). The action plan resulting from the certification decision is also appended to the assessment report. This action plan is examined by the certification body before the review and the certification decision.7.4(8) The certification body provides the CNIL, at its request, with the report of its assessments as well as its appendices. Note: to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this standard, the certification body is not required to keep the evidence (e.g.: documents, screenshots, log files, etc.) .) which enabled it to establish the findings documented in its evaluation report.
Note: In accordance with the requirements of §7.12 of this standard, the certification body retains the report of its assessments for a period of 6 years.7.4(9) If the personal data of the scope of certification are processed from several structures/establishment of the candidate, the assessment must be carried out according to the rules defined by the certification scheme. When non-compliance is detected for one of these structures/establishments, the certification body asks its client to:
- that it analyzes its extent and causes; And
- that it proposes the implementation of measures aimed at preventing this non-conformity from recurring in other locations. These analyzes are attached to the action plan and examined by the certification body. 7.5. Review of the results relating to the assessment7.5(1) In accordance with the requirements of §7.5 of ISO 17065, the certification body carries out a review of all the information and all the results following the assessment.In addition of the requirements of §7.5 of ISO 17065, the assessment review process must take into account the rules defined by the certification scheme. In particular, the certification body must: a) Check that the scope of the certification is consistent with the object of the certification which has been assessed; b) Check that the assessment methods have been followed and that the findings available in the assessment report are relevant.7.5(2) The certification body shall designate personnel with appropriate skills to carry out the certification review, taking into account the rules defined by the certification scheme. The certification body ensures that the personnel involved in the certification review, whether these resources are internal to the organization or external, meet the skills requirements, as specified in §6 of these standards. In particular, for each review, the certification body ensures that the staff responsible for reviewing the assessment has the legal and technical skills as defined in §6 of these standards.7.6. Certification decision7.6(1) In addition to the requirements of §7.6 of ISO 17065, the certification body defines procedures for making certification decisions or refusing certification, taking into account the rules defined by the scheme certification body. The certification body also defines procedures for making other decisions relating to certification occurring following an assessment carried out as part of the monitoring process provided for in §7.9.2 of ISO 17065 or when the measures appropriate in response to non-compliance include an assessment in accordance with §7.11.2 of ISO 17065: renewal, updating of the scope of certification (extension or reduction of the scope), suspension or lifting of a suspension and withdrawal of certification. These procedures must provide that: a) The reasons which led to a favorable decision are identified and documented based on evidence and objective facts; b) The reasons which led to the refusal, suspension or withdrawal of certification are identified and documented, in particular with regard to the seriousness, number and recurrence of the non-conformities noted; c) The period between the end of the assessment (last findings) and the decision cannot exceed 3 months, except in exceptional circumstances for which the justifications are documented; of a control action in progress, or of a decision of sanction and/or recent corrective measures pronounced by the CNIL or other competent control authorities, the certification body checks with the client that this information is up to date. day before making a decision.
If new checks have been carried out with the client or if corrective measures have been requested, the certification body assesses whether this may constitute non-compliance with the certification criteria and prevent the certification from being issued (or renewed, reinstated or extended).
The certification body documents in its assessment report (and/or in its certification decision) its conclusions concerning the control actions or the corrective measures requested relating to the processing of data within the scope of the certification; e) L The certification body informs the CNIL of its decisions, in writing and before the application of its decision, when the certification is issued (renewed, restored or extended) or withdrawn (reduced or suspended) in accordance with article 43-5 of the GDPR;
The information provided to the CNIL must include:
- the customer's name;
- the scope of the certification;

Note: This information includes a history of actions taken by the certification body for each certified TOE. They do not have to be made public, unless the certification scheme stipulates that they must be published, unlike the information provided for in requirement 7.8(2) of this standard which aims to make the list of endpoints that have a valid certificate. They must nevertheless be accessible on request from a third party who wishes to be sure of the validity status of a given certification, for example, for a specific previous period or for a target of evaluation which has undergone changes during the time.Note: In accordance with the requirements of §7.12 of this reference system, the certification body keeps the records relating to the certified objects for a period of 6 years.7.8(2) The certification body must make available to the public a summary documentation of its certification decision in a way that promotes transparency regarding what was assessed and the assessment methods used. The information to be published is defined by the certification scheme. The certification body must, at the very least, publish a summary in a directory which includes: a) The name of the client and the information enabling him to be contacted; of the certification, which includes a clear and understandable description of the subject of the certification; c) The subject of the certification (the target of evaluation), including the version or other identifiers applicable; d) The name and/or a reference (including the version) of the certification criteria which were used for the assessment and, where applicable, the specifics of the method applied to assess the compliance of the data processing operations with the certification criteria; e) The date on which the certification was issued (or renewed); f) The state of validity of the certification resulting from the last certification decision. certification (in accordance with the requirements of §7.6 of this standard), the certification body provides it with this information, which will be published. The scope of the certification and the object of the certification must be provided to the CNIL in French.7.9. Monitoring and renewal7.9(1) The certification body must define a procedure for monitoring the compliance of the certified evaluation targets with the certification criteria, in accordance with article 43-2-c of the GDPR.In addition to the requirements of §7.9 of ISO 17065, the monitoring must include: a) An assessment of the changes that have been applied to the data processing concerned by the scope of the certification since the previous assessment and their potential impact on compliance with the certification criteria b) An assessment of the certification criteria whose implementation methods were assessed during the previous audit but for which the actual implementation was not applicable, for example due to the fact that certain data processing operations had not been not yet started;c) Evaluation of the implementation of measures provided for in the action plan resulting from the previous certification decision (see the requirements of §7.4 and §7.11 of this reference system);d) An in-depth evaluation certification criteria selected from the risks of non-compliance observed during previous assessments (but which have not been the subject of a finding of non-compliance). For example, an assessment can be deepened by:
- the analysis of larger quantities of evidence (eg: files, contracts, interviews, etc.) in order to consolidate the findings already established;
- the analysis of recent recordings in order to ensure that the findings established remain valid over time, for example an assessment of compliance with the certification criteria of one or more new processing operations within the scope of the certification since the previous assessment;
- the analysis of data processing in different contexts within the scope of the certification (e.g.: evaluation in other client locations, of certain personalized services or processes, etc.) in order to ensure that the findings established are consistent.7.9(2) The certification body must plan its surveillance activity according to the rules defined by the certification scheme. The maximum period between surveillance measures should not exceed 12 months. In addition to these regular assessments, the surveillance measures necessary to maintain the certification must allow: a) To ensure that the information relating to the certification is up to date (e.g. description of the target of evaluation, etc.); b) The organization of an additional evaluation at the initiative of the certification body, when this is proportionate to the risk in terms of the protection of personal data. For example, an additional assessment may take place when non-compliance is suspected due to one or more complaints received by the certification body or information relating to non-compliant practices which have been made public or even when this is necessary to provide the CNIL with the requested information relating to compliance with the approval requirements of this standard.7.9(3) The certification body must document the results of its monitoring activity for each certification, including its consequences when the surveillance leads to a decision to reduce the scope of certification, or to suspend or withdraw the certification. Note: In accordance with the requirements of §7.12 of this standard, the certification body keeps records relating to its surveillance activity during a period of 6 years.7.9(4) When the client's request relates to the renewal of the certification, the certification body must follow a certification process that complies with the same requirements of this standard as those applicable to a certification request initial. The certification body must follow the specific rules defined by the certification scheme which apply to the renewal of the certification. In particular, these rules may relate to the issue of the certificate (e.g. effective date of renewal of certification).7.9(5) When the client has several structures/establishments, the certification body must follow the rules applicable defined by the certification scheme, in particular with regard to the consequences on the certification process of the addition (extension of the scope) or the termination of location (reduction of the scope). In particular, the certification body plans the evaluation of the client's sites over the validity period of the certification.7.10. Changes affecting certification7.10(1) In addition to the requirements of §7.10 of ISO 17065, changes to be considered by the certification body shall include: a) Any breach of the GDPR or the law Informatique et Libertés reported by the client to the certification body when it is related to the subject of the certification; b) Any change in the processing of personal data indicated by the client as being likely to have effects on the compliance of the object of certification with the certification criteria; c) Any modification made to the regulations relating to the protection of personal data when it concerns the scope of the certification mechanism; d) The the adoption of delegated acts by the European Commission in accordance with Article 43-8 and 43-9 of the GDPR in relation to the scope of the certification mechanism; e) Binding decisions or opinions of the EDPS and/or the CNIL in connection with the scope of the certification mechanism; f) The court decisions on the protection of personal data brought to its attention in connection with the scope of the certification mechanism; g) The new state-of-the-art developments in the technologies used for the processing of personal data;

Note: The certification body may also take into account the recommendations, good practices and other documents adopted by the EDPS and/or the CNIL in connection with the scope of the certification mechanism.7.10(2) The certification body must define a management procedure allowing it to analyze, decide on and implement changes having consequences on the certification process, taking into account the rules defined by the certification scheme. At a minimum, this procedure includes the following points: a) Establishing and updating a register listing the changes analyzed as having consequences on the certification process as well as the impacted evaluation targets;
b) Document the measures decided to implement the changes having consequences on the certification, in particular:
- the additional assessment or the immediate reassessment of the certification criteria;
- the reasons which led to not immediately carrying out an additional evaluation or a re-evaluation of the certification criteria for the impacted evaluation targets;
- the reasons which led to no evaluation being carried out and, where applicable, the other types of action implemented;
- the rules applicable to the transition periods, including when they are defined by the owner of the certification scheme when updating the certification criteria, the deadlines applicable to the changes to be implemented and the conditions to maintain or renew certification for impacted TOEs; c) Notify the client, in a timely manner, when changes affecting their certification will require assessment and what will need to be assessed (and how ) to ensure that the processing of data within the scope of the certification remains in compliance with the certification criteria. The planned evaluation must be proportionate to the consequences on the certification. When a transition period is defined, the client is informed of the deadlines to be met in order to maintain or renew their certification, as well as the consequences in the event of non-compliance; d) Revise the official certification documents (certificates) , suspend or withdraw the certification, if the assessment concludes that the data processing within the scope of the certification no longer complies with the certification criteria; e) Update its certification procedures, including the impacted assessment methods taking into account the rules defined by the certification scheme, so that they apply to future clients in a uniform manner.7.10(3) In the event that the client informs the certification body of an action of control in progress, or of a decision of sanction and/or recent corrective measures pronounced by the CNIL or another control authority, which calls into question the conformity of the customer with the rules of protection of personal data, the certification body documents the outcome of its analysis of whether the TOE remains in compliance with the certification criteria, including its consequences when the evaluation results in a certification decision.7.11. Termination, suspension or withdrawal of certification7.11(1) In addition to the requirements of §7.11 of ISO 17065, the certification body must define a procedure for managing non-conformities of the target of evaluation according to the rules defined by the certification scheme. At a minimum, this procedure includes the following points: a) When non-compliance with the certification criteria is confirmed, the certification body must determine whether the corrective actions proposed by the client are likely to remove the non-compliance before the certification decision making. This opinion is without prejudice to the conclusions of the evaluation of the implementation of the measures by the customers when it will be carried out by the certification body;
For all non-conformities, the certification body assesses whether the action plan makes it possible to guarantee the compliance of the processing operations when the certification decision is taken. If the action plan is not sufficient to guarantee it, the certification body must wait for evidence of implementation of the corrective actions to issue the certification; b) The certification body sets a deadline for implementation corrective actions according to the level of seriousness of the non-conformities; c) When the client's certification is conditional on the implementation of an action plan, the certification body checks that the implementation of the measures aimed at to correct the non-conformities is carried out according to the planned schedule and takes the appropriate actions when the non-conformities are not resolved according to the action plan. an additional assessment.7.11(2) When the certification is terminated at the request of the client, the certification body informs the CNIL in writing and within a maximum period of 30 calendar days from the date of termination.7.11( 3) When the certification is reinstated after suspension or when the scope of the certification is reduced, the certification body informs the CNIL in writing of its decision in accordance with the requirements of §7.6 of this standard. 7.11(4) In the case of he refusal of certification, suspension or withdrawal, the customer is informed of the options available to him to appeal this decision of the certification body, the means and the time limits available to him to make this appeal. 7.12.
