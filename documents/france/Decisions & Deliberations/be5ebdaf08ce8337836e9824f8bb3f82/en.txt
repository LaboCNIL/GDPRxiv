Having regard to the decree of March 22, 2017 relating to the security reference system applicable to the National Health Data System,
After having heard Mrs. Marie-France MAZARS, commissioner, in her report, and Mrs. Nacima BELKACEM, government commissioner, in her observations,
Makes the following observations:
Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter the GDPR) and in particular its article 5, point 2, provides that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected.
Article 9, paragraph 4 of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health.
Thus, pursuant to the amended law of 6 January 1978 (hereinafter the Data Protection Act), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health, is authorized by the Commission National Computing and Liberties (hereinafter the Commission).
The Commission may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the reference systems mentioned in II of Article 54 of the Data Protection Act, established in consultation with the National Institute for Health Data (hereafter INDS), as well as only with public and private organizations representing the players concerned.
Among the most common treatments is access by healthcare establishments to data centralized by the Technical Agency for Hospitalization Information (hereinafter ATIH) and made available on the ATIH secure platform, that is, data from the Information Systems Medicalization Program (hereafter PMSI) and data from Emergency Department Passage Summaries (hereafter RPU).
The PMSI consists of a synthetic and standardized collection of administrative and medical information within health establishments, public or private, for-profit or non-profit, whose main objectives are to organize hospital care on French territory. (planning) and to finance establishments according to their activity (activity-based pricing). It is increasingly used in hospital epidemiology to understand the factors of variation in care, the supply of care and its adequacy to the needs of populations.
Governed by Articles L. 6113-7 and L. 6113-8 of the Public Health Code (hereinafter CSP), the PMSI was generalized in the 1990s and is now applied regardless of the hospital sector, but with different collection methods depending on the care categories. It includes data on the following activities:
- medicine, surgery, obstetrics and odontology (MCO);
- follow-up and rehabilitation care (SSR);
- collection of medical information in psychiatry (RIM-P);
- hospitalization at home (HAD).
A specific file is used to link all the PMSI data concerning the same patient (ANO file).
PMSI data make it possible to analyze and understand the activity of healthcare establishments in all their dimensions (volume, attractiveness, leakage rate, value, etc.) and to establish comparisons between establishments throughout the country. They thus allow establishments to develop their medical project and territorial projects taking into account their environment, in terms of care and cost, and to meet their legal obligation to analyze their activity (art. L. 6113-7 of the CSP).
The summary of passage to emergencies (RPU) is a standardized collection of medico-administrative data of patients treated by hospital emergency services. It was made compulsory by an order of July 24, 2013. The purpose of this collection is to improve knowledge of the activity of emergency structures and to allow the establishment of a national database on emergencies.
The RPUs are not linked either with the PMSI (which constitutes a separate database), nor between them, so that the different passages of the same patient will not be grouped together in the ATIH national database.
Although of more recent use than the PMSI, the RPUs represent an important source of information on emergencies, which allows analyzes complementary to those carried out from the PMSI.
Facilitating the access of health establishments to this data is also part of the will of the public authorities to improve access to care and the quality of medical care within a framework of control of general expenditure which leads to strengthening hospital reorganizations and to rationalize their financing with regard to their contribution to improving the overall performance of the healthcare offer.
Directly concerned by this objective, the hospital federations which inform, advise, assist and represent health establishments with the public authorities, also need to use ATIH data on a recurring and iterative basis to meet the needs of their members. , whether common or individual.
In view of all these needs, the Commission considered that the framework of a reference methodology was appropriate to facilitate and supervise the numerous data processing operations carried out by healthcare establishments and hospital federations from data held by ATIH .
Given their missions, the federations and establishments carry out a large number of studies that fit into a set of determined purposes corresponding to their missions (for example: evaluation of health pathways or the quality of care, medical- economic, responses to requests from public authorities, actions with the general public, advice to members, etc.). Data controllers who send a commitment to comply with this reference methodology are authorized to implement processing as long as it meets the conditions provided for by these provisions.

When the data controller justifies it, access to the data may be maintained at the end of the study, within the limit of two years from the last publication relating to the results.Title III: PROCESSING RELATING TO PERSONAL DATA RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING OUT THE STUDY
The data processing of the persons responsible for carrying out the study must have the sole purpose of implementing the study and complying with the legal obligations of the data controller.
In particular, the data processed is intended for the management of declarations of interest, their transmission to the INDS if necessary and the management of internal authorization procedures.
The only categories of personal data relating to data subjects that may be processed are the following:
- surname, first name(s), function, access profiles;
- if relevant: professional telephone, postal and/or electronic contact details, employing body;
- training / qualifications ;
- elements necessary for the evaluation of knowledge in order to carry out the study.
The information of the persons concerned as well as the procedures for exercising their rights comply with the principle of transparency provided for in Chapter III of the GDPR.
The personal data of the persons concerned in charge of carrying out the study cannot be kept beyond a period of five years after the end of the study.Title IV: IMPLEMENTATION AND SECURITY
The implementation of personal data processing occurring within the framework of the study is carried out under the responsibility of the data controller, including with third parties acting on his behalf, in compliance with the provisions of Articles 24, 25 , 28, 32 to 35 of the GDPR as well as the decree of March 22, 2017 relating to the security reference system applicable to the SNDS.
ATIH makes the data available on a secure and approved platform within the meaning of the decree of March 22, 2017 relating to the security reference system applicable to the SNDS.
It is based on a secure internet connection (HTTPS protocol) and strong authentication (one-time password generated by a token). Access traceability is ensured and a computer monitoring mechanism records all actions performed by the user.
A workspace on the platform is provided by ATIH so that users can consult the data. Only statistics aggregated in such a way that the direct or indirect identification of persons is impossible can be extracted from the platform.
A copy of all data output is kept by ATIH, which reserves the right to report to the Commission if it becomes aware of information likely to reveal serious shortcomings.Title V: SUBCONTRACTORS
When the data controller uses one or more subcontractors, he ensures that they provide sufficient guarantees as to the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures so that the processing meets the requirements of the GDPR, the Data Protection Act and guarantees the protection of the rights of the person concerned.
A health establishment or a hospital federation responsible for processing may in particular choose another health establishment or a hospital federation as a subcontractor.
The data controller establishes with the subcontractor a contract or another legal act specifying the obligations of each party and containing the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR. In particular, the contract must provide that the subcontractor:
- only processes data on documented instructions from the data controller and takes all required security measures;
- does not subcontract without the written authorization of the data controller;
- helps the data controller to guarantee compliance with his various obligations (rights of individuals, security of processing, notification of breach, impact analyses, etc.);
- provides the data controller with all the information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations and to enable audits to be carried out;
- immediately informs the data controller in the event of an instruction which, in his opinion, constitutes a violation of the GDPR or the Data Protection Act.
In addition, the subcontractor:
- appoints, where applicable, a data protection officer in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR;
- keeps a register of the categories of processing carried out on behalf of the data controller, in accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR. Title VI: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPONSIBILITY
6.1. Formalities
Each controller appoints a data protection officer, pursuant to Article 37 of the GDPR. This data protection officer will in particular be responsible for verifying compliance with the processing implemented according to this methodology.
Data controllers send the Commission a single commitment to comply with this methodology for all the processing operations they implement provided they are carried out in compliance with all the provisions of the methodology. A request for an opinion from the Expert Committee for research, studies and assessments in the field of health (CEREES) is not required.
In accordance with Article 30 of the GDPR, the data controller keeps up to date, within the register of processing activities, the list of processing operations implemented within the framework of this methodology.
6.2. Principle of transparency
The provision of data from the SNDS and its components is designed to account for their use to civil society. To this end, article L. 1461-3 of the CSP makes access to data from the SNDS and its components subject to the communication to the INDS of several elements by the data controller, before and after the studies.
Thus, the data controller undertakes to register the studies carried out within the framework of this reference methodology with the public directory kept by the INDS. This registration, to be carried out by the data controller or the person acting on his behalf, before the start of the studies, is accompanied by the transmission to the INDS of a file containing:
- the protocol, including the justification of the public interest, as well as a summary, according to the model made available by the INDS;
- the declaration of interests of the data controller, in relation to the subject of the studies.
At the end of the studies, the method and the results obtained must be communicated to the INDS with a view to their publication.
The recording of the processing and the transmission of the results are carried out in accordance with the methods defined by the INDS. Title VII: ENTRY INTO FORCE
This reference methodology comes into force as of its publication in the Official Journal.
This deliberation will be published in the Official Journal of the French Republic.
