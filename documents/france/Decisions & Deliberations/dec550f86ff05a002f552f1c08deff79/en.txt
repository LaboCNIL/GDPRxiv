Law No. 2018-771 of September 5, 2018 for the freedom of choose one's professional future profoundly modifies the governance and financing of the vocational training system and in particular the methods of transmission of apprenticeship contracts. Article 11 of the aforementioned law provides that the procedure for registering apprenticeship contracts is replaced by the filing procedure. Article L. 6224-1 of the Labor Code provides that the apprenticeship contract or, where applicable, the declaration mentioned in Article L. 6222-5 is sent to the operator of competences (OPCO), which proceeds to its deposit under conditions fixed by regulation. It is within this framework that the Commission was seized of the draft decree. Also, article 1 of the draft decree specifies that the Employers, with the exception of those in the non-industrial and commercial public sector, now send the apprenticeship contract to the OPCO, and no longer to the consular chambers (the chambers of trades and crafts, agriculture or trade and industry). In the event of acceptance of the apprenticeship contract, the OPCO files said contract with the ministry in charge of professional training by dematerialized means. This same provision lists the information transmitted by the employer to the 'OPCO.Article 1 of the draft decree is equal specify the procedure for filing the contract in the non-industrial and commercial public sector. As such, it provides that the public employer henceforth sends the apprenticeship contract to the regional directorate for business, competition, consumption, labor and employment. The Commission recalls that any transmission of data to personal character must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted. Thus, in the case of electronic transmission, data transiting over networks open to the public must be subject to encryption and authentication measures for the sender and the recipient. As this is a paper transmission, physical security measures must be implemented. She considers that these changes do not call for any further comments on her part.
