Constituted by the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), the ESND is a random sample comprising two percent of the people whose data appear in the SNIIRAM mentioned in Article L. 161-28-1 of the Social Security Code. The ESND contains the following information from SNIIRAM: the inter-regime consumption data mart (DCIR), also called the individual beneficiary database; the data contained in the program for the medicalization of information systems (PMSI) in the fields of medicine, surgery, obstetrics and odontology (MCO), follow-up care and rehabilitation (SSR), collection of medical information in psychiatry (RIM-P) and hospitalization in (HAD). Thematic databases of aggregated data called datamarts oriented towards monitoring expenditure (DAMIR) or analyzing the supply of care (AMOS) are also created from SNIIRAM, as well as tables of board on biology and pharmacy. These datasets are included in the scope of this reference document. The use of this sample makes it possible in particular to better know and understand the use of care, the trajectories of care and the health expenditure of the insured.

- and meetings with the competent authorities and committees, or studies for monitoring purposes;
- feasibility studies in the context of research involving or not involving the human person. Modalities of access specific to certain categories of data controllers: In order to benefit from these conditions for making datamarts, are required to use a research laboratory or a design office mentioned in article L. 1461-3 of the CSP: persons producing or marketing products mentioned in II of article L. 5311-1 of the CSP; the organizations mentioned in 1° of A and in 1°, 2°, 3°, and 6° of B of Article L. 612-2 of the Monetary and Financial Code as well as the insurance intermediaries mentioned in Article L. 511-1 of the Insurance Code.

The Data Platform of health decides with regard to the following elements: the justification provided by the data controller to demonstrate the scientific relevance of the project; the justification of the historical depth requested concerning the ESND data (nine years in addition to the year in course or nineteen years in addition to the current year); the justification of the potential identifier retained; the public interest purpose pursued by the processing; the duration of access to the CNAM portal for the processing envisaged, which must be limited to the time necessary to carry out the research, study or evaluation; and, where applicable, the justification for the request for extension of this period sent by the data controller; compliance with the legislative and regulatory requirements applicable to the SNDS; the procedures for informing and exercising the rights of the persons concerned; the where applicable, compliance with the terms of access to the data provided for by the reference system determining the criteria of confidentiality, expertise and independence for research laboratories and design offices. Access procedure: The request for access is sent to the PDS under the same conditions as those provided for the transmission of the application file for authorization of research, study or evaluation in the field of health provided for in Article 76 of the Data Protection Act. The PDS notifies its decision to the applicant within fifteen working days of receipt of a complete file. If there is no response from the PDS at the end of the fifteen working day period, the request is deemed approved. The PDS may contact the applicant for any additional information if necessary.

After the latter's agreement, the PDS refers to the CESREEEs for an opinion, then the National Commission for Computing and Liberties for authorisation. Information and procedures for exercising rights: The information of the persons concerned cannot be limited to registration of processing in the public directory of the PDS. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 14-5-b of the GDPR, the controller may claim an exception to the obligation of individual information for the implementation processing involving exclusively data from the ESND and datamarts. In this case, it must take appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms as well as the legitimate interests of the persons concerned, including by making the information publicly available .Thus, collective information relating to the carrying out of the study must appear on the website of the data controller as well as, where applicable, of the research laboratory or design office carrying it out. In addition, other vectors may be used to disseminate this information (communication on social networks, in the regional media, with patient associations, publication of a press release, etc.). processing carries out several studies using data from the ESND and data marts, it must set up a transparency portal containing general information on the SNDS, as well as an information note specific to each study. These documents must include all of the information provided for in Article 14 of the GDPR. Transparency: The legal framework allowing the provision of SNDS data is designed to account for their use to civil society.
