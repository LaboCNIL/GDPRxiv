To do this, the networks collect, produce and analyze perinatal health indicators annually. As part of the management of the networks, a certain number of common tracer indicators, calculated by the Technical Agency for Information on Hospitalization ( hereinafter "ATIH") based on data from the program for the medicalization of information systems (hereinafter "PMSI") are monitored by the networks (multiple births, maternal age, prematurity, stillbirth, etc.).The Network Perinatal Occitanie is one of these networks. On the advisability of using the single decision The performance of the tasks of the data controller involves the implementation of numerous processing of PMSI data intended for the evaluation of perinatal health indicators. The processing operations described fall under the processing authorization regime for research, study or evaluation purposes. e, to authorize the implementation of this processing on the basis of the provisions of Articles 66 IV and 72 et seq. of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended (hereinafter the "Computing and Freedoms" Law), within the framework of a single decision. On the application of the provisions related to the SNDS Since the PMSI data comes from one of the databases making up the National Health Data System (hereinafter "SNDS"), the Commission recalls that all legislative and regulatory provisions relating to the SNDS are applicable in this case, and in particular the prohibition on using this data for the purposes described in Article L. 1461-1 V of the Public Health Code. processing The processing implemented by the data controller is intended to enable the evaluation of the perinatal health policy. The perinatal health networks contributing to the implementation of the perinatal health policy according to the aforementioned instruction, these treatments, real ized for the purposes of scientific research, are necessary for the performance of the mission of public interest with which the Occitanie Perinatal Network is invested. They are, as such, lawful with regard to Articles 6, paragraph 1 point e) and 9 , paragraph 2 point j) of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter "GDPR"). On the purpose of the processing and its nature of public interest The processing operations requiring access to PMSI data are intended for the multi-year monitoring of the perinatal health policy through the production as well as the analysis of indicators and perinatal care pathways. To do this, studies will be carried out aimed at monitoring perinatal health indicators, thanks to: an analysis of the offer of care and hospital flows; a study of mother/child patient pathways; an evaluation of practices; an implementation of indicators of quality and relevance of care; an evaluation of the quality of PMSI coding. the purpose of the processing is considered to be specific, explicit and legitimate, in accordance with Article 5 paragraph 1 point b) of the GDPR.
