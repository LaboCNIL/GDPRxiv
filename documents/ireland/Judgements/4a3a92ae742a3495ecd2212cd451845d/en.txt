Outcome
By written judgment of 5 December 2019, the High Court struck out judicial review proceedings brought by Ms Scott under High Court Record No. 2019/95 JR. The proceedings were struck out on grounds of mootness, on the application of the DPC, the DPC having earlier delivered decisions in respect of certain complaints filed by the Applicant. (In her judicial review proceedings, Ms Scott had sought orders compelling the delivery of decisions in respect of her complaints).
On 3 January 2020, Ms Scott filed an appeal against Judgment and Order of the High Court.
Ultimately, Ms Scott agreed to withdraw that appeal. It was duly struck out, on consent, on 31 July 2020.
Note that one of the two decisions delivered by the DPC referred to above is presently the subject of a (separate) statutory appeal brought by Ms Scott in Dublin Circuit Court. That appeal has not yet come on for hearing.
