Outcome
The Court of Appeal delivered a written judgment on 1 July 2020, refusing an appeal by Mr Nowak against an earlier judgment of the High Court in which the High Court had upheld a decision of the DPC to the effect that certain memoranda held by PWC did not contain personal data relating to Mr Nowak and so Mr Nowak was not entitled to exercise a right of access to same.
Subsequent to its judgment, the Court of Appeal delivered a written ruling on 27 July 2020 on the issue of costs, holding that Mr Nowak must pay the DPC’s costs of the appeal before the Court of Appeal and also the costs of the courts below.
Separately, Mr Nowak applied to the Supreme Court for leave to bring a further appeal to that Court. That application was refused by written determination made by the Supreme Court on 16 December 2020.
