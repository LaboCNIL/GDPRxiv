Outcome
Following written and oral submissions by the parties, the High Court made a ruling on 28 October 2020 directing the DPC to pay Mr Schrems’ costs of the proceedings in the High Court and CJEU.
The High Court refused the DPC’s application for an order directing Facebook to pay the DPC’s costs and to bear responsibility for such costs as the DPC was ordered to pay to Mr Schrems.
Current Status of Case 
The final order has not yet been perfected and so the time-period for the bringing of an appeal (if any) has not yet expired.
