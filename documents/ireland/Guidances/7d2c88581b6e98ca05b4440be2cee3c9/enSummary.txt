Drones (common name for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)) are a broad category of aircraft of various sizes which are remotely piloted without humans on board, equipped with technology for collecting images, videos, sounds and/or other information (data collection system) and transmitting them to smart devices (for example, to cloud storage). Similar to Body Worn Cameras (BWC) drones can effectively turn into a mobile surveillance system and are highly likely to capture the personal data of passers-by (data subjects).
These guidelines have been developed for drone operators for purposes other than public law-related purposes and also to answer queries from the perspective of data subjects. Other drones aviation particulars such as security, safety and certification requirements remain outside the scope of these guidelines.
