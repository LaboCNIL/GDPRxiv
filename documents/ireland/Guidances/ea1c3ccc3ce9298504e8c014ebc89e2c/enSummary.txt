The Data Protection Commission (DPC) previously carried out a series of audits in order to assess how organisations gather and process personal data in the course of providing electronic receipts (‘e-receipts’) to customers. In a number of cases, email addresses gathered for the purpose of issuing e-receipts were subsequently used by retailers in order to issue marketing material. Following on from these audits, the DPC has produced guidance around the use of e-receipts to assist retailers adhere to best practice in relation to e-receipts and electronic direct marketing.
