Information Note:   Data Breach Trends from the First Year of the GDPR  October 2019    Data Breach Trends from the First Year of the GDPR  1  Introduction This information note is intended to give an overview of the trends observed by the Data Protection Commission (DPC) over the first year of the mandatory breach reporting regime introduced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The statistics and trends discussed below capture all data breach notifications received in the first year since the 25th of May 2018, and the total number of breach notifications received by the DPC during that time amounted to 5,818. Of all breach notifications received by the DPC, approximately 4% have been classified a ‘non-breaches’ and did not meet the definition of a personal data breach as per Article 4(12) GDPR. Since the introduction of the new breach reporting regime, the DPC’s Breach Assessment Unit has undertaken an analysis of breach notifications received from areas within the public and private sector, including those notified by: the financial sector; the insurance sector; the telecommunications industry; the healthcare industry; and law enforcement. Some of the trends and issues identified by the Breach Assessment Unit whilst conducting theses reviews and from the processing of notifications include: late notifications; difficulty in assessing risk ratings; failure to communicate the breach to data subjects; repeat breach notifications; and inadequate reporting.  One issue of note identified by the DPC is that, of the breach notifications received in the first year since the 25th of May 2018, a total of 13% failed to satisfy the requirement of notification to the DPC ‘without undue delay’ (normally within 72 hours), as required under the provisions of Article 33(1) GDPR. The DPC has prepared a separate practical guidance note based on the issues identified in this analysis of trends and statistics.
