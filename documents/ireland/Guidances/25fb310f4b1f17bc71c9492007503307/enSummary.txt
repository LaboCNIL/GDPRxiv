As well as the General Data Protection (GDPR) applying to processing of personal data for the purposes of electronic direct marketing (marketing conducted by phone, fax, text message, and email), there are further rules which specifically apply to electronic direct marketing, which are set out in the ‘ePrivacy Regulations’ (SI 336 of 2011).
This guidance provides answers to some frequently asked questions about the rules which apply to electronic direct marketing, specifically the rules about when consent is required, the limited exception when marketing to existing customers as long as further specific requirements are met (such as providing a clear opt-out mechanism), and how data subjects can object to the use of their personal data for electronic direct marketing.
