The Data Protection Commission (DPC) is frequently asked about whether it is lawful from a data protection perspective for landlords (or letting agents acting on their behalf) to require certain information or documentation from prospective tenants. The purpose of this guidance is to assist both landlords (or letting agents acting on their behalf) and tenants in understanding which information may be appropriate to request at the initial application stage for a residential tenancy.
