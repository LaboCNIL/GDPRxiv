Every day, each one of us as a matter of convenience and utility engages with a variety of websites, apps and social media platforms using our desktop PCs, tablets and smartphones. In doing this, our personal data is being collected and processed in a whole range of ways which we may be unaware of and which may pose some risks to us.
The aim of this note is to help you to be aware of these risks, identify when they can arise, and suggest steps that can be taken to deal with them and protect yourself online. Of course, the more you know, the better equipped you are to keep yourself and your personal data safe and to exercise choice and control in deciding how you engage online with social media and other online services.
