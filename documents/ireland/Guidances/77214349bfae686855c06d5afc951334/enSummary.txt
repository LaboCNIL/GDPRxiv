Garda vetting is a background check completed by the National Vetting Bureau and is an important safeguard in protecting the safety and welfare of children and vulnerable adults. Anyone who works with or undertakes an activity, of which a necessary and regular part of it consists of having access to or contact with children or vulnerable adults, is required to be vetted. 
Given the type of information that can be disclosed when an individual undergoes vetting, it is important that organisations are aware of their data protection obligations and have proper procedures in place to deal with Garda vetting disclosures.
This guidance note provides background information on the type of information that can be included in a vetting disclosure and sets out data protection considerations for organisations carrying out Garda vetting. The note also outlines some of the data protection rights of individuals undergoing vetting.
