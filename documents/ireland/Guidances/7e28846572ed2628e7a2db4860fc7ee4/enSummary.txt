The decreasing cost of electronic storage and processing has greatly contributed to the large increase in the quantity of personal data stored in recent years, often on portable storage devices, which gives rise to particular security challenges for the organisations responsible for that stored data.
To ensure that they have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place, any organisation utilising portable storage devices to store or transmit personal data should consider the particular risks associated with the use of such devices, such as loss or unauthorised access, and ensure that they have internal policies and technical measures which mitigate these risks. This guidance sets out recommendations for organisations to consider when planning their own internal policies on the use of portable storage devices.
