1 DPC Ref: C-19-X-XXXICO Ref: XXXXXXXXXDate:  10 November 2020 Complainant: XX Data Controller: Ryanair DAC RE: XX V Ryanair DAC This document is a decision of the Data Protection Commission of Ireland (“DPC”) in relation to DPC complaint reference, C-19-X-XXX (hereinafter referred to as the (“Complaint”), submitted by XX (“Complainant”) against Ryanair DAC (“Data Controller”), which was referred to the Data Protection Commission of Ireland (“DPC”), in its capacity as lead supervisory authority, by the Information Commissioners Office of the United Kingdom (“ICO”), as the concerned supervisory authority with which the complaint was lodged.  This decision is made pursuant to the powers conferred on the DPC by section 113(2)(a) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“the Act”) and Article 60 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Preliminary Assessment of complaint 1.The complainant initially submitted a complaint to the ICO, which was thereafterreceived by the DPC on 02 March 2019. In their request, the complainant alleged thatthe data controller had failed to comply with a subject access request, submitted to itby the complainant on 26 September 2018. In transmitting the complaint to the DPC,the ICO advised that the complaint related to the data controller’s failure to respond tothe complainant’s access request. The ICO provided the DPC with a copy of thecomplaint form submitted to the ICO by the complainant, a copy of theacknowledgement, dated 26 September 2018, that the complainant had received fromthe data controller when submitting the access request, and a copy of thecomplainant’s follow up email to the data controller requesting an update in relation totheir request.2.Prior to commencing an investigation into the complaint, the DPC reviewed theinformation provided by the ICO and established that Ryanair DAC, which has its placeof main establishment in Ireland, was identified as the relevant data controller underthe GDPR in relation to the complaint, as it determined the purposes and means of the2 processing of the complainant’s personal data for the purposes of managing their customer service query and responding to their access request.  3.The data in question was personal data relating to the complainant (consisting of,amongst other things, customer service complaints and an access request they hadsubmitted to Ryanair DAC) as it related to them as an identifiable natural person. TheDPC was therefore satisfied that the complaint, as received by the DPC on 02 March2019, should be investigated to determine if a breach of the Act and/or GDPR hadoccurred.Examination of complaint4.Acting in its capacity as lead supervisory authority, the DPC commenced anexamination of the complaint by contacting the data controller via email on 19 March2019.  In our correspondence, the DPC outlined the details of the complaint as set outby the ICO.5.In our communication, the DPC advised the data controller that the scope of thecomplaint related to an allegation made by the complainant that the data controller hadfailed to respond to a subject access request, dated 26 September 2018, submitted toit by the complainant. The DPC also provided the data controller with details of theonline portal reference number that the complainant received from the data controllerfollowing their request.6.In order to progress the matter the DPC instructed the data controller to respond to theaccess request in full and to provide this office with a copy of the cover letter that issuedto the complainant.7.In its response to the DPC dated 02 April 2019, the data controller provided the DPCwith a copy of a cover letter dated 02 April 2019, that issued to the complainant inrelation to their access request. In its correspondence to the complainant, the datacontroller advised that had it received the access request dated 26 September 2018,in which the complainant had requested access to all data and specifically all data,including call recordings, relating to a specific booking reference.8.With its letter of 02 April 2019, the data controller provided the complainant with accessto copies of their personal data relating to the specific booking reference thecomplainant had provided to the ICO and data relating to a separate complaint. Thedata controller advised that it could not provide the complainant with a copy of the callrecording they had requested as, due to the delay on the data controller’s part inprocessing the request, the call recording had been deleted in accordance with3 company policy and they had been unable to retrieve it. The data controller advised the DPC that it had informed the complainant of this via its online portal on 22 February 2019. The data controller stated that the delay in processing the access request was caused by human error as the agent who had opened and was processing the access request, had ceased working on the data controller’s online portal prior to completing the request and had failed to reassign the request to another agent. The data controller advised the DPC that it has reviewed its process to ensure that this error would not occur again and that the assignment of a request is no longer dependant on agent (human) action.   9.This office reverted to the data controller with further queries relating to its procedureregarding access requests for call recordings.10.The data controller responded to the DPC’s queries stating that it had acknowledgedthe request on 27 September 2018 and requested that the complainant verify theiremail address. The data controller stated that at the time the request was submitted,due to the volume of data subjects who did not verify their email address, accessrequests were not assigned to the relevant department until the email was verified bythe data subject. The data controller advised this office that the complainant respondedto the request, verifying their email address, but the agent who was working on therequest had ceased working on the online portal and therefore the request had notbeen assigned to the relevant department. The data controller asserted that this errorwas not discovered until December 2018, when the request was then assigned to theCustomer Services department to provide the necessary data, including the callrecording, at which point the call record had been deleted in accordance with the datacontroller’s retention policy.11.The data controller provided the DPC with a copy of its retention policy, in which itstates that call recordings are retained for a period of 90 days from the date of the call.The data controller advised that, as the complainant’s call had been made on 05September 2018, it would have been automatically deleted on 04 December 2018. Thedata controller further stated that it does not have the functionality to retrieve deletedcall recordings.12.The data controller advised this office that it would now include wording in its “ContactUs FAQ’s” on its website, which is the central location for the data controller’s contactnumbers, including the phone numbers for the main Customer Support for eachmarket, advising customers that call recordings will be deleted from the system after90 days. The data controller stated that customers looking to contact its call centresneed to access this page in order to obtain the appropriate number and the notificationwould be prominent and visible at that point.413.Throughout the handling of the complaint, the DPC kept the complainant informed ofthe progress of the complaint via updates transmitted to the ICO.14.The DPC provided the data controller with a copy of the draft decision in relation to thecomplaint by way of email on 03 April 2020, inviting it to provide final submissions inrelation to the matter by close of business 17 April 2020.15.The data controller provided its final submission by way of email dated 21 April 2020.16.In its submission, the data controller stated that the complainant’s access request,submitted through the data controller’s online portal on 26 September 2018, stated “Iwould like ALL data included recorded calls relating to booking CR8E6F”. The datacontroller advised the DPC that the request was not limited to recordings of phone callsmade by the complainant.17.The data controller also submitted that the draft decision did not reflect the chronologyof events and asserted that, in response to the complainant’s access request, prior toreceipt of the DPC’s initial correspondence, the data controller had previously providedvarious records to the complainant via its online portal on both 10 January 2019 and18 February 2019. The data controller asserted that the records provided containedthe complainant’s personal data and included letters, a written complaint and web chattranscripts relating to a specific booking reference. The data controller stated that, inthe course of these communications with the complainant, and in a furthercommunications on 22 February 2019 and 04 March 2019 via the data controller’sonline portal, the data controller had also made it clear to the complainant that it wasno longer in a position to provide call recordings, as they had been deleted andexplained the reasons for this (i.e. that the data controller had not located therecordings prior to the 90 day deletion period elapsing). The data controller advisedthat in its communication to the complainant on 04 March 2019 it had also apologisedto the complainant for any inconvenience caused. In addition, the data controller alsostated that it liaised with the complainant in September and October 2019, in parallelto their access request, in an attempt to resolve their underlying customer servicecomplaint.18.The data controller highlighted the steps that it had taken in response to thecomplainant’s access request and suggested that they be considered as mitigatingfactors by the DPC when making its decision. These steps were:a)providing various written records containing the complainant’s personal datato them in January and February 2019; 5 b)explaining to the complainant on more than one occasion the reasons for itsinability to provide the call recordings to them;c)providing an apology to the complainant for any inconvenience caused;d)making various alterations to its data processing systems to avoid any repeatof the human error that caused the failures highlighted in the complaint;e)adopting measures to ensure enhanced transparency concerning its retentionof call recordings; andf)that it had co-operated with the DPC in respect of our investigation into thismatter.Complaint handling process 19.In accordance with section 109(2) of the Act, the DPC is mandated to attempt toamicably resolve complaints where there is a reasonable likelihood of amicableresolution being reached within a reasonable time. If the complaint is not amicablyresolved the DPC will take such action(s) as the Commission considers appropriate asset out in section 113 of the Act. Whilst the DPC engaged in such efforts, in this casethe complainant notified the ICO they were unsatisfied with the apology put forward bythe data controller in an attempt to amicably resolve the subject matter of thecomplaint.Communication of draft decision to “supervisory authorities concerned”20.In accordance with Article 60(3) of the GDPR, the DPC is obliged to communicate therelevant information and submit a draft decision, in relation to a complaint regardingcross border processing, to the supervisory authorities concerned for their opinion andto take due account of their views.21.In accordance with its obligation, the DPC transmitted a draft decision in relation to thematter to the “supervisory authorities concerned” on 25 May 2020. As Ryanair DACoffers goods and services across the EU, and therefore the processing is likely tosubstantially affect data subjects in every EU member state, the DPC in its role as LSAidentified that each supervisory authority was a supervisory authority concerned asdefined in Article 4(22) of the GDPR. On this basis, the draft decision of the DPC inrelation to this complaint was transmitted to each supervisory authority in the EU andEEA for their opinion.22.Subsequently, the DPC received a number of “relevant and reasoned objections” fromdifferent supervisory authorities concerned within the statutory timeframe of four weekspursuant to Article 60(4). Further, the DPC also received a number of opinions fromother supervisory authorities concerned in relation to the draft decision.6 Summary of opinions received from “supervisory authorities concerned” 23.The DPC received formal relevant and reasoned objections in relation to the draftdecision, pursuant to Article 60(4) of the GDPR, from three supervisory authoritiesconcerned;•Berliner Beaftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit (Berlin DPA);•Comissão Nacional de Protecção de Dados (Portuguese DPA); and•the Office of Personal Data Protection (UODO) of Poland.24.The DPC also received a number of opinions, which were not expressed as formalobjections, in relation to the draft decision from five other supervisory authoritiesconcerned;•Garante Per La Protezione Dei Dati Personali (the Italian DPA);•Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság (the Hungarian DPA);•Datatilsynet (Danish DPA);•Autorité de Protection de Données (Belgian DPA); and•Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (Dutch DPA).25.In its relevant and reasoned objection the Berlin DPA opined that the DPC’s draftdecision failed to make a substantive assessment of what it considered to be additionalinfringements by Ryanair DAC of Article 32(1) and Article 32(4) of the GDPR. TheBerlin DPA stated that, due to Ryanair DAC’s insufficient technical, organisational andhuman resource measures to ensure the security of data processing, the informationprovided to the complainant was incomplete.26.In its opinion, the Italian DPA stated that the human error that led to the failure to replyto the subject access request within the statutory timeframe clearly shows thatorganisational and technical issues existed internally, such as to give rise to anaccountability issue under Article 24(1).27.Further, in the relevant and reasoned objections raised by the supervisory authoritiesconcerned, the Berlin DPA, the Portuguese DPA and UODO all noted that the DPChad found that an infringement of the GDPR occurred. On this basis, theaforementioned supervisory authorities concerned advocated for the exercise of acorrective power by the DPC, especially in circumstances where the infringementsrelated to the exercise of data subject rights. This opinion was also expressed by theItalian DPA, the Hungarian DPA, the Danish DPA and the Belgian DPA in the7 comments submitted by these supervisory authorities in relation to the DPC’s draft decision. 28.Finally, in its opinion on the DPC’s draft decision, the Dutch DPA submitted the viewthat supervisory authorities are free to structure their complaint handling as they wishand that finding a breach of the GDPR does not automatically mean that a correctivemeasure needs be imposed. The DPC notes this view, and considers that no furtheranalysis of the Dutch DPA’s opinion is required in this regard.Analysis of opinions received from “supervisory authorities concerned”29.Having carefully considered the opinions of the supervisory authorities concerned, theDPC has completed a careful in-depth analysis of the opinions and concerns raised,both in the context of formal relevant and reasoned objections pursuant to Article 60(4)and in opinions submitted in relation to the DPC’s draft decision.30.The DPC has given careful consideration to the opinions of both the Berlin DPA andthe Italian DPA in relation to their assertions that Ryanair DAC had further contravenedthe GDPR and has completed the following analysis.31.In its submission the Berlin DPA stated that “Due to Ryanair's insufficient technical,organisational and human resource measures to ensure the security of dataprocessing, the information provided to the complainant was late and incomplete.According to points 8, 10 and 26 of the DPC's Draft Decision, Ryanair was late ininforming the complainant of his data held by Ryanair within the meaning of Art. 15(1)GDPR due to 'human error'. The agent who had initially handled the access requestuntil the end of his work on the online portal forgot to assign the access request toanother agent after his departure. The answer to the re-quest was hence only madeby letter of 2 April 2019. Additionally, due to the delay in providing the information, thecomplainant could not be provided with the recording of his or her call of 5 September2018, as calls are irrevocably deleted 90 days after their recording due to Ryanair'sinternal deletion deadlines. Within the one-month period resulting from Art. 12(3)GDPR, Ryanair would therefore have been able to make the call available to thecomplainant. Hence, this additionally constitutes an infringement by Ryanair of Art.32(1) and (4) GDPR.”32.Article 32 of the GDPR relates to the security of processing of personal data. Morespecifically, Article 32(1) of the GDPR states that a data controller shall implementappropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of securityappropriate to the risk. Further, Article 32(4) states that the controller shall take stepsto ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller who has8 access to personal data does not process the data except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.  33.The DPC notes that in this instance the data controller failed to respond to an accessrequest submitted by the data subject within the statutory timeframe and that thisfailure to respond was caused by an employee failing to follow internal organisationalprocedures. The DPC also notes that the failure to respond to the data subject’s accessrequest within the statutory timeframe resulted in an irrevocable deletion of the datasubject’s personal data, as it was deleted in line with the data controller’s 90 dayretention period for call recordings. While the DPC notes that the employee’s failure tofollow the organisational measures in place resulted in the deletion of the data subject’spersonal data, the DPC does not consider that there is any evidence to suggest thatthe employee’s failure to follow the organisational measures in place resulted in anyrisk to the security of the personal data being processed, as the data was destroyed inline with the data controller’s retention period. The DPC also considers that there is noevidence to suggest that the employee of the data controller processed the datasubject’s personal data outside of the instructions of the data controller, incircumstances where the employee failed to process the data subject’s accessrequest. As such, the DPC finds no basis to agree with the opinion of the Berlin DPAthat Ryanair DAC contravened Article 32(1) and Article 32(4) of the GDPR. Further, inthe course of the DPC’s examination of this complaint, an alleged infringement ofArticle 32(1) and Article 32(4) of the GDPR was not raised as a ground of complaintand did not form part of the DPC’s complaint-handling process; as such, anexamination of Ryanair DAC’s compliance with Article 32(1) and Article 32(4) of theGDPR falls outside the scope of the complaint and of this decision. On this basis, theDPC does not propose to follow this objection.34.In its opinion, the Italian DPA expressed the opinion that the human error that causedthe failure to reply to the data subject’s access request in due time clearly shows thatissues existed in relation to the data controller’s technical and organisationalmeasures. The Italian DPA also stated that the risk at issue, namely the fact that anoperator leaving the company and in charge of complaints handling would not beimmediately replaced to ensure the seamless handling of such complaints, had notbeen tackled by the data controller beforehand, and that the issue was only resolvedfollowing the intervention of the DPC in relation to this complaint. The Italian DPAexpressed the opinion that such an internal issue would give rise to an accountabilityissue under Article 24(1) GDPR.35.The DPC notes that, in the course of the DPC’s examination of this complaint, analleged infringement of Article 24 was not raised as a ground of complaint and did notform part of the DPC’s complaint-handling process; as such, an examination of RyanairDAC’s compliance with Article 24 falls outside the scope of the complaint and of thisdecision. On this basis, the DPC does not propose to follow the Italian DPA’s opinion.9 36.The DPC also notes that, in their opinions the Berlin DPA, the Portuguese DPA andthe UODO all advocated for the exercise of a corrective power by the DPC, especiallyin circumstances where the infringements related to the exercise of data subject rights.Further, the DPC notes that this opinion was also expressed by the Italian DPA, theHungarian DPA, the Danish DPA and the Belgian DPA in the comments submitted bythe supervisory authorities in relation to the DPC’s draft decision.37.Article 58 of the GDPR provides supervisory authorities with certain powers in relationto the investigation and enforcement of the GDPR. Specifically, Article 58(2)(b)provides that supervisory authorities shall have the power to issue reprimands to acontroller or processor where processing operations have infringed provisions of theGDPR. Further, Recital 129 of the GDPR states that measures, such as correctivepowers, “should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuringcompliance with this Regulation”.38.In assessing whether the application of a corrective power is appropriate, necessaryand proportionate in this case, I have had regard to the specific circumstances of thiscomplaint. I note that the failure to comply with the complainant’s access request wasthe result of a human error and that the data controller has reviewed it’s technical andorganisational measures and has put in place further measures to ensure aninfringement of this nature does not occur again. However, it is important to note that,due to this human error, the data controller was irrevocably unable to comply in fullwith the data subject’s access request. I consider that the irreversible deletion of thedata subject’s personal data, contained in a call recording, presented a risk to thefundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject as it prevented the data subjectfrom ever being able to exercise full control over their personal data. On this basis theDPC considers it appropriate, necessary and proportionate to issue a reprimand to thedata controller in this instance, taking into account the mitigating measures put in placeby the data controller and the risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the datasubject.Communication of revised draft decision to the data controller39.In light of the opinions received from the supervisory authorities concerned, the DPCrevised its draft decision to include a summary and analysis of the opinions expressedby the supervisory authorities concerned, as detailed in paragraphs 23 to 38 above.40.The DPC provided the data controller with a copy of both the revised draft decisionand the opinions of the supervisory authorities concerned by way of email on 01October 2020. The DPC invited the data controller to provide any final submissions inrelation to the matter by close of business 15 October 2020.10 41.The data controller responded to the DPC by way of email dated 14 October 2020.42.In its response, the data controller noted that the DPC had found that it had infringedthe GDPR, as set out at paragraph 52 below, and that the DPC had exercised itspowers in this case in line with Recital 129 and the due process requirements in Article58 of the GDPR. The data controller advised the DPC that it accepted the findings andthe associated reprimand.43.In light of the above the data controller advised the DPC that it did not wish to makeany final submissions in relation to the revised draft decision.Applicable Law44.Article 15 of the GDPR provides for an individual’s right of access. Article 15(3) statesthat “The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing”45.Article 4(2) of the GDPR defines processing as “any operation or set of operationswhich is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not byautomated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment of combination, restriction,erasure or destruction”.46.Further, Article 12(3) of the GDPR states that “The controller shall provide informationon action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without unduedelay and in any event within one month of receipt.”47.Article 12(3) further states that “That period may be extended by two further monthswhere necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. Thecontroller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month ofreceipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. “. However, I note thatthe data controller never notified the complainant of any such extension in thisinstance.Findings of Investigation48.During the investigation of the complaint, the DPC established that the complainanthad submitted an access request to the data controller via its online portal on 26September 2018. The complainant received an acknowledgment of receipt of theiraccess request from the data controller on 27 September 2018.11 49.The data controller provided the complainant with its initial response containing thecomplainant’s personal data on 10 January 2019.50.Further, in relation to the call recordings requested by the complainant, the datacontroller advised the DPC that call recordings are retained for a 90 day period fromthe date of the call. As the complainant made a call to the data controller on 05September 2018 and submitted an access request to the data controller on 26September 2018, some 21 days later, the complainant’s personal data, contained in acall recording would have been undergoing processing by the data controller as thedata controller was storing it. Therefore, this data should have been provided to thedata subject in response to their access request.51.The investigation found that the data controller failed to provide the complainant’spersonal data within one month of their request. Further, the data controller failed tonotify the complainant of any extension to the statutory timeframe allowed for underArticle 12(3) of the GDPR.Decision on infringements of the GDPR52.Following the investigation of the complaint against Ryanair DAC, I am of the opinionthat it infringed the General Data Protection Regulation as follows:•Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation when it failed to providethe complainant with a copy their personal data that was undergoingprocessing at the time of the request.•Article 12(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation in that it failed toprovide the complainant information on action taken on their request underArticle 15 within the statutory timeframe of one month.Remedial measures undertaken by Ryanair DAC 53.In respect of these infringements, it is noted that Ryanair DAC has taken certainremedial measures. With regards to Ryanair DAC’s 90 day retention period for callrecordings, the DPC notes that Ryanair DAC has placed a notice on its website pagewhere its contact numbers are located notifying users of this 90 day retention period.54.Regarding the infringement of Article 15, Ryanair DAC has informed the DPC that ithas put in place measures to ensure that an access request assignment no longerrequires human action and therefore, an access request will not be overlooked due tohuman error.12 Exercise of corrective power by the DPC 55.In light of the extent of the infringements identified above, the DPC herebyissues a reprimand to Ryanair DAC, pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPRYours sincerely, John O’Dwyer Deputy Commissioner On behalf of the Data Protection Commission
