Since the GDPR came into effect, the Data Protection Commission has been actively monitoring complaints received from individuals in order to identify thematic and possible systemic data protection issues. A number of issues have been identified from concerns raised by individuals both in Ireland and across the EU. The identified issues pertain to MTCH Technology Services Limited’s ongoing processing of users’ personal data with regard to its processing activities in relation to the Tinder platform, the transparency surrounding the ongoing processing, and the company’s compliance with its obligations with regard to data subject right’s requests. As such, the DPC has commenced an own- volition Statutory Inquiry, with respect to MTCH Technology Services Limited, pursuant to section 110 of the Data Protection 2018 and in accordance with the co-operation mechanism outlined under Article 60 of the GDPR. The Inquiry of the DPC will set out to establish whether the company has a legal basis for the ongoing processing of its users’ personal data and whether it meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency and its compliance with data subject right’s requests.
