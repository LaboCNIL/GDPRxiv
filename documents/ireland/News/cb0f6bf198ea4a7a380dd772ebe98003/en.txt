The DPC has today published guidance that will assist elected representatives in having a strong awareness of their obligations and responsibilities as data controllers under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.
These materials have been developed on foot of extensive consultations carried out by the Data Protection Commission with relevant stakeholders with the aim of identifying and addressing the most pertinent issues regarding the processing of personal data, which affect public representatives in carrying out their functions.
