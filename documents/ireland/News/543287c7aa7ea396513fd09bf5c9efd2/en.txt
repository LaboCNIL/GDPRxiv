The Data Protection Commission (“the DPC”) was today delighted to be invited to make its first address before the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (“the LIBE Committee”). The address coincided with the five-year anniversary of the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (“the GDPR”) and covered a wide-range of topics, including the extensive enforcement work of the DPC over the last five years and the progress of some of the large-scale investigations it currently has on-hand; in particular those relating to TikTok.
Today’s address by Commissioner for Data Protection, Helen Dixon, built on the ongoing positive engagement between the DPC and the LIBE Committee, following the visit of a LIBE delegation to the DPC’s offices last September. Welcoming the chance to highlight the successful enforcement work of the DPC to date, Commissioner Dixon reflected on the constructive and useful nature of engagement with the LIBE Committee “as we each, from our respective remits, pursue the drive for fair and effective enforcement of data protection law and protection of fundamental rights.”
Commissioner Dixon was also pleased to answer questions from the MEPs in attendance and provide additional clarity as to the nature and scale of the DPC’s work.
