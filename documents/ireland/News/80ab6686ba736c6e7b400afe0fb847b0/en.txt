The Data Protection Commission (DPC) submitted a draft decision in a large scale inquiry into TikTok Technology Limited to other Concerned Supervisory Authorities across the EU on 13 September 2022. This inquiry was commenced in September 2021 and it examined certain processing of the personal data of children by TikTok. The Inquiry focuses on processing of child users’ personal data in the context of the platform settings of the TikTok platform, in particular public-by-default processing of such platform settings in relation to users under age 18 accounts and age verification measures for persons under 13. The Inquiry also considers whether TikTok has complied with the GDPR’s transparency obligations in the context of the processing of personal data of users under age 18.
 
Deputy Commissioner, Graham Doyle commented:
“As the EU Lead Supervisory Authority for TikTok, the DPC opened this inquiry in September 2021. The DPC has submitted its draft decision to its colleagues for their views on it today. This is part of the process under Article 60 of the GDPR, where the DPC sends draft decisions to other Concerned Supervisory Authorities and they have one month to review its draft decision and raise any ‘relevant and reasoned objections’ that they may have.”
