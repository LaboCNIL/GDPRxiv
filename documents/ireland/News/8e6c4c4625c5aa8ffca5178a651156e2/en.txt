The first inquiry will examine TikTok’s compliance with the GDPR’s data protection by design and default requirements as they relate to the processing of personal data in the context of platform settings for users under age 18 and age verification measures for persons under 13. This inquiry will also examine whether TikTok has complied with the GDPR’s transparency obligations in the context of the processing of personal data of users under age 18.  
The second inquiry will focus on transfers by Tiktok of personal data to China and TikTok’s compliance with the GDPR’s requirements for transfers of personal data to third countries.
