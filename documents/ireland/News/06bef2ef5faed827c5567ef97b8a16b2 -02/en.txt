The Data Protection Commission has received a number of breach notifications from Facebook since the introduction of the GDPR on 25 May  2018. With reference to these data breaches, including the most recent breach received, we have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook’s compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR.
