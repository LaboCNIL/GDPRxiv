The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has today published the final report of the independent KOSI audit of resource allocation at the DPC. The audit reflected on structure, numbers of staff and the efficacy of the current organisational model in the light of risks arising from post-GDPR requirements, while also considering how the DPC aligns with the structures of peer and analogous bodies.
The scope of the audit included consideration of demands on the DPC in terms of volumes and caseload, the current organisation structural model, resource allocation, gap and any perceived deterioration in the risk model.
