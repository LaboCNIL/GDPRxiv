DPC Ireland notes the media reports in relation to Google and location data. For clarity, DPC Ireland, in the immediate aftermath (on the 15th August) of the publication of the Associated Press story, raised a number of questions with Google in relation to those issues and required an urgent response. Google has committed to a response in the coming days. Once in receipt of that response, the DPC will assess the position and take all appropriate next steps.
