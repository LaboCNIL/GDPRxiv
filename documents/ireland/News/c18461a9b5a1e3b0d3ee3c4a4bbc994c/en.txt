The Data Protection Commission (DPC) submitted a draft decision in an inquiry into Instagram to other Concerned Supervisory Authorities across the EU on Friday last, December 3rd. This inquiry was commenced in September 2020 and it examined certain processing of the personal data of children by Facebook Ireland Limited in the context of the “Instagram” social networking service. Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle commented:
“As the Lead Supervisory Authority for Facebook/Instagram, we opened this inquiry in September 2020. It was commenced in response to information provided to the DPC by a third party, and also in connection with issues identified by the DPC following examination of the Instagram user registration process. We last week submitted our draft decision to our colleagues for their views on it. This is part of the process under Article 60 of the GDPR, where we send draft decisions to other Concerned Supervisory Authorities and they have one month to send us their “reasoned and relevant objections”. This is the seventh DPC inquiry to have reached the Article 60 stage under the GDPR. In addition to this Instagram inquiry, two other DPC inquiries into Facebook are currently at the Article 60 stage.”
