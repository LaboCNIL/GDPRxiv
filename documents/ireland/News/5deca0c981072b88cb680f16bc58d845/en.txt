In December 2020, the Data Protection Commission (“DPC”) published draft guidance entitled “Children Front and Centre: Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing” (the “Fundamentals”). The Fundamentals were informed by the output of the two-streamed public consultation which the DPC ran during the first half of 2019, as well as by extensive legal analysis and expert input from key child rights stakeholders over the course of 2019 and 2020.
Between 18 December 2020 and 31 March 2021, the DPC ran a public consultation on the draft version of the Fundamentals to give stakeholders a final opportunity to present their views.
Following on from this consultation, the DPC has published this report in order to give an insight into the level of engagement we experienced and to provide an overview of the headline trends and themes emerging from the feedback we received from stakeholders in their submissions, as well as the DPC’s responses to this feedback.
