The fifth Language Scheme was prepared in accordance with Section 15 of the Official Languages Act 2003 (“the Act”) by the Data Protection Commission (DPC). Section 15 provides for the preparation by Public Bodies of a statutory scheme detailing the services they will provide:

through the medium of Irish;
through the medium of English; and
through the medium of Irish and English

and the measures to be adopted to ensure that any service not provided by the body through the medium of the Irish language will be so provided within an agreed timeframe.
The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has confirmed this scheme. The scheme shall remain in force for a period of 3 years from 21 December 2020 or until a new scheme has been approved, whichever is the later.
A copy of this scheme has been forwarded to the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga.
The Fifth Language Scheme of the Data Protection Commission 2020 – 2023 is available here.
