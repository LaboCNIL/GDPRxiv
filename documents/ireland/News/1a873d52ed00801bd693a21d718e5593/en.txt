The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has established a DPC-facilitated DPO Network. The first initiative that we are rolling out is the DPO Network conference in The Helix, Dublin on 31 March 2020.
The DPC-facilitated DPO Network will foster peer-to-peer engagement and knowledge sharing between Data Protections Officers (DPOs). The Conference will feature leading experts in the field of data protection, working through the application of data protection legislation in a practical and applicable way.
The DPC has engaged with different DPO Networks in the past few months and also sought feedback from DPOs working in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors on topics that they would like covered through our Network.
As a result of this engagement the Conference will focus on areas such as;

Risk Assessing
Data Breaches
Access and Erasure
Legal Basis
Legitimate Interest
Data Sharing in the Public Sector
