The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched a statutory inquiry under Section 110 of the Data Protection Act, 2018 arising from the revelations on last Thursdayâ€™s Prime Time programme on RTE concerning the processing by the Department of Health of the personal data of children with autism who were involved in legal actions against the State. The inquiry will examine whether or not the Department of Health has discharged its obligations in connection with the data processing concerned and it will determine whether or not any provisions of the Data Protection Acts and/or the GDPR have been contravened by the Department of Health in that context. A team of Authorised Officers has been appointed by the Commission to conduct the inquiry.
