The Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing (the Fundamentals) have been drawn up by the Data Protection Commission (DPC) to drive improvements in standards of data processing. They introduce child-specific data protection interpretative principles and recommended measures that will enhance the level of protection afforded to children against the data processing risks posed to them by their use of/ access to services in both an online and offline world. In tandem, the Fundamentals will assist organisations that process children’s data by clarifying the principles, arising from the high-level obligations under the GDPR, to which the DPC expects such organisations to adhere.
The Fundamentals have been informed by the output of the two-streamed public consultation which the DPC ran during the first half of 2019. One stream of this consultation was addressed directly to children and young people and encouraged them to consider and give their views on the use of their own personal data and their rights in a social media context. The other stream of the consultation was addressed to all other stakeholders including parents, educators and children’s rights organisations, as well as organisations which process children’s data.
