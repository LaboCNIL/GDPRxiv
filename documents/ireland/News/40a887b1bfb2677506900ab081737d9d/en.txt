The Data Protection Commission today welcomed the outcome of the prosecution proceeding that was taken this morning in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court against one prominent telecommunication company in relation to marketing offences under S.I. 336 of 2011 in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.
Vodafone Ireland Limited pleaded guilty to one charge of making an unsolicited marketing telephone call without consent. The case concerned a customer who received a marketing call to her mobile phone number in July 2021. The complainant had opted out of marketing since March 2018. Vodafone Ireland Limited had carried out a manual check of preferences in advance of conducting the communication and due to human error the complainant was included. The court applied the Probation of Offenders Act in this case on the basis that the company will donate €500 to the Little Flower Penny Dinners charity.
The defendant company agreed to cover the DPC’s prosecution costs.
