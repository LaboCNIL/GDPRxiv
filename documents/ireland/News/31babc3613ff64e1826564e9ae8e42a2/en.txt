In December 2021, the DPC settled legal proceedings with the Department of Social Protection (D/SP) on the D/SP’s processing of personal data when issuing Public Service Card.
In 2021, the DPC published its finalised Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing, giving much-needed direction to organisations involved in the processing of children’s data.

Staff numbers increased to 190 and budget increased to €19.1 million (€23.2 million in 2022).

The Commissioner for Data Protection, Helen Dixon, commented:
“2021 has been a year of strong regulatory results from the DPC, in which it delivered impactful and far-reaching outcomes for the protection of individuals’ personal data. The GDPR is a strong framework law that demands accountability, fairness and transparency from all organisations that process personal data. It is clear that “data controllers” in Ireland continue to improve their compliance efforts, but higher standards of responsiveness to individuals seeking to exercise their rights are still needed in many sectors. The DPC will continue to target enforcement actions aimed at driving those necessary improvements, in addition to publishing decisions and case studies on its website to guide data controllers in the application of the GDPR. Operationalising the aims of the GDPR is an important work-in-progress for all of us and must continue. “
