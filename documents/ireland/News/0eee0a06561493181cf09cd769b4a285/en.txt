The Data Protection Commission, in its role as Lead Supervisory Authority for Google, has received a number of complaints from various Consumer Organisations across the EU, in which concerns were raised with regard to Google’s processing of location data. The issues raised within the concerns relate to the legality of Google’s processing of location data and the transparency surrounding that processing. As such the DPC has commenced an own-volition Statutory Inquiry, with respect to Google Ireland Limited,  pursuant to Section 110 of the Data Protection 2018 and in accordance with the co-operation mechanism outlined under Article 60 of the GDPR. The Inquiry will set out to establish whether Google has a valid legal basis for processing the location data of its users and whether it meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency.
