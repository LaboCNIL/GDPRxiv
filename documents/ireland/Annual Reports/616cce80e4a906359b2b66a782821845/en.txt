While 2022 saw significant output from the DPC in its efforts to drive GDPR compliance and protect the rights of those in Ireland and across the EU, it is perhaps both the number - and value - of the fines levied by the DPC against big technology firms that have most visibly demonstrated the GDPR’s ability to enforce effective data protection.I am pleased to present this Annual Report for 2022 which includes details of: in excess of €1billion in punitive fines issued; multiple reprimands and/or compliance orders supervised and enforced following the conclusion of 13 large-scale inquiries; 10,008 individual cases resolved; 4 successful prosecutions under the ePrivacy legislation in respect of 2 companies; observations in relation to 30 pieces of new legislation provided to Government and the Oireachtas; over 300 European Data Protection Board meetings contributed to.Two-thirds of the fines issued across Europe last year, including the EU, EEA, and UK, were issued by the DPC on foot of detailed and comprehensive investigations, a fact that underlines both the outsized role, and exceptional performance, of the organisation in effectively holding those guilty of non-compliance to account. Summaries of these significant decisions are detailed on page 21 of the report, with full decisions published on the DPC’s website. While the extent of these fines has garnered significant attention from stakeholders and the media in 2022, these decisions also demonstrate the DPC’s willingness to use other potentially more significant corrective powers, such as orders, to bring about improvements in corporate behaviour and avoid further transgressions.Progress on other large-scale inquiries, including the DPC’s investigation of Facebook’s transfers of EU personal data to the USA, are further detailed on pages 27 to 29. Final decisions in several of these cases will be reached in the coming months. Many of the concluded cross-border DPC decisions have had legal proceedings lodged against them by the relevant regulated entity, including appeal and judicial review proceedings in Ireland. Fines cannot be collected until the Irish courts confirm the fine. An application to confirm the fine cannot be made by the DPC while an appeal is lodged against it. This can amount to a lengthy process. In addition, the relevant regulated entities have also in a number of cases lodged annulment proceedings against European Data Protection Board (EDPB) decisions that informed the adoption of the final decision by the DPC in those cases. A decision of the General Court of the CJEU (T-709-/21) in December 2022 found WhatsApp’s application for annulment of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) decision of July 2021 against the company to be inadmissible as WhatsApp, the court said, lacked the necessary standing to make the application. Despite the binding nature of the EDPB’s decisions, the law, as it now stands, states that such decisions cannot be directly challenged by the complainant or controller parties. Instead it requires WhatsApp, in this instance, to apply to the Irish High Court, as part of its appeal against the DPC’s Final Decision, to make a preliminary reference to the CJEU concerning the validity of the EDPB decision. The novelty of the political and economic compromise that led to the creation of the One-Stop-Shop, in its current form, has created something of a legal maze that requires constant navigation, building an ever more complex landscape for litigators.Big Year, Big LawPage 33 sets out litigation involving the DPC in which written judgments issued last year. The volume of preliminary references from national courts to the Court of Justice of the European (CJEU) Union on issues not considered “acte clair” under GDPR has continued to increase with around 45 cases currently pending decision at the CJEU. The volume of cases pending at the CJEU signals that it may take some further time before points of legal certainty are Commissioner’s Foreword78Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022reached on interpretations of key articles of the GDPR. Several important data protection decisions issued from the CJEU in 2022 including a far-reaching decision in August that significantly broadens the interpretation of when special category data is processed (C-184/20). The CJEU also repeated again and again (C-793/19 and C794-19) last year that EU law precludes the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data relating to electronic communications for the purposes of combating serious crime, including in a reference case from Ireland (C-140/20).Compensation cases in the EU appear to be continuing the same trend as the last few years with only conservative awards, if any at all, made by Member State courts where cases have progressed to hearing. The first compensation case under section 117 of the 2018 Act to proceed to hearing in Ireland did not buck that trend. It was dismissed in 2022 by the Circuit Civil Court judge ordering the SIPTU members who took the case against their union to pay its costs. The case was taken after the Union inadvertently sent an email with the names and addresses of the claimants to a group of 212 other SIPTU members. The Judge, however, found that proof of more than minimal loss was necessary and that no evidence was presented of any actual loss suffered by the claimants resulting from the email distribution. Important consultations were initiated by Government Departments with the DPC on more than 30 legislative projects and the DPC appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice as part of its consideration of the General Scheme of the Communications (Retention of Data) (Amendment) Bill 2022. The DPC’s observations were urgently requested by the Government on amendments to the Data Retention Act, on foot of the CJEU judgment in April, however these new provisions have not yet been commenced by Government. The Circular Economy Act, the Digital Recordings Bill, the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, and the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill should, in due course, provide for the proportionate and necessary use of CCTV and Automatic Number Plate Technologies, with clear and precise rules as to how these technologies may be used by Local Authorities and An Garda Síochána, in circumstances where there is currently insufficient legislative underpinning for the data processing. The DPC has issued a number of decisions relating to personal-data processing by local authorities for a variety of purposes by means of CCTV technology where non-compliance with the 2018 Act and the GDPR was found. NatioNaL DecisioNs aND compLaiNt-HaNDLiNgThe DPC also demonstrated the extraordinary strength of its record in concluding examinations into a wide range of alleged infringements of the GDPR across various sectors last year. Enforcement action covered personal-data security matters in healthcare, banking and insurance sectors; failure to appoint and notify a Data Protection Officer to the DPC; and non-compliance with obligations under the Law Enforcement Directive. Taken in the round, they demonstrate that a failure to adequately assess the risks relating to the particular personal-data processing context of an organisation and to implement correspondingly appropriate technical and organisational measures will lead to poor outcomes for all concerned.The handling of individual complaints is an important and high-volume area of the DPC’s remit. Because of the importance of access rights to unlocking other rights under the GDPR, complaints about access to their personal data remain the most frequent type of complaint the DPC receives. There has been a marked improvement in the response of public sector bodies to access requests, likely due to Data Protection Officers gaining experience in this area and the implementation of improved procedures by these bodies. Complaints from home-occupiers about neighbours’ CCTV remain frequent and often intractable where the complaints bring in many issues outside of the scope of data protection. Cross-border complaints from individuals ground the majority of interactions between EU data protection authorities. Of complaints lodged with the Irish DPC from individuals living here that relate to the actions of a company in another EU member state, 48% have had a resolution via other EU data protection authorities. Of complaints handled by the DPC redirected by other EU authorities, the DPC has resolved 71%. The operation of the One-Stop-Shop in these matters often does not serve individuals well as a result of the way in which it is constructed. For example, an Irish citizen lodged a complaint with the DPC in 2019 about a German company from which they were seeking a spare part. The company had passed on the complainant’s details, without their consent, to a UK supplier who had the required spare part. In accordance with the requirements of the GDPR, the DPC referred the complaint to the relevant German authority. Despite the apparent simplicity of the issue, the matter took more than three years to resolve. This is in part due to the requirements for constant back and forth between authorities, necessitating the translation of communications from English to German and vice versa. A final decision was eventually issued in January 2023 from the German authority, however resolution for the complainant, and the respondent, were delayed by the unnecessarily protracted process required by the operation of the One-Stop-Shop. It also involves the transmission of the complainant’s personal data around an unnecessarily large number of investigative staff in various EU data protection authorities. This issue requires examination by legislators to improve the timeliness and appropriate handling of decisions for EU citizens.eU DigitaL regULatioN It has been clear for quite some time that the general purpose, technology-neutral GDPR does not have, nor was intended to have, the answers to all of the potential harms that can arise online. The new wave of EU digital regulation, including the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA), will ensure elements of ex-ante regulation for gatekeepers and Very Large Online Platforms, seeking to create better protections for internet users and online consumers in the EU. Co-ordination between digital regulators in Ireland and at EU level will be vital in ensuring issues relating to platform regulation do not fall between the gaps of the various legal instruments. The DPC looks forward to working with other regulators, particularly in the priority area of protection of children online. tHe roaD aHeaD is LoNg2023 will bring big new decisions from the DPC; more judgments from the CJEU; more data protection litigation involving DPC heard in Ireland; the start of application of certain provisions of the DSA and DMA; and the commencement of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act in Ireland, among other developments. These latter developments will see the entry of regulators of digital platforms onto the pitch. 2022 was a year in which the conclusion of comprehensive DPC enforcement action brought clarity to the application and enforcement of many novel and complex issues under the GDPR. Our work in 2023 is set to continue this trend as we seek to pursue the issues of greatest consequence for data subjects, drive compliance, and, most importantly, safeguard individuals’ rights.Helen DixonCommissioner for Data Protection.910Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022sUpportiNg iNDiviDUaLsFrom 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022:•	The DPC received 21,230 electronic contacts,1 6,855 phone calls and 1,118 postal contacts;•	The DPC processed 9,370 new cases last year: 6,660 in the nature of queries that could be dealt with relatively expeditiously and 2,710 that progressed to a formal complaint-handling process.

Accordingly, the DPC is the Irish supervisory authority tasked with monitoring the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).The core functions of the DPC, under the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 — which gives further effect to the GDPR in Ireland — include:• driving improved compliance with data protection legislation by controllers and processors;• handling complaints from individuals in relation to potential infringements of their data protection rights;• conducting inquiries and investigations into potential infringements of data protection legislation;• promoting awareness among organisations and the public of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights incumbent in the processing of personal data; and• co-operating with data protection authorities in other EU member states on issues, involving cross-border processing.The DPC also acts as supervisory authority for personal-data processing under several additional legal frameworks. These include the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive 2016/680, as transposed in Ireland under the Data Protection Act 2018) which applies to the processing of personal data by bodies with law-enforcement functions in the context of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or execution of criminal penalties. The DPC also performs certain supervisory and enforcement functions in relation to the processing of personal data in the context of electronic communications under the e-Privacy Regulations (S.I. No. 336 of 2011).In addition to its functions under the GPDR, the DPC continues to perform its regulatory functions under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, in respect of complaints and investigations that relate to the period before 25 May 2018, as well as in relation to certain limited other categories of processing, irrespective of whether that processing occurred before or after 25 May 2018.In addition to specific data protection legislation, there are in the region of 20 more pieces of legislation, spanning a variety of sectoral areas, concerning the processing of personal data, where the DPC must perform a particular supervisory function assigned to it under that legislation.roles and responsibilitiesDpc’s seNior teamThe DPC’s Senior Management Committee (SMC) comprises the Commissioner for Data Protection, and nine Heads of Function. The Commissioner and members of the SMC oversee the proper management and governance of the organisation, in line with the principles set out in the Corporate Governance Standard for the Civil Service (2015). The SMC has a formal schedule of matters for consideration and decision, as appropriate, to ensure effective oversight and control of the organisation.During 2022, the SMC comprised:• Helen Dixon, Commissioner for Data Protection;• Ian Chambers, Head of Regulatory Activity [from November 2022];• Tony Delaney, Head of Regulatory Activity;• MB Donnelly, Head of Strategy, Governance, Finance, and Risk [from November 2022];• Graham Doyle, Head of Corporate Affairs, People and Learning, Media and Communications;• Cian O’Brien, Head of Large-Scale Inquiries and Investigations [from May 2022];• Ultan O’Carroll, Head of Technology, Operational and Performance;• Fleur O’Shea, Head of Legal [from April 2022];• Sandra Skehan, Head of Regulatory Activity [from May 2022]; • Dale Sunderland, Head of Regulatory Consultation, Supervision, Guidance and International Affairs;• John O’Dwyer, Deputy Commissioner, Head of Regulatory Activity [up to October 2022];• Anna Morgan, Deputy Commissioner, Head of Legal [up to April 2022]; and• Colum Walsh, Deputy Commissioner, Head of Regulatory Activity [up to June 2022].fUNDiNg aND aDmiNistratioN – vote 44 The DPC is funded entirely by the Exchequer.

The ePrivacy Regulations implement Directive 2002/58/EC (‘the ePrivacy Directive’) in Irish law.The DPC received 204 new complaints in relation to electronic direct marketing in 2022. These included some 118 complaints in relation to email messages, 52 complaints in relation to text messages, 28 complaints in relation to cookies and 6 complaints concerning phone calls. A total of 207 electronic direct marketing investigations were concluded in 2022.

The OSS allows for these organisations to be subject to direct oversight by just one DPA, where they have a ‘main establishment’, rather than being subject to separate regulation by the data protection authorities of each member state. The main establishment of an organisation is generally its place of central administration and/or decision making in the EU/EEA.  In 2022, the DPC - as Lead Supervisory Authority - received 125 valid cross-border complaints, with 246 cross-border complaints concluded by the DPC during the year.  Also in 2022 – as a Concerned Supervisory Authority – the DPC received 12 valid cross-border complaints which it transmitted onwards for resolution to the relevant Lead Authority in the EU. Since 2018, the DPC has received 1,205 cross-border processing complaints through the OSS. In addition, the DPC has been a Concerned Supervisory Authority in respect of 96 cross-border complaints. The complaints handled by the DPC as Lead Authority were either lodged directly with the DPC by individuals in other EU countries, or they were lodged by individuals with other EU data protection authorities and passed to the DPC under the OSS.

In order for the ‘LED’ to be applicable, the data controller must also be a “competent authority” as set out in Section 69 of the Data Protection Act 2018. In 2022, the DPC received 38 LED complaints and concluded 58 LED complaints (including complaints received prior to 2022) the majority of which involved An Garda Síochána as the data controller but also included organisations such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.immeDiate Direct iNterveNtioNThe DPC prioritises and directly intervenes in issues that give rise to immediate data protection concerns for large groups of people, in order to ensure a timely response on matters that may potentially have wide repercussions.Matters prioritised for direct intervention in 2022 included:• Census data collection practices.• Residential property sector– excessive data collection.• Mobile home park– excessive data collection.• CCTV in cinemas, school toilets, fast-food outlets, nursing home, medical centre.• Remote access to CCTV as a substitute for onsite workplace supervision.In selecting certain matters for direct intervention, the DPC is particularly cognisant of its Regulatory Strategy 2022-2027, which identifies “the elderly, non-native speakers and those from at-risk demographics such as the homeless as being in need of specific supports to ensure their data protection rights are upheld.”compLaiNts UNDer tHe Data protectioN acts 1988 & 2003The DPC continues to receive and examine a small number of complaints that fall under the remit of the Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003. The DPC received 12 such cases in 2022. The Commissioner issued 22 formal decisions under the Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003 in 2022, of which 6 fully upheld the complaint, 12 partially upheld the complaint and 4 rejected the complaint.

A total of 5,695 valid GDPR data breaches were recorded, representing a 13% decrease (854) on the GDPR data breach numbers reported in 2021. Since the introduction of GDPR – and in line with previous years – the highest category of data breaches notified to the DPC in 2022 related to unauthorised disclosures, in cases affecting one or small numbers of individuals, accounting for 62% of the total notifications. Of the total 5,828 breach notifications that the DPC received in 2022, in terms of breakdown, 3,014 related to the private sector, 2,568 to the public sector and the remaining 246 came from the voluntary and charity sector. breaChes52%44%4%Breach Notifications -BreakdownPrivate Sector (3,014)Public Sector (2,568)Voluntary & Charity Sector(246)1920Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022The DPC received a total of 105 valid data-breach notifications (an increase of 176% on 2021 figure) under the ePrivacy Regulations, which accounted for just under 2% of total valid breach cases notified for the year. As predicted in its 2021 Annual Report, the number of breaches notified to the DPC under the ePrivacy Regulations increased significantly in 2022, due to changes in ePrivacy legislation. The 105 valid data-breaches notified to the DPC in 2022 represents a three-fold increase on the previous year’s figures. Law eNforcemeNt Directive BreacHesThe DPC also received 38 breach notifications in relation to the LED, (Directive (EU) 2016/680), which has been transposed into Irish law, by certain parts of the Data Protection Act 2018.

Notably, correspondence issuing to incorrect recipients as a result of poor operational practices and human error - for example inserting a wrong document into an envelope addressed to an unrelated third party – has featured prominently. Additionally, autofill options on email address bars have given rise to a significant number of breach notifications, where emails have been misdirected. These types of errors are attributable to both a failure on the part of organisations to update data in a timely fashion and, in some instances, customers’ failure to notify organisations of a change of address. The DPC continually monitors such breach notifications received, to identify trends and inform potential inquiries. Consequently, in 2022, the DPC issued decisions - and applied fines and sanctions - in a number of inquiries relating to the financial, insurance and public sectors, including Bank of Ireland plc, An Garda Síochána, and Limerick City and County Council. The DPC has noted in particular that its decision pertaining to Bank of Ireland has generated an increase in reports from lending institutions to the DPC, as they apply the learnings from the Bank of Ireland decision to the own   processing operations and proactively seek to address any gaps in their operating practices. Details of these decisions can be found on pages 23 - 26.eprivacY BreacHesAn ePrivacy breach is a breach that is notified to the DPC under Regulation 4 of S.I. 336/2011 - European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2011 (‘the ePrivacy Regulations’), that specifically relates to providers of publically available electronic communications services / networks, e.g. telecommunications companies or online messaging platform providers. All breaches under the ePrivacy Regulations should be notified to the DPC no later than 24 hours after the detection of the personal data breach, regardless of the degree of risk they are believed to pose.The new European Union (Electronic Communications Code) Regulations 2022 in Ireland (SI 444/2022) E amended in September 2022 a number of definitions including the definition of “electronic communications service”, such that certain services such as “over-the-top” services are now brought within the scope of that definition. This will include services such as messaging services. As a result, providers of a wider range of services were required to notify personal data breaches to the DPC.European Union Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders meets with DPC staff.2122Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022statUtorY iNqUiries BY tHe DpcUnder the Data Protection Act 2018, the DPC may conduct two different types of statutory inquiry under Section 110 in order to establish whether an infringement of the GDPR or the 2018 Act has occurred:• a complaint-based inquiry; and• an inquiry of the DPC’s “own volition”. The objective of any inquiry is to:• establish the facts as they apply to the matters under investigation;• apply the provisions of the GDPR and/or 2018 Act as applicable to the facts as found in order to analyse whether an infringement of the GDPR and/or 2018 Act has been identified;• make a formal decision of the DPC in relation to whether or not there is an infringement; and• where an infringement has been identified, make a formal decision on whether or not to exercise a corrective power, and if so, which corrective power2. 2) Corrective powers include imposing an administrative fine (not applicable for infringements of the LED), issuing a warning, a reprimand, a temporary or definitive ban on processing or a suspension of international data transfers or a direction to bring processing into compliance, amongst others.

The personal data breach occurred when a third party organisation (‘the Third Party’) contracted by PIAB returned materials containing personal data to PIAB on an unencrypted USB key in a paper envelope, which USB key was ultimately lost in the post with only a ripped envelope delivered to PIAB.The Inquiry considered whether the PIAB had complied with its obligation to implement an appropriate level of security under Article 32 GDPR. The DPC issued its decision on 24 January 2022 and found no infringement in circumstances where PIAB had requested in advance that the Third Party not send the personal data to PIAB and where it could not have foreseen that the Third Party would post an unencrypted USB storage device in an unpadded envelope by ordinary (not registered) post. A Consultancy ProviderThis inquiry was commenced in respect of a personal data breach that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (‘PIAB’) reported to the Data Protection Commission on 10 December 2019, which, as set out above, occurred when a Consultancy Provider sent an unencrypted USB storage device, containing personal data to PIAB, despite PIAB expressly stating the data was not to be sent.The DPC issued its decision on 24 January 2022 and found that the Consultancy Provider had infringed Article 32(1) GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by its processing of personal data.

Article 32(1) GDPR was infringed by BOI’s failure to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved in transferring information to the CCR. BOI was issued with a fine of €463,000 for the infringements. BOI was also reprimanded and ordered to bring its technical and organisational measures into compliance with Article 32(1).Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council On 3 May 2022, the DPC issued its Final Decision in relation to an inquiry commenced as a result of a monitoring and enforcement exercise carried out pursuant to the tasks of a supervisory authority contained in Article 57 of the GDPR.

It was held that Allianz had complied with Article 32(1) as it had implemented policies, which were specifically tailored to the risks associated with the processing. Allianz also provided repeated training to sectors of the business, which were the most susceptible to personal data breaches of this kind. Allianz also took proactive measures to counter the increasing risk profile of some business units by implementing additional security measures after some personal data breaches occurred. Accordingly, no corrective powers were exercised in this decision.Ark LifeOn 26 September, The DPC issued its Final Decision in relation to an inquiry into personal data breach notifications from Ark Life during the period December 2018 to May 2021. The data breach notifications primarily concerned the unauthorised disclosure of personal data as a result of address inaccuracies and issues within the postal and email procedures operated by Ark Life.The decision considered whether Ark Life had complied with Article 32(1) GDPR. It found that Ark Life had implemented policies which were specifically tailored to the risks associated with the processing. Ark Life also provided repeated training to sectors of the business which were the most susceptible to personal data breaches of this kind.

These measures addressed inherent flaws in their processes concerning customer contact details and dealing with returned mail.Taking into account the quantum of data breaches, the technical and organisational measures implemented by Ark Life and the moderate to low severity of risk to data subjects, DPC concluded that Ark Life did not infringe Article 32(1). Accordingly no corrective powers were exercised in this decision.An Garda Síochána On 15 December 2022 the DPC issued a final Decision to An Garda Síochána (AGS), in respect of a data breach under Part 5 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (the LED), following a report by AGS to the DPC of a personal data breach.

At certain times, the operation of such accounts required and/or facilitated the publication (to the world-at-large) of the child user’s phone number and/or email address.2. At certain times, Meta operated a user registration system for the Instagram service whereby the accounts of child users were set to “public” by default, thereby making public the social media content of child users, unless the account was otherwise set to “private” by changing the account privacy settings.In December 2021, the DPC submitted a draft decision to the Article 60 process. The DPC received objections from other concerned supervisory authorities and was unable to reach consensus. Therefore, the DPC referred the objections to the European Data Protection Board (“EDPB”) for determination pursuant to the dispute resolution process provided for in Article 65 GDPR.

In response a number of Supervisory Authorities raised objections or made comments on the decision. The DPC issued a composite response to the objections in September 2022. A number of the CSAs maintained their objections. The DPC subsequently triggered the Article 65 dispute resolution process which is still ongoing. Airbnb Ireland UC (Airbnb)This inquiry was commenced following receipt of a complaint that Airbnb had unlawfully requested a copy of ID in order to verify the Complainant’s identity, in particular in circumstances where the Complainant, as a registered member and host with Airbnb, had not previously provided her ID to Airbnb and that Airbnb had failed to comply with the principle of data minimisation when requesting a copy of the individual’s ID in order to verify their account. In its draft decision, the DPC noted Airbnb claimed legitimate interests pursued by Airbnb as the lawful basis for requesting a copy of ID to verify identity in order to protect the safety and security of the users of the Airbnb platform, in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Noting that the platform that Airbnb operates brings hosts and members who are unknown to each other into a situation where they may actually meet in person at the host’s premises, or elsewhere, the DPC agreed that a legitimate interest existed in Airbnb ensuring it had adequate safety and security measures in place to protect users of the platform. The DPC took the view that the service operated by Airbnb is significantly different to a purely online service such as a social media platform. Given that Airbnb members stay at the premises of a host “in the real world”, the DPC recognised the importance of verifying the identity of hosts to ensure that they are who they say they are. Given that other means of validating this host’s identity failed, the DPC found that it was necessary to process the photo ID in pursuit of the legitimate interest. The DPC found that in a balancing test, the rights of the host were not prejudiced by this verification process. The DPC did not receive any relevant or reasoned objections to the draft decision from the concerned supervisory authorities under Article 60(4).cross-BorDer iNqUiries wHere sUBmissioNs oN a preLimiNarY Draft DecisioN, statemeNt of issUes, or iNqUirY report were iNviteD from tHe reLevaNt parties DUriNg 2022 aND iNqUiries tHat are cUrreNtLY at aN iNvestigative stage BY eND 2022Google Ireland Limited (Google): Location data inquiryThe DPC received a number of complaints from various consumer organisations across the EU, in which concerns were raised with regard to Google’s processing of location data. The issues raised within the concerns related to the legality of Google’s processing of location data and the transparency surrounding that processing. As such the DPC commenced an own-volition Statutory Inquiry, with respect to Google Ireland Limited, pursuant to Section 110 of the Data Protection 2018 and in accordance with the cooperation mechanism outlined under Article 60 of the GDPR. The Inquiry set out to establish whether Google has a valid legal basis for processing the location data of its users and whether it meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency. The DPC’s preliminary draft decision was provided to Google in December 2021 for its submissions. The DPC received submissions from Google and prepared a Revised Preliminary Draft Decision. On 21 December 2022, the DPC provided the Revised Preliminary Draft Decision to various consumer protection agencies for the purpose of enabling those consumer protection agencies to make observations.Facebook Ireland Limited (Facebook) (now known as Meta Platforms Ireland Limited): Personal Data Breaches affecting Facebook User TokensThis inquiry relates to an examination of whether Facebook has discharged its GDPR obligations to implement organisational and technical measures and data protection by design and default obligations to secure and safeguard the personal data of its users in connection with a data breach which occurred in September 2018 and affected Facebook user tokens.

On 9 December 2016, the DPC delivered a decision in response to a complaint by Ms Nowak against her employer, alleging that her employer had failed to comply fully with an access request she had made, within the relevant time period. In its decision, the DPC found that the employer had complied with the request, but its response was late. Ms Nowak appealed to the Circuit Court, contending that her employer (and the DPC) had misconstrued her request. The Circuit Court disagreed, upholding the DPC’s decision. On a further appeal on a point of law, the High Court likewise upheld the decision. The Court of Appeal rejected Ms Nowak’s further appeal, for the reasons set out in its judgment of 13 April 2022, noting that Ms Nowak had failed to identify any point of law that would warrant the intervention of the Court. Costs were also awarded to the DPC.

Ms Thorsch later made a further allegation to the effect that the Equality Tribunal had wrongly published her personal data online and that, because of the manner of its publication, her data had been unlawfully transferred out of the State. The DPC delivered a decision in which it upheld Ms Thorsch’s complaint insofar as the Equality Tribunal had failed to respond to her access request within the relevant time period but rejecting the other grounds of complaint. Ms Thorsch then brought an appeal to the Circuit Court in respect of the points on which her complaint had been rejected. By Order made on 31 March 2022, the Circuit Court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the appeal was time-barred, Ms Thorsch having failed to file her appeal within the relevant 21-day period.

The decision was appealed by the ODCE to the Circuit Court. By written judgment dated 1 April 2022, the Court allowed part of the appeal on the basis that the DPC had not applied fair procedures in arriving at its decision. Specifically, the Court found that, when delivering its final decision, the DPC did not give the ODCE fair notice of certain amendments it had made to a draft version of the decision previously shared with the parties.

By decision dated 20 May 2019, the DPC concluded that the employer was entitled to rely on the privilege it had asserted. Ms Scott appealed to the Circuit Court against that decision. By written judgment delivered on 4 May 2022, the Circuit Court refused the appeal, accepting the DPC’s position that the employer had made out its case in relation to its asserted entitlement to rely on privilege to withhold from releasing personal data that would otherwise need to be released in response to Ms Scott’s access request.

The DPC did not uphold Mr Doolin’s complaint, finding that the data in question had not been processed in a manner incompatible with the purpose for which it had been collected. Mr Doolin appealed the DPC’s decision to the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court upheld the decision. Mr. Doolin then brought a further appeal to the High Court on a point of law. That appeal was successful. The High Court disagreed with the DPC’s analysis, finding (in effect) that Mr Doolin’s data had been processed by his employer for a purpose other than the purpose for which it had first been collected, and where the second purpose was incompatible with the first. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court’s analysis, dismissing the DPC’s appeal and awarding costs to Mr Doolin.The proceedings have concluded.3738Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022No.Record No.TitleType of action and venueDate of Judgment/Order7.2021/04468Aimee Scott v Data Protection CommissionerStatutory AppealDublin Circuit Court17 November 2022Costs not yet dealt withOutcomeCurrent StatusMs Scott made a complaint to the DPC, alleging that a barrister had unlawfully processed her personal data in the context of an exercise to check for potential conflicts of interest before accepting instructions to act in a case for Ms Scott’s former employer. The DPC delivered a decision in response to the complaint on 2 September 2022. In its decision, the DPC found that, on the facts, the GDPR did not apply at all, on the grounds that Ms Scott’s personal data had been the subject of a verbal disclosure only. Without prejudice to that point, the DPC went on to find that, even if the GDPR did apply, the complaint could not be upheld because Ms Scott’s personal data was processed, lawfully, by reference to the legitimate interests identified as being engaged in the case.

Facebook Ireland Ltd and Maximilian Schrems, making a number of findings in connection with the adequacy of the protections available in the US for European citizens where their data is transferred from the EU to the US. The judgment also ruled that the Privacy Shield mechanism under which some EU-US transfers were being undertaken did not comply with EU law and so should be struck down. Thereafter, the DPC opened an inquiry to consider the lawfulness of EU-US data transfers from Facebook Ireland Limited to its US-based processor, Facebook Inc., delivering a Preliminary Draft Decision on 28 August 2020 Facebook Ireland Limited responded to the Preliminary Draft Decision by bringing judicial review proceedings, challenging the DPC’s decision to open the inquiry and taking issue with the procedures adopted by the DPC in that connection. As well as joining in Facebook’s proceedings, Max Schrems separately brought his own judicial review proceedings likewise challenging the DPC’s inquiry into Facebook’s EU-US transfers. In a judgment delivered by the High Court on 14 May 2021, the High Court dismissed Facebook’s objections to the DPC’s inquiry. Thereafter, certain orders were made on consent on 20 May 2021, including an order that FBI pay 90% of the DPC’s Commission’s costs of the Facebook proceedings and all of Mr. Schrems’ costs of those proceedings. The (separate) proceedings brought by Mr. Schrems, had earlier been settled on terms agreed between the parties. Exceptionally, the parties were unable to reach agreement on the costs of the proceedings. In a follow-on judgment delivered by the High Court on 29 September 2022, the Court decided that the DPC should pay 80% of Mr. Schrems’ costs of his proceedings. The Court deducted 20% of the costs to reflect the fact that Mr. Schrems did not ultimately pursue his claim for an order quashing the DPC’s inquiry or for certain of the other (ancillary) reliefs referred to in his case.The proceedings have concluded.Commissioner Helen Dixon (DPC) and Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle (DPC) engage  with all EU Ambassadors to Ireland hosted by the French Ambassador to Ireland H.

The aim of supervision engagement is to offer guidance to stakeholders and to connect proactively as a regulator with a visible presence, ensuring the data protection rights of service users are upheld. In this context, the DPC promotes and aims to maintain open and regular communication with such stakeholders which includes organisations. In this way, the DPC advocates for the rights of individuals by mitigating against potential infringements before they occur. The Supervision function also facilitates prompt reaction by the DPC, where appropriate, to data protection concerns as they emerge.The supervision function is an important part of the regulatory framework, as ensuring best practice is applied at project planning stages results in better outcomes for data subjects and less need for resource-intensive ex-post activity for the DPC. However, if during engagement with the supervision function it appears necessary for the DPC to take enforcement action against a particular organisation, the DPC is not precluded from taking relevant action in such circumstances    The DPC received 322 consultation requests during 2022.

In so doing, the DPC seeks to promote data protection by design and the upholding of data protection rights within legislation where the processing of personal data may result.In 2022, some of the legislative measures that the DPC engaged in consultation on were:• Civil Law (Misc.

The DPC recognises that transparency is fundamental to the integrity of the planning process, and maintaining the trust and confidence of the public in the work of the planning authorities. However, the requirement to publish information relating to planning applications must be balanced with the legitimate privacy concerns and data protection rights of individuals. Particular concerns can arise, for example, where applicants submit special category personal data relating to family members, who may be children or vulnerable adults, in support of their planning application. Planning applicants, and those making submissions in relation to applications, can also occasionally provide information relating to third parties, without their knowledge.The DPC engaged with the Local Authorities Data Protection Officer Network, the Local Government Management Agency, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a set of principles was collectively developed for policies to be implemented to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck in the online publication of planning material between the transparency requirements of the planning process and the data protection rights of individuals. These policies will ensure that excessive or irrelevant data is not inappropriately published, in particular information about people’s health or children’ data. There will also be opportunity for applicants to request that their data be reviewed subsequent to publication, taking into consideration their own circumstances. In the interests of transparency in the planning process, it will always be necessary for certain elements of personal data to be made available to the public, and it is important that this is explained in a clear and understandable way to planning applicants.As the planning process moves towards a national ePlanning model, the DPC will continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure that data protection implications are considered appropriately.Housing Agency Collaboration on Owners’ Management Companies guidanceIn 2022, the DPC published detailed guidance on the Data Protection Considerations Relating to Multi-Unit Developments and Owners’ Management Companies (OMCs), following extensive collaborative engagement with the Housing Agency.For some time, both the DPC and the Housing Agency had identified the OMC sector as a regular source of data protection queries relating to a number of issues. Examples of this include access to and use of data held on the register of company members, personal data of tenants, and the deployment of CCTV in common areas. Involvement with OMCs is an ever-increasing part of the Irish housing landscape, and the sector’s activities entail significant data processing between residents (owner-occupiers and tenants), landlords, and property management agents. The development of this guidance document represented a positive engagement between the DPC and another statutory body (The Housing Agency), combining specific sectoral knowledge with the application of the principles of data protection to bring forward a solution to an identified problem area. In line with the DPC’s commitments under its Regulatory Strategy 2022-2027 to promote data protection awareness, and to support organisations and drive compliance, the DPC will continue to look for opportunities to work with other statutory bodies and sectoral representative groups to develop targeted and relevant guidance. Adult Safeguarding and Data Protection The DPC’s Regulatory Strategy 2022-2027 sets out a commitment to prioritise the protection of children and other vulnerable groups.As part of this strategic goal, in 2022, the DPC commenced a process of stakeholder engagement to discuss data protection concerns arising in the context of adult safeguarding. The first strand of these discussions addressed, in particular, the processing of sensitive personal data and information relating to those living in adult residential care settings. Concerns that can arise in this context, and that may result in safeguarding actions which require the processing of personal data, can include allegations of inappropriate or potentially illegal behaviour onsite, and suspicions of financial abuse or coercive control of residents by third parties. Questions can also arise in these contexts regarding the sharing of information with family members of residents. The aim of the DPC’s engagement with stakeholders in this sector is to assist in providing clarity and certainty to adult safeguarding organisations regarding their data protection obligations, in particular when dealing with sensitive situations. The DPC has already issued some guidance to the stakeholders on processing particularly sensitive information arsing in certain situations, including handling requests for information from concerned family members. The DPC’s overall aim is to foster a consistent approach to data protection across the wider sector, to promote equality, prevent discrimination and ensure that the data protection rights of vulnerable groups are given appropriate consideration. This consultative engagement process will continue in 2023, looking at additional solutions to identified sectoral issues including, for example, published guidance, and the possibility for the development of codes of conduct.pUBLic sector, Law eNforcemeNt aND sociaL protectioNLocal Authority CCTV schemeIn early 2022, the Data Protection Commission received a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) from a local authority seeking to implement an expansive city-based community CCTV scheme. The cameras were technologically sophisticated and had Pan Tilt, Zoom and other ‘smart’ capabilities. It was the intention of the local authority to effectively use these cameras for 24/7 surveillance of certain high-crime areas. The proposed locations for the cameras were primarily open public spaces. However a number of these cameras were to be in positions where they could capture images from the upstairs windows of private dwellings. The DPC raised a number of concerns about this planned data processing, in particular about the justification for 24/7 surveillance and the intrusiveness of some of the cameras ‘smart’ capabilities. The DPC emphasised the necessity for robust security measures, the need to respect the privacy rights of residents and the responsibility on the local authority, as a data controller, to protect the public and mitigate the risks this processing could have for children and vulnerable members of society.In response to these concerns, the local authority decided to disable the auto-scan and roaming capabilities of all cameras and also chose to turn off a number of the cameras, following a further necessity analysis. In response to the DPC’s concerns about protecting individual privacy rights and the need to safeguard the vulnerable, the local authority implemented further security measures, including regular staff training, strict access controls, shortened retention periods, strict procedures to view and download camera footage, the implementation of an oversight board, and other measures. The local authority also revised its plans for 24/7 monitoring by default to 4344Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022to Meta to improve transparency to users particularly concerning processing purposes. Meta subsequently implemented a number of updates to the Hub. These included updates to placing the in-context Help Centre article in a more prominent and easily accessible position within the Hub. Additionally, for ease of access to users and non-users, a link to Meta’s Data Policy and the purposes of processing are now provided through the Help Centre article.Combatting Child Sexual Abuse MaterialDuring the year the DPC engaged with several providers of interpersonal communications services such as Meta, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Google and Twitter, to review their policies, procedures and technologies relating to the processing of personal data for the purpose of combating online child sexual abuse material. The DPC has made a number of recommendations to providers in areas such as Transparency, Retention and Purpose Limitation. In response, Meta, for example, has notified the DPC that they will be updating User Notices to enhance transparency including in relation to the appeals mechanism. Engagement with the large platform providers will continue into 2023. private aND fiNaNciaL sectorMigration of customer data from KBC Bank to Bank of Ireland The DPC proactively engaged with both KBC Bank and Bank of Ireland for the migration of most of the KBC customer database of mortgage holders and persons who had credit facilities, (i.e. credit cards, loans, deposits) to Bank of Ireland. This porting of customer data is due to KBC’s pending exit from the Irish market. During its interaction with both banks, the DPC provided guidance on many issues including security of transfer, accuracy of data, providing full information to all customers and ensuring that the customers’ data protection rights were not adversely affected. only commencing monitoring at the direct request of An Garda Síochána.Charitable PreschoolThe balancing of the data protection rights of children against the interests of their parents is an area data controllers and processors must navigate as part of their daily functions. In 2022, the Information Officer of a charitable preschool contacted the Data Protection Commission (DPC) following an estranged parent’s request for access to all of their child’s records held at the preschool.The preschool had concerns for the welfare of both the custodial parent and child should they provide all the information, and were seeking to clarify whether the preschool could refuse the information request.The DPC informed the preschool that as the data controller, they have an obligation to ensure that the right of access does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others under Article 15(4) GDPR. This includes the rights of the child and the other parent. Data controllers may restrict a parent’s right of access to their child’s data where they have reasonable grounds to believe this would not be in the best interests of the child.This is not to say that an access request should be dismissed entirely. The DPC informed the preschool that they should provide a response to the request. However, the preschool may redact certain information where they deem it necessary to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the child or custodial parent. Following these initial recommendations, the charitable preschool informed the DPC that exemptions and redactions, as necessary and proportionate in light of the circumstances, were applied to the relevant records before they were released.tecHNoLogY mULtiNatioNaLsTikTok Legitimate Interest AssessmentIn June 2022, TikTok publicly announced that several changes were being made to the TikTok Privacy Policy. One change of note was that the lawful basis being relied on for first party personalised advertising for users aged 18 and over would change from consent to legitimate interest. Following an intervention by the DPC, TikTok agreed to pause the change in lawful basis to allow for further assessment by the DPC and other EU/EEA supervisory authorities of the justification for relying on the legitimate interests lawful basis for the processing concerned. The DPC subsequently raised a number concerns with the company, in particular that, in the view of the DPC and other supervisory authorities, TikTok had not yet sufficiently demonstrated that it could rely on legitimate interests. Further information and clarity on a number points was sought and engagement with TikTok on this matter is ongoing. Chrome Privacy Sandbox engagement and co-operation with the other Supervisory AuthoritiesDuring 2022 the DPC, as Lead Supervisory Authority, co-ordinated and facilitated several meetings between Google and members of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). These meetings allowed Google to update supervisory authorities on the continuing development of the Google Privacy Sandbox as well as providing the DPC and other supervisory authorities the opportunity to probe Google’s plans and to raise questions and/or concerns. Engagement with Google on the Privacy Sandbox will continue in 2023.Google Workspace recommendationsThe DPC undertook a high-level review of ‘Workspace’ Google Cloud Privacy Notice during 2022. Workspace Google Cloud Privacy Notice covers the processing of personal data in relation to a collection of Google’s cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products. Several recommendations were made to Google to improve contextual transparency including in relation to the definition of terms used and retention periods as well as other transparency requirements pursuant to GDPR Articles 12, 13 and 14. In response, Google has sought to provide more granular detail on retention periods for service data, with indicative examples to provide additional meaning and context. Google has also published an updated version of the Google Cloud Privacy Notice.Apple MapsEngagement with Apple on the collection of data for Apple Maps continued into 2022. Following a review of Apple’s collection processes and in particular the retention of unblurred images captured to support the “Look Around” feature”, the DPC queried why raw data was being retained for 18 months from date of publication of the updated street views. In response Apple confirmed that the retention period would be reduced to 12 months. The Apple Maps Image collection website and policies for all EU/EEA countries were subsequently updated to reflect the 12-month retention period. Meta Emotional Health HubThe DPC concluded in 2022 engagement with Meta on the Emotional Health Hub. The Hub is a website with a collection of resources on various mental health topics, primarily provided by third parties (NGOs, World Health Organisation, charities, etc.). Facebook users and non-users can access these resources, follow links to third party sites, and use the Hub to message a Facebook contact to talk about the issues they are facing. Meta collects various information including the time spent by a user on the Hub, the time spent on each resource within the Hub, the number of clicks on each resource, what resources a user clicks on, the location of the user, and data regarding the title of the resource being clicked. Having identified a number of transparency related concerns, the DPC made a number of recommendations 4546Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022 gUiDaNce for cHiLDreN oN tHeir Data protectioN rigHtsIn May 2022, the DPC published three short guides for children aged 13 and over on their data protection rights. These guides are intended mainly for children aged 13 and over, as this is the age at which children can begin signing up for many forms of social media on their own. The protection of children’s personal data is an important priority for the DPC, and is one of the five strategic goals of its 2022-2027 Regulatory Strategy. In furtherance of this objective, the DPC published the final version of its comprehensive ‘Fundamentals’ guidance on children’s data protection rights at the end of 2021. The purpose of the Fundamentals is to help organisations provide the special protection children merit when processing their personal data. However, an equally important element of protecting children’s personal data is giving children themselves the awareness and tools that they need to be safe online. With this in mind, the DPC has published the following short guides:“Data protection - what’s it all about?” This guide introduces children and young people to the idea of personal data and data protection, and why it’s important for them to know about it. “My data protection rights” This guide is a series of one-page primers which each introduce children to a separate GDPR right and how to use it.“Top tips for keeping your data safe online” This guide has 15 useful tips to help children - and indeed everyone - keep their personal data safe when they go online. The DPC hopes that these guides will not only help children keep their data safe, but will also be useful for parents, educators and anyone interested in children’s safety and wellbeing online. Targeting Children with social media advertisingIn September 2022, the DPC received a query from a public sector organisation about whether they could use social media advertising tools to target children with ads about beneficial initiatives and services that they offer for children. The organisation noted that the age of digital consent in Ireland is 16 and surmised that parental consent would be required for children under this age. The organisation asked whether their understanding was correct and whether social media ads for children under 16 should be directed at parents.The DPC advised that the public body was likely to be a joint controller – together with the social media platform – for any processing of personal data for targeted advertising. Therefore, the public body would share responsibility for ensuring that the processing was compliant with data protection law. In practice, this would mean preparing the necessary compliance documentation in consultation with their Data Protection Officer, to set out the justification and legal basis for this processing and to identify and mitigate any potential risks to children. The DPC also advised that, in the context of preparing their DPIA, the organisation should consider whether consent would be the most appropriate legal basis for this processing, as it would in practice be difficult for children or parents to give meaningful and distinct consent to targeted advertising in circumstances where they must accept it as a condition for using the service in the first place. The DPC advised that alternate legal bases under Article 6 of the GDPR may be more appropriate, but it was for the public body itself to determine this, taking into account its context, statutory remit, objectives and obligations under the law.The advice that the DPC gave in this case is relevant to any public sector organisation that is considering whether to use social media to target children. Such organisations should in particular bear in mind the following considerations. First, the DPC cannot give blanket endorsements of social media advertising tools and it is therefore up to the organisation itself to determine on a case-by-case basis whether it can use such tools in a proportionate and privacy-preserving manner for a purpose that reflects the best interests in the child. An organisation that wants to use social media advertising to pursue its objectives cannot assume that the associated data protection compliance is the sole responsibility of the social media company itself. Second, there is a lot of confusion around the appropriateness of consent as a lawful basis and in particular the role of the age of digital consent. Public sector organisations in particular should consider whether alternate legal bases are more appropriate, taking into account their particular duties and obligations in relation to children and any other relevant contextual factors.eUcoNseNt projectIn 2022, the DPC participated on the advisory board of the euCONSENT project, an EU-funded initiative to create a framework for age verification (AV) and parental consent tools and solutions to increase the protection of children online by making AV and parental consent tools more effective.Children’s data proteCtion rights4748Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022The DPC emphasises open engagement with data controllers when seeking to drive compliance with the GDPR. In this way, and where appropriate, the DPC can support organisations in providing the individuals they interact with the full protections and considerations of the GDPR. However, where a data controller fails to engage with the DPC and/or comply with their obligations, the DPC will consider utilising its enforcement powers in order to ensure compliance.The DPC continued its programme of engagement with data controllers on compliance with the requirements of Article 37 of the GDPR concerning the designation and notification of a Data Protection Officer (DPO). At the end of 2021 all but one public sector body had been brought in to compliance with Article 37 of the GDPR. The remaining public sector body, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC), failed to respond to repeated efforts from the DPC querying the organisation’s designation of a DPO.The DPO wrote to the PHECC five times, via various mediums, without response, before opening an Inquiry in February 2022 in accordance with section 110(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018. The Inquiry was commenced to establish whether the PHECC was required to designate a DPO pursuant to Article 37(1) of the GDPR and whether the PHECC had done so. In addition, the Inquiry sought to establish whether the PHECC infringed Article 37(7) of the GDPR concerning publication of the DPO contact details and communication of those contact details to the DPC. The Inquiry also examined whether the PHECC infringed Article 31 of the GDPR by failing to cooperate, on request, with the DPC in the performance with its tasks. The DPC’s Decision in the Inquiry finalised in May 2022 accepted that the failure to cooperate with the DPC was without intent, but noted that it cannot be the case that a public authority or body (or any data controller), can fail to answer, in any way, repeated efforts to monitor and enforce the GDPR. The PHECC was issued with a reprimand in respect of infringements of Articles 31, 37(1) and 37(7) of the GDPR. A further update on this inquiry can be found in the inquiries chapter on page 21.Dpo NetworkThe DPC remains committed to supporting DPOs and their teams. In 2022, the DPC hosted 32 online webinars for members of the DPO Network, covering topics ranging from responding to access requests to compiling records of processing activities. Additionally, DPC staff continued to take part in events organised by sectoral DPO Networks, from both the public and private sector. The DPC also hosted a conference in May – as part of the EU ARC Project – which drew many members of the DPO Network to the event.

It is a tool for border, immigration, police, customs and judicial authorities in the EU and the Schengen associated countries to share information on people and objects in one common database. Ireland is part of the SIS system.As part of the DPC’s ongoing international work,in 2022, staff from the DPC acted as Member State Lead Expert in three separate evaluations of the application of SIS II in Sweden, Denmark and Iceland.The respective teams were led by staff of the European Commission and included experts from other Member States.The on-site teams visited multiple locations in the preparation of their reports, including:• Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection;• Swedish Police Headquarters;• Swedish Migration Agency;• Border Control Police at Arlanda Airport;• Icelandic Data Protection Authority;• Icelandic National Police Commissioner´s office;• Directorate of Immigration´s office, Kópavogur;• Reykjavík Metropolitan Police Station;• Datatilsynet - Danish DPA;• Danish Immigration Service;• Danish National Police; and• Copenhagen Airport.The three evaluation groups each produced reports on the manner in which Sweden, Denmark and Iceland implement and apply the European Union’s Schengen acquis against the background of data protection requirements, including areas where the on-site team considers there is need for improvement, as well as best practices observed during the on-site visit. cooperatioN witH otHer eDpB sUpervisorY aUtHorities 2022The DPC continued to invest considerable resources in the day-to-day operation of the OSS at various levels in the performance of its role as a Lead Supervisory Authority, including seeking the assistance of other authorities on a broad range of matters as well as keeping them informed of pertinent issues and developments.

BCRs were introduced in response to the need of organisations to have a global approach to data protection where many organisations consisted of several subsidiaries located around the globe, transferring data on a large-scale. During 2022, the DPC continued to act or commenced acting as lead reviewer in relation to 27 BCRs applications from 16 different companies. Three of those applications were given approval in 2022 – Controller BCRs for Groupon International Limited and Controller and Processor BCRs for Ellucian Ireland Limited.The DPC also assisted other European Data Protection Agencies by acting as co-reviewer or on drafting teams for Article 64 Opinions on 6 BCRs in this period.Furthermore, once the BCRs are approved, the DPC continues to have a significant oversight role upon receiving annual updates on all BCR’s. In 2022 the DPC led on 23 BCRs for 16 different companies which are already approved.The EDPB issued Article 64 opinions on 23 BCRs applications in 2022 and the DPC checked and offered feedback on each of these applications.Bcr traiNiNg worksHop, DUBrovNik In May 2022 a Training Workshop on BCRs was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia where staff from the DPC delivered a session on progressing a BCRs application from start to finish which was well received by attendees from all EEA supervisory authorities.spriNg coNfereNce of Data protectioN commissioNersIn May 2022 the DPC participated in the Spring Conference of Data Protection Commissioners in Cavtat, Croatia. This was the first time the conference had been held since 2019 was attended by all EU data protection authorities, as well as representatives from the EU Commission and from the legal and academic spheres. The 2022 event was an in-person event, hosted by the Croatian Data Protection Authority over the course of three days. The DPC took part in the expert panel discussions and presented the initial findings of the ARC project to attendees. arc projectIn 2022 the DPC’s successful participation in the EU-funded ARC project came to an end. The ARC Project had its inception in 2019, when the Croatian Data Protection Authority, AZOP, submitted a proposal to the EU Commission seeking funding for a project that would focus on supporting the compliance efforts of small-to-medium enterprises; specifically because the often limited resources of SMEs presented an additional challenge when complying with data protection legislation. Funding was awarded on the basis of a consortium approach, and AZOP approached the DPC and Vrije University, Brussels with an invitation to join them in their efforts to support SMEs. The DPC recognised this as an excellent opportunity for international cooperation and for providing support to one of its own key stakeholder groups. Having taken the decision to join the consortium, the project was formally launched in February 2020, will a full programme planned of national and international engagements and workshops. Within a month, the entire landscape of events for which the project had been designed had been significantly altered. The ARC Project needed to be radically reconceived in order to meet the needs of a cohort that was changing by the hour. The ARC team followed the path set out by the needs of the SME cohort and it too transitioned to an online environment. Where in-person workshops and events had been planned, these were replaced with online substitutes to ensure that learning and engagement continued. Online engagement had the advantage of allowing attendees to join who might otherwise have been prevented by distance from joining an in-person event, however the drawback was that it didn’t allow attendees to engage with each other. The project team persevered nonetheless, and in all the ARC project delivered over 100 workshops for both Irish and Croatian SMEs between 2020 and 2022. In its formal evaluation of the project, the EU Commission noted that the ARC had been:“…assessed as very good and no shortcomings were identified. The content of the deliverables is satisfactory and of high quality, despite the circumstances caused by the pandemic. The project can have long-term impact on the project groups and the society, as well as on EU Legislation and/or policies and can serve as a pool of knowledge for other Data Protection Authorities as well.”The ARC Project drew to a close in 2022, with a very well attended conference for DPOs - and others in the data protection space - which was held in Croke Park in May. In a happy turn of events, the DPC was finally in a position to host an in-person conference, and was delighted to welcome representatives from our consortium partners in AZOP and Vrije University. Dpc coNfereNce for smesBackground to the ConferenceOn May 11th, 2022, the DPC hosted a large-scale in-person conference for SMEs in Croke Park, Dublin,  as part of its commitments to the EU-funded ARC project. The structure of the day was based on the findings of a survey of the SME sector (an earlier deliverable of the ARC Project), which had identified Legal Bases, Accountability, and Data Breach mitigations as areas of particular difficulty for Irish SMEs. Conference GoalsThe goal of the conference was to give SMEs access to the type of expert legal and regulatory advice that they may not be in the position to acquire for themselves, for financial or other reasons. Accordingly, panellists from the DPC were joined on the day by some of the top data protection and legal specialists currently operating both in Ireland and internationally. A secondary goal of the conference was to create an environment where SMEs could engage in the peer-to-peer networking that had been denied them for the previous two years, due to the Covid restrictions in place in Ireland. The DPC wanted to work towards mitigating the sense of isolation that many SMEs and DPOs have acknowledged when it comes to dealing with compliance challenges. It was important to the DPC and its stakeholders that the conference be an in-person event, to facilitate the softer networking and relationship building that helps build a culture of compliance among regulated entities.Adding value – planning the contentThe driving principles of the conference were practicality and applicability. This included a strong emphasis on workshop style presentations that essentially “walked” attendees through the steps necessary to meet the threshold of accountability for their respective businesses. Q&A sessions were also built into each panel, allowing the audience to ask for clarifications on specific points. Serving SMEs – the contents of the conferenceIn preparation for the conference, the DPC had liaised with the various SME representative bodies in Ireland to ensure we reached our target audience of small and medium enterprises. 340 delegates attended the event and the panel sessions on the day were extremely well received, with many compliments from the audience for the quality of the panel participants and a strong desire for future, similar events which is something that the DPC will actively pursue in 2023 and beyond.Siniša Kovačić (AZOP), Deputy Commissioner Igor Vulje (AZOP), MB Donnelly (DPC), Commissioner Helen Dixon (DPC), Ashwinee Kumar (VUB) - ARC ConferenceCommissioner Helen Dixon - Keynote, ARC Conference5152Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022meDia eNgagemeNtThe DPC published a total of 15 press releases over the course of 2022, leading to significant coverage on international and national level media.

An Employee Engagement Forum was established following the transfer of staff to the DPC as an independent body in 2021. The Forum has a diverse and inclusive membership, with representation at each grade an essential requirement. Its purpose is to contribute to the DPC’s commitment to becoming an     Employer of Choice through enhancing the employee experience for staff. Employee experience is about creating a great work environment for people and involves understanding the role that trust plays in the employment relationship and making sure people are listened to and have a voice in issues that impact them. In support of this, the Employee Engagement Forum focused on Trust and Culture throughout the year, and identified these as underlying themes in the development of the DPC’s Employee Engagement Strategy, which is due to be finalised in 2023. Having identified “retaining and amalgamating the expert capacities of its staff to ensure operational effectiveness” as a strategic priority and a key driver of successful organisational change, the DPC’s SMC leverages employee engagement to support the achievement of objectives in the DPC’s Regulatory Strategy. In 2022, the DPC continued to prioritise the professional development of all of our staff, developing a Learning and Development strategy which delivered a range of skill enhancements in the areas of leadership development, personal professional development and wellbeing. DPC staff attended 634 courses via OneLearning in 2022. Additionally, several courses were delivered in the DPC in 2022, these courses covered Data Protection Training, Leadership Development, Line Manager Training, De-escalation & conflict management as well as Interview Skills sessions throughout the year.

Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 requires public bodies to prepare and publish, by 30 June in each year, a report in relation to the previous year in an anonymised form.Pursuant to this requirement, the DPC confirms that in 2022:• No internal protected disclosures (from staff of the DPC) were received.• 13 potential protected disclosures (set out in the table below) were received from individuals external to the DPC in relation to issues pertaining to data protection within other entities. These issues were raised with the DPC in its role as a ‘prescribed person’ as provided for under Section 7 of the Protected Disclosures Act (listed in SI 364/2020).

The individual did not receive a response to this request. This DPC intervened to see if the matter could be informally resolved. By the time the DPC had received the complaint, it transpires that the data controller no longer held any information relating to her as it was not aware of the access request until it was brought to its attention by this office. This was because the email address to which the access request was sent was not an address that was regularly used, despite this being the email address contained in the data controller’s Privacy Policy. The data controller further stated that CCTV footage is retained for 14 days due to the system storage capacity and it was therefore not in a position to provide the requested CCTV footage as more than 14 days had elapsed. Having examined the matter thoroughly, it was apparent to this office that the data controller contravened Article 12(3) of the GDPR as controllers have an obligation to provide a response to the individual’s subject access request within the statutory timeframe as set out in Article 12 of the GDPR, even where the controller is not in possession of any such data. The failure by the data controller to monitor the inbox associated with the email address in its Privacy Policy resulted in its failure to secure the relevant CCTV footage before it was deleted in line with its retention policy. In this regard, the failure to have relevant organisational measures in place resulted in the data controller being unable to fulfil the subject access request.The DPC issued directions to the data controller reminding it of its obligation to monitor any email mailbox which they provide for data subject requests. The DPC will take enforcement action if a repeat of this issue arises with the same controller. Case Study 2: Failure to respond to an Access Request (II)appeNDix 4: Case studiesThe DPC received a complaint from an individual regarding a subject access request made by him to an organisation (the data controller) for a copy of all information held regarding his engagement with the data controller. The individual did not receive a response to this request. The DPC intervened to see if the matter could be informally resolved. The complainant was in particular not satisfied with the fact that certain documents had not been provided in response to his access request. The position of the data controller was that the documents were not provided as the personal data had been provided “in another format”.Data protection access rights are not about access to documents per se. They are about access to personal data. An access request may be fulfilled by providing the individual with a full summary of their data in an intelligible form. The form in which it is supplied must be sufficient to allow the applicant to become aware of the personal data being processed, check they are accurate and being processed lawfully. Having examined what data the controller did provide in this case, the DPC was satisfied to advise the complainant that he had been provided with all of the data to which he was entitled under data protection legislation. Case Study 1: Failure to respond to an Access RequestCase studies:Complaints6566Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022The complaint concerned the individual’s dissatisfaction with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited’s (Data Controller) response to their right to be forgotten request pursuant to Article 17 GDPR. The individual requested the delisting of two URLs that were returning on the Data Controller’s search engine when searching the individual’s name. The Data Controller confirmed to the individual that the URLs were delisted. However, a search of the individual’s name, carried out by their legal representative, showed that the URLs continued to be returned. The DPC reviewed the URLs when receiving the complaint and confirmed that the URLs were still being returned. The DPC intervened to seek to swiftly and informally resolve the matter. The DPC corresponded with the Data Controller and noted that despite confirmation that the URLs were delisted, they continued to return when searching the individual’s name. The Data Controller investigated the request further and confirmed to the DPC that the URLs had now been delisted. Following further investigation by the DPC, it was determined that while the original URLs requested for delisting no longer appeared, a different URL was now appearing, distinct from the other URLs, redirecting to the same content. The Data Controller delisted this URL also at the request made by the DPC on behalf of the individual. The DPC wrote to the individual and outlined the Data Controller’s actions. The DPC confirmed that all three URLs had been delisted by the Data Controller. This case demonstrates the importance of Supervisory Authorities, in this case the DPC, carrying out their own investigations and ensuring that individuals’ requests are fulfilled in line with GDPR. The above is an example of how the DPC took extra measures to ensure that the individual could comprehensively achieve a satisfactory outcome, rather than having to submit a new complaint for the new URL. Case Study 4: Right to be Forgotten (Microsoft)An individual made a complaint to the DPC concerning the data controller’s use of CCTV footage to investigate an incident in which the individual was involved. The individual had organised an event in a leisure facility (the data controller), and displayed signage in relation to Covid-19 procedures to assist attendees. At the end of the event, the individual inadvertently removed a different sign also in relation to Covid-19 procedures when removing the signage they had installed for the event. The data controller reviewed its CCTV footage to establish who had removed the sign.The complainant was of the opinion that the data controller did not process their personal data in a proportionate or transparent manner, and that it did not comply with its obligations as a data controller in how it investigated the incident. Accordingly, the individual lodged a complaint with the DPC.The DPC intervened to seek to resolve the matter informally and the parties reached an amicable resolution when the leisure centre agreed to undertake an audit of its use of the CCTV system and to restrict access to review CCTV footage to designated staff members.The individual thanked the DPC for handling their complaint in a professional and helpful manner and further stated that they were reluctant to submit the complaint initially as they are aware of the volume of complaints the DPC deals with and the accompanying constraints on resources. The complainant stated that they felt confident that the issue will not arise in the future as a result of the involvement of the DPC. The individual wished to express their appreciation and acknowledge the DPC’s efficiency in dealing with the matter.Case Study 3: Fair obtaining complaint made against a Golf Club6768Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022The Data Controller also acknowledged the delay in responding to the individual and confirmed that it had since taken steps to ensure that such delays would not occur in responding to future requests.The Data Controller confirmed that it had actioned the individual’s access and erasure requests. It also confirmed that it had reached out to the individual to inform him of the steps it had taken in response to the DPC’s correspondence and provided the individual with the explanations set out above. The actions taken and explanations given by the Data Controller were also outlined to the individual by the DPC. The individual informed the DPC that they were satisfied with the actions taken by the Data Controller in response to the DPC’s correspondence as it allowed him to download his data and delete his account. This case study illustrates how often simple matters – such as a complaint being forwarded to the wrong unit in an organisation – can become data protection complaints if the matter is not identified appropriately. The complaint concerned the individual’s dissatisfaction with Microsoft Ireland’s (Data Controller) response to their right to be forgotten request pursuant to Article 17 GDPR. The individual requested to have 7 URLs delisted from being returned in a search against their name on the Data Controller’s search engine. The individual stated that their National Identity number was contained in the URLs returned and raised concerns that the availability of their National Identity number increased the risk of identity theft. The DPC intervened on behalf of the complainant. The Data Controller originally refused the delisting request, stating that the URLs contained information of public relevance, and that the information Case Study 6: Right to be Forgotten (Microsoft)The complaint concerned the individual’s dissatisfaction with Pinterest Europe’s (Data Controller) response to his access and erasure requests pursuant to Article 15 GDPR and Article 17 GDPR, respectively. The individual submitted his requests following the suspension of his account, in order to obtain a copy of all of his personal data and to have it deleted from the Data Controller’s systems. The individual’s account was suspended due to a violation of the Data Controller’s policies regarding spam. The Data Controller responded to the requests via automated response which stated that it had reviewed the account and decided not to reactivate it because it noticed activity that violated its spam policy. As a result, the individual was no longer able to access his personal data stored on their account. The individual maintained that this information could not be correct as they seldom used their account and sought a more substantial response to their access and erasure requests. The DPC took up the complaint with Pinterest. The DPC outlined the individual’s concerns in relation to his access and erasure requests and requesting that the Data Controller address those concerns more substantively. The DPC also requested that the Data Controller indicate whether the individual was provided with an opportunity to appeal his account suspension and, if so, describe the procedure for such appeals. The Data Controller responded to the DPC stating that it had investigated the matter and explained that once an account is suspended on the basis of a spam violation, all correspondence is automatically directed to its Spam Operations team. The Data Controller further explained the appeal process and noted that the individual corresponded with the Spam Operations team in relation to the appeal of their suspension. The Spam Operations team failed to identify that the correspondence also included the individual’s access and erasure requests and therefore this was not addressed in its response. The Data Controller’s response also noted that, although the Spam Operations team had rejected the individual’s appeal of their account suspension, it had since carried out another review in light of its updated spam policies. Following this review, the Data Controller re-activated the individual’s account. Case Study 5: Access and Erasure request (Pinterest)6970Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022An individual complained to the DPC about the restrictions applied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) in response to an access request. The person outlined they were a victim of a crime but a decision was reached by the DPP not to prosecute. The DPC noted that the DPP imposed restrictions on access to the investigation file, the statement of a witness, memorandums of interviews taken as part of the investigation as well as correspondence between the DPP and An Garda Síochána (AGS). The DPC probed the restrictions applied by the DPP further as any restriction relied upon by data controllers must respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. The data protection rights conferred under the Law Enforcement Directive as transposed in the Data Protection Act 2018 pertain solely to personal data relating to an individual’s own personal information and do not confer a right of access to the personal data of a third party. In this case, the DPP clarified that it restricted the right of access of the individual in question under Section 94(2)(e) of the Act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. The DPP also cited 91(7) of the Act which provides that a data controller shall not provide individuals with personal data relating to another individual where doing so would reveal, or would be capable of revealing, the identity of the other individual. The only circumstances in which 91(7) does not apply is where a third party consents to the provision of their information to the individual making the request as set out in 91(8) of the Act. With regard to the investigation file submitted by AGS to the DPP and correspondence between the DPP and AGS, under Section 162 of the Act, individual data subject rights and controller obligations do not apply as far as these relate to personal data processed for the purpose of seeking, receiving or giving legal advice. Equally, such rights and obligations do not apply in respect of which a claim of privilege can be made for the purpose of or in the course of legal proceedings. The DPC noted the Act explicitly outlines that these legal proceedings include personal data consisting of communications between a client and his or her legal advisers or between those advisers. After seeking further clarification, it was apparent to the DPC that the restrictions invoked were valid and legal privilege applied to the data sent between AGS and the DPP.Case Study 7: Restrictions to the Right of Access – files from An Garda Siochána to the Director of Public Prosecutionswas published in an official bulletin of a government body; in this case, the Spanish Government. The DPC corresponded with the Spanish Data Protection Authority in relation to the information published in the URLs. The Spanish Data Protection Authority stated that due to the introduction of the GDPR, the Spanish Data Protection law was modified and the Government is no longer permitted to disclose citizens’ complete National Identification number alongside their name and surnames when publicising administrative acts. Following clarification from the Spanish Data Protection Authority, the DPC informed the Data Controller of the change in the Spanish Data Protection law. The Data Controller stated that based on the update in Spanish Data Protection law, it would delist all requested URLs from being returned against the individual’s name pursuant to Article 17 GDPR. This case highlights the importance of communicating with other supervisory authorities during the complaint resolution process. In these circumstances, the DPC was provided with clarification on how Spain has adapted its national legislation to comply with the GDPR. It also allowed the Data Controller to adapt its current procedure to ensure that requests involving the delisting of URLs containing full National Identity numbers are handled in accordance with the updated national legislation. 7172Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022As set out in Section 101(2) of the Act, the DPC is not competent for the supervision of data processing operations of the courts when acting in their judicial capacity. The DPC advised the complainant that CAB prepared the court documents for the purposes of court proceedings and that supervision of data processing operations of the courts when acting in their judicial capacity is assigned to a Judge appointed by the Chief Justice pursuant to section 157 of the Act. The DPC provided the complainant with the contact details for the assigned judge. An individual complained to the DPC that a Clothing and Food Company disclosed their personal medical information by issuing postal correspondence with the words “Coeliac Mailing” printed on the outside of the envelope. As part of the Stores Value Card facility, the individual in question had signed up to receive an ‘Annual Certificate of Expenditure’ of gluten free products purchased during the year, which could be used for tax purposes. The DPC advised the Store that under Article 9 of the GDPR, health data is deemed sensitive data and is afforded additional protection and that displaying the words “Coeliac Mailing” has to be examined in light of Article 9 of the GDPR. In response, the Store advised the DPC that it instructed its marketing department to cease using this wording on the outside of envelopes for all future mailings. The DPC welcomes the positive outcome to this engagement.Case Study 9: Disclosure of Sensitive DataThe DPC handled several similar complaints during 2022 against the DPP in relation to subject access requests. Each complaint examined followed a procedure whereby the DPC probed further with regard to any restrictions applied by the DPP on a case-by- case basis, in addition to querying any privilege claimed in respect of data withheld.In 2022, a complaint against the DPP examined by the DPC in 2020 was the subject of a challenge by the complainant in Carrick-on-Shannon Circuit Court (civil) with regard to the DPC’s acceptance of the restrictions applied by the DPP. The Court noted that the DPC had queried the reasons given by the DPP to the appellant for withholding certain personal data and that the DPP had provided the DPC with a further detailed response. The Court stated that it was clear from the pleadings that the handling of the complaint was not a rubber-stamping exercise and that the DPC had examined all matters. The Court stepped through each of the three documents withheld by the DPP and the privilege claimed in respect of each and found no error in respect of any of the three categories.An individual complained to the DPC that the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) disclosed his personal financial details without his consent, to a number of individuals against whom CAB had taken legal proceedings. CAB advised the DPC that the proceedings in question were under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996-2016 (PoCA), the purpose of which is to identify and confiscate property, established to the satisfaction of the High Court, to be the proceeds of crime. CAB stated the information contained in the subject documentation was required to establish the provenance of property the subject matter of the proceedings. CAB outlined that the personal data of the complainant was intertwined with the personal data of the individuals being prosecuted and could not be redacted from the court documents. The DPC noted such proceedings are governed by section 158(1) of the Data Protection Act, 2018 (the Act) which provides that the GDPR and Law Enforcement Directive as transposed in the Act may be restricted in order to ensure the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings. Case Study 8: Disclosure Without Consent7374Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022In July 2021, the DPC received one complaint from an individual regarding an unsolicited marketing telephone call received from Vodafone Ireland Limited. In response to the DPC’s investigation of the complaint, Vodafone Ireland Limited explained that the existing customer had opted out of receiving marketing communications in March 2018. Despite this, Vodafone Ireland Limited had carried out a manual check of preferences in advance of conducting a marketing campaign, and due to human error, the complainant was included in the marketing campaign. The DPC had previously prosecuted Vodafone Ireland Limited in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2013 and 2011 for breaching Regulation 13 of the ePrivacy Regulations in relation to previous complaints. Accordingly, the DPC decided to proceed to another prosecution arising from this complaint case. At Dublin Metropolitan District Court on 27 June 2022, Vodafone Ireland Limited pleaded guilty to one charge under Regulation 13(6) of the ePrivacy Regulations. The District Court applied the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 in this case, on the basis of a charitable donation of €500 to Little Flower Penny Dinners. Vodafone Ireland Limited agreed to discharge the DPC’s legal costs. Case Study 11: Prosecution of Vodafone Ireland LimitedIn January 2022, the DPC received two complaints from two individuals regarding unsolicited marketing emails received from Guerin Media Limited. In response to the DPC’s investigation of the complaints, Guerin Media Limited explained that the two individuals’ email contact details had previously been removed from all marketing lists held by the company with the exception of a Gmail contact list that it maintain. It stated that due to human error and the fact that their details remained on the Gmail contact list, both individuals were sent marketing emails from Guerin Media Limited that should not have occurred. The DPC had previously prosecuted Guerin Media in 2019 for breaching Regulation 13 of the ePrivacy Regulations in relation to previous complaints regarding similar incidents of unsolicited email marketing. Accordingly, the DPC decided to proceed to another prosecution arising from these complaint cases. At Naas District Court on 5 December 2022, Guerin Media Limited pleaded guilty to three charges under Regulation 13(1) of the ePrivacy Regulations. The District Court convicted Guerin Media Limited on all three charges and it imposed fines totalling €6,000. Guerin Media Limited agreed to pay €1,000 towards the DPC’s legal costs.

This page now provides enhanced information to individuals on specific issues relating to the processing of personal data and exercising those rights directly with Tinder’s DPO.Via the Greek Supervisory Authority, the DPC informed the individual of the actions taken by Tinder. In their response the individual confirmed that they were content to conclude the matter and, as such, the matter was amicably resolved pursuant to section 109(3) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act), and the complaint was deemed to have been withdrawnThis case study again demonstrates the benefits — to individual complainants — of the DPC’s intervention by way of the amicable resolution process. The DPC’s engagement with the controller also resulted in Tinder improving the information that it makes available to all of its users on its platform. This case study concerns a complaint the DPC received via the One-Stop-Shop (OSS) mechanism created by the GDPR from an individual regarding an erasure request made by them to MTCH Technology Services Limited (Tinder). As way of background, the individual’s account was the subject of a suspension by Tinder. Following this suspension, the individual submitted a request to Tinder, under Article 17 of the GDPR, seeking the erasure of all personal data held in relation to them. When contacting Tinder, the individual also raised an issue with the lack of a direct channel for contacting Tinder’s DPO. As the individual was not satisfied with the response they received from Tinder, they made a complaint to the Greek Supervisory Authority. The individual asserted that neither their request for erasure nor their concerns about accessing the DPO channels, had been properly addressed by Tinder. As the DPC is the Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) for Tinder, the Greek Supervisory Authority forwarded the complaint to the DPC for handling. The DPC intervened to seek a swift and informal resolution of the matter in the first instance. The DPC put the substance of the complaint to Tinder and engaged with it. In response and by way of a proposed amicable resolution, Tinder offered to conduct a fresh review of the ban at the centre of this case. Following this review, Tinder decided to lift the ban. The lifting of a ban by Tinder allows an individual to be then in a position to access their account on the platform. The individual can then decide if they wish to use the self-delete tools to erase their account from within the Tinder platform. In addition to the above, Tinder provided information for the individual in relation to its retention policies. Case Study 12: Erasure request to Tinder by Greek data subject, handled by the DPC as Lead Supervisory Authority Case study: one-stop-shop Complaint7778Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022The complainant in this case held a joint bank account with a family member. Following a request from the solicitors of the other joint account holder, the bank (the data controller) disclosed copies of bank statements relating to the account, which included the complainant’s personal data, to those solicitors. The complainant was concerned that this disclosure did not comply with data protection law.During the course of the DPC’s handling of this complaint, the bank set out its position that any joint account holder is entitled to access the details and transaction information of the joint account as a whole. The bank further took the view that, in relation to solicitors who are acting for its customers, it is sufficient for it to accept written confirmation from a solicitor on their headed paper that the solicitor acts for the customer as authority for the bank to engage with the solicitor in their capacity as a representative of the bank’s customer.Data protection law requires that personal data be collected or obtained for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (the “purpose limitation” principle). In this case, the DPC noted that the bank had obtained the complainant’s personal data in order to administer the joint account which the complainant held with the other account holder, including the making of payments, the collection of transaction information and the preparation of bank statements. It appeared to the DPC that it was consistent with the bank’s terms and conditions for the joint account, and the account holder’s signing instructions on the account (which allowed either party to sign for transactions without the consent of the other account holder), that the administration of the account could be completed by one account holder without the consent of the other. In the light of this, the DPC considered that the disclosure of bank statements to the solicitors of the other joint account holder was not incompatible with the specified, explicit and legitimate purpose for which the complainant’s personal data had been obtained by the bank, i.e. for the administration of the joint account.Second, the DPC considered whether the bank had a lawful basis for the disclosure of the complainant’s personal data, as required under data protection law. In this regard, the DPC was satisfied that the bank was entitled to rely on the “legitimate interests” lawful basis, which permits the processing of personal data where that processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party. In this case, the bank had disclosed the complainant’s Case Study 14: Disclosure of account statements by a bank to the representative of a joint account holderThe Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) sent a letter containing the outcome of its investigation into a complaint to an address where the person who made the complaint no longer resided. The DPC established the letter was posted to the address where the individual lived at the time of a previous complaint that they had made to GSOC. The individual in question had subsequently informed GSOC they no longer lived at that address and that with regard to the new complaint they were only contactable by email. The DPC liaised extensively with GSOC regarding this complaint. GSOC reported the data breach to the DPC through the normal breach reporting channels.  To avoid this type of incident happening again, GSOC advised the DPC that an email issued internally to all staff advising of the importance of ensuring the accuracy of personal data entered onto the Case Management System (CMS). GSOC also outlined that it sent a separate email to all line management in the GSOC Casework section advising them of the necessity to accurately input personal data on the CMS and to amend this information whenever updated information is received.Case Study 13: Law Enforcement Directive (LED)  Case studies: data breaCh Complaint7980Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022Case studies: data breaCh notiFiCationThe DPC received a notification from a financial sector data controller concerning an individual whose account had been incorrectly reported to the Central Credit Registrar (CCR). The controller had purchased the individual’s account as part of a portfolio sale in 2015 and was not aware that the individual had been adjudicated bankrupt in 2014. Individuals who have been declared bankrupt fall outside the scope of reporting obligations to the CCR. In addition, accounts with returns prior to the commencement of the CCR on the 30 June 2017 are not reportable to it. The individual experienced difficulty obtaining a loan because their CCR record, which is visible to other lending institutions, had been reported in error by the controller as live and in arrears. The risk to the rights and freedoms of the individual was assessed as high and the breach was accordingly communicated by the controller to the individual under Article 34 of the GDPR. The DPC confirmed with the controller that the individual’s CCR record had been amended. By way of mitigation, the controller introduced measures which require sellers of portfolios to disclose information on individuals such as bankruptcies. This case highlights the importance of having systems in place to ensure the security and integrity of personal data under Article 5(1)(f) GDPR . Controllers should be aware of the personal data they hold on individuals and have measures in place to validate and understand the data when acquiring it from other parties. The case also demonstrates that controllers have a duty to prevent any alteration to or unauthorised disclosure of personal data, incorrect or otherwise to the CCR which poses risk to individuals. Case Study 15: Inaccurate data leading to potential high risk resulting from inaccurate Central Credit Register data personal data on the basis that the solicitor was acting for the other joint account holder and was seeking the statements for legitimate purposes, namely to carry out an audit of the other account holder’s financial affairs. In circumstances where, pursuant to the signing instructions on the account, the other account holder would have been entitled to administer the account, the DPC was satisfied that the bank would not have had any reason to suspect that the disclosure would be unwarranted by reason of any prejudice to the complainant’s fundamental rights or freedoms. Accordingly, the DPC considered that the bank had a lawful basis for the disclosure, regardless of whether the complainant had provided consent.Finally, the DPC considered whether the bank had complied with its obligations under data protection law to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of personal data against unauthorised or unlawful disclosure. In this regard, the DPC accepted the position of the bank, set out in its policies, that it was appropriate to accept written confirmation from a solicitor that they were authorised to act on behalf of an account holder, without seeking further proof. The bank’s policy in this regard was based on the fact that a solicitor has professional duties as an officer of the court and as a member of a regulated profession.8182Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022As reported in last year’s annual report the DPC issued a decision to Limerick City and County Council in December 2021 regarding a broad range of issues pertaining to surveillance technologies deployed by the Council, in 2022 the DPC followed up on the decision’s twenty-one corrective actions to be taken by Limerick City and County Council to ensure that these were implemented within the specified timeframes.Amongst the issues of concern in the decision were the Council’s use of CCTV cameras where no authorisation from the Garda Commissioner was received, no lawful basis for the use of traffic management CCTV cameras, access from Henry Street Garda Station to the Council’s CCTV cameras in specified locations, the use of automatic number plate recognition technology and drones in public places which were used for the purposes of prosecuting crime or other purposes. The DPC in its decision imposed a temporary ban on the Council’s processing of personal data in respect of certain CCTV cameras and ordered the Council to bring its processing into compliance by taking specified actions. The Council was also reprimanded by the DPC in respect of infringements, and an administrative fine in the amount of €110,000 was imposed.By way of follow-up enforcement action in respect of the implementation of the corrective actions, the DPC wrote to Limerick City and County Council and met virtually with them on a number of occasions in 2022 in order to monitor progress. On 27 July 2022, the DPC carried out an onsite inspection at Limerick City and County Council to verify that all corrective actions had been carried out. At the end of this process, the DPC was satisfied that Limerick City and County Council had implemented the corrective actions required by the DPC’s decision. Amongst the issues of note in that regard were the following:Case Study 17: Enforcement follow-through: Surveillance Technologies and Data Protection in LimerickA Hospice Care Centre (Data Controller) utilises the services of Microsoft Office 365, a cloud based email service and also engaged third party IT Consultants. An Office 365 Audit was conducted by the IT Provider every quarter, where a number of recommendations by the service provider were identified including but not limited to all user accounts to have Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and the disabling of forwarding rules on all accounts.A user’s credentials were subsequently compromised and the IT Consultants established that the credentials were obtained as a result of a brute force attack, which may have been prevented had the controller introduced Multi-Factor Authentication as recommended at the time of the audit. On the advice of the IT Consultants, the compromised user password was reset and MFA introduced for this user. The controller has now commenced the introduction of MFA to all users.This breach could likely have been prevented if the recommendations of the audit were introduced in a timely manner. Case Study 16: Hacking of third party emailCase studies: inQuiries8384Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022A complaint was lodged directly with the DPC on 02 July 2019 against Twitter International Company (“Twitter”), and accordingly was handled by the DPC in its role as lead supervisory authority. The complainant alleged that, following the suspension of their Twitter account, Twitter failed to comply within the statutory timeframe with an erasure request they had submitted to it. Further, the complainant alleged that Twitter had requested a copy of their photographic ID in order to action their erasure request without a legal basis to do so. Finally, the complainant alleged that Twitter had retained their personal data following their erasure request without a legal basis to do so.The complainant’s Twitter account was suspended as Twitter held that the complainant was in breach of its Hateful Conduct Policy. Once Twitter suspended the account, the complainant sought that all of their personal details, such as email address and phone number, be deleted. They submitted multiple requests to Twitter asking that their data be erased. Twitter asked the complainant to submit a copy of their ID in order to verify that they were, in fact, the account holder. The complainant refused to do so. In the premises, Twitter ultimately complied with the erasure request without the complainant’s photographic ID.The DPC initially attempted to resolve this complaint amicably by means of its complaint handling process. However, those efforts failed to secure an amicable resolution and the case was opened for further inquiry. The issues for examination and determination by the DPC’s inquiry were as follows: (i) whether Twitter had a lawful basis for requesting photographic ID where an erasure request had been submitted pursuant to Article 17 GDPR, (ii) whether Twitter’s handling of the said erasure request was compliant with the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 and (iii) whether Twitter had complied with the transparency requirements of Article 12 GDPR.In defence of its position, Twitter stated that authenticating that the requester is who they say they are is of paramount importance in instances where a party requests the erasure of their account. It states that unique identifiers supplied at the time of registration of an account (i.e. email address and phone number) simply associate a user with an account but these identifiers do not verify the identity of an account holder. Twitter posited that it is cognisant of the fact that email accounts can be hacked and other interested parties might seek to erase an account particularly in a situation such as this, where the account was suspended due to numerous alleged violations of Twitter’s Hateful Conduct Policy. The company indicated Case Study 18: Article 60 decision concerning Twitter International Company – ID Request, Erasure Request• Authorisation of the Garda Commissioner under Section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act, was obtained for 353 CCTV cameras across Limerick City and County;• A joint controller agreement between An Garda Síochána and Limerick City and County Council in respect of the authorised cameras was put in place; • All automated number plate recognition capability was removed from all sites where it had been in operation;• All traffic management cameras were disconnected;• CCTV cameras that previously focussed on traveller accommodation sites were removed;• The link from some of the Council’s CCTV cameras to Henry Street Garda Station was disconnected;• Drones were grounded;• New CCTV signage was erected across all CCTV sites;• Plans to implement real-time monitoring of CCTV cameras in fourteen towns and villages across Co. Limerick were abandoned; and • 126 no. of CCTV cameras are no longer in operation.In addition, in late November 2022, the Circuit Court confirmed the DPC’s decision to impose an administrative fine of €110,000 on Limerick City and County Council in relation to the GDPR infringements identified in the decision. 8586Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022• Article 12(3): Twitter infringed Article 12(3) of the GDPR by failing to inform the data subject within one month of the action taken on his erasure request pursuant to Article 17 of the GDPR.The DPC also found in its decision that Twitter had a valid legal basis in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) for the retention of the complainant’s email address and phone number that were associated with the account. It also found that, without prejudice to its finding above concerning the data minimisation principle with regard to photo ID, Twitter was compliant with the data minimisation principle as the processing of the email address and phone number data was limited to what was necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. In light of the extent of the infringements, the DPC issued a reprimand to Twitter International Company, pursuant to Article 58(2) (b) of the GDPR. Further the DPC ordered Twitter International Company, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), to revise its internal policies and procedures for handling erasure requests to ensure that data subjects are no longer required to provide a copy of photographic ID when making data erasure requests, unless it can demonstrate a legal basis for doing so. The DPC ordered that Twitter International Company provide details of its revised internal policies and procedures to the DPC by 30 June 2022. Twitter complied with this order by the set deadline. that it retains basic subscriber information indefinitely in line with its legitimate interest to maintain the safety and security of its platform and its users. Twitter further argued that, as it did not actually collect any ID from the complainant, Article 5 (1)(c) was not engaged. Notwithstanding this, it stated that the request for photo identification was both proportionate and necessary in this instance. It indicated that a higher level of authentication is required in circumstances where a person is not logged into their account, as will always be the case where a person’s account has been suspended. Having regard to the complainant’s erasure request and the associated obligation that any such request be processed without ‘undue delay’, Twitter set out a timeline of correspondence pertaining to the erasure request between it and the complainant. Twitter stated that the Complainant had made duplicate requests and, as such, had delayed the process of deletion/erasure themselves. Regarding data retention, Twitter advised the DPC that it retained the complainant’s phone number and email address following the completion of their access request. It stated that it retains this limited information beyond account deactivation indefinitely in accordance with its legitimate interests to maintain the safety and security of its platform and users. It asserted that if it were to delete the complainant’s email address or phone number from its systems, they could then use that information to create a new account even though they have been identified and permanently suspended from the platform for various violations of its Hateful Conduct Policy. Following the completion of its inquiry, on 27 April, 2022 the DPC adopted its decision in respect of this complaint in accordance with Article 60(7) of the GDPR. In its decision the DPC found that the data controller, Twitter international Company, infringed the General Data Protection Regulation as follows:• Article 5(1)(c): Twitter’s requirement that the complainant verify his identity by way of submission of a copy of his photographic ID constituted an infringement of the principle of data minimisation, pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR;• Article 6(1): Twitter had not identified a valid lawful basis under Article 6(1) of the GDPR for seeking a copy of the complainant’s photographic ID in order to process his erasure request;• Article 17(1): Twitter infringed Article 17(1) of the GDPR, as there was an undue delay in handling the complainant’s request for erasure; and8788Annual Report 2022Annual Report 2022their account to verify their identity, without the necessity to provide ID. Following intervention by the DPC, Airbnb complied with the complainant’s access request. Having completed its inquiry, on 14 September 2022, the DPC adopted its decision in respect of this complaint in accordance with Article 60(7) of the GDPR. In its decision the Data Protection Commission found that the data controller, Airbnb Ireland UC, infringed the General Data Protection Regulation as follows:• Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR The DPC found that Airbnb’s requirement that the complainant verify their identity by way of submission of a copy of their photographic ID constituted an infringement of the principle of data minimisation, pursuant to Article 5(1) (c) of the GDPR. This infringement occurred in circumstances where less data-driven solutions to the question of identity verification were available to Airbnb;• Article 6(1) of the GDPRThe DPC found that, in the specific circumstances of this complaint, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller did not constitute a valid lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR for seeking a copy of the complainant’s photographic ID in order to process their erasure request; and• Article 12(3) of the GDPRThe DPC found that Airbnb infringed Article 12(3) of the GDPR with respect to its handling of the complainant’s access request. This infringement occurred when Airbnb failed to provide the complainant with information on the action taken on their request within one month of the receipt of the access request.In light of the extent of the infringements, the DPC issued a reprimand to Airbnb Ireland UC, pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR. Further the DPC ordered Airbnb Ireland UC, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d), to revise its internal policies and procedures for handling erasure requests to ensure that data subjects are no longer required to provide a copy of photographic ID when making data erasure requests, unless it can demonstrate a legal basis for doing so. The DPC ordered that Airbnb Ireland UC provide details of its revised internal policies and procedures to the DPC by 4 November 2022. Airbnb complied with this order by the set deadline. A complaint was lodged with the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (“Berlin DPA”) against Airbnb Ireland UC (“Airbnb”) and was thereafter transferred to the DPC to be handled in its role as lead supervisory authority.The complainant alleged that Airbnb failed to comply with an erasure request and a subsequent access request they had submitted to it within the statutory timeframe. Further, the complainant stated that when they submitted their request for erasure, Airbnb requested that they verify their identity by providing a photocopy of their identity document (“ID”), which they had not previously provided to Airbnb. The DPC initially attempted to resolve this complaint amicably by means of its complaint handling process. However, those efforts failed to secure an amicable resolution and the case was opened for further inquiry. The issues for examination and determination by the DPC’s inquiry were as follows: (i) whether Airbnb had a lawful basis for requesting a copy of the complainant’s ID where they had submitted an erasure request, pursuant to Article 17 GDPR, (ii) whether Airbnb’s handling of the said erasure request was compliant with the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 and (iii) whether Airbnb’s handling of the complainant’s access request was compliant with the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.Airbnb responded to the complainant’s allegations, justifying its request for photographic ID given the adverse effects that would flow from a wrongful deletion of an account. Airbnb highlighted that fraudulent deletion of an Airbnb account can lead to significant real-world harm including, in the case of hosts, the economic harm through cancelled bookings and loss of goodwill built up in the account and, in the case of guests, the potential loss of accommodation while travelling abroad. Airbnb stated that these are not trivial risks and appropriate steps must be taken to address them. It further stated that the provision of an ID document to authenticate an erasure request is a reliable proof of identification and that it does not place a disproportionate burden on the individual making the erasure request. It posited that photographic identity can be considered to be an evidential bridge between an online and an offline identity.Airbnb ultimately complied with the complainant’s erasure request, validating their identity by providing them with the option of logging into Case Study 19: Article 60 decision concerning Airbnb Ireland UC – Delayed response to an Access Request and an Erasure Request 89Annual Report 2022In January, 2022 the DPC informed the data subject by email of the final outcome of its engagement with the data controller. When doing so, the DPC noted that the actions now taken by the data controller appeared to adequately deal with the concerns raised in his complaint. In the circumstances, the DPC asked the data subject to notify it, within two months, if he was not satisfied with the outcome so that the DPC could consider the matter further. On the following day the data subject informed the DPC by email that he agreed with the informal resolution given his concerns regarding the data controller were now satisfied. The DPC was subsequently informed by the data controller that the erasure request was completed and that the personal data of the data subject had been erased. Confirmation of OutcomeFor the purposes of the GDPR consistency and cooperation procedure, the DPC communicated a draft of the outcome which confirmed that:• The complaint, in its entirety, had been amicably resolved between the parties concerned;• The agreed resolution was such that the object of the complaint no longer existed. No relevant and reasoned objections were received from the concerned supervisory authorities concerning the draft and the DPC subsequently closed the file in this case. BackgroundIn February 2021 a data subject lodged a complaint pursuant to Article 77 GDPR with the Data Protection Commission concerning an Irish-based data controller. The DPC was deemed to be the competent authority for the purpose of Article 56(1) GDPR.The details of the complaint were as follows:a. The data subject emailed the data controller in January 2021 to    request erasure of his personal data.b. The data subject did not receive any response from the data    controllerFollowing a preliminary examination of the material referred to it by the complainant, the DPC considered that there was a reasonable likelihood of the parties concerned reaching informal resolution of the subject matter of the complaint within a reasonable timeframe. Informal ResolutionThe DPC engaged with both the data subject and the data controller in relation to the subject-matter of the complaint. Further to that engagement, it was established that during the week in which the data subject sent his erasure request by email to the controller a new process to better manage erasure requests was implemented by the controller. The data controller informed the DPC that it was in a transition period during the week the email came in and it appears a response was missed. New personnel were being trained on how to manage these types of requests during this transition period. The data controller stated that it was an oversight, possibly due to the technical transition or human error, and it regretted the error. In the circumstances, the data controller agreed to take the following actions: 1. The data controller agreed to comply with the erasure request; and2. The data controller sincerely apologised for the error.
