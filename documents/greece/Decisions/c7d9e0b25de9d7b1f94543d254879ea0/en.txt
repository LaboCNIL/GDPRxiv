2. For the application of Greek law: a) there must be real
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishment in Greece (see article 3 par. 3 letter a' of Law 2472/1997, in which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this law applies to any processing of personal data,
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it is performed by a controller or processors,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established in the Greek Territory or in a place where based on public international
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of law, Greek law applies), and b) the processing is carried out in the context
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the activities of the controller's establishment (see article 4 par. 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item a' of Directive 95/46/EC, Opinion 8/2010 of the Article 29 Working Group on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Applicable Law, WP 179, 16-12-2010, section III.1 a and b, p.13 ff. and WP 179
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
update, 16-12-2015).

 

Regarding point a), Google Inc. has an establishment in Greece through it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsidiary of Google Hellas (Fragokklissias 7, Marousi, Athens). Regarding sub
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b) element regarding "processing carried out in the context of the activities",
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the processing carried out by Google Inc, i.e. the display of the results
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search, takes place in context
 

 

 

 

 

of commercial and advertising
 

 

 

 

activity of the installation of Google Inc in Greece, since it is accompanied by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the display of advertising messages linked to the search terms, with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the two activities, of the operator and its establishment in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greece, to be inseparably connected (see above, under 1b). Therefore, Art
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to processing, as the company itself accepts, is governed by Greek law
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2472/1997.

 

3. by seeking a fair balance between fundamental rights and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests and applying in the present case the above-mentioned generalities
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria that have been formulated at the European level (WP Opinion 225, 26-11-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2014), the justified or not of the negative response of the Google company is examined
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Inc, operator of the Google search engine.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this case, Google Inc stuck to its original position and refused it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfaction of the applicant's request to remove the link which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refers to her request with no. cat. ….

so that there is no obstacle to her appointment in the public and private sector,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while the summary of the deed was published in accordance with the law in the CoE. This publication
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is imposed by law as a necessary form for the deed to acquire legal force.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is, therefore, legally published data on its website
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the National Printing Office, in which they are published, in accordance with its principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of transparency, in full or in summary, in order to acquire legal force according to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided for in the law (see in particular Law 3469/2006), acts of public authorities, which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are available to the public electronically (freely) and free of charge, indefinitely (see n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3861/2010). Therefore, the criterion of the issuer's legal obligation is also met
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the data to make the data available to the public. Not the search for them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of deeds on the website of the National Printing Office is relatively easy to combine
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criteria (year, Issue, keywords, e.g. with the name of the interested party who
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contained in the published act).
  

 

 

 

 

 

4. Furthermore, "public persons are understood to be persons who hold a public position
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and/or use public money or even everyone who plays a role in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public life, such as in politics, economics, the arts, the social sphere,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in sports or in any other field." (see also Resolution 1165 (1998) of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe). the examinee
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the applicant does not play a role in the public life of the place
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nor is he a public figure since he did not hold, nor used, a public position
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public money and was not found in any political office. therefore, it had no properties
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to which, according to the decision of the CJEU Google Spain but also the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corresponding guidelines of the Article 29 Group, he should not be happy
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the same degree of protection as private individuals' data.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, the data to be examined do not concern her professional life
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant. specifically, the link that appears in the result
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search, whose abolition the applicant requested, does not contain
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information related to
 

 

 

professional activity or
 

 

 

professional
 

her behavior, while not from the one mentioned in the link above, criminal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offence, to which the pardon is concerned, a connection with the professional one arises
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her life.
 

 

 

5. From the assessment of the appeal, the documents of Google to the Authority, of
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of views presented by the applicant and Google during the Authority meeting and

of all the elements of the file, the following can be concluded:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The disputed link with the above content is for the applicant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disproportionate adverse effects and a more general negative impact that are exacerbated
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the easy public access to said data on its own
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typing her name. And yes, the publication in its Journal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Government of the above presidential decree, as well as its maintenance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

publication, is legal and serves the public purpose of transparency, as already
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exposed, the possibility, however, of access to the information contained in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this decree, including sensitive personal data (criminal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction), through a search engine with only the mention of the name, even
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and after issuance, according to the provisions on criminal records (see articles 573 et seq. CPC),
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a copy of a blank criminal record for general use is a stronger intervention
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in privacy than the publication of the information on the original website and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excessively infringes on the individual right to protection of personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant.

   

 

6. Based on the aforementioned, after weighing the public interest and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the conflicting relevant rights and interests, it must be accepted that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operator of the Google search engine, as controller,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must satisfy the request of the applicant for the abolition of the specific
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

link.
 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

1) It is unanimously decided that the negative response given by Google Inc to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request of the applicant to remove the link mentioned in the application
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of with no. cat. ... is not legally justified according to what is stated in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning of the present.
 

 

 

2) It imposes, unanimously, the company Google LLC (formerly Google Inc), as responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, pursuant to the provision of article 21 par. 1 sec. a' of Law 2472/1997,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to remove without delay the offending link listed in the history
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the present.
