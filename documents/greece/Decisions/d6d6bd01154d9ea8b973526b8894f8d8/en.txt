appeal by A against the television stations ET-1, NET and ET-3 of the company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERT SA, with which the appellant complains both to the Protection Authority
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Personal Data as well as the National Radio and Television Council
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the, according to his claims, illegal projection of his face, as visual
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investment of the reports that the above stations showed in the news deltas of...
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the abuse of prisoners at Police Station X.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

From the excerpts of the relevant news bulletins sent to the Authority by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above television station, the following emerged:
 

 

 

 

 

 

A) The presentation of the issue of ill-treatment of foreign prisoners in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Police Department X from the central news delt o of NET of .... lasted 16
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes and 25 seconds. Initially, a report was presented about the incident
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of abuse and a discussion followed with a representative of the Greek Police
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and journalists. The report, images of which were shown during
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the discussion, he presents the video with the scenes of abuse as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and images from the entrance of Police Department X. The video shows o
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chief guard who abuses foreign (two) prisoners
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well as the two prisoners. There is no blurring on the faces of all three
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(blurring) with the result that they are recognizable. In the images from his entrance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Police Department, the appellant is presented in a close-up, the one against
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time when the images were taken by the television crews
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stations, served the purpose of entering the Police Department in question. Except
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the appellant, other police officers are also presented, who are executed
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also guard duty when entering or leaving the building. From the report and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the discussion shows that there are three persons involved in the case: the chief constable,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who is shown in the relevant video, a policeman and a border guard
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guardian.
 

B) The same issue was presented in the news reports of ... and ... of ... and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TV station ET-3. In the report presented in the first of the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the applicant's face does not appear in the above news bulletin. instead
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears in the report that was presented in the news delt of .... according to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1-3 Kifis St., 11523 Athens, Tel: 210 6475600, Fax: 210 6475628, contact@dpa.gr / www.dpa.gr
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2

a way that also appears in the report presented by the NET television station.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The only difference consists in the fact that the faces of the warden as well as of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of two foreign prisoners are not recognizable as it has been applied to them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fogging method.
 

 

 

According to the appellant's claims, the above, without his consent,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

projection of his image, as a visual overlay of reports on abuse
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prisoners at Police Station X, which happened during the visit of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of television station partners in the said Department to perform in the income
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duties of purpose, constitutes an insult to his personality.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, with the no. 135/2011 Decision, rejected the appeal, as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered that the display of a face as a visual investment in a report being shown
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from delt the news does not violate law 2472/1997 without exception. Specifically, with her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contested decision held that in the specific case it exists
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified interest of the public opinion to be informed of its fact
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse of prisoners in a police station, while at the same time the insult of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the applicant's right to the protection of his personal data, through
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the projection of his face as a visual investment of the television reports
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

station broadcast on the news deltas, does not exceed the limits set by the principle of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportionality, taking into account the fact that in no case
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the belief is created in the television viewer that the appellant is involved in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alleged illegal acts.
  

 

 

With the remedy request, the appellant requests the reconsideration of his appeal,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sticking to his claim that the above projection of his image without it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his consent constitutes an insult to his personality.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, after examining all the above elements, after hearing him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rapporteur and the assistant rapporteur, who left after the debate and before
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conference and decision-making, and after thorough discussion,
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE LAW

material or moral damage to his legal interests caused by personal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid act may, for any reason, upon his application, request, either from the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial authority that issued the deed, its revocation or amendment (application
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatment), or, from the authority which is in charge of the one that issued the deed, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its annulment (initial appeal)'. The simple administrative appeal (Article 24)
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submitted by the manager who has suffered material or moral damage from the law
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his interests from an individual administrative act, to the authority that issued the act
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(request for treatment) and has as its object the revocation or amendment of an express
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual administrative act (see Spiliotopoulos, Manual of Administrative Law
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2002, § 251).
 

 

 

2. As the Authority has already considered (see, i.e., Decisions 122, 140, 190/2012, and

Mass Media, 3.9.1. Radio and TV broadcasts), after the constitutional
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revision in 2001, by which the provision of article 15 par. 2 was replaced
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Constitution, the control over the content of radio and television broadcasts
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the imposition of administrative sanctions belong to his exclusive competence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

National Radio and Television Council (NRC). Therefore, the competence of the Authority
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in relation to the broadcasting media has been limited and no longer extends to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      

Dissemination of personal data through radio and television broadcasts. For
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content of relevant broadcasts (news bulletins) exclusively competent to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the National Radio and Television Council (NRC), which, as it appears
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the elements of the file (see the document with no. prot. ESR 1058/30-08-2007,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attached to the treatment request), has already been received.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a result of this, due to incorrect interpretation and application of the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order, the Department of the Authority that issued the no. 135/2011 Decision, ruled
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he had jurisdiction to investigate the appeal, and then dismissed it as

essentially baseless. Therefore, the request for treatment must be accepted, withdrawn
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the challenged decision and to reject the appeal due to lack of jurisdiction
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Principle.
 

 

FOR THEIR REASONS
 

 

 

 

The Authority revoked the offending no. 135/2011 Decision and rejected
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the appeal due to incompetence.
