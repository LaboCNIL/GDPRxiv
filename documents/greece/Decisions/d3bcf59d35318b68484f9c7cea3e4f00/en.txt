Introduction
The establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and seals and
data protection signals is provided for in Article 42 of the GDPR. The enactment
of these mechanisms can improve transparency and compliance with the
GDPR and allow data subjects to assess the level
data protection of the relevant products and services (reasonable
paragraph 100 of the GDPR).

The certification is granted by a certification body accredited for this purpose,
based on article 43 of the GDPR, to a controller or executor
processing, which has submitted its relevant processing to the mechanism
certification. The accreditation of certification bodies is of particular importance as
provides official confirmation of the relevant competence of these bodies
making it possible to develop trust in the certification mechanism.
According to article 37 paragraph 1 of Law 4624/2019, the accreditation of
bodies that grant certifications, in accordance with article 42 of the GDPR,
carried out by the National Accreditation System (hereafter E.SY.D.)
(www.esyd.gr), based on the EN-ISO/IEC 17065/2012 standard (henceforth ISO 17065) and
in accordance with the additional accreditation requirements set forth by
Personal Data Protection Authority (hereinafter the Data Protection Authority). The
E.SY.D. apply these additional requirements during the process
accreditation in conjunction with the ISO 17065 standard.

This document includes the supplementary accreditation requirements
set by the APDPH in relation to the ISO 17065 standard and in accordance with articles 43
paragraph 1 letter b) and 43 paragraph 3 of the GDPR.

These requirements are based on the proposed requirements of
of guidelines 4/20181 of the ESPD and must be applied to
combined with the ISO 17065 standard. The numbering of the units used
here corresponds to the numbering used in ISO 17065 and
ESPD guidelines. However, some of the sections of ISO 17065
are not included in this document. This means that for the specific
modules no additional accreditation requirements are set but applied
the requirements of the respective section of ISO 17065.

0. Prefix
At this point, the terms of cooperation between the APDPH and the E.SY.D.
in the context of the accreditation of certification bodies. More detailed terms
cooperation, roles, responsibilities and procedures in relation to accreditation will
be agreed between the APDPH and the E.SY.D.

The E.SY.D. must inform the APDPH in writing:

1) Regarding all accreditation requests submitted by the agencies
certification. In particular, the E.SY.D. provides the APDPH with a summary
description of the request, the name and contact details of the body
certification, the certification scheme for which accreditation is requested as well

Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)'
https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_4_2018_accreditation_en.pdf

and whether the certification criteria are approved by the competent supervisory authority
or the ESPD. In case the accreditation request is submitted to the E.SY.D. before
from the final approval of the certification criteria, the E.SY.D does not grant the
accreditation until the certification criteria receive final approval.
 

2) Regarding the reasons for granting or withdrawing the accreditation, before each
grant or withdrawal of accreditation. The information to the APDPH
includes at a minimum information about the brand and the
details of the certification body, the period of time of its granting
of accreditation, date of initial accreditation, start dates
and expiry of the current accreditation as well as the certification scheme which
accreditation is concerned.
 

3) For the actions taken regarding the revocation of the accreditation
in the event that the E.SY.D. be informed by the APDPH that they are not met
now the accreditation requirements or the certification body is in breach of the GDPR
and the provisions of Law 4624/2019 (Article 37 Par. 2 of Law 4624/2019).

The APDPH, if it decides, informs the E.SY.D within a reasonable period of time.
for any significant reasons for the certification body's non-compliance with
GDPR. In this case, the E.SY.D. may continue the process
accreditation, but does not complete it before its final relevant judgment
APDPH. The E.SY.D. is free to decide on its grant
accreditation. It should, however, take into account its final decision
APDPH without prejudice to the authority of APDPH to subsequently revoke the
accreditation, if deemed appropriate.

The information provided by APDPH to E.SY.D. in the framework of

accreditation process must be kept confidential.

The E.SY.D. must ensure full transparency to the APDPH regarding
the accreditation process in accordance with articles 43 par. 4 and 7, 58 par. 1 item
b) of the GDPR and article 37 par. 2 of law 4624/2019.

The staff of E.SY.D. who is responsible for the evaluations and involved
in the process of accreditation of certification bodies, must have
proven knowledge of GDPR and personal data protection.

1. Scope
This document contains the supplements to the ISO 17065 standard
accreditation requirements of the APDPH in accordance with articles 43 paragraph 1
point b) and 43 paragraph 3 of the GDPR, taking into account the guidelines
lines 4/2018 of the ESPD.
