As part of examining the complaints, the Authority sent the person in charge
processing documents equal to the number of complaints, i.e. thirty-six (36) in total (with
original number G/EX/4652-1/12-07-2019, G/EX/4805-1/26-07-2019, G/EX/5070-1/09-08-2019,
C/EX/5803-1/19-11-2019, C/EX/6255-1/19-11-2019, C/EX/1297-1/21-05-2020, C/EX/1483-
1/21-05-2020, etc.), with which his opinions were requested on each of the above
complaints, which were attached to said documents. However, in spite of
repeated attempts by the Authority to contact the data controller
through the listed address and contact information on its website
(anoixisdate.gr), every action was ineffective.

For this reason, he sent to the National Telecommunications and Postal Commission
request to grant space name details with the application number C/EX/2372/01-04-2020
document in order to be informed about the details of the person it has
assigned the domain name 'www.anoixisdate.gr'. At the same time, he sent to the providers
of telecommunications Yuboto Ltd and Cosmote – Mobile Telecommunications SA with the documents under
No. C/EX/2376/01-04-2020 and No. C/EX/2378/01-04-2020 and message
e-mail from 17-11-2021, respectively, requests for the granting of
details of the owners of the telephone numbers in order to be informed about the persons at
which have been assigned the telephone numbers …, …, …, …, …, …, … and … of which
the said messages were sent, and to facilitate the examination of the above complaints.
 The National Telecommunications and Postal Commission responded to the grant request
site name data with document No. G/EIS/2554/08-04-2020.
According to EETT, the domain name anoixisdate.gr was registered on 06-19-2013 and
expired on 18-06-2021. The beneficiary of the domain name was A. Furthermore, with the document
No. C/EIS/2555/08-04-2020 the provider Yuboto Ltd responded to the request of
Authority to provide details of the owner of the telephone number ... . The phone guy
number ... has been assigned to the sole proprietorship of B, with A.F.M.: , D.O.Y.: ... and declared
mobile contact phone …. Finally, Cosmote with sub nos. first ... and C/EIS/7630/22-
11-2021 replied that: 1. The owner of the connections … and …, … and … is B with number
passport …, … e-mail: … . 2. Owner of the connections … and … is C of … (deleted
from 01/05/2020 and 09/03/2021, respectively) 3. Owner of the connection … for the period
1/02/2018 - 7/12/2018 was D. On 12/12/2018 this connection was transferred to B and
remained active until 17/10/2019.

Subsequently, the Authority sent clarification documents (prot. no.
C/EX/2669/14-04-2020 and C/EX/3330/15-05-2020) to A and B to inform them of

the submitted complaints to the Authority and asked them to present their views on
of the complainants, without receiving any response. Subsequently, every document to
data controller was sent to both of the above natural persons, but without
never be answered.
Finally, the Authority sent the under no. prot. 1619/29-06-2021 document to the company DNHOST,
registrar of the domain name www.anoixisdate.gr, regarding the person for whom
has proceeded with this entry since 06-16-2021. The company responded with…
her message that the beneficiary of the site name is B, with address ..., who proceeded
and in said entry. From a search in the Central Union public directory
of Chambers of Greece (https://www.businessregistry.gr/publicity/show/143491640000)
it appears that the above information of the said person operates a sole proprietorship
with distinctive title 'Αnoixis', ... .

Then the Authority called with no. prot. C/EX/397/22-02-2022 document no
controller and the two above natural persons, attaching the whole
of the complaints, at a hearing on Wednesday 02-03-2022, during which
the aforementioned complaints were to be discussed as well as the general practice
which is followed for the direct promotion of products and services with electronics
inside. However, although the document was duly served, neither was the person in charge
processing, but neither did any of the above natural persons attend.
 

The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file and referring to
of the meeting of 02-03-2022, after hearing the rapporteur and the
clarifications from the assistant rapporteur and after thorough discussion,

 

THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

1. According to art. 4 pc. 7 of the General Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter "General
Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR” or “Regulation”) for the protection of
natural persons against the processing of personal data and for
the free circulation of these data, which is in effect from
May 25, 2018, the controller is defined as "the natural or legal person, i
public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determine
the purposes and manner of personal data processing".

 

6

2. The issue of making unsolicited communications by any means
electronic communication, without human intervention, for direct purposes
commercial promotion of products or services and for any kind of advertising
purposes, is regulated in article 11 of Law 3471/2006 on personal protection
data in the field of electronic communications. According to this article, one
such communication is permitted only with the subscriber's express consent
expressly in advance. Exceptionally, according to art. 11 par. 3 of Law 3471/2006, the
legitimately obtained email contact information, in context
of the sale of products or services or other transaction, they may
are used to directly promote its similar products or services
supplier or to serve similar purposes, even when the recipient
of the message has not given his consent in advance, under
provided that he is provided in a clear and distinct manner with the possibility to
opposes, in an easy way and free of charge, the collection and use of
of electronic data and this during the collection of contact data, as well as
in each message, in case the user had not initially objected to this
use. It is also pointed out that short text messages (SMS) also constitute
e-mails according to the definitions of Law 3471/2006 and
of Directive 2002/58/EC.

3. According to art. 31 of the GDPR, the controller and the executor
processing and, as the case may be, their representatives cooperate, thereafter
request, with the supervisory authority for the exercise of its duties.

4. As can be seen from the data in the files of the complaints under review:

a. None of the complainants had expressly consented in advance
in order to receive advertising messages from the controller
but neither did he have any previous business contact or other relationship with him
controller so that the contact details have been obtained legally
them so that their prior consent is not required for sending them
specific messages. The controller did not provide any information to
prove that the required prior consent of the
recipients of the SMS messages, or that there had been a previous similar one
contact/communication.

 

7

b. In none of the specific messages, as attached to the complaints, no
refers to a valid address to which the recipient of the message can
requests the termination of the communication by exercising the right to object as defined
in article 11 par. 4 of Law 3471/2006.

c. As can be seen from the complaints under item. h', j', id', z', lb' and lst' above, o
controller did not respond to access/deletion requests
of data subjects submitted by electronic means. Therefore, no
nor does it adequately satisfy the subjects' right of access to the data
of their personal nature that are processed, as provided for in
article 15 of the Regulation, but neither the possibility of deleting them from the list
recipients of said communication, thereby infringing this right
of their objection to the processing, provided for in article 21 of the Regulation.

5. The controller did not cooperate with the Authority as he did not respond,
repeatedly, in none of the even number of complaints documents for clarification
which were sent to him both by e-mail and registered at
stated contact addresses that it has posted on its website and does not
attended the meeting of the Authority, where he was called for explanations.

6.

 No administrative sanction has been imposed by the Authority on the person in charge in the past
processing,

 

Based on the above, the Authority unanimously judges that according to Article 11 of Law
3471/2006 and articles 15, 21 and 31 of the GDPR, the conditions for enforcement in
burden of the controller, based on the one hand on article 13 of Law 3471/2006 on
combination with article 58 par. 2 sec. i' of the GDPR, the administrative sanction, which is mentioned
in the present provision, which is deemed proportionate to the gravity of the violation.

 
 

FOR THOSE REASONS

It imposes on the data controller the effective, proportional and
dissuasive administrative fine appropriate to the specific case
according to the special circumstances thereof, amounting to fifty-four thousand euros

 

8

(€54,000.00), for the above found violations of Article 11 of Law 3471/2006
and articles 15, 21 and 31 of the GDPR.
