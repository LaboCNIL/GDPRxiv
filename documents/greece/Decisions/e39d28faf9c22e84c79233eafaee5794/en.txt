As stated in the Finding and recorded in the findings:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system is not limited to entry and exit areas or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the treasury o, but covers additional workplaces where they move almost
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively employees. Let the specific workplaces include
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jobs let, both type of worker in a call center, and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working in a standard office space of one space.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system receives an image from the public street, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sidewalks, opposite buildings and the opposite perpendicular to N. Faliro Street,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the central entrance of the responsible person's facility, without receiving
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be limited to a space near the entrance.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• Our editor has posted information boards but only on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interior of the space.
  

 

 

 

-2-

 


• The controller was late in communicating its functionality
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance system to the Authority.
 

 

 

 

 

The person responsible for processing, then, with no. prot. G/EX/839/30-01-2018
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document of the Authority was only summoned to a hearing before the Authority at its session
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14-02-2018 to provide further clarifications and express his views on the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject. Together with his summons, the above Opinion was served. At her meeting
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

02-14-2018, B attended, who verbally presented the views of the person in charge. At
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then, our processor received a deadline and timely filed the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No. prot. C/EIS/1513/22-02-2018 memo.
  

 

 

 

 

In this memo, the data controller briefly supports the following:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regarding the first finding, he considered that there are objective conditions that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justify and tolerate the use of the video surveillance system for its sake
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workplace safety, the protection of persons and property
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goods.
 

Regarding the second finding, he considered that the conditions for its application were met
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of article 6 of Guideline 1/2011 of the APDPH, i.e. the bending of the prohibition principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of taking pictures from side streets and sidewalks.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As for the third finding, he accepts it and understands the obligation of immediateness
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance with the relevant door marking.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As for the fourth finding, he does not deny the failure to notify her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operator of the external cameras, but he should appreciate that, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

internal cameras were not working and therefore no processing took place
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data, a fact that was considered, well, that it did not dictate the relevant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notification.
 

 

 
With no. prot. C/EIS/2104/15-03-2018 supplementary memo o

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
our controller sent further data late. Specifically,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
attached relevant incident reports requested by him after the hearing. Also

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
inform about two more recent events within the month of March: a) phone call

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
in documents a for an imminent attack by RUBICON and b) receiving a suspect

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
parcel, for which the Piraeus Security Sub-Directorate was contacted.

The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file and referring to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the session of 02-14-2018, after hearing the rapporteur and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifications of the assistant rapporteurs, who then left before the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conference and decision-making, and after thorough discussion,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

 

 

 

 

 
1. According to article 2 par. a' of Law 2472/1997 and recitals 14-17
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, audio and video data, if
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to persons, constitute personal data.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. The storage and reading of a facial image, which is collected by a system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance, which operated permanently, continuously or at regular intervals,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a closed or open place of gathering or passage of persons, recommends
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of personal data in whole or in part
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automated within the meaning of articles 2 par. d' and 3 par. 1 Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Basic condition, according to article 4 par. 1 of Law 2472/1997, for the legality of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let us process personal data with the observance of proportionality, under
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning that the collected data must be necessary and convenient for him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended purpose, which should not have been achieved by milder
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside. Furthermore, the
 

 

 

data processing
 

 

image through system
 

 

 

video surveillance, for the purposes stated by the person in charge, can be relied upon
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only in the provision of no. 5 par. 2 e' of Law 2472/1997 "The processing is highly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 ngi for the notification of the legal interest pursued by the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processed by the third party or third parties to whom the data is shared and under
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the condition that this clearly overrides their rights and interests
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of persons who carry the data and the fundamentals are not affected
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their liberties".
 

 

4. According to article 5 of no. 1/2011 The Authority's guide for use
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance systems for the protection of persons and goods, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legality of our processing is examined in the context of the purpose pursued by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for our processing and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, which a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires video surveillance systems to be convenient and necessary in relation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the intended purpose, which should not be achieved with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-

 

milder means (articles 4 and 5 of Law 2472/1997). Affordability and necessity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of video surveillance is assessed based on the risk that the person in charge of processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants to deal with in relation to the intended purpose.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Furthermore, the installation points of the cameras and the way of receiving the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be identified in such a way that the data collected does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than is absolutely necessary to fulfill the purpose
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our processing and that the fundamental rights of the persons who
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are located in the area that is being monitored and that this order is not violated
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be seen as a "legitimate expectation of a certain degree of protection of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privacy" in a specific area.
 

 

 

 

 

6. Also, according to article 7 of no. 1/2011 Guide, the system should not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be used for the surveillance of employees within the workplaces,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except in special exceptional cases where this is justified by nature and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the working conditions and it is necessary for the protection of health and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee safety or the protection of sensitive workplaces (e.g.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military factories, banks, high-risk facilities). For example,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a typical business office space, video surveillance should be limited
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in entry and exit areas, without monitoring specific rooms
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offices or corridors. Exceptions may be specific spaces, such as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treasury or areas with safes, electromechanical equipment, etc., under the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition that the cameras focus on the property they are protecting and not on their premises
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers. Also, in special areas, such as areas with electromechanical ones
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities the shift manager or the safety manager may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

track in real time
 

 

 

 

the operators of high machinery
 

 

 

 

risk, in order to intervene immediately if an incident occurs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure let's
  

7. According to article 12 of no. 1/2011 Guide let, before a person enters the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the range of the video surveillance system, the processor must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informs, in a visible and comprehensible way, that he is about to enter a space that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

videotaped. To this end, they must: a) be posted in a sufficient number and prominently
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place clearly visible signs, where the person will be written on his behalf
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the video recording is made (responsible for editing), the purpose, as well as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person with whom the interested parties can contact to exercise them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that Law 2472/1997 recognizes in the data subject.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-

 

8. As stated in article 10 of no. 1/2011 Let us guide, the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processor is obliged to notify the Authority of the installation of the system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance before the start of our processing, in accordance with article 6 of n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997.
 

9. In the present case, taking into account the elements of the file, it appears
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The following:
 

 

 
• As there are no external information boards, visitors to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

premises are not informed about the operation of the video surveillance system,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in violation of no. 11 of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system was notified late to the Authority,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least as far as external cameras are concerned, and therefore there was
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of Article 6 of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system in question does not meet the legal requirements
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which are set in articles 7, 8, 12 and 19 of no. 1/2011 Guide of the Authority, since
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cameras operate in the workplace, without being justified by nature and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the working conditions. The controller's claim cannot
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are accepted, as the purpose of the protection of persons and goods may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was satisfied only with the operation of cameras in the attendance areas.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system in question does not meet the legal requirements
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which are set out in article 6 par. 1 and the surveillance of neighboring publics
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spaces extends to an excessive degree in outdoor spaces.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• Therefore, it is concluded that the fundamental requirements for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legality of any collection and processing of personal data,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the provisions of articles 4, 5 and 11 of Law 2472/1997 set.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Taking into account the above findings, and in view of their gravity

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
violations found, the Authority unanimously considers that it should be imposed on

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
responsible for the processing provided for in article 21 par. 1 item b' of n.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2472/1997 sanction referred to in the operative part of the present and the suspended

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
proportional to the number and gravity of the above violations.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
FOR THOSE REASONS

 

 

 

 

-6-

 

The Authority taking into account the above:
  

 

 

 

 

 

It imposes, based on articles 19 par. 1 item f and 21 of Law 2472/1997, at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law firm Sioufas and Associates fine of fifty thousand (50,000) euros
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the above described violations of Law 2472/1997.
