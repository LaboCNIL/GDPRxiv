complains that despite his repeated communication with the company ONLINE

DELIVERY S.A. (e-food) and the sending of corresponding electronic letters

on 01.11.2018 and 01.12.2018, with which he requested the deletion of his profile,

the company did not comply with his request for erasure within 30 days and did not

his account, b) secondly, A applied with the electronic from 1.11.2018

letter to him deleting his personal data, coming back with news

letter on 1.12.2018 in order to provide explanations on behalf of the company

for the absence of action to satisfy his request, c) in both as

THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

 

1. With article 94 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) under

No. 679/2016 repealed Directive 95/46/EC from 25.5.2018, when

in application the GDPR no. 99 par. 2 thereof from May 25, 2018.

 

2.

According to the provisions of article 17 par. 1 GDPR is provided to

data subject the right to delete personal data

character that concern it without undue delay and the person in charge

processing is obliged to delete the personal data without

unjustified delay, if one of the reasons provided for in

paragraphs a to f of the same paragraph.

 

The exercise of the right to erasure must be reviewed by

the data controller and receive a response within a month, otherwise o

the latter informs the data subject of any extension of art

due to a period of time, as well as for the reasons for the delay (article 12

par. 3 GDPR). If the controller does not act on his request

subject of the data, informs within one month of its receipt

request the data subject for the reasons why not

also acted on the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and

of legal action (article 12 par. 4 GDPR).

 

From the information in the file, the following emerged:

Complainant A with the 01.11.2018 and 1.12.2018 electronic

3.

  

letters to the e-food company, requested confirmation of its deletion

account, due to the deactivation of his old e-mail, as well as the

justification of the delay of the specific action. The e-food company with

her electronic letters of 1.11.2018 and 3.12.2018 recommended to

complainant to follow the company policy

process, addressing his request to the email address

privacy@e-food.gr. As it appears in particular from the provision document

clarifications of Online Delivery S.A. (e-food), no. 1052/08-02-2019, to

the Authority, the company carried out an internal audit, from which it emerged that the

complainant is not a user of its services, and that the personal

3

 

his data is not registered in the personal data file

held by the company.

4.. Because in this particular case the complainant did not follow the

deletion procedure provided by the relevant company policy.

       Because according to the aforementioned, data retention was not proven

personal data of the complainant in its filing system

of the denounced company Online Delivery S.A. (e-food), as well as the use of

part of its services as it did not provide relevant evidence.

      Because, consequently, there is no violation of the right to erasure

personal data and the right to information on

of the deletion request in case they are not included

personal data of the subject in its filing system

controller.

 

FOR THOSE REASONS

 

The Authority rejects the complaint as essentially unfounded.
