The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file, after hearing the rapporteur and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the assistant rapporteur, who left after the debate and before the conference and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision making, and after thorough discussion,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

 

 

 

 

1. the article 2 par. a', b', c', g', h' and j' of Law 2472/1997, as applicable, define the concepts
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of simple and sensitive data, the subject thereof, the data controller,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the processor and the recipient, respectively, while in par. d' of the same
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article defines the concept of processing, which includes "transmission, ...
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or any other form of disposition. Subsequently, in article 4 of the same law, the basic ones are defined
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles of the processing, while in article 5 the individual conditions for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its legitimacy. Furthermore, according to article 11 of the same law 2472/1997: "1. The one in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing must, during the stage of collecting personal data, to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it divides the subject in an appropriate and clear manner for at least the following elements: a.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his identity and the identity of any representative, b. the purpose of processing,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

c. the recipients or categories of recipients of the data, d. the existence of the right
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access s. 2. If the person responsible for the collection of personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing requires the consent of the subject, he must inform it specifically and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in writing for the elements of par. 1 of this article as well as for his rights,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with articles 11 to 13 of this law. With this, the person in charge
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing informs the subject whether or not he is obliged to provide his assistance,
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on which provisions, as well as for the possible consequences of its refusal. 3. If the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data is communicated to third parties, the subject is informed of the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
3

from them.". The fulfillment of the above notification obligation is further specified
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the no. 1/1999 Regulatory Act of the Authority for "In part subject to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of data according to article 11 of Law 2472/1997" (Government Gazette B΄ 555/1999), as well as with the provision of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of article 24 par. 3 of Law 2472/1997 which, although it is a transitional provision, reflects
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader and permanent will of the legislator for the cases in which it is about
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"large number of subjects" (see Decision 24/2004 of the Authority), in combination with the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no. 408/1998 Regulatory Act of the Authority on "On the part of subjects
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of personal data by the Press" (Government Gazette B' 1250/1998) which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it both specifies the concept of "a large number of subjects" by specifying that this applies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the number of these individuals is equal to or greater than one thousand (Article 1) as well as the
 
the manner in which this update must be made (articles 3 and 4). 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2. Regarding the processing of personal data in the context of securitization
 
bank claim (see Annual Report of the Authority 2014, under 3.6.2.)2, the Authority has judged that
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transfer of debt information from a bank to a special purpose company may
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered necessary for the fulfillment of its obligation imposed by law, in accordance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with article 5 par. 2 para. b of Law 2472/1997, and the terms and conditions that
 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states article 5 par. 2 para. e', i.e. transmission absolutely necessary for the pursuit and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection of the relevant claims, which obviously prevails over the rights and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests of the debtors, without affecting their fundamental freedoms, as long as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processed within the framework of law 3156/2003 by a limited circle of recipients.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It has also accepted that the transfer agreement of the securitized entrepreneurs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims is registered in the public book of article 3 of Law 2844/2000 in summary
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which contains its essential elements (article 10 par. 8 of Law 3156/2003). From
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration of the relevant agreement, the transfer of the securitized assets occurs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, unless otherwise specified in the terms of the contract, and the transfer
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(assignment) is announced in writing by the transferor or the special purpose company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the debtor (article 10 par. 9 of Law 3156/2003). Furthermore, as an announcement is considered the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration of the contract in the public book of article 3 of Law 2844/2000 in accordance with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the aforementioned provision of article 10 par. 8 of Law 3156/2003. therefore, the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration of the contract in the public book is recommended according to article 10 par. 10 of the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
1 it is noted that Regulation (EU) 2016/679 now explicitly promotes the principle of transparency of
 
 
processing and subsequently strengthens the subject's right to information (see articles 5, 13 and 14 of
 
Regulation and corresponding reasons in its preamble).

3156/2003 announcement of the contract of assignment to the debtor no written document required
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announcement of the assignment by the transferred company or the special purpose company to
 
the debtor.3 Therefore, as the Authority has further accepted, given that the more specific
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims securitization provisions state that it is sufficient and effective as notice
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(update) the registration of the relevant contract in the public book must be accepted
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it is not required in this case according to the special provisions and of another kind
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous individual update. Beyond that, however, the Authority pointed out that it is recommended
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time of data collection the data controller (the bank which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequently proceeds with securitization of its claim), to include in its content
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information provided, according to article 11 par. 1 of Law 2472/1997, as a charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipients, the special purpose companies in the case of securitization of receivables and,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

however, when securitizing the claim, the assigning bank or
 

     

     

   

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
the special purpose company must inform the debtor about this individually (e.g. with the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sending his relevant account). And this because, from the systematic interpretation of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the aforementioned provisions, it follows that the more specific provisions for securitization
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements remove the obligation to update article 11 par. 3 of law 2472/1997 only
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as necessary to implement their content and not the obligation itself
 
information.4 This is also in line with the obligation to inform, such as this
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided for in Directive 95/46/EC (see article 11), which he incorporated into the Greek
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 
3. With Law 4354/2015 (Government Gazette A΄ 176 16.12.2015) Management of non-performing loans,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wage regulations and other urgent provisions implementing the agreement
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

d of fiscal objectives and structural reforms, as amended and in force,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two new categories of companies were introduced into the Greek legal order, namely "Companies

of Acquisition of Claims from Loans and Credits (E.A.A.A.D.P.)". From its provisions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this law in combination with PDTE 118/19-05-2017 (Government Gazette B΄ 1764/22-05-2017)

Claims Management Companies is identified, first of all, with the corresponding management that will

which have been determined in advance in the “management delegation agreement

undertake, on behalf of the contracting bank, the legal and accounting
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow-up of the claim until full or partial payment of the debt. For the purpose
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, the Claims Management Companies are authorized, among other things, to sign
