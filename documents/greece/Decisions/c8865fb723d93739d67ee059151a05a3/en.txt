THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

1. The Fourth Department of the Council of State, in the context of examining applications
of annulment against Decisions of the Authority by which fines were imposed for
unsolicited political communication, based on the provision of article 11 of
Law 3471/2006, accepted that: "...To limit the, necessary for the
functioning of the democratic state, communication of the candidate for parliament
during the pre-election period with the electors of the district in
which is applying, special regulation is required. No such special arrangement
can be considered article 11 par. 1 of Law 3471/2006 [...] which regulates the
unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes
products or services and for any kind of advertising purposes,
transferring the corresponding provision of article 13 of directive 2002/58, re
unsolicited calls for direct marketing purposes, as well as in
communication described in the above provisions does not, however, fall within the scope of communication
of the parliamentary candidate during the pre-election period. [...] This interpretation does not
affects the protection of the personal data of the individuals involved
persons, [â€¦], since the general ones still apply
provisions of the GDPR, based on which the legality of each can be judged
processing". (see SC 1343, 1344, 1345/2022).

2. In the decisions of the Authority with no. 19 of the year 2019, 12, 14, 17, 19, 24, 28, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 56, 58 of the year 2020, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 19 and 46 of
of the year 2021 and 17 and 26 of the year 2022, sanctions have been imposed for unsolicited
political communication on the basis of the above provision of article 11 of the law.
3471/2006. Taking into account the aforementioned decisions
Council of State, there is a legal reason for revocation of the above
of the Authority's decisions, with which sanctions were imposed under
provision of article 11 of Law 3471/2006 and not in the provisions of the GDPR which
is still applied to assess the legitimacy of each
processing.
