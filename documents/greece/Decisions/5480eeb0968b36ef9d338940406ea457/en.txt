The Authority, after examining the evidence of the file, the hearing process and after hearing the rapporteur and the clarifications of the assistant rapporteur, who subsequently withdrew before the conference and decision, and after thorough discussion, HELD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW 1.

Political communication carried out by human intervention (calls), through public communication networks, is not permitted, in accordance with article 11 par. 2 of Law 3471/2006, as applicable, as long as the subscriber has declared to the service provider service available to the public that they generally do not wish to receive such calls. 5.
