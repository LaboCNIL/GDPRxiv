The Authority, after examining the elements of the file and after hearing the rapporteur and the assistant rapporteur, who withdrew after the discussion of the case and before the conference and decision-making, after a thorough discussion THINKS ACCORDING TO THE LAW 1. By Article 94 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) no. 679/2016, Directive 95/46/EC was repealed from 25.5.2018, when the GDPR came into force no. 99 par. 2 thereof from May 25, 2018. 2. The provisions of articles 13 and 14 GDPR include the information provided by the controller to the subject when personal data is collected. In accordance with the provisions of Article 15 para. 1 GDPR, the subject of the rights has the right to receive from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not the personal data concerning him is being processed and, if this is the case, the right of access to the personal data and the information detailed in the subsections of the said paragraph. Furthermore, according to Article 16 GDPR, the data subject has the right to demand from the controller without undue delay the correction of inaccurate personal data concerning him. Bearing in mind the purposes of the processing, the data subject has the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including through a supplementary statement. If the data controller does not act on the data subject's request, he shall inform the data subject within one month of receiving the request of the reasons why he did not act and of the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and bringing legal action (Article 12 par. 4 GDPR). Finally, according to article 37 para. 7 GDPR the data controller publishes the contact details of the data protection officer (DPO), while according to article 38 para. 4 GDPR the data subjects can contact the data protection officer (DPO ) for any issue related to the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their rights pursuant to the GDPR. 3. From the information in the file, the following emerged: Complainant A with his electronic letters of 16.10.2018, 17.10.2018 at 13:10, 17.10.2018 at 13:10, 18.10.2018 and 6.11.2018 to the AADE, addressing its DPO, requested the change (correction) of his residential address that was registered in the TAXISnet information system due to the fact that he permanently resides abroad. The Independent Public Revenue Authority (AADE) with its electronic letter dated 17.10.2018 at 08:10, indicated to the complainant the relevant legislation for the change of his tax residence in order for him to follow the tax procedure prescribed by law. The complainant in his electronic letter of 17.10.2018 at 13:10 replied to AADE that the question (request) was addressed to the DPO and not to AADE and for this reason he requested that it be forwarded to the DPO and informed about the data communication of the latter in order to address it directly. The AADE with its electronic letter dated 18.10.2018 at 13:10 replied in relation to the DPO that "your message is not related to the security of personal data, as the taxpayer is responsible for updating the residential address" and indicated the procedure prescribed by the tax law for changing the declaration of tax residence. The complainant, in his electronic letter dated 18.10.2018 at 21:30, after commenting on the previous response of AADE, repeated his request to be informed of the details of the DPO in order to contact him to resolve his issue. 4 The AADE with its electronic letter of 22.10.2018 forwarded to the complainant the details of the independent DPO support department and its head, from which it received on 06-12-2018 a response to the request for the correction of the details of the residential address of, according to which, the request was forwarded to the competent authorities of AADE and is under examination. From the AADE clarification document, no. 354/18-01-2019, to the Authority after the attached correspondence, it appears that the complainant was informed about the contact details of the DPO of AADE and that his request was forwarded for processing by the competent department of AADE. 4. Because in particular, in the case under consideration, according to the aforementioned, the Independent Public Revenue Authority (AADE) informed the complainant about the contact details of the data protection officer (DPO) of the AADE. Because the complainant does not plead a violation of the right to correct the personal data concerning him.
Because the competent services of AADE have not rejected the request

change of the data of the tax residence of the complainant but the

examine in the context of the relevant tax legislation and procedure.

 

FOR THOSE REASONS

 

The Authority rejects the complaint as essentially unfounded.
