and by foreign nationals from the same category are determined by decision of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ministries of Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization, Foreign Affairs, National
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Defense, Justice and Public Order". Based on the above authorization

above KYA, for the observance of E.K.ANA.A. and the processing of the corresponding ones

and especially of art. 4 and 13 thereof. Also, according to the provisions of art. 82 of the law

registration of a third-country national in the E.K.ANA.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

3. Because, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item b' of Law 3386/2005 shows that the registration of a foreigner in EKANA
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is allowed, as long as there is a violation of this law regarding entry and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence of third country nationals in Greek territory, which has led to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative deportation of the alien. The same is true in cases where it has
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered to deport the foreigner based on art. 74 PC due to conviction for
