additional requirements for the accreditation of the organizations that grant

articles 42 and 43 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons against the processing of personal data (General
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Data Protection Regulation – GDPR). They were attended by the President,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constantinos Menudakos, and the regular members Pyridon Vlachopoulos,

Konstantinos Limniotis, informatics, as assistant lecturers, who provided
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifications and left before the conference and decision making, as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Irini Papageorgopoulou, employee of the Department of Administrative Affairs,
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as secretary.
  

 

 

 

The Authority took into account the following:
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 42 paragraph 1 of the GDPR provides that the Member States, the supervisory
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
 

authorities, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the Commission
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encourage the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms. And this
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the establishment of these voluntary accountability tools can improve the
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transparency and compliance with the GDPR and to allow their subjects
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data to assess the level of data protection of the relevant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

products and services (recital 100 GDPR).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In particular, compliance with an approved certification mechanism may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be used as evidence of compliance with obligations
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the data controller (Article 24 par. 3 GDPR) or as evidence to prove
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the processor provides sufficient assurances in accordance with par. 1
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 4 of article 28 (article 28 par. 5 GDPR). It is also taken into account during
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making a decision regarding the imposition of an administrative fine as well as regarding
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the amount of the administrative fine (Article 83 paragraph 2 letter j) GDPR).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The certification is granted by a certification body accredited for this purpose,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on article 43 of the GDPR, to a controller or executor
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, who has submitted the relevant processing to the mechanism
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification. The accreditation of certification bodies is of particular importance as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides official confirmation of the relevant competence of these bodies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making it possible to develop trust in the certification mechanism. THE
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accreditation of a certification body is carried out by the competent supervisory authority or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the national accreditation body or by both of these bodies (Article 43
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

par. 1 GDPR) and is granted for a maximum period of five years, and may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revised under the same conditions, provided that the certification body
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meets the requirements of article 43 (article 43 par. 4 GDPR). If the accreditation
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried out by the national accreditation body according to the EN-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ISO/IEC 17065/2012
 

 

(ISO 17065), the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional requirements set by the competent supervisory authority.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority after hearing the rapporteurs, as well as the assistant rapporteurs, the
