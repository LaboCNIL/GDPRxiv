implementation from May 25, 2018. In accordance with the provisions of article 15 par. 1

and 3 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to receive from the

character that concern it are being processed as well as b) a copy of

personal data processed and in particular

to know the following information: the purposes of the processing, the categories

the period of their observance, the existence of the right to submit a request

to the controller for correction or deletion of data, limitation

processing or right to object to said processing, the right

of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority, the source of the data and the existence

automated decision-making, including training

Profile. The controller is obliged to provide the subject of

given the information without delay within one month of its receipt

request. This deadline may be extended by two more months,

if required, taking into account the complexity of the request and

number of requests. The controller informs the subject of

data for said extension within one month of receipt of the request,

as well as for the reasons for the delay (article 12 par. 3 of the GDPR). If o

controller does not act on the subject's request

data, informs the subject within one month of receiving the request

of the data on the reasons why it did not act and the possibility

filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and bringing legal action (art

each supervisory authority has, among other things, the power to issue reprimands

to the controller or processor when operations

processing have violated the provisions of this regulation.

2. From the information in the file, the following emerged: The applicant with

from ... her request to the SEP YNANP asked to be provided to the candidates

for the positions of supervisors, the right to submit objections - treatment requests

on the scoring and to be informed about her detailed scoring.

The Board of Selection of Heads of the Ministry of Shipping and Archipelago

Policy did not satisfy the applicant's right of access to

her detailed scoring, since she failed to respond to her relevant request

applicant. With regard to the process of submitting objections, it must

note that the right to correct the applicant's data does not

is identical with the right to submit an objection or a treatment request that may arise

the law reserves the right to re-evaluate its quota. Accordingly, the

any dispute of the obtained scoring cannot be requested with the

exercise of the right to rectification and is therefore unfoundedly referred to

specific case before the Authority the violation of article 16 GDPR.

3. Because, according to the aforementioned, in the considered case o

denounced body does not

satisfied

the right of access

her

applicant in the data that concerned her, in violation of the provisions

of articles 12 and 15 GDPR.

 

FOR THOSE REASONS

 

Addresses on the basis of article 58 par. 2 b' of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 a reprimand

to the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy for the violation of

provisions of articles 12 and 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
