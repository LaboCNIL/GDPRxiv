After examining the evidence of the case file, after they were read

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the minutes of the meeting of 27-09-2017, after hearing his proposal

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
rapporteur and the assistant rapporteur, who then left, and after

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
thorough discussion,

 

 
The beginning,

 

 

 

 
THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

 

 

 

 

1. Because the provision of article 2 par. (b) of Law 2472/1997 on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Protection of the individual from the processing of personal data,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
interpreted in the light of the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
European Union, and, in particular, those of article 8, as well as in the light

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and
 Council, of 24 October 1995, for the protection of natural persons
 
against our processing of personal data and for the free
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
circulation of these data defines, for the purposes of this law, as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
sensitive personal data and those concerning his health

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
their subject.

 

2. Because, from the combination of the provisions of articles 5 and 7 of L.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2472/1997, interpreted in the light of the above provisions of the Charter

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of Fundamental Rights

 

 
of the European Union, and

 

 

 

 
those

 
her

 
of the aforementioned Directive 95/46/EC, it follows that the collection and any further

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
processing of simple and sensitive personal data is allowed,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
in principle, if the data subject has given his consent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
However, the collection and any further processing of both simple and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of sensitive personal data is allowed, exceptionally, and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
without the consent or despite the refusal of their subject, in the cases

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
limited by law.

 

 

 

 

3. Because, for the legality of processing either simple or sensitive
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of personal data must, in accordance with the provisions

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of article 4 par. 1 item (a) and (b) of Law 2472/1997, to be fulfilled additionally

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and the fundamental principles of purpose of processing and proportionality

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
(necessity and affordability) of the data always in relation to him

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
intended purpose of the processing. therefore, personnel data

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1-3 Kifis St., 11523 Athens, Tel: 210 6475600, Fax: 210 6475628, contact@dpa.gr / www.dpa.gr

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

2



 
nature must be collected in a legitimate and legal manner for specified,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
clear and legitimate purposes and that there is legitimate and legal processing in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
in view of these purposes, while any processing of personal data, which

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
becomes beyond the intended purpose or is not suitable and necessary for it

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
achieving it, is not legal.

 

 

 

 

4. Because, article 11 par. 3 of Law 2472/1997 expressly states that "if the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are announced to them, the subject is informed of the announcement before
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
them".

5. Because, article 16 of the law stipulates, among other things, that: "2. Child a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a basic mission of the State and aims at the moral, spiritual,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional and physical education of the Greeks, the development of the national and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of religious consciousness and their development into free and responsible citizens".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. The years of compulsory education cannot be less than nine. 4. All the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Greeks have the right to free education, at all levels, in state schools
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

educational institutions. The State supports students who excel, as well
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those in need of assistance or special protection, depending on abilities
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
their. (…)".

 
6. Because the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU enshrines, among
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
others, the individual's right to human dignity (Article 1), the right

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
to the integrity of the person (Article 3), the right to respect for private

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and family life of the individual (article 7) and the right to the protection of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
personal data (Article 8), the right to education and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
access to professional and continuous training (Article 14),

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
prohibition of discrimination (Article 21) and the inclusion of people with disabilities

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
needs (Article 26).

 

 

7. Because Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) – which was sanctioned together with the Optional

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Protocol to this convention with the first article of Law 4074/2012 (Official Gazette A, 88)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
- stipulates for the right to education of the disabled: "1. States Parties recognize
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right of the disabled to education. In order to do justice
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that without discrimination and on the basis of your opportunities, the States Parties shall ensure one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inclusive education system at all levels and continuous learning that

Parties shall ensure that: (a) PWDs are not excluded from mainstream education
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system due to disability, and that children with disabilities are not excluded from it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

free and compulsory primary education, or secondary education,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the disability, (b) PWDs can have access to an integrated,

(e) effective personalized measures

facilitate PWDs to acquire skills both in terms of how to carry out
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their lives, in terms of their social development to facilitate it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their full and meaningful participation in education and as members of society. Therefore, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States Parties shall take appropriate measures, including: (a) facilitating
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Braille learning, alternative texts, auxiliary and alternative
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

methods, means and forms of communication and orientation and movement

through communication for the individual, and in an environment that maximized the academic
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and social development. 4. To help ensure compliance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this right, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to recruit

the others. In this regard, States Parties shall ensure the provision of reasonable
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
of adaptation to the disabled".

 

 

8. Because, with the provisions of Law 3699/2008 on Special Education and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Education of persons with disabilities or with special educational needs (Government Gazette A, 199,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
02-10-2008), establishes – according to its introductory report – the mandatory

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
character of special education and training as an integral part of it

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
compulsory and free public education and the minimum is specified

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
its duration, for compliance of the national legislator with the aforementioned

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, it is established that the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
educational process must take place in facilities (school buildings,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
laboratories, educational structures, etc.), which meet all the conditions

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
accessibility (building infrastructure) for people with disabilities, and it is defined that the

technologies, research and development of innovative tools, aids, etc.) which

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
are necessary in order to facilitate their stay, but also their integration

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
students with disabilities in the general educational process.

 

 

 

 

 

 

9. Because, with articles 59ff. of Law 4488/2017 Pension regulations
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Public and other insurance provisions, in connection with their protection
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
workers, rights of persons with disabilities and other provisions (Government Gazette A, 137,
