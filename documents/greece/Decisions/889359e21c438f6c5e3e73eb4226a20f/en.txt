prot. C/EX/6972/28-09-2017 order of the President of the Authority.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Prior to carrying out this on-site inspection, the register was examined
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of notifications kept by the Authority, where no notification was found for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data processing through a video surveillance system.
  

 

 

 

 

The control was sudden, without prior notification of the person in charge

As stated in the Finding and recorded in the findings:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system is not limited to entry and exit areas or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the treasury, but it also covers workplaces where they move almost
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively employees.
 

 

 
• The video surveillance system also includes cameras that monitor the area
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the bank seats.
 

 

 
• The video surveillance system receives an image from both the public street and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sidewalk, outside the main entrance of the store.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• Our editor has not posted boards to update them

In said memo it is stated, among other things, that the person in charge of our processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

installed the video surveillance system for the purpose of protecting persons and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goods and following repeated incidents of theft and burglary.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file and referring to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the session of 08-11-2017, after hearing the rapporteur and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifications of the assistant rapporteurs, who then left before the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conference and decision-making, and after thorough discussion,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

 

1. According to article 2 par. a' of Law 2472/1997 and recitals 14-17
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, audio and video data, if
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to persons, constitute personal data.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. The storage and reading of a facial image, which is collected by a system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance, which operated permanently, continuously or at regular intervals,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a closed or open place of gathering or passage of persons, recommends
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of personal data in whole or in part
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automated within the meaning of articles 2 par. d' and 3 par. 1 of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Basic condition, according to article 1 par. 1 of Law 2472/1997, for the legality of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let us process personal data with the observance of proportionality, under
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning that the collected data must be necessary and convenient for him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended purpose, which should not have been achieved by milder
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside.
 

 

4. According to article 5 of no. 1/2011 The Authority's guide for use
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance systems for the protection of persons and goods, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-

 

legality of our processing is examined in the context of the purpose pursued by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for our processing and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, which a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires video surveillance systems to be convenient and necessary in relation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the intended purpose, which should not be achieved with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

milder means (Article 4 of Law 2472/1997). Its affordability and necessity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of video surveillance is estimated based on the risk that the controller wants
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to deal with in relation to the intended purpose.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. Furthermore, the installation points of the cameras and the way of receiving the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be identified in such a way that the data collected does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than is absolutely necessary to fulfill the purpose
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our processing and that the fundamental rights of the persons who
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are located in the area that is being monitored and that this order is not violated
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be seen as a "legitimate expectation of a certain degree of protection of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privacy" in a specific area.
 

 

 

 

 

 

6. Also, according to article 7 of no. 1/2011 Guide, the system should not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be used for the surveillance of employees within the workplaces,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except in special exceptional cases where this is justified by nature and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the working conditions and it is necessary for the protection of health and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee safety or the protection of sensitive workplaces (e.g.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military factories, banks, high-risk facilities). For example,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a typical business office space, video surveillance should be limited
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in entry and exit areas, without monitoring specific rooms
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offices or corridors. Exceptions may be specific spaces, such as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treasury or areas with safes, electromechanical equipment, etc., under the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

condition that the cameras focus on the property they are protecting and not on their premises
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers. Also, in special areas, such as areas with electromechanical ones
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities the shift manager or the safety manager may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

track in real time
 

 

 

 

the operators of high machinery
 

 

 

 

risk, in order to intervene immediately if an incident occurs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure let's
  

 

7. Also, in accordance with article 19 par. 2 of no. 1/2011 Let's guide, cameras
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are allowed to be placed at the entrance and exit points of the stores, at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cash desks and money storage areas, in goods warehouses, while,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to article 19 par. 4 of our Guide, it is prohibited to operate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-

 

of cameras in places of rest and recreation, in the testing rooms, in the toilets and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the areas where store employees work and is not accessible to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public.
 

 

8. According to article 12 of no. 1/2011 Guide let, before a person enters the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the range of the video surveillance system, the processor must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informs, in a visible and comprehensible way, that he is about to enter a space that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

videotaped. To this end, they must: a) be posted in a sufficient number and prominently
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place clearly visible signs, where the person will be written on his behalf
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the video recording is made (responsible for editing), the purpose, as well as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person with whom the interested parties can contact to exercise them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights that Law 2472/1997 recognizes in the data subject.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9. As stated in article 10 of no. 1/2011 Let us guide, the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processor is obliged to notify the Authority of the installation of the system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance before the start of our processing, in accordance with article 6 of n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997.
 

 

In the present case, and taking into account the above elements, they arise
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The following:
 

 

 
• The system in question had not been disclosed to the Authority, and therefore it existed
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of Article 6 of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• The video surveillance system in question does not meet the legal requirements
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which are set in articles 7, 8, 12 and 19 of no. 1/2011 Guide of the Authority, since
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there were cameras in the workplace, without being justified by nature and them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working conditions Also cameras were taking pictures from the table seats
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restaurant, and no signs were posted to inform the public
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the video surveillance system.
 

 

 

 

 

 
• Therefore, it is concluded that the fundamental requirements for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legality of any collection and processing of personal data,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the provisions of articles 4 and 11 of Law 2472/1997 set.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taking into account the above findings, and in view of their gravity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations found, the Authority unanimously considers that it should be imposed on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsible for the processing provided for in article 21 par. 1 item b' of n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-

 

2472/1997 sanction referred to in the operative part of the present and the suspended
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportional to the gravity of the violations.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

The Authority taking into account the above:
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1) It imposes, based on articles 19 par. 1 item f and 21 of Law 2472/1997, at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Alki Alqi Zarballa" fined one thousand (1,000) euros for the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described violations of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

2) Orders, based on articles 19 par. 1 item. f and 21 of Law 2472/1997, no
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alki Alqi Zarballa Zarballa as he immediately performed the following actions,

of the store and the cameras located inside it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shop and get a view from the seating area. b) Yes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modify the field of view of the camera located outside the store
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so that it focuses on the entrance and does not get an image from the sidewalk and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public road. c) To modify the recording level of the camera that monitors the cash register

orders. d) To destroy any relevant document with personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of employees and customers collected by the system installed so far
