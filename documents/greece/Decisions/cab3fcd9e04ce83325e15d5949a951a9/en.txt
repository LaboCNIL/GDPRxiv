The Authority, after examining the aforementioned data, heard the rapporteur

and the clarifications from the assistant rapporteur and after a thorough discussion,

 

 

CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE LAW

1.

Because, the art. 24 of Regulation 1987/2006 in accordance with

provisions of the previous article 96 SESS regulates the registration conditions

third country nationals in the Schengen Information System (SIS II). Also in the article

29 par. 2 and 4 provides that to maintain the registration in SIS II for

a longer period of time, timely existence within the three-year period is deemed necessary

specially reasoned decision of the organ deciding the registration, which to

justifies the need to maintain it beyond three years. The competent body

decides after a recorded overall and individual assessment the

need to maintain it otherwise, the registration is automatically deleted (par. 5

Regulation). Moreover, from the provisions of articles 41, 43, 44 of the aforementioned Regulation

in conjunction with the provision of article 10 par. 4 of Law 4624/2019, it is concluded that the

Authority is competent to examine, following the subject's appeal, the legality

of its entry in the list of S.P.S. (SIS II), according to the above

provisions issued by the Authority responsible for the registration, of the decision on the

the need to maintain it beyond the time mentioned in the above provisions and

if the above conditions of the registration and the

of its maintenance, to order the deletion.

           2. Because, article 1 and article 3 of KYA4000/4/32-la΄/17.10.2012, as

this was replaced and applies with article 1 par. 2 of KYA4000/4/32-n

/31.03.2017, provide respectively the conditions for registration of foreigners in

I DID. and the ex officio review of each registration every three years.

In addition, according to art. 6 of the above KYA, for compliance with the E.K.ANA.A. and

the processing of the corresponding personal data apply the

relevant provisions of Law 2472/1997 and in particular of Art. 4 and 13 thereof, while the article

83 of Law 4624/2019 stipulates that "where in provisions of the existing legislation

3

reference to Law 2472/1997 is understood as a reference to the relevant provisions of the GDPR and

present".

          3. Because, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1

item a' of Law 3386/2005 it follows that "serious criminal acts" are understood not

only those that carry a penalty of imprisonment of at least one year

but also those expressly listed in the provision of article 76 par. 1 item. a' of

above law. In particular, "serious criminal acts" are also understood as

crimes of forgery and use of forged documents (Authority Gazette no.

3/2012).

       4. Because, for the legality of registration both in case of conviction and

and in the event of the existence of nuanced indications of the commission of a "serious crime

deed", from the above mentioned, the body responsible for the registration will

must take into account and take into account all the circumstances in its decision

execution of the criminal act and to deliver a specially reasoned judgment on it

"threat" constituted by the presence of a foreigner on national territory (see

previous thought).

5. In the case under consideration, from the information in the file and the

clarifications from the Directorate of Aliens of Attica, it emerged that the applicant A

registered with E.K.ANA.A. and in S.P.S. for reasons of public order and

of security on ... until ..., on the basis of Decision No. ... of the competent authority

officer of the Directorate of Aliens of Attica.

From the registration of the foreigner in question in E.K.A.N.A. and in S.P.S.

three years have passed and the ... by ... decision of the competent officer has been issued

of the Directorate of Aliens of Attica, by which it was reviewed, according to

defined in paragraph 3 par.1 of art. 3 of no. K.Y.A. 4000/4/32-la and

the registration of the above in the S.P.S. was maintained. and to E.K.ANA.A. until  ...,

since the original reasons for registration were deemed to still apply.

Consequently, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, its registration

applicant in the S.P.S. and E.K.A.N.A. it is legal, as it was registered

in the above lists for reasons of public order and security, before

and after three years from the initial registration, it was decided to maintain it

of its registration both in the S.P.S and in the E.K.A.N.A.

Consequently, her appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.

 

For those reasons

 

The Authority rejects A's appeal for the deletion of her data from the

S.P.S. and E.K.A.N.A.
