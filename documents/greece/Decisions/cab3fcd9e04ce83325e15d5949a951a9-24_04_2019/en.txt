1.

Because, the art. 24 of Regulation 1987/2006 in accordance with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of the previous article 96 E regulates the registration conditions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third country nationals in the European Information System (SIS II). Also in the article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 par. 2 and 4 provides that to maintain the registration in SIS II for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer period of time, timely existence within the three-year period is deemed necessary
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specially reasoned decision of deciding the registration of an instrument, which to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justifies the need to maintain it beyond three years. The competent body
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decides after a recorded overall and individualized evaluation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to maintain it otherwise, the registration is automatically deleted (par. 5
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulation). Besides, from the provisions of articles 41, 43, 44 of the aforementioned Regulation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in combination with the provision of article 19 par. 1 sub-section (e) of Law 2472/1997,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is concluded that the Authority is competent to consider, following an appeal by the subject,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the legality of its entry in the list .P. . (SIS II), in accordance with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions above issued by the competent authority for the registration, of the decision
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the need to maintain it beyond the time mentioned by the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions and if the above conditions of the registration are not met and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its maintenance, to order the deletion.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

2. Because, article 1 and article 3 of KYA4000/4/32-la΄/17.10.2012, as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was replaced and is valid with article 1 par. 2 of KYA4000/4/32-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

n'/31.03.2017, provide respectively the conditions for the registration of foreigners in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I DID. and the ex officio review of each registration every three years.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In addition, according to art. 6 of the above KYA, for compliance with the E.K.ANA.A. and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the processing of the corresponding personal data are applied
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant provisions of Law 2472/1997 and in particular of Art. 4 and 13 thereof.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

3. Because, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item a' of Law 3386/2005 it follows that "serious criminal acts" are understood not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only those that carry a sentence of imprisonment of at least one year
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but also those expressly listed in the provision of article 76 par. 1 item a' of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above law. specifically, as "serious criminal acts" are also understood

4

crimes of forgery and use of forged documents (Authority Gazette no.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3/2012).
 

      

4. Because, for the legality of the registration both in case of conviction and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in the event of the existence of nuances of evidence for the commission of a "serious crime
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deed", from those mentioned above, the body responsible for the registration will
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must take into account and take into account all the circumstances in his decision
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commission of the criminal act and to issue a specially reasoned judgment for it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"threat" constituted by the presence of a foreigner on national territory (see
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous thought).
  

 

5. the case under consideration, from the information in the file and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarifications from the Directorate of Aliens of Attica, it emerged that the applicant A
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered with E.K.ANA.A. and in .P. . for reasons of public order and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of security on … until … , based on the no. first ... Decision of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Head of the Foreigners' Office of Attica. In particular, it was registered first,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for violation of the provisions of Law 3386/2005 on entry, residence and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social integration of third country nationals in the Greek Territory as well as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

secondly, for the reason that it was judged as dangerous for public order and safety due
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of her conviction at first instance for the offenses of forgery using a document
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and attempted usurpation of a false certificate.
 

 

 

 

 

It should be noted that the applicant, regardless of her suspension in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden of criminal prosecution due to statute of limitations, entered Greek territory
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived of legalizing residence documents so she was deemed dangerous for her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public order. Its attributed and now disappeared by statute of limitations category
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forgery using a document and attempting to obtain a false certificate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not in any way change the fact of the applicant's illegal entry and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extension of her characterization as dangerous for public order. not at all

legal formalities.

Consequently, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, its registration
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant in .P. . and E.K.A.N.A. it is legal, as it was registered
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the above lists for reasons of public order and security, before
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and after three years from the initial registration, it was decided to maintain it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its registration both in .P. as well as in E.K.A.N.A.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consequently, her appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For those reasons
 

 

 

 

The Authority rejects A's appeal for the deletion of her data from the
