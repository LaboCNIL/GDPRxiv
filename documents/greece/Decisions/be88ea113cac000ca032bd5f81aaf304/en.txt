The Authority, after examining the contents of the file, after hearing the speaker
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the assistant teacher, who then left, and after the exit

CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. Art. 2 par. 8 of Law 3051/2002 on "Constitutionally protected
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent authorities, modification and completion of the recruitment system at
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public sector and related regulations" issued pursuant to Article 101
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A of the Constitution defined that "8. Against the executory decisions of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of independent authorities, a request for annulment may be brought before the Council

d o k e appeals. End and aids against the decisions of the independents
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities may also be exercised by the relevant Minister".
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 24 par. 1 of Law 2690/1999 (K.D.D ad.) defines that "If from the relations
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so the possibility of exercising it, according to the next article, was not foreseen
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of evidence, or of an appeal, the person in question, for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restoration of material or moral damage to the legal interests of the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused by an individual act may, for any reason, by application
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, to request, either from the audit authority which issued the deed, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its revocation or amendment (remedial request), either, by the authority which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in charge of the one that issued the deed, its cancellation (erarch ki
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recourse)". In the true sense of the provision, the application for treatment is intended
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the revocation or modification of the contested individual verification act
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for legal or real defects of it which go back to the regime under the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which was issued.
 

 

2. With the above provisions of article 24 K.D.D ad. enacted d burning each
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"related" document, which has suffered material or moral damage from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual legal act, to appeal against the authority that issued said
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act before resorting to judicial protection (simple judicial appeal,

retaliating with the standard "definitive" and "indefinite" appeals of Article 25
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

K.D.D ad.1. The appeal in question requests the revocation or amendment
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the above-mentioned individual proof deed in order to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the material or moral damage to his legal interests is remedied
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant that the valid act caused, in those cases where o
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law does not provide for the possibility of exercising the above appeals of the article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 K.D.D ad.2.
 

 

According to the above classification "relevant" does not have to be
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the one to whom the deed that requests its revocation concerns, it is enough to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove his legal interest3. He has a legitimate interest, the subject
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material or moral damage, within the meaning of articles 298 of the Civil Code and 932 of the Civil Code, from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offending individual legal act. Well, the legitimate interest
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presupposes material or moral damage that has already occurred (NSK GN230/2013).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Furthermore, according to the standard jurisprudence of the CoE (indicative CoE 1002/2007), the law
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest must be immediate, personal and present. Because of its existence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal interest, according to the above, the general interest of each is not sufficient
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen, but necessarily a genuine and direct legal interest, which concerns the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned person and a general circle of persons (StE 2717/2007, Coll.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

StE971/1998, All. StE 2856/1985, Coll. CoE 2855/1985). It should, that is, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damage from the offending act to be personally suffered by the person o
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the applicant (StE 605/2008). Furthermore, as far as the legal interest is concerned
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personally, there should be a proper relationship between the offending act
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ms. of the applicant, who is affected in a harmful way either by the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offended act or from the omission of effective law inaction,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e. this should be directly linked to the damage suffered by the applicant (StE
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2998/1998, 2305/1995). Finally, it must be present, i.e. the damage must exist
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the person of the appellant during the issuance of the contested certificate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deed, during the exercise of the remedy and during the discussion of the case
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(StE 4045/1996). Interest future or eventuality and ahor to or simply
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected or past making the appeal inadmissible (StE 2449/1980).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to the above, the applicant must have suffered material or moral damage,

to the fact that it is a basic condition for it to be in principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his application for the restoration of the resulting damage is accepted.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the damage, as a basis for establishing the legal interest,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must be properly specified. In other words, the appellant should have called the
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse changes coming to his detriment from the deed to be established
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the legal interest to file an appeal (see SC 3905/2004, SC
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1995/2016).
  

3. In the present case, with the submitted application for treatment, the appellant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the revocation or modification of the no. prot. G/EX/6059/09.07.2018
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(Authority Decision 54/2018) act of the Authority. Of the reasons, you are welcome
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the revocation or amendment of the aforementioned deed, which it was not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other than those he presented in his initial appeal before the Authority,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on which the contested decision was issued, it did not appear that it had
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material or moral damage to his interests. On the contrary, the above principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his appeal was accepted and for this reason he was imposed with the offended party
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54/2018 decision and corresponding sanction to the first complainant. In every
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, the appellant does not invoke specific reasons to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledge material or moral damage to his legal interests, which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it came from the contested decision, but it requests, as stated, the enforcement
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the expense of I.S.A. of the sanction of the fine (article 21 par. 1b Law 2472/1997).
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Accordingly, the application for treatment under consideration is not admissible,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with the aforementioned and the examination of its validity was omitted.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

 

The beginning
 

 

 

Rejects A's application for treatment as inadmissible.
