withdrew after the case was discussed and before the conference and reception
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, after thorough discussion
 

 

 

 

 

 

SEVEN E ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

1. The General Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Protection Regulation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Data - hereinafter GDPR), which replaced Directive 95/56 EC is in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application from May 25, 2018.
  

 

 

 

 

 

    

 in accordance with the provisions of article 15 par. 1 GDPR, the subject of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data subject has the right to receive confirmation from the data controller
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on whether or not the personal data concerning him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are being processed and, if this happens, the right of access to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal data and the detailed information
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
 

in the sub-cases of the said paragraph, while from par. 3 of the same article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is provided that the controller provides the data subject
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a copy of the personal data being processed.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For the satisfaction of the right of information and access no
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the invocation of a legal interest is required, since this exists and constitutes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis of the subject's right of access in order to obtain knowledge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information concerning it and which have been registered in a file, which is kept by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controller, so that the basic principle of law for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the protection of personal data, which consists in its transparency
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing as a condition of any further control of its legality acc
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the part of the data subject (see GDPR 16/2017). Likewise, no
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is required to invoke the reasons why the data subject
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wishes to exercise the right of access.
  

 

 

 

 

 

If the controller does not act on his request
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject of the data, informs within one month of its receipt
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request the data subject for the reasons why not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also acted on the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of legal action (article 12 par. 4 GDPR). The deadline in question
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be extended by two more months, if required, received
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering the complexity of the request and the number of requests (Article 12
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

par. 3 of the GDPR). It is pointed out that the controller even when not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeps a file with data of the subject, is not exempt from this reason
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from his obligation to answer even in the negative (tE 2627/2017).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Also, in accordance with the provisions of article 58 par. 2 item i of the GDPR,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each supervisory authority has, among other things, the authority to impose administrative
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fine under article 83, depending on the circumstances of each individual
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.
 

2. From the elements of the file and the hearing process they emerged
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The following:
  

 

  

Complainant A by electronic letter to the Responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Protection of Personal Data of PPC S.A., had submitted a request
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of her access to their physical and electronic communication for the time period
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from 2015 to date, but did not receive a relevant response. PPC through him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Personal Data Protection Officer through the provision document
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
 

clarifications (no. ...) to the Authority, replied that there is no physical and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic correspondence requested by the complainant from the year 2015 to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today. In addition, he stated that the administrator (DEDDIE SA) proceeded to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deactivation of the supply, following a request from PPC S.A., as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complainant did not comply with the terms of the settlement and did not proceed to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment of overdue debts.
 

 

 

 

             

However, PPC SA, as data controller, did not respond to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complainant within one month of receiving the request and did not inform, as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owed the complainant within one month of receiving the request, for her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inability to immediately respond and satisfy her request as well as for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reasons for the delay, requesting a further extension of the deadline, v
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of the provisions of article 12 par. 3 and 4 of the GDPR. The same offense
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.e. the delayed response of PPC S.A. as a controller
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after the lapse of one month from the receipt of the request it was established with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the earlier decision 15/2019 of the Authority.
 

 

 

 

 

 

3. In view of the specific violation that is, after the lapse
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one month from the receipt of the request, PPC SA, as responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, did not respond to the complainant regarding the weakness
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediate satisfaction of her request, and taking into account her relapse
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the previous same violation established with the aforementioned one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of the Authority 15/2019, the Authority unanimously judges that in the specific
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, based on the circumstances established, should be applicable
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the provision of article 58 par. 2 sec. GDPR to be enforced effectively,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine according to art. 83 GDPR for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the punishment of this illegal behavior.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

The Authority taking into account the above:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      

It imposes on PPC S.A. an effective, proportional and deterrent measure
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative fine appropriate to the specific case in accordance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the special circumstances thereof, amounting to five thousand (5,000.00) euros.
