Anonyme Company for the Management of Claims from Loans and Credits" (where
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attached to its application), the direct-autonomous access of the Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims Management in the files of the Defaulting System ( ΑΚ or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"black list") and Grants concentration system (X or "white list")
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of TEIREIA, with the same conditions of access as banks, is absolutely
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary especially for the cases of loan receivables management and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credits that were granted by credit or financial institutions and have
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferred to Companies for the Acquisition of Claims from Loans and Credits (vs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article 1 par. 1 b' of Law 4354/2015). in these cases the Management Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Receivables acting on behalf of a Receivables Acquisition Company, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the beneficiary of the receivables under management and is not itself subject to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision in Greece, since it can be located anywhere in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world. The access, therefore, of the Claims Management Companies to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aforementioned files of TEIRE IA are, according to the claims made,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary, not only for the assessment of solvency and credit
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity (X) of the creditors, the claims against which they manage,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but also for their compliance with the Credit Code of Conduct
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutions (Article 1 par. 22 Law 4354/2015) and the regulatory framework for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In particular, as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points out TEIRE IA, in case the Claims Management Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manage receivables from loans and credits that have been transferred, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transferred receivables are considered bank receivables, and those originally granted
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banks are completely alienated from these loans and credits
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims Management Companies, according to TIREIA, should be
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively and solely responsible for updating the AY and X file
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TIRE IA regarding the fate of managed loans and credits.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, TEIRE IA points out the need to apply to its borrowers
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle of equal treatment in the sense of non-differentiation of the borrower
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of him, the management of whose debts has been assigned to Management Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims of Law 4354/2015, against those for which the management has
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remains in the banks. Also, any exclusion of the Management Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Requirements from the access to the above systems of TEIREIA, with them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same terms and conditions that apply to Banks, may, according to

disposition but also the principle of reciprocity, based on which the systems

Also, since 2002, the Authority has issued a decision on the conditions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping a "risk pooling or whitelisting" record by TEIRE IA

file of unfavorable financial data ("black list"), the creation of art
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to a file ("white list") by TEIRE IA SA, without consent
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the subject is against the law and exceeds the purpose of the processing.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In other words, it was accepted that the file in question ("white list"), which contains the

be created and operate only on the basis of his consent

 then, the legislator, with the provision of article 40 of Law 3259/1004, regulated the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation of the "black list" file of TEIRE IA, in a way that
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially identical to the content of the Authority's Decision no. 109/31-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

03-1999 (which allowed TEIRE IA to create the file in question without
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the consent of the data subject), and modified them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific categories of data, which the Authority defined with no.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

523/19-10-1999 Decision, and the time of compliance thereof. Next, with her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of article 70 of Law 3746/2009 replaced the aforementioned
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of article 40 of Law 3259/2004. specifically, with this provision, in addition
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the conditions and the time of compliance with the specific ones were modified
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(adverse data) categories (see par. 1 and 3, as they were replaced
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again with article 4 par. 1 and 2 of Law 3816/2010, see also articles 3-5 n.

due to records, which were initially defined by the above-mentioned Decisions of the Authority,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which were issued under the regime of Law 2472/1997, and subsequently with the

therefore, there is an obligation to carry out an impact assessment on each
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of compliance with the conditions of article 35 par. 1 GDPR).
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The impact assessment contains at least: a) systematic description of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended processing operations and the purposes of the processing,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including, as the case may be, the legitimate interest pursued by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controller, b) assessment of the necessity and proportionality of

foreseen measures to deal with the risks, including
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantees, security measures and mechanisms, in order to ensure the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection of personal data and to prove the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance with the GDPR, taking into account the rights and laws
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests of data subjects and other interested parties
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(see par. 7 of article 35). in this case, the data controller
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must, when carrying out the impact assessment, also ask for their opinion
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data subjects or their representatives for the planned
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing (see par. 9 of article 35 of the GDPR).
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

5. Because the
 

 

 

integration
 

of Claims Management Companies to
 

 

 

 

 

legalized recipients of said files of TEIREIA, when they act
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on behalf of the Debt Collection Companies (CDCs), may
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons. For example, the risk of their disposal in EAA must be analysed, h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the beneficiary of the receivables under management and which is not subject to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervision in Greece, since it can be located anywhere in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world, so the risk of their transmission within or and should be analyzed
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside the EU, or the risk of their disposal in an NCA in the event of termination of the relevant one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the assignment contract concluded between EDA and EAA, in which case the files which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allocated to EDA are returned to EAA, which retains ownership
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the relevant portfolio, or are handed over to another NRA at the suggestion of the NRA.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In view of this, according to what is mentioned in the previous thought, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carrying out an impact assessment regarding the inclusion of EDAs in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legalized recipients of the above files of TEIREIA. in case

and provision by legislative provision of the expansion of the legalized
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beneficiaries, the impact assessment should be carried out in its context
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enactment of the relevant legislation (see article 35 par. 10 GDPR and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recitals 93 and 96). Moreover, during the evaluation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impact, the fact that relevant contracts exist must be taken into account
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e.g. contracts in operation between borrowers and banks, of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banks and Receivables Acquisition Companies, Management Companies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Receivables and the banks or Receivables Acquisition Companies respectively) and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to request the opinion of the Acquisition Companies involved
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claims (in relation to the role of Claims Management Companies) and of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowers affected by the planned processing.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

1. The Authority refrains from ruling on the application of TEIRE IA SA. to approve her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inclusion of Claims Management Companies, as data controllers, in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legalized recipients of the data of the above files.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. The Authority considers that TEIRE IA SA should and the autonomous applicant, as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controller, access to said files of TEIRE IA Company
