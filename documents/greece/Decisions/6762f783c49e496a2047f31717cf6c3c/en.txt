The person in charge of processing, through his memo, supports the following: According to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period in which the complainant worked in the complained-about company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

routes of the company's vehicles were predetermined based on programming
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the day's work. The system data was used for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

optimization of routes and cost control as well as response to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary requests. The company did not use geolocation data as such
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were stored after the end of working hours, while the workers did not have
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights to use the vehicles for personal travel. It is clarified that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geo-location data was never used for productivity control and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

termination of an employee contract. Regarding system operation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance, at
 

 

 as a reminder it is pointed out that the cameras were not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

placed in our workplaces, the system met the conditions of our Guide
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1/2011 of the Authority, there has been no protest from employees and the supervision of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of vehicle parking spaces does not mean surveillance of workplaces. Informative
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signs were placed at the entrance to the offices and the warehouse.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The complainant states in his memorandum that the geolocation system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was used for reprimands in relation to his productivity and that he has not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was informed when concluding his contract about the functioning of the system.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Data from the system about his movements were given to the person and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a family incident occurred. He clarifies that there was a work program
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of colleagues who travel with the company's vehicles, but there was no
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prescribed itinerary.
 

 

Regarding the functioning of the video surveillance system, the complainant states that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cameras received an image from the area surrounding the building on the ground floor where
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company is housed. Cameras were also placed on the third floor and could see
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around the perimeter of the building focusing on the company's parked vehicles. Because
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintenance and cleaning of the vehicles' equipment were carried out, o
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owner of the company let him check the image from the cameras and made observations on them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers. He also mentions that there was no information board. Find attached,

SEVEN E ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

1. According to article 2 par. a' of Law 2472/1997, the information regarding
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographical location, where a person is located at one or more times
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moments, it is personal data, as long as the person in question can be identified
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly or indirectly by our controller or by reasonable means.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In particular, the above information can lead to the identification and/or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracking the person in real time or not, while through her connection
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic location of a person with specific actions or activities, yes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible to reveal personal data about habits or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his preferences, allowing his characterization and creative profile
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behavior. The determination of the geographical position can be done through
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic geolocation systems based on multiple
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available technologies, the most common of which was the World Wide Web
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Position Locator (GPS)1. Therefore, it is processing in accordance with article 2
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item d' of Law 2472/1997. This data includes geographic data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

location, as well as other location-related data of persons and/or objects that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are directly related to individuals whose identity you can directly determine or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly from our controller or third party. The position is also adopted by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Opinion 5/2005 of the Article 29 Working Group on the use of location data with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the purpose of providing services of added value, where in par. 2.2 it is requested that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data processing that allows the employer to collect information about him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

locating the position of the employee, directly (locating the position of his
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee) and indirectly (tracking the location of the vehicle used by the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee or of a product or asset that has been charged to him) implies the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
1 The GPS network is a global positioning system based on
 
 
operating satellites, which revolve around the earth and emit a specific
 
radio signal at every point of their orbit. A GPS receiver can receive the above
 
radio signals and calculate his approximate geographical position based on them. Such receivers
 
they may be embedded in vehicles and/or digital devices.

use of personal data and is subject to the provisions of our Guide
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

95/46/EC.
  

 

3. The legality of our processing of personal data through systems
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographical localization is examined based on the provisions of articles 4 and 5 n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997 in the context of the legal purpose pursued by the controller and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the principle of proportionality. Therefore, the processing in question must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is convenient and necessary in relation to the intended purpose, the person who cannot
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be achieved with gentler and more effective means. The subject of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data must be informed by the controller in advance of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the collection and immediate processing in the context of no. 4 par. 1 sec. a' n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997 obligation for legitimate collection and processing, which is borne by the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing manager no. 4 par. 2 of Law 2472/1997 (CJEU, C-201/14, Smaranda Bara,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision of 01-10-2015).

 

 

    

When the operation of geographic localization systems concerns their field
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

labor relations, the main issue that arises, when applying its principle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proportionality, yes, the degree of legitimate monitoring and supervision, in this respect
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the employee is allowed to submit during his work (through
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracking its geographic location).
  

 

 

 

 

 

4. The Authority has issued Guideline 115/2001 regarding the processing of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of employees' personal data, in which he has defined the general guidelines
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawful processing of employees' personal data. In particular, according to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section E (protection of workers from the use of control systems and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monitoring) par. 1 of the above Guide, "the collection of personnel data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character with the use of employee control and monitoring methods must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited to the data directly linked to the employment relationship and not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it extends as far as possible to personal behavior, to personal characteristics
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   in the personal internal and external contacts of the employees. You must also

provision of telecommunication means accessible to employees for personal communications
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their communications". The above also applies to systems
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographical location. According to paragraphs 6-8 of the Guide, the data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collected through such a system may not be used as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1-3 Kifis St., 11523 Athens, Tel.: 210-6475600, Fax: 210-6475628, contact@dpa.gr, www.dpa.gr
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
-5-

 

exclusive criteria for the evaluation of their behavior and efficiency
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers.
 

 

5. According to Opinion 2/2017 of the Working Group of article 292 span as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an employee may provide valid consent to the employer for the processing a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his personal data (see p. 4) and in such processing as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal basis consent should not be applied due to its nature
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment relationship (see pages 6 and 7), as it has been supported by OE29 in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under no. 8/2011 (p. 23) earlier Opinion of 3.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With the more specific issue of the legality of operating systems
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographical localization in the field of labor relations, the Group has dealt with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Work of article 29 in Opinion 5/20054. It states that its legality
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific processing should not be based solely on consent
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of workers and that, possibly, the most appropriate way of securing the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of consent would be through collective agreements. This issue is also considered in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latest Opinion 13/20115 of the Working Group, where, since it is recognized that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent, as a legitimate reason for processing, is problematic in the workplace
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

box 6, requires that employers, instead of seeking consent, should
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigate whether they can accept that the supervisor of their exact location
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their employees is necessary and serves a legitimate purpose, as well as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examine whether this necessity violates fundamental rights and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers' freedoms. In cases where the necessity is justified against
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequately, the legal basis of this processing could be based on
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate interest of the person in charge of our processing (article 7 point f) of our Guide
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

95/46/EC (see Authority decision 165/2015).
 

 

 

 

 

From all of the above it follows that especially in the field of labor
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relations and in particular in the case of our processing of personnel data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a nature that reveal information such as the geographical location of employees
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerning fundamental rights and freedoms, consent constitutes a lawful

route and the employee not to use the vehicle outside of working hours.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Furthermore, the data retention time should not be longer than this
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is required for the realization of the processing purpose and in any case to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do not exceed one m. The controller must receive the necessary
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

security measures to protect data and ensure that access to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintained data will be done by persons authorized for this purpose. Additionally,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate pseudonymization/encoding techniques must be applied
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encryption. The employer must inform the employees about the purpose
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, the type of recorded data, the time of their use and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure for exercising the right of access by the employee. The update
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it must be individual and reasonably authenticated. Finally, the employee has
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of access to the collected data. Accordingly, the Authority granted permission
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

GPS mode on
 

 

 

company vehicles
 

 

of OPAP
 

 

(decision 162/2014) and
 

 

 

waste trucks of the Municipality of Piraeus (decision 163/2014), provided that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicles follow a predetermined route and the installation of the system takes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country for the optimization of the route followed and not the monitoring of them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

workers. On the contrary, the Authority imposed a strict warning on a pharmaceutical company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the GPS function in vehicles of medical visitors on the grounds that the route
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is followed by the medical visitors is not predetermined and does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is reason to be, since what is requested is the execution of the program
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visits during the day. For the nature of the services provided by medical practitioners
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visitors, the employer's knowledge of his permanent position is not critical
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vehicle they drive. Also, the use of the GPS system is seen in many
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases not to be a convenient means, since from the position in which it has been stationed
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the medical visitor's vehicle, the requested information about it does not appear
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not carrying out the specific visit. It should, therefore, be responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing to resort to other means, more effective, but less so
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdens that do not violate the privacy of the employee (e.g. control of deliverables,
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of orders, calculation of average execution time of specific routes and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visits). The Authority also ruled that the candidate from the pharmaceutical company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of serving an urgent order of an urgent appointment is in principle n
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate, but the GPS system is being considered for its necessity in general,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given that these extraordinary cases are isolated, and the number of vehicles

employer of the vehicle cannot be a legal reason for mandatory installation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geolocation system, as this is part of its total services
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer to the employee, which are part of his earnings. This one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also applies in the case of the provision of consent by the employee, which when
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is an employee-employer relationship cannot be taken as valid consent
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(decision 165/2014)".
  

 

 

7. According to article 5 of the Authority's Guide 1/2011, the legality of our processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered in the context of the purpose pursued by the person in charge of processing and in accordance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the principle of proportionality, which requires video surveillance systems to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is convenient and necessary in relation to the intended purpose, which should
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot be achieved by milder means (Article 4 of Law 2472/1997). Affordability
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the necessity of video surveillance is assessed based on the risk posed by the person responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing he wants to deal with, in relation to the intended purpose.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Further, the points of installation of the cameras and the way of taking them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data must be identified in such a way that the data collected
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to be more than what is absolutely necessary for its fulfillment
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of our processing and that the fundamental rights of persons who
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are located in the area that is being monitored and it is not possible to violate this
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be regarded as a "legitimate expectation of some degree of privacy protection" in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific space.
 

 

 

8. In addition, according to article 7 of no. 1/2011 Guide of the Authority, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

video surveillance system should not be used to monitor them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees within our workplaces, except in special exceptional cases.

period of time in which the complaint refers and the complainant was present
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee of our controller:
 

 

 

 

a) The functionality of the geolocation system has not been strictly limited
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within our working hours, thus violating the principle of legality and

data, unnecessary and related to the purpose of processing.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b) The controller did not appear before the Authority and therefore not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proved on the basis of the obligation of accountability from article 4 par. 2 of law 2472/1997 that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bears, the previous notification of the complainant that he is going to collect and

ed. a' n. 2472/1997.

 

 

 

   

c) The controller has declared that through the video surveillance system
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervise the parking areas of the company's vehicles, as well as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also park on a public road, thus not being able to exclude the taking of an image from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pavement and the public road, thus taking an image of passing natural
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of persons and cars that may lead to physical identification
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons. Thus, violate the principle of legality and force us to process them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant and necessary data (principle of relevance, minimization –
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose limitation) in relation to the intended purpose no. 4 par. 1 sec. a and b
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law 2472/1997 since the processing of personal data of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of natural persons was contrary to the purpose of the video surveillance system,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not necessary for the achievement of the purposes of the controller and
