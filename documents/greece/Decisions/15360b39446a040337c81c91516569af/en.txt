As can be seen from the above document of the Directorate of Aliens to the Authority, the applicant A was arrested on ... to be deprived of legal documents to stay in the country in violation of art. 76 of Law 3386/2005 in conjunction with Art. 21 of Law 3907/2011 "about foreigners".

In Greece, the maintenance of the National List of Undesirable Foreigners is provided for in article 82 of Law 3386/2005, which states that "The Ministry of Public Order maintains a list of undesirable foreigners. The criteria and the procedure for registering and deleting foreigners from this list are determined by a decision of the Ministers of the Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Justice and Public Order". On the basis of the above authorizing provision, Decree No. 4000/4/32-la΄/17.10.2012 KYA was issued, as replaced and valid with Decree 4000/4/32-n'/31.03.2017, articles 1 and 3 of which respectively provide for the conditions for the registration of foreigners in the E.K.A.N.A. and the ex officio review of each registration every three years. Specifically according to article 1 thereof: "1. In the National List of Undesirable Aliens (E.K.A.N.A.) are registered: a. Aliens against whom a judicial or administrative decision of expulsion from the country or a return decision was issued, as long as they have not complied with the obligation to return. b. Foreigners, whose presence on Greek soil constitutes a threat to national security, public safety or public order...", while according to article 3: "1. The duration of validity of the registration in E.K.ANA.A. is determined by the body deciding on the registration, based on the reasons for which it is imposed and does not exceed five (5) years. The above registration period in E.K.ANA.A. it is possible, to exceed five years in the event that the foreigner poses a serious threat to national security, public safety or public order, as well as in the event that a criminal court decision imposes deportation and a ban on re-entry of the foreigner to the Country, for as long as is specified in it (par. 3 of article 74 of the Civil Code, as applicable). Every case of registration in E.K.ANA.A. is reviewed ex officio every three years...". In addition, according to article 6 of the above KYA, for the observance of the E.K.ANA.A. and the processing of the corresponding 1-3 Kifisias St., 11523 Athens, Tel: 210 6475600, Fax: 210 6475628, contact@dpa.gr / www.dpa.gr 4 the relevant provisions of Law 2472/1997 apply , and in particular of art. 4 and 13 thereof whereas, article 83 of Law 4624/2019 states that "where in provisions of the current legislation reference is made to Law 2472/1997 it is understood as a reference to the relevant provisions of the GDPR and this one". 2. Since, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1 item. a' of Law 3386/2005 it follows that "serious criminal acts" mean not only those that carry a penalty of deprivation of liberty of at least one year but also those expressly listed in the provision of article 76 par. 1 item. a' of the above law (see Official Gazette No. 3/2012). 3. Since, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1 item. c' of Law 3386/2005 it follows that the registration of a foreigner in EKANA is allowed, as long as his presence on Greek territory is dangerous for the
public order or national security.

      

  4. Because, for the legality of registration both in case of conviction and

and in the event of the existence of nuanced indications of the commission of a "serious crime

deed", from the above mentioned, the body responsible for the registration will

must take into account and take into account all the circumstances in its decision

execution of the criminal act and to deliver a specially reasoned judgment on it

"threat" constituted by the presence of a foreigner on national territory (see

previous thought).

5. In the case under consideration, from the information in the file and the

clarifications from the Directorate of Aliens of Attica, it emerged that the applicant A

registered with E.K.ANA.A. by virtue of the administrative decision to return him

competent officer of the Directorate of Aliens of Attica with number ... for reasons

of public order and security on ... until .... His entry was made, because

was caught lacking legal residence documents in the country. Therefore,

registered for violation of the provisions of Law 3386/2005 on entry,

residence and social integration of third country nationals in the Greek Territory as well

and for the reason that the decision with number ... from ... was pending against him

of return, which was not executed and because it was already registered with E.K.ANA.A.

Consequently, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, its registration

applicant to E.K.A.N.A. is legal, as it was registered to the above

lists for reasons of public order and security, in view of being arrested to

he lacks legal documents to stay in the country while he has been sentenced to

a prison sentence of eight months and a previous decision is pending against him

return. It is noted that three years have not passed since the last one under review

registration so that a review of the registration is required. In sequence, the

his appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.

 

For those reasons

 

The Authority rejects A's appeal for the deletion of his data from

E.K.A.N.A.
