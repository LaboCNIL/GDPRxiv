The Personal Data Protection Authority met upon invitation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its President in a regular meeting at its headquarters on 16-01-2018, in order to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide on the process of issuing a license for the processing of sensitive data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health for the purposes of scientific research. Konstantinos Menoudakos appeared,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President of the Authority and regular members Konstantinos Christodoulou, Pyridon
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vlachopoulos, Antonios ymbonis, Konstantinos Lambrinoudakis, Charalambos
 

 

 

 

 

 

Anthopoulos and Eleni Martsoukou as well as the alternate member Grigorios
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tsolias who had been assigned the duties of rapporteur. the meeting, without right
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vote, the Head of the Department also attended, by order of the President
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Auditor Philippos Mitletton, and auditor Hariklia Latsiu, specialist scientists â€“
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers, as assistant rapporteurs, and Irini Papageorgopoulou, his employee
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Administrative-Financial Department, as secretary.
  

 

 

 

 

The Authority took into account the following:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. In recent years, the number of applications, especially large ones, has increased significantly
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public nurses
 

 

individual researchers
 

 

institutions of the country, which forward requests
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(undergraduate or postgraduate students, candidates
 

 

 

 

 

PhDs or health professionals in general), who in the context of preparation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



2
 

research papers wish to gain access to their records. Indicative
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is stated that according to the statistics of the Authority's report
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2016, a total of 196 new cases were submitted, which concerned the sector
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of health and of which a large number had as their object the granting of a license for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducting research on data controllers who provide health services, and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of licenses granted by the Authority for health sector affairs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounts to 69% of the total issued licenses of the same year (see charts 7
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 15, p. 35 and 41 of the 2016 Annual Report).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. During the examination of the relevant applications, the Authority requests from the applicant nursing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution (clinic, diagnostic center and health service provider in general),
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after prior consultation with the interested (individual) researcher, to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clarify essential elements of scientific research and, in particular: 1) what is the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject of the research (title), 2) how the specific research will be carried out (e.g.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on-site study of Hospital records and which or distribution of questionnaires to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patients), 3) certificate of the relevant institution for the status of the applicant researcher
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(undergraduate or postgraduate student, PhD candidate). the last two
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases requests to find out who is the appointed three-member committee and mainly the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designated professor, as supervisor of the specific research, 4) the complete data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address of the researcher (home address and telephone), 5) if the Scientific
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 board or the Ethics Committee of the Hospital has approved the specific one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request of the researcher, sending a copy of the relevant decision.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. The Authority with its series of decisions (see in particular decisions 46/2004, 47/2004, 32/2006,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54/2008, 63/2009, 10/2011 and 121/2011) has prescribed the legality conditions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing of personal data, both simple and sensitive, for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

research purposes and in particular for the preparation of a postgraduate study or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctoral thesis. this context, as the Authority consistently judges, the implementation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scientific research constitutes a legal purpose of processing, in the sense of article 4
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Law 2472/1997, among others due to the fact that according to Article 16 par. 1 of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 by statute, the development and promotion of research is an obligation of the State.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. In particular, the Authority has the authority to take over relevant cases,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in principle, pursuant to article 7 par. 2 item f of Law 2472/1997, which provides
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that exceptionally it is legitimate to process sensitive data after its permission
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Authority, when the processing is carried out for research and scientific purposes

purposes only and on the condition that anonymity is maintained and that everything is received
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the necessary measures to protect the rights of the persons in which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are mentioned. specifically, the Authority considers that the processing of personal data for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purpose of conducting scientific research must be carried out, in particular, under
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following conditions: a) the researchers' access to the premises
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

keeping the record, so that no personal data escapes the sphere
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

influence of the controller-owner of the file, b) the researcher puts under
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing from the archive only those elements that are according to his scientific judgment
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary for the completion of his specific research project and c) against
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completion of research and prior to publication or in any other way
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use of its results, the researcher shall anonymize them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal data it has collected and to destroy any existing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

named file it has collected. often, it is found in practice that the research
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is conducted with the consent of the interested subjects-patients
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing institutions. in the latter case, its provision applies
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article 7 par. 2 item a' of Law 2472/1997.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. Furthermore, the Authority, by decision 31/2013, ruled that in the case of "third parties"-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

researchers who wish to gain access to the controller's records
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, the issuance of two licenses is required: one to the controller-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file owner to extract sensitive data from his file and a
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second to the researcher for the sensitive data he will collect. the last
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case he himself becomes responsible for the processing of this data for him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of conducting scientific research1.
  

 

 

 

 

5. The General Regulation 2016/679 in the provision of article 89 paragraph 1 prescribes the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules for processing personal data for the purposes of scientific research with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring guarantees for the non-disclosure of the subject's identity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data (e.g. through pseudonymisation), while paragraph 2 of the same article provides
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the possibility for member states to establish restrictions on its rights
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access, correction, deletion, opposition and limitation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing for data processing carried out for research purposes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes2. Finally, in recital 156 of the General Regulation it is provided that the

processing of personal data carried out for research purposes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must comply with other relevant legislation, such as that for clinics
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tests. in this regard, Regulation 536/2014 of the European Parliament and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 council for clinical trials of medicinal products intended for humans poses
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as basic principles for the conduct of clinical studies: a) protection and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensuring the rights, dignity and well-being of the participants and b)
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the production of valid and reliable data (article 3). To ensure the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these principles provide, among other things, that clinical studies are approved in terms of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their scientific and ethical adequacy by an ethics committee (article 4),
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as well as that the clinical study is carried out, in principle, with the consent of the interested party

the status of doctors or other health professionals (and whom the Authority, such as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned above, after the decision 31/2013 makes it responsible for processing in respect of

codes of conduct regarding privacy and confidentiality. For example,
 
                                                                                                                                                     
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest or for scientific or historical purposes
 
research or statistical purposes is subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance herewith
 
regulation, regarding the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in accordance with
 
this regulation. These guarantees ensure that the technical and organizational measures are in place
 
measures, in particular to ensure compliance with the data minimization principle. Those in question
 
measures may include the use of pseudonyms, as long as such purposes may
 
be fulfilled in this way. As long as said purposes can be fulfilled by further
 
processing which does not allow or no longer allows the identification of data subjects,
 
said purposes are thus fulfilled. 2. When personal data
 
are processed for the purposes of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, the
 
Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights listed
 
in articles 15, 16, 18 and 21, without prejudice to the conditions and guarantees referred to in
 
paragraph 1 of this article, since the rights in question are likely to make it impossible or
 
to seriously hinder the achievement of the specific purposes and since the said deviations are
 
necessary for the fulfillment of said purposes. 3. When personal data exists
 
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, Union or Member State law
 
may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21,
 
subject to the conditions and guarantees mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof
 
article, since the said rights are likely to make impossible or to seriously hinder
 
the achievement of the specific purposes and as long as said deviations are necessary for the fulfillment
 
of said purposes. 4. When the processing referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 serves the same
 
moment and other purpose, the derogations only apply to the processing for the purposes that
 
provided for in said paragraphs".

5
 

Article 13 of Law 3418/2005 (Code of Medical Ethics) establishes the medical
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confidentiality, while respectively in the provisions of articles 11 of Legislative Decree 216/2001 and 25 of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Law 3252/2004 establishes nursing confidentiality. In addition, especially for doctors the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article 14 par. 5 of Law 3418/2005 provides regarding the investigation that the doctor receives
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all the necessary measures, so that in the case of scientific publications not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the identity of the patient is disclosed in any way, and only if because of it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature of the publication, the disclosure of the patient's identity is necessary or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements that indicate or can lead to the verification of identity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, the specific written consent of the patient is required.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEVEN E ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

In view of the above, and taking into account, in particular: a) the fact that in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all cases of examining requests from individual researchers for their access
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the records of the nursing institution (medical records) or conducting interviews
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with patients of nursing institutions, the Authority granted the requested license to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing institution, making at the same time - by virtue of the Authority's decision 31/2003 -
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the researcher responsible for processing the file he collects and that in the cases
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during which reservations arose as to the risk of weakening it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right of the subject-patient in view of conducting a specific study, the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Authority considered that this risk is prevented in particular due to the approval of the research
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protocol from the relevant (university) institutions and from their relevant approval
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Scientific councils of the relevant nursing institution, b) of the large number
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the relevant applications submitted to the Authority, c) the possibility of the Authority to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply simplified processing rules to processing for which it judges
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they do not pose particular risks to privacy and d) perspective
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abolition of the obligation to notify and permit sensitive processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data and their replacement with effective procedures and mechanisms
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the protection of privacy in accordance with the General Regulation 2016/2794, it is judged
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
4 See Recital 89 of the General Regulation: "Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation
 
 
notification of the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities. Although the
 
this obligation implies an administrative and financial burden, it did not contribute in all cases to
 
improving the protection of personal data. Therefore, general obligations
 
of such disclosure, without variation, should be repealed and replaced
 
with effective processes and mechanisms focused on those types of transactions

it is advisable to abolish the issuance of an ad hoc license for the purpose of conducting research
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

study. For this purpose, the original license of nurses must be amended
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institutions for the operation of the file they keep for the purpose of providing the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health services, so as to include a term for the purpose of conducting research
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of studies by the controller himself (nursing institution, medical,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nursing and other staff of the controller) and by individuals
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

researchers. it is reduced that the researchers are either included in the sphere of the person in charge
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, whether they are "third parties" in terms of the controller, are bound by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the codes of ethics applicable in each case regarding its observance
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privacy and security of the processing and are therefore subject to criminal charges (art
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

371), disciplinary (codes of ethics) and civil liability (Article 57 Civil Code). With the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation of the appropriate term in the operating license of the nursing institution,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Authority will be exempted from the relevant requests to issue an ad hoc license for its purpose
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducting research studies.
  

 

 

 

This is tolerable under the current personal data protection regime as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ratio of the establishment of the obligation to disclose the processing and the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior permission of the Authority for the processing of sensitive data is recommended
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in increasing the guarantees regarding the processing of sensitive data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the subject. the case of carrying out scientific studies by individuals
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

researchers, the above conditions are guaranteed by the special condition incorporated in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general permission to process sensitive data granted to the nursing facility
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution. Therefore, there is no need to issue a special permit to the individual researcher,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite the fact that he holds the position of data controller, he must, however,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be incorporated into nurses' licenses
