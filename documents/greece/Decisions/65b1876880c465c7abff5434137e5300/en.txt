revocations of his autograph wills, by the accused B, C, D, E, T,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Z, H and the Law Firm with the name "D-Law Firm", with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concealment of the revocation, parallax and falsification of the nature of the documents
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
 

which were subsequently characterized by the complainants as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"letters" and which contain his sensitive personal data.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As he specifically complains, a text was drawn up by editing the wills
 
entitled "opinion" by the 2nd of the accused C, who after

He also complains that a) by editing one of the two wills (of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

...) the document titled "Graphological Psychological Assessment on him" has been drawn up
 
from … of the text of the letter” of the 6th of the accused Z and b) from … and
 
then on the initiative of the 1st and 3rd of the accused and with the knowledge of the 4th

country in the context of exercising the right to judicial protection on the one hand for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest of B's two minor children on the other hand to avoid prosecution
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the complainant has unleashed against all the accused in dozens
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extrajudicial and criminal and civil records.
  

 

 

 

 

 

The 7th of the complainants with no. prot. G/EI /1531/26.02.2019 answer

Athens B in the dispute she has with her ex-husband and complainant A
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the custody and maintenance of their minor children, b) the case of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled jointly with lawyers C and D but has already delivered her
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case and has stopped any involvement with it, due to the pressures that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought against her by the complainant c) she never had the letters in her hands-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wills relied on by the complainant and never filed on her behalf
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B documents without her knowledge, and she presented all the documents

of the managers and partners of D recorded on the company's letterhead
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the texts, with which he refuted the allegations against him by the complainant,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does not mean that the company bears any responsibility for those that it does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law and substance is invoked by the complainant on behalf of the complained-of D.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the 2nd of the complainants with no. prot. G/EI /3512/16.05.2019
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his reply stated that the complaint should be dismissed as without merit for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following reasons: a) the complaint is vague, b) it cannot be substantiated
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any complaint before the Authority according to article 21 of Law 2472/1997, c) h
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case is anyway outside its scope
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of personal data law, in the absence of a file, d) data processing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the parent was imposed in favor of their superior legal interest
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor children, e) the expert acts as an assistant to the court in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specialization of vague concepts, therefore it does not act as a public authority with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory authority, f) the processing is also permissible for sensitive data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal data when it is done in the context of their jurisdictional function
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts, in the context of which the disputed opinion was prepared,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with the provisions of article 9 par. 1 sec. f of the GDPR, g) disputes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the father's data are simple and do not fall under his restrictive list
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of article 9 par. 1 of the GDPR, h) in any case an obligation for a previous one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorization of the Authority does not exist in this case according to its provisions
 
article 7A par. 1 sec. e' of Law 2472/97, j) even if someone wrongly judged that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, according to Article 7 of Law 2472/97, prior permission from the Authority was required for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputed use and that therefore this use fell under par. 2 of the article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 of Law 2472/97, as the petitioner claims, then again the provisions of the GDPR
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would prevail from a criminal point of view as later and milder rules
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous Law 2472/197 and finally, k) the complaint filed by the complainant against C,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B and Z were placed on file by prosecutor's order.

No. prot. G/EI /7679/7.11.19 in their memo to the Authority stated that a) the

indication of a third controller, the principal of B.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the Law Firm "D - Firm of Lawyers", through the representative
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the hearing on 23.10.2019 and with the no. prot. G/EI /7678/7.11.19
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its memorandum to the Authority stated that the company has no involvement in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, since D did not perform any action or omission in his capacity
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrator or the member of the company.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

The Authority, after examining the elements of the file, the hearing
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure and after hearing the rapporteurs and the assistant rapporteur, who
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withdrew after the case was discussed and before the conference and reception
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision, after thorough discussion
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SEVEN E ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

1. When personal data have been submitted to a judicial authority and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are in the case file, the Authority has no jurisdiction because the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file of the pending trial file is not a file, which is subject
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Authority's powers and control, as the Authority has already judged in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its previous decisions (see internal law decision 147/01). Regarding the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legality of the collection of personal data and its use when pending
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial or a preliminary investigation or interrogation is carried out, the judge or prosecutor
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official is competent to judge, in the context of the evaluation of the evidence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
 

media or the investigative material, if the collection of the data is in accordance with them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions of the law, given that the right to personal protection
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the individual's data is now also constitutionally guaranteed in Article 9 A thereof
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 decree.
  

 

2. From the elements of the file and the hearing process it emerged
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the reported processing acts constitute a legal basis and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are included in the action for compensation filed on 9.5.2019 by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complainants against the complainants.
  

 

 

 

Consequently, according to the aforementioned, the Authority is competent to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken over the case, since the issues of the legality of the processing of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the complainant's personal data will be judged and resolved properly and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definitely definitively by the competent court, which has taken charge of the dispute
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.
  

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority, taking into account the above, rejects due to incompetence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the complaint of A.
