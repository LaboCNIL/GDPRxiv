of the 08-02-2017 and 07-12-2016 meetings, in order to examine the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case referred to in the history of the present. Konstantinos appeared

Christodoulou, as rapporteur, Antonios Hymbonis, Pyros Vlachopoulos,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Konstantinos Lambrinoudakis, Charalambos Anthopoulos and Eleni Martsoukou.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 the meeting, they also attended by order of the President, without
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to vote, Maria Alikakou, expert scientist – legal auditor, as
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistant rapporteur, who left after the debate and before the conference
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and making a decision, and Irini Papageorgopoulou, an employee of the department
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of administrative and financial affairs, as secretary.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Authority took into account the following:
 

 

 

 

 

 

With the no. prot. G/EI /4257/30.5.2017 his appeal, like this one
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed
 

with
 

the
 

under
 

no.
 

prot. G/EI /8244/16.11.2017
 

 

and
 

C/EI /9099/18.12.2017 documents, A complains to the Pre-Deposit Fund and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
 

of Loans (hereinafter TSI) for non-observance of due prior notification
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding further processing of his personal data.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In particular, the appellant complains that in 2006 the TSI decided, without
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously to inform the applicant, to securitize a loan he had
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received by the appellant from TSI in 1998. The appellant further claims that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the securitization in question was carried out by the TSI without any particular reason, as it was about
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"healthy" loan.
 

 

The applicant was informed about the above securitization in 2016 by a random event
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and specifically, when it requested from the TSI the reduction of its interest rates as above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan agreement based on favorable arrangements. The applicant was informed by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the TSI that it was not entitled to more favorable treatment due to its securitization
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the loan agreement. When the appellant asked for clarifications from the TSI
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding the securitization in question and in particular for the reasons thereof, the answer
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he received according to his claims from the TSI was that it was “sold as certain
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan".
 

 the context of the examination of the above case, the Authority requested clarifications from the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TSI, which were submitted in writing (see prot. no. C/EX/4257-1/05-10-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2017 letter from the Authority to the TSI and no. prot. G/EI /7870/01.112017
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the latter's answer). its above reply document, the TSI stated,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among other things, that in 2006 he decided on the transfer and securitization of the income
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the period 30.4.2016 - 28.8.2039 for 27,414 housing loans that
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they were granted from 1.7.1988-30.6.2004. The said securitization was done on the basis of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of art. 9 Law 3453/2006 and was specified by the agreement of 29.8.2006
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assignment by the TSI to the special purpose company "Grifonas Finance No. 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plc".
 

The TSI, regarding the non-obtaining of consent, claimed that a) it does not arise
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of illegal processing of personal data due to non-receipt
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent, because personal information was not provided to the aforementioned company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrower data. The physical file of the loans and other data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of service are still observed in the TSI, which remains
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan manager and prepares reports with statistics to the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special purpose company, and the only element of specification is the number
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account, b) the special purpose company is not a third party, c) even if
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered to be a transmission of personal data, the exceptions apply
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
 

of the provisions of article 5 par. 2 e' and d' of Law 2472/1997 and d) in each
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, they are not affected by the satisfaction of TSI's legitimate interest
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental terms of the applicant's loan agreement with TSI.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With reference to the non-prior update, the TSI stated that borrowers
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the securitized loans were not updated individually, because no
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the terms of the corresponding loan contracts were changed (e.g. interest rate,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

duration and method of serving coke). In addition, the TSI claimed that the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the borrowers were informed through the registration of the relevant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of securitization in the public books kept at the Pawnbroker pursuant to it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article 11 of Law 2844/2000. he added that in the relevant contract of sale and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Transfer of Business Claims there is a note that "THIS

to consistent borrowers with securitized loans based on article 11 of Law.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4490/20171.
  

 

Subsequently, the TSI and the appellant were legally summoned to a hearing on

according to the above representatives answered questions of the members of the Authority and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented their views. The appellant developed his views thoroughly and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a relevant memorandum filed within the deadline granted to him (see

fulfillment of the obligation of prior information on the part of the TSI
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprived of the possibility to exercise his legal rights. In particular, Mr
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant clarified that if he knew in advance about its securitization
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loan agreement, would repay the loan in question on time, especially given that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time of the securitization he could redeem the balance of the loan
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to his financial situation at that given time.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The appellant claims that today, due to his difficult finances
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

status as a pensioner, and legally unable to make use of them
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favorable provisions to reduce interest rates due to the aforementioned securitization,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he risks losing his only asset.

although it is formulated as a transitional provision, it expresses the will of the legislator
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to establish a permanent regulation for the cases in which it is "big

she (articles 3 and 4)2.
  

 

 

 

 

3. With reference to the issue of the mandatory or non-obtaining of his consent
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data subject, i.e. the borrower, for its securitization
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his loan, the Authority has already judged3 that the consent of the subject does not
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a condition for the processing to be permitted, since, according to the article
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 par. 21 and 22 of Law 3156/2003 on the securitization of receivables, it is not required
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permission of the Authority, nor consent of the debtor for the processing of personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data debtors to the extent necessary for the purposes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securitization of receivables, and the special purpose company, to which the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim, like the other parts of the process, has the right to draw
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data on the receivables and the corresponding debtors from the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Issuing bank (Financial Institution, such as TPS).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Furthermore, the transferring bank or other financial institution
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmits the relevant data to the special purpose company not only having
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to this, but also an obligation (pursuant to article 456 of the Civil Code which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also applies in this particular case).
 

 

 

 

 

Therefore, the transmission of the debtors' details by the assignor
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial institution is necessary to fulfill its obligation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is imposed by law, in accordance with article 5 par. 2 para. b of Law 2472/1997.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But also the status of the acquiring company as a special purpose company - which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
2, it is noted that Regulation (EU) 2016/679 now explicitly promotes the principle of transparency
 
 
 
 
of the processing and subsequently strengthens the subject's right to information (see articles
 
 
5, 13 and 14 of the Regulation and corresponding recitals in its preamble).

since the processing is carried out within the framework of Law 3156/2003 by a limited circle
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipients. It goes without saying that the transmission must be limited to the absolute
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary elements for the purpose of securitization.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. With reference to the issue of mandatory or non-prior notification of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

borrowers, as data subjects, in case of loan securitization,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Authority has accepted the following in relation4:
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

The contract for the transfer of securitized business receivables
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is registered in the public book of article 3 of Law 2844/2000 in a summary that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contains its essential elements (article 10 par. 8 of Law 3156/2003). From
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration of the relevant agreement, the transfer of the securitized assets occurs
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims, unless otherwise specified in the terms of the contract, and the transfer
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(assignment) is announced in writing by the transferor or the specialist company
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose to the debtor (article 10 par. 9 of Law 3156/2003). Further, as an announcement
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is considered the registration of the contract in the public book of article 3 of n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2844/2000, in accordance with the aforementioned provision of article 10 par. 8 of the law.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3156/2003. therefore, the above registration of the contract in the public book constitutes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to article 10 par. 10 of Law 3156/2003 announcement of the assignment agreement
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the debtor of no required written notice of the assignment by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I transferred a company or the special purpose company to the debtor (so does the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision 2391/2011 BR ATH).
  

 

 

 

Therefore, given that the more specific provisions on securitization
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements state that the registration is sufficient and valid as an announcement (information).
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the relevant contract in the public book (see Annual Report 2014, 3.6.2.

Securitization of bank claims), it must be accepted that it is not required in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case in accordance with the special provisions and other previous ones
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual update. is recommended, however, at the time of collection
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the controller who proceeds to securitize the claim
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of, i.e. the bank or other financial institution, to include in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content of the update, in which it proceeds, according to article 11 par. 1 of the law.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997, as a category of recipients, the special purpose companies for the case
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securitization of receivables and, in any case, the task of securitization
 

     

     

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the claim the above controller or the special purpose company must
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to inform the debtor individually (e.g. by sending the relevant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his account). And this because, from the systematic interpretation of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the aforementioned provisions, it follows that the more specific provisions for the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securitization of receivables remove the obligation to update article 11 par. 3 n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997 only as necessary to implement their content and not the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the obligation to inform5. This is also in accordance with the obligation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, as provided for in Directive 95/46/EC (see article 11), the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which Directive was incorporated into Greek law by Law 2472/1997, but also now with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (see articles 12,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 and 14).
 

 

 

5. the case at hand, the personal data of the applicant which
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

linked to the loan agreement received from TSI in 1998 were granted
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the TSI to the special purpose company "Grifonas Finance No. 1 Plc" with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishment in London in the context of securitization / transfer of receivables
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to article 10 par. 21 of Law 3156/2003. And yes, although it was not necessary by law
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent for the securitization, in accordance with what is mentioned above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraph 3, however, for the said securitization there was an obligation of the TSI to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inform the applicant beforehand about the transmission of his personal data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of data to the receiving special purpose company as set out in paragraph 4.
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a result, the applicant, as a data subject, due to the non
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informing him, he did not have a reasonable period of time before
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposal of his data to the aforementioned special purpose company in order to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effectively exercise the rights of access and objection in accordance with

action to protect his property.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In view of the above, the Authority, taking into account the seriousness of his violation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of article 11 of Law 2472/1997 which was proven and of the insult caused by
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she in the subject judges that it should be imposed on the Pre-Deposit Fund and

of Law 2472/1997 sanction referred to in the ordinance.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THIS REASON
 

 

 

 

The beginning:
 

 

 

 

 

1. deems that the Deposit and Loan Fund, as responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, he should have previously informed the applicant A about
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the securitization of his loan agreement for the reasons that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to the rationale of the present
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. imposes on the Deposits and Loans Fund, as responsible
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processing, for non-compliance with the aforementioned previous obligation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

informing the applicant A and for the reasons mentioned in
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning of the present, the sanction of the warning, pointing out that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

henceforth it should inform the borrowers accordingly and before
