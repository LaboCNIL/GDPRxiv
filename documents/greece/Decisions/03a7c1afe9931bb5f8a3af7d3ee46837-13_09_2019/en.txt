The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file, after listening to him
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rapporteur and the clarifications of the assistant rapporteur, who left after the debate
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and before conference and decision making, and after thorough discussion,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW
 

 

 

 

 

 

1. The issue of telephone calls, for the purposes of direct product promotion or
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services and for both advertising purposes, is regulated in article 11 of the law.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3471/2006, in which the relevant unsolicited communications are defined (see par. 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 2). It is noted that, with the provisions of article 16 par. 1 and 2 of Law 3917/2011
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 11 of Law 3471/2006 were amended, so that with article 11
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

par. 1 of Law 3471/2006 now stipulates that: "The use of automatic systems
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call, i.e. using facsimile (fax) or e-mail devices,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and more generally the making of unsolicited communications by any means
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic communication, without human intervention, for direct purposes
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of commercial promotion of products or services and for each and every advertiser
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes, is permitted only if the subscriber expressly consents in advance",
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while paragraph 2 of the same article stipulates that: "It is not allowed to
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making unsolicited communications with human intervention (calls) for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the above purposes, as long as the subscriber has declared to the provider
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our publicly available service, that he generally did not wish to receive such calls.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The organization is obliged to register these declarations free of charge in a special list
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subscribers, which is at the disposal of every interested party".
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The law provides for the creation of registers of objections ("opt-out") in each provider and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the subscriber can declare free of charge, to his own service provider
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic communications, that he did not wish to receive telephone calls for
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly let commercial promotion. Therefore, each provider bears, with the aforementioned
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, the obligation to keep, with these declarations, a Public Register that he made
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
3

a public purpose and accessible to anyone who is interested in it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use for direct commercial promotion.
  

 

 

 

 

 

2. Further, the telephone number of a natural person was personal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given, since it can function as an indirect identification element of the owner
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of (cf. article 4 par. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 hereinafter GDPR), allowing the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact him. It is also pointed out that, in accordance with Opinion 4/2007 of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working group of article 29 of the E.U. about the concept of personal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of data, especially during the operation of electronic services, an indirect element
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identification, can sufficiently in some cases distinguish a person from
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others in the context of a specific set, even if it has not happened
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expungement of his name.
  

 

 

 

 

3. The principle of accuracy is fundamental in the processing of personnel data
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character (see no. 5 par. 1 c GDPR). Furthermore, based on article 32 of the GDPR, o
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data controller shall apply appropriate technical and organizational measures
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to ensure an appropriate level of security against risks,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking into account the latest developments, implementation costs and the nature, field
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application, the context and purposes of our processing, as well as the risks
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different probability of occurrence and severity for the rights and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberties of natural persons.
 

 

 

 

 

4. Taking into account that from the examination of the complaint in question a wider issue emerged
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of not properly maintaining the register of article 11 of Law 3471/2006 as a consequence
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

technical error during the process of removing a subscriber portability request
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

OTE, according to what is mentioned in the company's memorandum, the Authority considers that
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you must examine the said complaint in the context of the wider incident and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to invite the company to a hearing again.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FOR THOSE REASONS
 

 

 

 

 

The Personal Data Protection Authority:
 

 

 

 

 

 

Accepts the validity of the complaint as stated in the history of the present
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and refers the case for a comprehensive examination with a new summons, where it will
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examine the wider incident of improper record keeping
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of article 11 of Law 3471/2006 by OTE.
