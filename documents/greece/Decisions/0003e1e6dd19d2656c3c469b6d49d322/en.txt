Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and therefore the entry in question

Prohibition of re-entry of the foreigner into the Country, for as long as the time specified in it (par.

above KYA, for the observance of E.K.ANA.A. and the processing of the corresponding ones

and especially of art. 4 and 13 thereof. Also, according to the provisions of art. 82 of the law

registration of a third-country national in the E.K.ANA.
 

 

 

 

 

 

          

2. Because, from the combined interpretation of the above and article 76 par. 1
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item c' of Law 3386/2005 shows that the registration of a foreigner in EKANA

public order or national security.
  

 

 

 

 

 

3. Because the registration of persons in the National List of Undesirable Aliens

that the applicant A was registered by the Directorate of State Security in the National
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

List of Undesirable Aliens in ...2010 for reasons of national security,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

according to the no. ... decision of the Director of this Directorate. On ...2013 and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before three years had passed since the initial registration, it was decided to maintain it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said registration until ...2015 with the no. ...decision of its CEO

of its registration. then on ...2016 as part of the review of the above
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative measure, it was decided to reimpose her administrative measure
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his "Entry Ban" to the country until ...2019 with the no. ... decision
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Director of the State Security Directorate.
 

 

 

 

 

 

Consequently, in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, its registration
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant to E.K.A.N.A. it is legal, as long as it was registered for reasons
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of national security, given that he was deemed dangerous to its national security
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of our country, before the expiration of three years from his initial registration, it was decided
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintaining its entry in the said list and then in the context
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review of the administrative measure, it was decided to reimpose it
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

banning his entry into the country until ...2019.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Consequently, his appeal must be rejected as unfounded.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For those reasons
 

 

 

 

The Authority rejects A's appeal for the deletion of his data from
