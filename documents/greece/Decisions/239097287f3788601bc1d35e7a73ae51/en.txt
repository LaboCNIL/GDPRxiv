Specifically with the no. prot.

In particular, following a lawsuit filed against him for embezzlement by the company, as a former employee in the position of debt collector, he asked the company for judicial use of his defense, as a defendant in the criminal trial, with his request from ... to be granted a copy of the video footage who recorded the CCTV of the bus in the driver's seat of the bus on the day of the incident in question on â€¦. However, as he complains, the company never responded to his request, rejecting it implicitly, in violation of the provisions of articles 12 par. 3 and 15 of the GDPR.

C/EIS/1546/21 in their memorandum to the Authority stated the following: a) the complainant has not yet satisfied the complainant's right of access to the video footage in question, nor has she answered anything related to his request b) even though the case of the criminal hearing was put on file, the complainant needs the material in question for his defense in the civil trial for compensation from the complainant, c) during the hearing the legal representative of the company stated that the video material has been deleted and that he has been informed verbally by the complainant, while such a thing never happened and neither did the complainant mention it in her response document to the Authority in 2020, d) the certificate of previous service contained his personal data unnecessary, relevant, and depending on the intended purpose, in violation of the provisions of of articles 678 of the Civil Code and 5 of the GDPR, e) at a later time requested to be granted a new certificate, in which again, although it was not stated that he was dismissed due to a criminal act, it was stated that he was dismissed due to termination before the agreed time for a good reason, and f) finally, with his third new application and at the same time a complaint to the Labor Inspectorate, the complainant granted him a new certificate in which he mention of the hiring and firing decisions, so even this third certificate does not meet the criteria of 678 AK, as long as someone with the numbers of the decisions can refer to DIAUGEA and see the full text of his dismissal, where he appears as an exception. The President of the Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes "RODA" D. Tsikkis and the attorney-in-fact S. Passaris, both during the hearing and with the case no. prot. C/EIS/1862/21 in their memorandum to the Authority stated the following: a) regarding the certificate of previous service, personal data was processed only in the light of the right of access, as long as the certificate was not transmitted to third parties, in any case after the from 23.12.20 of the complainant's new request, the company issued a new certificate with a correct 3 repetition in which only the time of his employment, the period of his employment and the type of his work are indicated, b) the recording of personal data by the a video camera installed inside the buses above the driver's seat only records the ticketing transaction between the driver and the passenger, without depicting faces and without sound, and the data collected through the video surveillance system is not stored in an archive system, and the duration their observance is limited to seven (7) days, after which they are automatically deleted, c) the ... the camera footage was automatically deleted, a fact of which the complainant was aware and had been verbally informed and d) as of 3.3.21 the Board of Directors has voted in favor. the company's written CCTV policy, which is attached to the Authority. The Authority, after the hearing and the examination of the elements of the file and after hearing the rapporteur and the assistant rapporteur, who withdrew after the discussion of the case and before the conference and decision-making, after a thorough discussion, CONSIDERED THE LAW 1. According to the provisions of article 5 par. 1 item a', b' and c' of the GDPR, personal data should a) be lawfully and legitimately processed in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (principles of legality, objectivity and transparency), b) collected for specified , express and legitimate purposes and not be further processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes (principle of purpose limitation), c) are appropriate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (principle of data minimization). Furthermore, in accordance with Article 12 para. 3 of the GDPR, "the data controller shall provide the data subject with information on the action taken upon request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request . This deadline may be extended by a further two months if necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number of requests. The data controller shall inform the data subject of said extension within one month of receipt of the request, as well as of the reasons for the delay." Finally, according to Article 15 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to receive from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not the personal data concerning him is being processed. 2. Also, according to article 678AK "At the end of the contract, the employee can demand from the employer a certificate for the type and duration of his work. Only if the employee specifically requests it, the quality of his work and his conduct are confirmed." 3. In the present case, based on what emerged from the hearing process and from the examination of the file's elements, the complained Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes "RODA", as the controller, a)in violation of the provisions of article 5 par. 1 item c' of the GDPR, granted
to the complainant following his dismissal from the company, a certificate
seniority in which it was registered except for its type and duration
of work and the information that he was dismissed due to a criminal act and b) v
violation of the provisions of articles 12 par. 3 and 15 of the GDPR, he never answered
in writing to the complainant's request of 22.7.19 to be granted a copy
of the footage captured by his CCTV
bus in the driver's seat of the bus on the day of the incident
disputed incident on 23.2.20, implicitly dismissing it.

Following these, a violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the
principle of proportionality (article 5 par. 1 letter c GDPR), of the non-satisfaction of

4. In view of the above, the Authority, taking into account its gravity

complainant, considers that it should be imposed on the complainant by application
of the provision of article 58 par. 2 sec. i' of the GDPR effective, proportional and
dissuasive administrative fine, according to article 83 of the GDPR1.

Because the violation found by the Authority of the provisions of articles 5

administrative fines of article 83 par. 5 sec. a' and b' GDPR.
