decision-making, after thorough discussion,
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW

 

 

 

 

 

1. Because the provisions of articles 2 par. b', 4 par. 1 and 7 par. 2 item. 3 of n.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2472/1997 determine the terms and conditions for legal processing

5 par. 3 and 13 par. 3 item. b' of Law 3418/2005 (Code of Medical Ethics)
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide for the exceptional granting of medical certificates and opinions
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a third party who has a legitimate interest and proves it, as well as the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions for lifting medical confidentiality. Because, further, article 11 par. 3
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Law 2472/1997 stipulates that if the data is communicated to third parties, the subject
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2

2. Because, in the case under consideration, A is requesting as a third party (article 2
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

item i' of Law 2472/1997) the granting of personal data (among others
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitive health data) concerning B's mother.
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Because it appears from the evidence of the case file that the appellant
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the documents, the purpose of personal data processing consists of
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebuttal of the aforementioned lawsuits and the insurance claim
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

measures (petitions under items a' to c) that he has brought against her and others
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants/defendants B before the competent courts

processing of the requested personal data in accordance with
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aforementioned provision of article 7 par. 2 item c' of Law 2472/1997 and if
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition, the principle of proportionality of personal data is also met
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(article 4 par. 1 item b of Law 2472/1997), so that the Authority can decide whether
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity and affordability of the use of the specific personal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data to refute the above lawsuits, its determination is required
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file content.
 

 

 

5. Since it is not clear from the data in the case file what the
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-mentioned conducted social research, if it includes personal
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data, nor if medical opinions are kept in the file of the Municipality regarding
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
the B.

 

  

 

 

 
FOR THOSE REASONS

 

 

 

The Authority postpones the adjudication of the case in this case the data controller
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to send without delay a photocopy of the above file that he keeps and
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to specify in writing whether it has submitted a Notice of Formation and Operation
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file no. 6 or 7 of Law 2472/1997 or if he is exempted from the relevant obligations
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by no. 7A n. 2472/1997 and for what reasons.
