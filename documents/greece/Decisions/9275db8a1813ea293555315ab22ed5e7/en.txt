THOUGHT ACCORDING TO THE LAW

 

1. Because the provisions of articles 2 par. b', 4 par. 1 and 7 par. 2 item. c

of Law 2472/1997 determine the terms and conditions for the legal

processing of sensitive personal data concerning health, in

combination with the provisions of articles 5 par. 3 and 13 par. 3 item b' of n.

3418/2005 (Code of Medical Ethics) which provide for the exceptional

granting medical certificates to a third party, as long as it has a legal interest

and proves it and the conditions for lifting the medical confidentiality. Because,

further, article 11 par. 3 of Law 2472/1997 stipulates that if the data

are announced to third parties, the subject is informed of the announcement before

from them.

2. Because article 1666 of the Civil Code provides that in judicial support

the adult is submitted, among other things, when due to mental or intellectual reasons

disorder or due to physical disability is unable to provide care in whole or in part

alone in his affairs. Furthermore, article 1667 of the Civil Code states that the submission

in legal aid is decided by the court after an application,

among others, the child of the sufferer.

3. Because, in the considered case, A is requesting as a third party

(Article 2 item i of Law 2472/1997) the provision of sensitive data



3

(health data) relating to B's mother and kept in his records

Papageorgiou General Hospital, as data controller (article 2 letter g)

of Law 2472/1997). From the data in the case file, it appears that Mr

purpose of processing is to support the application for judicial

defense filed by A before the Single Member Court of First Instance

Thessaloniki (Voluntary Jurisdiction Procedure) for the submission of B to

legal assistance and her appointment as a legal assistant

of her mother (no. 1666 ff. A.K. and 801 ff. KPolD).

4. The intended processing purpose is consistent with the aforementioned

provision of article 7 par. 2 item c' of Law 2472/1997, while at the same time it is fulfilled

and the principle of data proportionality (article 4 par. 1 letter b) of

Law 2472/1997). The General Hospital of Papageorgiou, owes, as responsible

processing, to inform, in accordance with the provisions of article 11

par. 3 of Law 2472/1997, to B for the transmission of his personal data to

A, to the extent that, at the discretion of the treating physicians of the Hospital,

is able to understand the meaning and content of this update.

 

FOR THOSE REASONS

 

The Authority grants the license to Papageorgiou General Hospital, as responsible

processing, to grant A the requested medical certificate concerning

in B, namely a medical opinion on the nature, type and severity

of the situation, the evolution of the disease and the present in general

state of health, in the context of the above legal case, since

previously the Hospital informs B, to the extent that she, during

judgment of the treating doctors of the Hospital, is able to perceive it

meaning and content of this update.
