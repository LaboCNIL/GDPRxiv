2. Because the request for a temporary injunction under consideration is requested by
complainant, to order her immediate total temporary restraint
processing, and in particular the replacement of the provisional certificate
identity card with a new identity card without any reference to his position
complainant's availability and the provisions that provide for it.

3. Because the Authority following the no. original Authority C/EXE/2388/21-10-2021 document
of her, with which she asked the complainants for clarifications on her
complaint and the request for a temporary injunction, received in response
the one with no. prot. ... (under Authority prot. no. C/EIS/7359/11-11-2021) document of
Headquarters of the Fire Department to the Authority. With the above document,
controller claims that as of …/2021, the complainant was summoned
with the with no. ... document of the Regional Fire Administration Ψ (attachment
in with no. prot.: ... (under Authority prot. no. C/EIS/7359/11-11-2021) document) to
deliver the no. ... proof of identity, which, according to
claims of the data controller, by mistake it lists the
service status of the complainant in order to be granted a new one
certificate in which no corresponding mention is made. Following these, the Authority invited Mr
new controller with no. First Authority C/EXE/2621/17-11-
2021 document to present to the Authority the type of the new temporary certificate
identity details and/or a copy of the certificate issued to
complainant. With the no. Authority Prot. C/EIS/7649/22-11-2021, the Headquarters of
of the Fire Brigade sent the Authority a copy of the new temporary one
certificate with no. first … granted to the complainant, as well as
copy of the delivery protocol from her complainant with no…

first ....

4. Because with the no. of the Authority C/EXE/2622/17-11-2021 its document, the Authority
at the same time invited the complainant to confirm receipt of the relevant
no. first ... Invitation of the Regional Fire Administration Ψ for

granting a new temporary certificate of identity and receiving it,
as well as to present to the Authority a copy of the certificate granted,
in order for the Authority to be able to judge the further outcome of No.
Complaint of Authority G/EIS/6553/11-10-2021. With the no. First Authority
C/EIS/7672/23-11-2021 his response, the complainant confirmed receipt of
relevant no. first ... Invitation of the Regional Fire Administration
Ψ and presented to the Authority the new temporary certificate of identification with
no. first ....

5. Because from the examination with no. first ... of temporary certificate which
included both in no. Prot. Authority C/EIS/7672/23-11-2021 document of
complainant, as well as in no. Authority letter C/EIS/7649/22-11-2021
controller's response, it appears that each has been deleted
reference to the position of the complainant in availability and the provisions from
which are foreseen.

6. Because in this case, from the above it is established that if the person in charge
processing proceeded to replace the temporary identity certificate
and granting a new one with deletion of the disputed personnel data
character, the processing in question has been stopped and therefore not
there is a case of issuing a temporary injunction. Therefore, the defendant must
request to be rejected as irrelevant.

 

FOR THOSE REASONS

 

THE BEGINNING
