THE EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION BOARD

Having regard to Article 70 (1e) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, (hereinafter “GDPR”),

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended by
the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20181,

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure,

Having regard to the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council
titled Data protection as a pillar of citizens’ empowerment and the EU’s approach to the digital transition -
two years of application of the General Data Protection Regulation2,

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES

1 INTRODUCTION

1.

4.

The GDPR introduces, in certain cases, the requirement for a personal data breach to be notified to the
competent  national  supervisory  authority  (hereinafter  “SA”)  and  to  communicate  the  breach  to the
individuals whose personal data have been affected by the breach (Articles 33 and 34).

The Article 29 Working Party already produced a general guidance on data breach notification in October
2017, analysing the relevant Sections of the GDPR (Guidelines on Personal data breach notification under
Regulation 2016/679, WP 250) (hereinafter “Guidelines WP250)3. However, due to its nature and timing,
this guideline did not address all practical issues in sufficient detail. Therefore, the need has arisen for a
practice-oriented,  case-based guidance,  that  utilizes  the  experiences  gained  by  SAs  since  the  GDPR  is
applicable.

This document is intended to complement the Guidelines WP 250 and it reflects the common experiences
of the SAs of the EEA since the GDPR became applicable. Its aim is to help data controllers in deciding how
to handle data breaches and what factors to consider during risk assessment.

As part of any attempt to address a breach the controller and processor should first be able to recognize
one. The GDPR defines a “personal data breach” in Article 4(12) as “a breach of security leading to the

accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data
transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”.

5.

In its Opinion 03/2014 on breach notification4 and in its Guidelines WP 250, WP29 explained that breaches
can be categorised according to the following three well-known information security principles:

“Confidentiality breach” - where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to,
personal data.
“Integrity breach” - where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data.
“Availability breach” - where there is an accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of,
personal data.5

A breach can potentially have a range of significant adverse effects on individuals, which can result in
physical, material, or non-material damage. The GDPR explains that this can include loss of control over
their  personal  data,  limitation  of  their  rights,  discrimination,  identity  theft  or  fraud,  financial  loss,
unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, and loss of confidentiality of personal
data  protected  by  professional  secrecy.  It  can  also  include  any  other  significant  economic  or  social
disadvantage to those individuals. One of the most important obligation of the data controller is to evaluate
these  risks  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects  and  to  implement  appropriate  technical  and
organizational measures to address them.

7.

Accordingly, the GDPR requires the controller to:

document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its
effects and the remedial action taken6;
notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority, unless the data breach is unlikely to result
in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons7;
communicate the personal data breach to the data subject when the personal data breach is likely to
result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons8.

Data breaches are problems in and of themselves, but they may be also symptoms of a vulnerable, possibly
outdated data security regime, they may also indicate system weaknesses to be addressed. As a general
truth, it is always better to prevent data breaches by preparing in advance, since several consequences of
them are by nature irreversible. Before a controller can fully assess the risk arising from a breach caused by
some form of attack, the root cause of the issue should be identified, in order to identify whether any
vulnerabilities that gave rise to the incident are still present, and are still therefore exploitable. In many
cases the controller is able to identify that the incident is likely to result in a risk, and is therefore to be

5 See Guidelines WP 250, p. 7. - It must be taken into consideration that a data breach can concern either one
category or more categories simultaneously or combined.

notified. In other cases the notification does not need to be postponed until the risk and impact surrounding
the breach has been fully assessed, since the full risk assessment can happen in parallel to notification, and
the information thus gained may be provided to the SA in phases without undue further delay9.

The breach should be notified when the controller is of the opinion that it is likely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of the data subject. Controllers should make this assessment at the time they become
aware  of  the  breach.  The  controller  should  not  wait  for  a  detailed  forensic  examination  and  (early)
mitigation steps before assessing whether or not the data breach is likely to result in a risk and thus should
be notified.

If a controller self-assesses the risk to be unlikely, but it turns out that the risk materializes, the competent
SA can use its corrective powers and may resolve to sanctions

Every controller and processor should have plans, procedures in place for handling eventual data breaches.
Organisations should have clear reporting lines and persons responsible for certain aspects of the recovery
process

Training and awareness on data protection issues for the staff of the controller and processor focusing on
personal data breach management (identification of a personal data breach incident and further actions to
be taken, etc.) is also essential for the controllers and processors. This training should be regularly repeated,
depending on the type of the processing activity and size of the controller, addressing latest trends and
alerts coming from cyberattacks or other security incidents.

The principle of accountability and the concept of data protection by design could incorporate analysis that
feeds into a data controller’s and data processor’s own “Handbook on Handling Personal Data Breach” that
aims  to  establish  facts  for  each  facet  of  the  processing  at  each  major  stage  of  the  operation.  Such  a
handbook  prepared  in  advance  would  provide  a  much  quicker  source  of  information  to  allow  data
controllers and data processors to mitigate the risks and meet the obligations without undue delay. This
would ensure that if a personal data breach was to occur, people in the organisation would know what to
do, and the incident would more than likely be handled quicker than if there were no mitigations or plan in
place.

Though the cases presented below are fictitious, they are based on typical cases from the SA’s collective
experience with data breach notifications. The analyses offered relate explicitly to the cases under scrutiny,
but  with  the  goal  to  provide  assistance  for  data  controllers  in  assessing  their own  data  breaches.  Any
modification in the circumstances of the cases described below may result in different or more significant
levels of risk, thus requiring different or additional measures. These guidelines structure the cases according
to certain categories of breaches (e.g. ransomware attacks). Certain mitigating measures are called for in
each case when dealing with a certain category of breaches. These measures are not necessarily repeated
in each case analysis belonging to the same category of breaches. For the cases belonging to the same
category only the differences are laid out. Therefore, the reader should read all cases relevant to relevant
category of a breach to identify and distinguish all the correct measures to be taken.

15.

The internal documentation of a breach is an obligation independent of the risks pertaining to the breach,
and must be performed in each and every case. The cases presented below try to shed some light on
whether or not to notify the breach to the SA and communicate it to the data subjects affected.

2 RANSOMWARE

16.

A frequent cause for a data breach notification is a ransomware attack suffered by the data controller. In
these cases a malicious code encrypts the personal data, and subsequently the attacker asks the controller
for a ransom in exchange for the decryption code. This kind of attack can usually be classified as a breach
of availability, but often also a breach of confidentiality could occur.

2.1 CASE No. 01: Ransomware with proper backup and without exfiltration
Computer systems of a small manufacturing company were exposed to a ransomware attack, and
data stored in those systems was encrypted. The data controller used encryption at rest, so all data
accessed  by  the  ransomware  was  stored  in  encrypted  form  using  a  state-of-the-art  encryption
algorithm. The decryption key was not compromised in the attack, i.e. the attacker could neither
access it nor use it indirectly. In consequence, the attacker only had access to encrypted personal
data. In particular, neither the email system of the company, nor any client systems used to access it
were  affected. The  company  is  using  the  expertise  of  an  external  cybersecurity  company  to
investigate the incident. Logs tracing all data flows leaving the company (including outbound email)
are available. After analysing the logs and the data collected by the detection systems the company
has deployed, an internal investigation supported by the external cybersecurity company determined
with certainty that the perpetrator only encrypted data, without exfiltrating it. The logs show no
outward data flow in the timeframe of the attack. The personal data affected by the breach relates
to clients and employees of the company, a few dozen individuals altogether. A backup was readily
available, and the data was restored a few hours after the attack took place. The breach did not result
in any consequences on the day-to-day operation of the controller. There was no delay in employee
payments or handling client requests.
In this case, the following elements were realized from the definition of a ‘personal data breach’: a breach
of security led to unlawful alteration and unauthorized access to personal data stored.

2.1.1 CASE No. 01 - Prior measures and risk assessment
As with all risks posed by external actors, the likelihood that a ransomware attack is successful can be
drastically reduced by tightening the security of the data controlling environment. The majority of these
breaches can be prevented by ensuring that appropriate organizational, physical and technological security
measures have been taken. Examples of such measures are proper patch management and the use of an
appropriate anti-malware detection system. Having a proper and separate backup will help to mitigate the
consequences of a successful attack should it occur. Moreover, an employee security education, training,
and awareness (SETA) program, will help to prevent and recognise this kind of attack. (A list of advisable
measures can be found in section 2.5.) Among those measures, a proper patch management that ensures
that the systems are up to date and all known vulnerabilities of the deployed systems are fixed is one of
the most important since most of the ransomware attacks exploit well known vulnerabilities.

17.

18.

19. When assessing the risks, the controller should investigate the breach and identify the type of the malicious
code to understand the possible consequences of the attack. Among those risks to be considered is the risk
that data was exfiltrated without leaving a trace in the logs of the systems.

20.

In this example, the attacker had access to personal data and the confidentiality of cipher text containing
personal data in encrypted form was compromised. However, any data that might have been exfiltrated
cannot be read or used by the perpetrator, at least for the time being. The encryption technique used by
the  data  controller conforms  to  the  state-of-the-art.  The decryption key  was not compromised and
presumably could also not be determined by other means. In consequence, the confidentiality risks to the

rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons are  reduced to  a  minimum barring  cryptanalytic  progress  that
renders the encrypted data intelligible in the future.

21.

The data controller should consider the risk to individuals due to the breach10. In this case, it appears the
risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects result from the lack of availability of the personal data, and
the confidentiality of the personal data is not compromised11. In this example, the adverse effects of the
breach were mitigated fairly soon after the breach occurred. Having a proper backup regime12 makes the
effects of the breach less severe and here the controller was able to effectively make use of it.

22. On the severity of the consequences for the data subjects, only minor consequences could be identified
since the affected data was restored in a few hours, the breach did not result in any consequences on the
day-to-day operation of the controller and had no significant effect on the data subjects (e.g. employee
payments or handling client requests).

2.1.2 CASE No. 01 – Mitigation and obligations

23. Without a backup few measures to remediate the loss of personal data can be undertaken by the controller,
and the data has to be collected again. In this particular case however, the impacts of the attack could
effectively be contained by resetting all compromised systems to a clean state known to be free of malicious
code, fixing the vulnerabilities and restoring the affected data soon after the attack. Without a backup, data
is lost and the severity may increase because risks or impacts to individuals may also do so.

24.

The timeliness of an effective data restoration from the readily available backup is a key variable when
analysing the breach. Specifying an appropriate timeframe to restore the compromised data depends on
the unique circumstances of the breach at hand. The GDPR states that a personal data breach shall be
notified without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than after 72 hours. Therefore, it could be
determined that exceeding the 72-hour time limit is unadvisable in any case, but when dealing with high
risk level cases, even complying with this deadline can be viewed as unsatisfactory.

25.

In  this  case,  following  a  detailed  impact  assessment  and  incident  response  process,  the  controller
determined that the breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
hence no communication to the data subjects is necessary, nor does the breach require a notification to

10 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see A29 Working Party “Guidelines on Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and determining whether processing is “likely to result in a high risk” for the
purposes of Regulation 2016/679”, WP248 rev. 01, - endorsed by EDPB,
https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611236, p. 9.

11 Technically, encryption of data will involve “access” to original data, and in the case of ransomware, the deletion of
the original – the data needs to be accessed by ransomware code to encrypt it, and to remove the original data. An
attacker may take a copy of the original before deletion, but personal data will not always be extracted. As a data
controller’s investigation progresses, new information may come to light to make this assessment change. Access that
results in unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of the personal data, or to a security risk to a
data subject, even without interpretation of the data may be as severe as access with interpretation of the personal
data.

12 Backup procedures should be structured, consistent and repeatable. Examples of back up procedures are the 3-2-1
method and the grandfather-father-son method. Any method should always be tested for effectiveness in coverage
and when data is to be restored. Testing should also be repeated at intervals and especially when changes occur in
the processing operation or its circumstances to ensure the integrity of the system.

the SA. However, as all data breaches, it should be documented in accordance with Article 33 (5). The
organisation may also need (or later be required by the SA) to update and remediate its organizational and
technical personal data security handling and risk mitigation measures and procedures. Within the frame
of this update and remediation, the organisation should thoroughly investigate the breach and identify the
causes and the methods used by the perpetrator in order to prevent any similar events in the future.

2.2 CASE No. 02: Ransomware without proper backup
One of the computers used by an agricultural company was exposed to a ransomware attack and its
data was encrypted by the attacker. The company is using the expertise of an external cybersecurity
company  to  monitor  their  network. Logs  tracing  all  data  flows  leaving  the  company  (including
outbound email) are available. After analysing the logs and the data the other detection systems
have collected the internal investigation aided by the cybersecurity company determined that the
perpetrator only encrypted the data, without exfiltrating it. The logs show no outward data flow in
the timeframe of the attack. The personal data affected by the breach relates to the employees and
clients  of  the  company,  a  few  dozen  individuals  altogether. No  special  categories  of  data  were
affected. No backup was available in an electronic form. Most of the data was restored from paper
backups. The restoration of the data took 5 working days and led to minor delays in the delivery of
orders to customers.

26.

2.2.1 CASE No. 02 - Prior measures and risk assessment
The data controller should have adopted the same prior measures as mentioned in part 2.1. and in section
2.9. The major difference to the previous case is the lack of an electronic backup and the lack of encryption
at rest. This leads to critical differences in the following steps.

27. When assessing the risks, the controller should investigate the method of infiltration and identify the type
of  the  malicious  code  to  understand  the  possible  consequences  of  the  attack.  In  this  example  the
ransomware encrypted the personal data without exfiltrating it. As a result, it appears the risks to the rights
and  freedoms  of  data  subjects  result  from  the  lack  of  availability  of  the  personal  data,  and  the
confidentiality of the personal data is not compromised. A thorough examination of the firewall logs and
its implications is essential in determining the risk. The data controller should present the factual findings
of these investigations upon request.

28.

The data controller needs to keep in mind that if the attack is more sophisticated the malware has the
functionality to edit log files and remove the trace. So - given that logs are not forwarded or replicated to a
central log server - even after a thorough investigation that determined that the personal data was not
exfiltrated by the attacker, the data controller cannot state that the absence of a log entry proves the absence
of exfiltration, therefore the likelihood of a confidentiality breach cannot be entirely dismissed.

29.

The data controller should assess the risks of this breach13 if the data was accessed by the attacker. During
the risk assessment, the data controller should also take into consideration the nature, the sensitivity, the

13 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.

Adopted - after public consultation

10

volume, and the context of personal data affected in the breach. In this case no special categories of personal
data are affected, and the quantity of breached data and the number of affected data subjects is low.

30.

Gathering exact information on the unauthorized access is key for determining the risk level and preventing
a new or continued attack. If the data had been copied from the database, it would obviously have been a
risk-increasing  factor. When  uncertain  about  the  specifics  of  the  illegitimate  access, the  worse  scenario
should be considered and the risk should be assessed accordingly.

31.

The absence of a backup database can be considered a risk enhancing factor depending on the severity of
consequences for the data subjects resulting from the lack of availability of the data.

2.2.2 CASE No. 02 – Mitigation and obligations

32. Without a backup few measures to remediate the loss of personal data can be undertaken by the controller,
and the data has to be collected again, unless some other source is available (e.g. order confirmation e-mails).
Without a backup, data may be lost and the severity will depend on the impact for the individuals.

33.

34.

35.

The restoration of the data should not prove to be overly problematic14 if the data is still available on paper,
but given the lack of an electronic backup database, a notification to the SA is considered necessary, as the
restoration of the data took some time and could cause some delays in the orders’ delivery to customers and
a considerable amount of meta-data (e.g. logs, time stamps) might not be retrievable.

Informing the data subjects about the breach may also depend on the length of time the personal data is
unavailable and the difficulties it might cause in the operation of the controller as a result (e.g. delays in
transferring employee’s payments). As these delays in payments and deliveries may lead to financial loss for
the individuals whose data has been compromised, one could also argue the breach is likely to result in a
high risk. Also, it might not be possible to avoid informing the data subjects if their contribution is needed for
restoring the encrypted data.

This case serves as an example for a ransomware attack with risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects, but not reaching high risk. It should be documented in accordance with Article 33 (5) and notified
to the SA in accordance with Article 33 (1). The organisation may also need (or be required by the SA) to
update and remediate its organizational and technical personal data security handling and risk mitigation
measures and procedures.

14 This will depend on the complexity and structure of the personal data. In the most complex scenarios, re-establishing
data integrity, consistency with metadata, ensuring the correct relationships within data structures and checking data
accuracy may take significant resources and effort.

2.3 CASE No. 03: Ransomware with backup and without exfiltration in a hospital
The information system of a hospital / healthcare centre was exposed to a ransomware attack and a
significant proportion of its data was encrypted by the attacker. The company is using the expertise of
an external cybersecurity company to monitor their network. Logs tracing all data flows leaving the
company (including outbound email) are available. After analysing the logs and the data the other
detection  systems have  collected the  internal  investigation aided by the cybersecurity  company
determined that the perpetrator only encrypted the data without exfiltrating it. The logs show no
outward data flow in the timeframe of the attack. The personal data affected by the breach relates to
the employees and patients, which represented thousands of individuals. Backups were available in
an electronic form. Most of the data was restored but this operation lasted 2 working days and led to
major delays in treating the patients with surgery cancelled / postponed, and to a lowering the level
of service due to the unavailability of the systems.

36.

37.

38.

39.

2.3.1 CASE No. 03 - Prior measures and risk assessment
The data controller should have adopted the same prior measures as mentioned in part 2.1. and in section
2.5. The major difference to the previous case is the high severity of consequences for a substantial part of
the data subjects15.

The quantity of breached data and the number of affected data subjects are high, because hospitals usually
process large quantities of data. The unavailability of the data has a high impact on a substantial part of the
data subjects. Moreover, there is a residual risk of high severity to the confidentiality of the patient data.

The type of the breach, nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data affected in the breach are important.
Even though a backup for the data existed and it could be restored in a few days, a high risk still exists due to
the severity of consequences for the data subjects resulting from the lack of availability of the data at the
moment of the attack and the following days.

2.3.2 CASE No. 03 – Mitigation and obligations
A notification to the SA is considered necessary, as special categories of personal data are involved and the
restoration of the data could take a long time, resulting in major delays in patient care. Informing the data
subjects about the breach is necessary due to the impact for the patients, even after restoring the encrypted
data. While data relating to all patients treated in the hospital during the last years have been encrypted,
only those patients who were scheduled to be treated in the hospital during the time the computer system
was  unavailable  were  impacted.  The  controller  should  communicate  the  data  breach  to  those  patients
directly. Direct communication to the other patients some of which may not have been in the hospital for
more than twenty years may not be required due to the exception in Article 34 (3) c). In such a case, there
shall instead be a public communication16 or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an
equally effective manner. In this case, the hospital should make the ransomware attack and its effects public.

15 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.

16 GDPR Recital 86 explains that “Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible
and  in  close  cooperation  with  the  supervisory  authority,  respecting  guidance  provided  by  it  or  by  other  relevant
authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would
call  for  prompt  communication  with  data  subjects  whereas  the  need  to  implement appropriate  measures  against
continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication”.

This case serves as an example for a ransomware attack with high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects. It should be documented in accordance with Article 33 (5), notified to the SA in accordance with
Article 33 (1) and communicated to the data subjects in accordance with Article 34 (1). The organisation also
needs to update and remediate its organizational and technical personal data security handling and risk
mitigation measures and procedures.

2.4 CASE No. 04: Ransomware without backup and with exfiltration

The server of a public transportation company was exposed to a ransomware attack and its data was
encrypted by the attacker. According to the findings of the internal investigation the perpetrator not
only encrypted the data, but also exfiltrated it. The type of breached data was the personal data of
clients and employees, and of the several thousand people using the services of the company (e.g.
buying tickets online). Beyond basic identity data, identity card numbers and financial data such as
credit card details are involved in the breach. A backup database existed, but it was also encrypted by
the attacker.

41.

42.

43.

2.4.1 CASE No. 04 - Prior measures and risk assessment
The data controller should have adopted the same prior measures as mentioned in part 2.1. and in section
2.5. Though backup was in place, it was also affected by the attack. This arrangement alone raises questions
about the quality of the controller’s prior IT security measures and should be further scrutinised during the
investigation, since in a well-designed backup regime, multiple backups must be securely stored without
access  from  the  main  system,  otherwise  they  could  be  compromised  in  the  same  attack.  Furthermore,
ransomware  attacks  may  lie  undiscovered  for  days  slowly  encrypting  rarely  used  data.  This  can  render
multiple backups useless, so backups should also be taken periodically and be isolated. This would increase
the likelihood of recovery albeit with increased loss data.

This  breach  concerns  not  only  data  availability,  but  confidentiality  as  well,  since  the  attacker  may  have
modified and / or copied data from the server. Therefore, the type of the breach results in high risk17.

The  nature, sensitivity,  and  volume of  personal  data  increases  the  risks  further,  because the  number of
individuals affected is high, as is the overall quantity of affected personal data. Beyond basic identity data,
identity documents and financial data such as credit card details are involved too. A data breach concerning
these types of data presents high risk in and of themselves, and if processed together, they could be used for
– among others - identity theft or fraud.

44.

Due to either faulty server logic or organizational controls, the backup files were affected by the ransomware,
preventing the restore of data and enhancing the risk.

17 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.

47.

This data breach presents a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, because it could likely lead to
both  material  (e.g.  financial  loss  since  credit  card  details  were  affected)  and  non-material  damage  (e.g.
identity theft or fraud since identity card details were affected).

2.4.2 CASE No. 04 – Mitigation and obligations
Communication to the data subjects is essential, so they can make the necessary steps to avoid material
damage (e.g. block their credit cards).

Aside  from documenting  the  breach  in  accordance  with  Article  33  (5),  a  notification  to  the  SA  is also
mandatory in this case (Article 33 (1)) and the controller is also obliged to communicate the breach to the
data subjects (Article 34 (1)). The latter could be undertaken on a person-by-person basis, but for individuals
where contact data is not available the controller should do so publicly, provided that such communication
would not be susceptible to trigger additional negative consequences on the data subjects, e.g. by way of a
notification on its website. In the latter case a precise and clear communication is required, in plain sight on
the homepage of the controller, with exact references of the relevant GDPR provisions. The organisation may
also need to update and remediate its organizational and technical personal data security handling and risk
mitigation measures and procedures.

2.5 Organizational and technical measures for preventing / mitigating the impacts of

ransomware attacks

48.

The fact that a ransomware attack could have taken place is usually a sign of one or more vulnerabilities in
the controller’s system. This also applies in ransomware cases in which the personal data has been encrypted,
but has not been exfiltrated. Regardless of the outcome and the consequences of the attack, the importance
of an all-encompassing evaluation of the data security system - with particular emphasis on IT security -
cannot  be  stressed  enough.  The  identified  weaknesses  and  security  holes  are  to  be  documented  and
addressed without delay.

49.

Advisable measures:

(The list of the following measures is by no means exclusive or comprehensive. Rather, the goal is to
provide prevention ideas and possible solutions. Every processing activity is different, hence the controller
should make the decision on which measures fit the given situation the most.)



Keeping the firmware, operating system and application software on the servers, client machines, active
network components, and any other machines on the same LAN (including Wi-Fi devices) up to date.
Ensuring that appropriate IT security measures are in place, making sure they are effective and keeping
them  regularly  updated  when  processing  or  circumstances  change  or  evolve.  This  includes  keeping
detailed logs of which patches are applied at which timestamp.

 Designing and organising processing systems and infrastructure to segment or isolate data systems and



networks to avoid propagation of malware within the organisation and to external systems.
The existence of an up-to-date, secure and tested backup procedure. Media for medium- and long-term
back-up should be kept separate from operational data storage and out of reach of third parties even in
case of a successful attack (such as daily incremental backup and weekly full backup).

 Having / obtaining an appropriate, up-to-date, effective and integrated anti-malware software.

Adopted - after public consultation

14





 Having  an  appropriate,  up-to-date,  effective  and  integrated  firewall  and  intrusion detection  and
prevention system. Directing network traffic through the firewall/intrusion detection, even in the case of
home office or mobile work (e.g. by using VPN connections to organizational security mechanisms when
accessing the internet).
Training  employees  on  the  methods  of  recognising  and  preventing IT attacks. The  controller  should
provide means to establish whether emails and messages obtained by other means of communication
are  authentic  and  trustworthy. Employees  should  be  trained  to  recognize  when  such  an  attack  has
realized, how to take the endpoint out of the network and their obligation to immediately report it to
the security officer.
Emphasize the need of identifying the type of the malicious code to see the consequences of the attack
and be able to find the right measures to mitigate the risk. In case a ransomware attack has succeeded
and  there  is  no  back-up  available,  tools  available  such  as  the  ones  by  the  “no  more  ransom”
(nomoreransom.org) project may be applied to retrieve data. However, in case a safe backup is available,
restoring the data from it is advisable.
Forwarding or replication all logs to a central log server (possibly including the signing or cryptographic
time-stamping of log entries).
Strong encryption and multi factor authentication, in particular for administrative access to IT systems,
appropriate key and password management.
Vulnerability and penetration testing on a regular basis.
Establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) within the organization, or join a collective CSIRT/CERT. Create an Incident Response Plan, Disaster
Recovery Plan and a Business Continuity Plan, and make sure that these are thoroughly tested.

 When assessing countermeasures – risk analysis should be reviewed, tested and updated.

3 DATA EXFILTRATION ATTACKS

50.

Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in services offered by the controller to third parties over the internet, e.g.
committed by way of injection attacks (e.g. SQL injection, path traversal), website compromising and similar
methods, may resemble ransomware attacks in that the risk emanates from the action of an unauthorized
third  party,  but those attacks  typically aim  at copying,  exfiltrating and abusing  personal  data  for some
malicious end. Hence, they are mainly breaches of confidentiality and, possibly, also data integrity. At the
same time, if the controller is aware of the characteristics of this kind of breaches, there are many measures
available to controllers that can substantially reduce the risk of a successful execution of an attack.

3.1 CASE No. 05: Exfiltration of job application data from a website

An employment agency was the victim of a cyber-attack, which placed a malicious code on its website.
This malicious code made personal information submitted through online job application forms and
stored on the webserver accessible to unauthorized person(s). 213 such forms are possibly affected,
after analysing the affected data it was determined that no special categories of data were affected in
the breach. The particular malware toolkit installed had functionalities that allowed the attacker to
remove any history of exfiltration and also allowed processing on the server to be monitored and to
have personal data captured. The toolkit was discovered only a month after its installation.

51.

3.1.1 CASE No. 05 - Prior measures and risk assessment
The security of the data controller’s environment is extremely important, as the majority of these breaches
can  be  prevented  by  ensuring  that  all  systems  are  constantly  updated,  sensitive  data  is  encrypted  and

Adopted - after public consultation

15

52.

53.

54.

applications are developed according to high security standards like strong authentication, measures against
brute force, attacks, “escaping” or “sanitising”18 user inputs, etc. Periodic IT security audits, vulnerability
assessments and penetration  tests are  also  required  in  order  to  detect  these  kinds  of  vulnerabilities  in
advance and fix them. In this particular case, file integrity monitoring tools in production environment might
have helped to detect the code injection. (A list of advisable measures is to be found in section 3.7).

The controller should always start to investigate the breach by identifying the type of the attack and its
methods, in order to assess what measures are to be taken. To make it fast and efficient, the data controller
should have an incident response plan in place which specifies the swift and necessary steps to take control
over the incident. In this particular case, the type of the breach was a risk enhancing factor since not only
was data confidentiality curtailed, the infiltrator also had the means to establish changes in the system, so
data integrity also became questionable.

The nature, sensitivity and volume of personal data affected in the breach should be assessed to determine
to what extent the breach affected the data subjects. Though no special categories of personal data were
affected, the accessed data contains considerable information about the individuals from the online forms,
and such data could be misused in a number of ways (targeting with unsolicited marketing, identity theft,
etc.), so the severity of the consequences should increase the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects19.

3.1.2 CASE No. 05 – Mitigation and obligations
If possible, after solving the problem, the database should be compared with the one stored in a secure
backup. The experiences drawn from the breach should be utilized in updating the IT infrastructure. The data
controller should return  all  affected  IT  systems  to  a  known  clean  state,  remedy the vulnerability  and
implement new security measures to avoid similar data breaches in the future, e.g. file integrity checks and
security  audits. If  personal  data  was  not  only  exfiltrated,  but  also  deleted,  the  controller  has  to  take
systematic action to recover the personal data in the state it was in before the breach. It may be necessary
to apply full backups, incremental changes and then possibly rerun the processing since the last incremental
backup – which requires that the controller is able to replicate the changes made since the last backup. This
could require that the controller has the system designed to retain the daily input files in case they need to
be processed again and requires a robust method of storage and a suitable retention policy.

55.

In light of the above, as the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons, the data subjects should definitely be informed about it (Article 34(1)), which of course means that
the relevant SA(s) should also be involved in the form of a data breach notification. Documenting the breach
is obligatory according to Article 33 (5) GDPR and makes the assessment of the situation easier.

3.2 CASE No. 06: Exfiltration of hashed password from a website

An SQL Injection vulnerability was exploited to gain access to a database of the server of a cooking
website. Users were only allowed to choose arbitrary pseudonyms as usernames. The use of email
addresses for this purpose was discouraged. Passwords stored in the database were hashed with a
strong algorithm and the salt was not compromised. Affected data: hashed passwords of 1.200
users. For safety’s sake, the controller informed the data subjects about the breach via e-mail and
asked them to change their passwords, especially if the same password was used for other services.

60.

61.

62.

3.2.1 CASE No. 06 - Prior measures and risk assessment
In this particular case data confidentiality is compromised, but the passwords in the database were hashed
with an up-to-date method, which would decrease the risk regarding the nature, sensitivity, and volume of
personal data. This case presents no risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore,  no  contact  information  (e.g.  e-mail  addresses or  phone  numbers)  of  data  subjects  was
compromised,  which  means  there  is  no  significant  risk  for  the  data  subjects  of  being  targeted  by  fraud
attempts (e.g. receiving phishing e-mails or fraudulent text messages and phone calls). No special categories
of personal data were involved.

Some user names could be regarded as personal data, but the subject of the website does not allow for
negative connotations. Although it has to be noted that the risk assessment may change20, if the type of the
website and the data accessed could reveal special categories of personal data (e. g. website of a political
party or trade union). Using state of the art encryption could mitigate the adverse effects of the breach.
Assuring that a limited number of attempts to login is allowed will prevent brute force login attacks to be
successful, thus reducing largely the risks imposed by attackers already knowing the usernames.

3.2.2 CASE No. 06 – Mitigation and obligations
The communication to the data subjects in some cases could be considered a mitigating factor, since the data
subjects are also in a position to make the necessary steps to avoid further damages from the breach, for
example by changing their password. In this case, notification was not mandatory, but in many cases it can
be considered a good practice.

The data controller should correct the vulnerability and implement new security measures to avoid similar
data breaches in the future like, for example, systematic security audits to the website.

The breach should be documented in accordance with Article 33 (5) but no notification or communication
needed.

Also, it is strongly advisable to communicate a breach involving passwords to data subjects in any case even
when the passwords were stored using a salted hash with an algorithm conforming to the state-of-the-art.
The use of authentication methods obviating the need to process passwords on the server side is preferable.
Data subjects should be given the choice to take appropriate measures regarding their own passwords.

3.3 CASE No. 07: Credential stuffing attack on a banking website

A bank suffered a cyber-attack against one of its online banking websites. The attack aimed to
enumerate all possible login user IDs using a fixed trivial password. The passwords consist of 8
digits. Due to a vulnerability of the website, in some cases information regarding data subjects
(name, surname, gender, date and place of birth, fiscal code, user identification codes) were leaked
to the attacker, even if the used password was not correct or the bank account not active anymore.
This affected around 100.000 data subjects. Out of these, the attacker successfully logged into
around 2.000 accounts which were using the trivial password tried by the attacker. After the fact,
the  controller  was  able  to  identify  all  illegitimate  log-on  attempts. The  data  controller could
confirm that, according to antifraud checks, no transactions were performed by these accounts
during the attack. The bank was aware of the data breach because its security operations centre
detected a high number of login requests directed toward the website. In response, the controller
disabled the possibility to log in to the website by switching it off and forced password resets of
the compromised accounts. The controller communicated the breach only to the users with the
compromised accounts, i.e. to users whose passwords were compromised or whose data was
disclosed.

64.

65.

66.

67.

3.3.1 CASE No. 07 - Prior measures and risk assessment
It  is  important  to  mention  that  controllers  handling data  of  highly  personal  nature21 have  a  larger
responsibility in terms of providing adequate data security, e.g. having a security operation’s centre and other
incident prevention, detection and response measures. Not meeting these higher standards will certainly
result in more serious measures during an SA’s investigation.

The breach concerns financial data beyond the identity and user ID information, making it particularly severe.
The number of individuals affected is high.

The fact that a breach could happen in such a sensitive environment points to significant data security holes
in  the  controller’s  system,  and  may  be  an  indicator  of  a  time  when  the  review  and  update  of  affected
measures is “necessary” in line with Articles 24 (1), 25 (1), and 32 (1) of the GDPR. The breached data permits
the unique identification of data subjects and contains other information about them (including gender, date
and place of birth), furthermore it can be used by the attacker to guess the customers’ passwords or to run
a spear phishing campaign directed at the bank customers.

For these reasons, the data breach was deemed likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of all
the data subjects concerned22. Therefore, the occurrence of material (e.g. financial loss) and non-material
damage (e.g. identity theft or fraud) is a conceivable outcome.

3.3.2 CASE No. 07 – Mitigation and obligations
The controller’s measures mentioned in the case description are adequate. In the wake of the breach it also
corrected the vulnerability of the website and took other steps to prevent similar future data breaches, such

21 Such as information of the data subjects referred to payment methods such as card numbers, bank accounts, online
payment, payrolls, bank statements, economic studies or any other information that may reveal economic information
pertaining to the data subjects.

68.

Documenting the breach according to Article 33 (5) GDPR and notifying the SA about it are not optional in
this scenario. Furthermore, the controller should notify all 100.000 data subjects (including the data subjects
whose accounts were not compromised) in accordance with Article 34 GDPR.

Advisable measures:23

(The list of the following measures is by no means exclusive or comprehensive. Rather, the goal is to
provide prevention ideas and possible solutions. Every processing activity is different, hence the controller
should make the decision on which measures fit the given situation the most.)





State-of-the-art encryption and key management, especially when passwords, sensitive or financial data
are being  processed. Cryptographic  hashing  and  salting  for  secret  information  (passwords)  is  always
preferred  over  encryption  of  passwords. The  use  of  authentication  methods  obviating  the  need  to
process passwords on the server side is preferable.
Keeping the system up to date (software and firmware). Ensuring that all IT security measures are in
place, making  sure  they  are effective  and  keeping  them  regularly  updated  when  processing  or
circumstances change or evolve. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with Article 5(1)(f) in
accordance with Article 5 (2) GDPR the controller should maintain a record of all updates performed,
including also the time when they were applied.



 Use  of  strong  authentication  methods  like  two-factor  authentication and authentication  servers,

complemented by an up-to-date password policy.
Secure development standards include the filtering of user input (using white listing as far as practicable),

4 INTERNAL HUMAN RISK SOURCE

71.

The role of human error in personal data breaches has to be highlighted, due to its common appearance.
Since these types of breaches can be both intentional and unintentional, it is very hard for the data controllers
to  identify  the  vulnerabilities  and  adopt  measures  to  avoid  them.  The  International  Conference  of  Data
Protection and Privacy Commissioners recognized the importance of addressing such human factors and
adopted the resolution to address the role of human error in personal data breaches in October 201924. This
resolution stresses that appropriate safeguarding measures should be taken to prevent human errors and
provides a non-exhaustive list of such safeguards and approaches.

4.1 CASE No. 08: Exfiltration of business data by an employee

During his period of notice, the employee of a company copies business data from the company’s
database. The employee is authorized to access the data only to fulfill his job tasks. Months later,
after  quitting  the  job, he uses  the  data  thus  gained  (basic  contact  data) to  feed  a  new  data
processing for which he is the controller in order to contact the clients of the company to entice
them to his new business.

72.

73.

74.

4.1.1 CASE No. 08 - Prior measures and risk assessment
In  this  particular  case  no  prior  measures  were  taken  to prevent  the  employee  from  copying  contact
information of the company’s clientele, since he needed – and had – legitimate access to this information for
his job tasks. Since fulfilling most customer relation jobs require some kind of employee access to personal
data, these data breaches may be the most difficult to prevent. Limitations to the scope of access may limit
the work the given employee is able to do. However, well thought out access policies and constant control
can help prevent such breaches.

As usual, during risk assessment the type of the breach and the nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal
data  affected  are  to  be  taken  into  consideration.  These  kinds  of  breaches  are  typically  breaches  of
confidentiality, since the database is usually left intact, its content “merely” copied for further use. The
quantity  of  data  affected  is  usually  also  low  or  medium.  In  this  particular  case  no  special  categories  of
personal data were affected, the employee only needed the contact information of clients to enable him to
get in touch with them after leaving the company. Therefore, the data concerned is not sensitive.

Although the only goal of the ex-employee that maliciously copied the data may be limited to gaining the
contact information of the company’s clientele for his own commercial purposes, the controller is not in a
position to consider the risk for the affected data subjects to be low, since the controller does not have any
kind of reassurance on the intentions of the employee. Thus, while the consequences of the breach might be
limited to the exposure to uncalled-for self-marketing of the ex-employee, further and more grave abuse of
the  stolen  data  is  not  ruled  out, depending  on  the  purpose  of  the  processing  put  in  place  by  the  ex-
employee25.

76.

77.

4.1.2 CASE No. 08 – Mitigation and obligations
The mitigation of the adverse effects of the breach in the above case is difficult. It might need to involve
immediate legal action to prevent the former employee from abusing and disseminating the data any further.
As a next step, the avoidance of similar future situations should be the goal. The controller might try to order
the ex-employee to stop using the data, but the success of this action is dubious at best. Appropriate technical
measures such as the impossibility of copying or downloading data to removable devices may help.

There is no “one-size fits-all” solution to these kinds of cases, but a systematic approach may help to prevent
them. For example, the company may consider – when possible - withdrawing certain forms of access from
employees who have signalled their intention to quit or implementing access logs so that unwanted access
can be logged and flagged. The contract signed with employees should include clauses that prohibit such
actions.

All in all, as the given breach will not result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, a
notification to the SA will suffice. However, the information to the data subjects might be beneficial for the
data controller too, since it might be better that they hear from the company about the data leak rather than
from the ex-employee who tries to contact them. Data breach documentation in accordance with Article 33
(5) is a legal obligation.

CASE No. 09: Accidental transmission of data to a trusted third party

4.2
An insurance agent noticed that – made possible by the faulty settings of an Excel file received by
e-mail – he was able to access information related to two dozen customers not belonging to his
scope.  He is  bound  by  professional  secrecy  and was  the  sole  recipient  of  the  e-mail.  The
arrangement between the data controller and the insurance agent obliges the agent to signal a
personal data breach without undue delay to the data controller. Therefore, the agent instantly
signalled the mistake to the controller, who corrected the file and sent it out again, asking the agent
to delete the former message. According to the above-mentioned arrangement the agent has to
confirm the deletion in a written statement, which he did. The information gained includes no
special categories of personal data, only contact data and data about the insurance itself (insurance
type, amount). After analysing the personal data affected by the breach the data controller did not
identify any special characteristics on the side of the individuals or the data controller that may
affect the level of impact of the breach.

78.

79.

4.2.1 CASE No. 09 – Prior measures and risk assessment
Here the breach does not derive from an intentional action of an employee, but from an unintentional human
error caused by inattentiveness. These kinds of breaches may be avoided or decreased in frequency by a)
enforcing training, education and awareness programs where employees gain a better understanding of the
importance of personal data protection, b) reducing file exchange through e-mail, instead using dedicated
systems for processing customer data for example, c) double checking files before sending, d) separating the
creation and sending of files.

This data breach concerns only the confidentiality of the data, and the integrity and the accessibility thereof
are left intact. The data breach only concerned about two dozen costumers, hence the quantity of data
affected can be considered as low. Furthermore, the personal data affected does not contain any sensitive
data. The fact that the data processor immediately contacted the data controller after becoming aware of
the data breach can be considered a risk mitigating factor. (The possibility of data having been sent to other
insurance agents should also be evaluated and, if confirmed, proper measures should be taken.) Due to the
appropriate steps taken after the data breach, it will probably not have any impact on the data subjects’
rights and freedoms.

80.

The combination of the low number of individuals affected, the immediate detection of the breach and the
measures taken to have its effects minimized make this particular case no risk.

4.2.2 CASE No. 09 – Mitigation and obligations

81. Moreover, other risk mitigating circumstances are at play as well: the agent is bound by professional secrecy;
he himself reported the problem to the controller; and he deleted the file upon request. Raising awareness
and possibly including additional steps in checking documents involving personal data will probably help
avoid similar cases in the future.

82.

Besides documenting the breach in accordance with Article 33 (5), there is no need for any other action.

5 LOST OR STOLEN DEVICES AND PAPER DOCUMENTS

85.

A frequent type of case is the loss or theft of portable devices. In these cases, the controller has to take into
consideration the circumstances of the processing operation, such as the type of data stored on the device,
as well as the supporting assets, and the measures taken prior to the breach to ensure an appropriate level
of security. All of these elements affect the potential impacts of the data breach. The risk assessment might
be difficult, as the device is no longer available.

These kinds of breaches can be always classified as breaches of confidentiality. However, if there is no backup
for the stolen database, then the breach type can also be breach of availability and breach of integrity.

The scenarios bellow demonstrate how the above mentioned circumstances influence the likelihood and
severity of the data breach.

5.1 CASE No. 10: Stolen material storing encrypted personal data

During a break-in into a children’s day-care centre, two tablets were stolen. The tablets contained
an app which held personal data about the children attending the day-care centre. Name, date of
birth,  personal  data about the  education  of  the  children  were  concerned.  Both  the encrypted
tablets which were turned off at the time of the break-in, and the app were protected by a strong
password.  Back-up  data  was  effectively  and readily  available  to  the  controller.  After  becoming
aware of the break-in, the day-care remotely issued a command to wipe the tablets shortly after
the discovery of the break-in.

5.1.1 CASE No. 10 - Prior measures and risk assessment
In this particular case the data controller took adequate measures to prevent and mitigate the impacts of a
potential data breach by using device encryption, introducing adequate password protection and securing
back-up of the data stored on the tablets. (A list of advisable measures is to be found in section 5.7).

After becoming aware of a breach, the data controller should assess the risk source, the systems supporting
the data processing, the type of personal data involved and the potential impacts of the data breach on the
concerned individuals. The data breach described above would have concerned confidentiality, availability
and integrity of the concerned data, however due to the appropriate proceedings of the data controller prior
and after the data breach none of these occurred.

5.1.2 CASE No. 10 – Mitigation and obligations
The confidentiality of the personal data on the devices was not compromised due to the strong password
protection on both the tablets and the apps. The tablets were set up in such a way that setting a password
also means that the data on the device is encrypted. This was further enhanced by the controller’s action to
attempt to remotely wipe everything from the stolen devices.

Due to the measures taken, the confidentiality of the data was kept intact too. Furthermore, the backup
ensured the continuous availability of the personal data, hence no potential negative impact could have
occurred.

Due to these facts, the above described data breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
of the data subjects, hence no notification to the SA or the concerned data subjects was necessary. However,
this data breach must also be documented in accordance with Article 33 (5).

5.2 CASE No. 11: Stolen material storing non-encrypted personal data

The electronic notebook device of an employee of a service provider company was stolen. The
stolen notebook contained names, surnames, sex, addresses and date of births of more than
100000 customers. Due to the unavailability of the stolen device it was not possible to identify if
other categories of personal data were also affected. The access to the notebook's hard drive was
not protected by any password. Personal data could be restored from daily backups available.

95.

96.

97.

98.

5.2.1 CASE No. 11 - Prior measures and risk assessment
No prior safety measures were taken by the data controller, hence the personal data stored on the stolen
notebook  was  easily  accessible  for  the  thief or  any  other  person  coming  into  possession  of  the  device
thereafter.

This data breach concerns the confidentiality of the data stored on the stolen device.

The notebook containing the personal  data was  vulnerable in  this  case because  it did  not  possess  any
password  protection  or  encryption. The  lack  of  basic  security  measures  enhances  the  risk  level  for  the
affected data subjects. Furthermore, the identification of the concerned data subjects is also problematic,
which also increases the severity of the breach. The considerable number of concerned individuals increases
the risk, nevertheless, no special categories of personal data were concerned in the data breach.

During the risk assessment29 the controller should take into consideration the potential consequences and
adverse effects of the confidentiality breach. As a result of the breach the concerned data subjects may suffer
identity fraud relying on the data available on the stolen device, so risk is considered to be high.

5.2.2 CASE No. 11 – Mitigation and obligations
Turning on device encryption and the use of strong password protection of the stored database could have
prevented the data breach to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Due to these circumstances the notification of the SA is required, the notification of the concerned data
subjects is also necessary.

5.3 CASE No. 12: Stolen paper files with sensitive data

A paper log book was stolen from a drug addiction rehab facility. The book contained basic identity and
health data of the patients admitted to the rehab facility. The data was only stored on paper and no
backup was available to the doctors treating the patients. The book was not stored in a locked drawer
or a room, the data controller had neither an access control regime nor any other safeguarding measure
for the paper documentation.

29 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.

Adopted - after public consultation

25

99.

5.3.1 CASE No. 12 – Prior measures and risk assessment
No prior safety measures were taken by the data controller, hence the personal data stored in this book was
easily accessible for the person who found it. Moreover, the nature of the personal data stored in the book
makes the lack of backup data a very serious risk factor.

100. This  case  serves  as  an  example  for  a  high-risk  data  breach.  Due  to  the  failure  of  appropriate  safety
precautions, sensitive health data pursuant to Article 9 (1) GDPR was lost. Since in this case a special category
of personal data was concerned, the potential risks to the concerned data subjects was increased, which
should be also taken into consideration by the controller assessing the risk30.

101. This breach concerns the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the concerned personal data. As a result
of the breach, medical secrecy is broken and unauthorized third parties may gain access to the patients’
private medical information, what may have severe impact on the patient’s personal life. The availability
breach may also disturb the continuity of the patients’ treatment. Since the modification/deletion of parts of
the book’s content may not be excluded, the integrity of the personal data is also compromised.

5.3.2 CASE No. 12 – Mitigation and obligations

102. During the assessment of the safeguarding measures the type of the supporting asset should be considered
as well. Since the patient log book was a physical document, its safeguarding should have been organized
differently than that of an electronic device. The pseudonymisation of the patients’ names, the storage of
the  book  in  a  safeguarded  premises  and in  a  locked  drawer  or  a  room,  and  proper  access  control  with
authentication when accessing it could have prevented the data breach.

103. The above described data breach may severely impact the concerned data subjects; hence the notification

of the SA and communication of the breach to the concerned data subjects is mandatory.

104. A combination of the below mentioned measures – applied depending on the unique features of the case –

should help to lower the chance of a similar breach reoccurring.

105. Advisable measures:

(The list of the following measures is by no means exclusive or comprehensive. Rather, the goal is to

should make the decision on which measures fit the given situation the most.)

Turn on device’s encryption (such as Bitlocker, Veracrypt or DM-Crypt).


 Use passcode/password on all devices. Encrypt all mobile electronic devices in a way that requires the

input of a complex password for decryption.

 Use multi-factor authentication.


Turn on the functionalities of highly mobile devices that allow them to be located in case of loss or
misplacement.

30 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.



down any unattended devices.
If possible and appropriate to the data processing in question, save personal data not on a mobile device,
but on a central back-end server.
If the workstation is connected to the corporate LAN, do an automatic backup from the work folders
provided it is unavoidable that personal data is stored there



 Use a secure VPN (e.g. which requires a separate second factor authentication key for the establishment

of a secure connection) to connect mobile devices to back-end servers.
Provide physical locks to employees in order to enable them to physically secure mobile devices they use
while they remain unattended.
Proper regulation of device usage outside the company.
Proper regulation of device usage inside the company.



 Use MDM (Mobile Devices Management) software/app and enable the remote wipe function.
 Use centralised device management with minimum rights for the end users to install software.



Install physical access controls.
Avoid  storing  sensitive  information  in  mobile  devices  or  hard  drives.  If  there  is  need  to  access  the
company’s internal system, secure channels should be used such as previously stated.

6 MISPOSTAL

106. The risk source is an internal human error in this case as well, but here no malicious action led to the breach.
It is the result of inattentiveness. Little can be undertaken by the controller after it happened, so prevention
is even more important in these cases than in other breach types.

6.1 CASE No. 13: Postal mail mistake

Two orders for shoes were packed by a retail company. Due to human error two packing bills were
mixed up with the result that both products and the relevant packing bills were sent to the wrong
person.  This  means  that  the  two  customers  got  each  other's  orders,  including  the  packing  bills
containing the personal data. After becoming aware of the breach the data controller recalled the
orders and sent them to the right recipients.

6.1.1 CASE No. 13 - Prior measures and risk assessment

107. The  bills  contained  the  personal  data  required  for  a  successful  delivery  (name,  address,  plus  the  item
purchased and its price). It is important to identify how the human error could have happened in the first
place, and if in any way, it could have been prevented. In the particular case describe the risk is low, since no
special categories of personal data or other data whose abuse might lead to substantial negative effects were
involved, the breach is not a result of a systemic error on the controller’s part and only two individuals are
concerned. No negative effect on the individuals could be identified.

6.1.2 CASE No. 13 – Mitigation and obligations

108. The controller should provide for a free return of the items and the accompanying bills, and it also should
request the wrong recipients to destroy / delete all eventual copies of the bills containing the other person’s
personal data.

109. Even if the breach itself does not pose a high risk to rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, and thus
communication to the data subjects is not mandated by Article 34 GDPR, communication of the breach to
them cannot be avoided, as their cooperation is needed to mitigate the risk.

6.2 CASE No. 14: Highly confidential personal data sent by mail by mistake

The employment department of a public administration office sent an e-mail message – about
upcoming  trainings - to  the  individuals  registered  in  its  system  as  jobseekers.  By  mistake,  a
document containing all these jobseekers’ personal data (name, e-mail address, postal address,
social security number) was attached to this e-mail. The number of affected individuals is more
than 60000. Subsequently the office contacted all the recipients and asked them to delete the
previous message and not to use the information contained in it.

6.2.1 CASE No. 14 - Prior measures and risk assessment

110. Stricter  rules should have been  implemented  for  sending  such  messages.  The  introduction  of  additional

control mechanisms need to be considered.

111. The number of affected individuals is considerable, and the involvement of their social security number, along
with  other,  more  basic  personal  data,  further  increases  the  risk,  which  can  be  identified  as  high31.  The
eventual distribution of the data by any of the recipients cannot be contained by the controller.

6.2.2 CASE No. 14 – Mitigation and obligations

112. As mentioned earlier, the means to effectively mitigate the risks of a similar breach, are limited. Though the
controller  asked  for the deletion  of  the  message,  it  cannot  force  the  recipients  to  do  so,  and  as  a
consequence, nor can it be certain that they comply with the request.

113. The execution of all three below indicated actions should be self-evident in a case like this.

6.3 CASE No. 15: Personal data sent by mail by mistake

A list of participants on a course in Legal English which takes place in a hotel for 5 days is by mistake
sent to 15 former participants of the course instead of the hotel. The list contains names, e-mail
addresses and food preferences of the 15 participants. Only two participants have filled in their
food preferences, stating that they are lactose intolerant. None of the participants have a protected
identity. The controller discovers the mistake immediately after sending the list and informs the
recipients of the mistake and asks them to delete the list.

6.3.1 CASE No. 15 - Prior measures and risk assessment

114. Strict  rules should  have  been  implemented  for  sending  of  messages containing  personal  data.  The

introduction of additional control mechanisms need to be considered.

31 For guidance on “likely to result in high risk” processing operations, see footnote 10 above.

Adopted - after public consultation

28

115. The risks deriving from the nature, the sensitivity, the volume and the context of the personal data are low.
The  personal  data includes sensitive  data  on  food  preferences  of  two  of  the  participants.  Even  if the
information  that  someone  is  lactose  intolerant  is  health  data,  the  risk  that  this  data  will  be  used  in  a
detrimental way should be considered relatively low. While in the case of data concerning health it is usually
assumed that the breach is likely to result in a high risk for the data subject32, at the same time in this
particular  case  no  risk  can  be  identified  that  the  breach  will  lead  to  physical,  material  or  non-material
damages of the data subject due to the unauthorised disclosure of lactose intolerance information. Contrary
to  some  other  food preferences,  lactose  intolerance  can  normally  not  be  linked  to  any  religious  or
philosophical beliefs. The quantity of the breached data and the number of affected data subjects is very low
as well.

116.

117.

6.3.2 CASE No. 15 – Mitigation and obligations
In summary, it can be stated that the breach had no significant effect on the data subjects. The fact that the
controller immediately contacted the recipients after becoming aware of the mistake can be considered as a
mitigating factor.

If an email is sent to an incorrect/unauthorised recipient, it is recommended that the data controller should
Bcc a follow up email to the unintended recipients apologising, instructing that the offending email should
be  deleted,  and  advising  recipients  that  they  do  not  have  the  right to  further  use  the  email  addresses
identified to them.

118. Due to these facts this data breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects, hence no notification to the SA or the concerned data subjects was necessary. However, this data
breach must also be documented in accordance with Article 33(5).

6.4 CASE No. 16: Postal mail mistake

An insurance group offers car insurances. To do this, it sends out regularly adjusted contribution
policies by postal mail. In addition to the name and address of the policyholder, the letter contains
the vehicle registration number without masked digits, the insurance rates of the current and next
insurance year, the approximate annual mileage and the policyholder's date of birth. Health data
according  to  Article  9  GDPR,  payment  data  (bank  details),  economic  and  financial  data  are  not
included.

Letters are packed by automated enveloping machines. Due to a mechanical error, two letters for
different policyholders are inserted into one envelope and sent to one policyholder by letter post.
The policyholder opens the letter at home and takes a look at his correctly delivered letter as well as
at the incorrectly delivered letter from another policyholder.

6.4.1 CASE No. 16 - Prior measures and risk assessment

119. The incorrectly delivered letter contains the name, address, date of birth, unmasked vehicle registration
number and the classification of the insurance rate of the current and the next year. The effects on the
affected person are to be regarded as medium, since information not publicly available such as the date of

29

birth  or unmasked vehicle  registration  numbers,  and details  about  the  increment  in  insurance  rates  are
disclosed to the unauthorized recipient. The probability of misuse of this data is assessed to be between low
and medium. However, while many recipients will probably dispose of the wrongly received letter in the
garbage, in individual cases it cannot be completely ruled out that the letter will be posted in social networks
or that the policyholder will be contacted.

6.4.2 CASE No. 16 – Mitigation and obligations

120. The controller should have the original document returned at its own expense. The wrong recipient should

also be informed that he/she may not misuse the information read.

121.

It will probably never be possible to completely prevent a postal delivery error in a mass mailing using fully
automated machines. However, in the event of an increased frequency, it is necessary to check whether the
enveloping machines are set and maintained correctly enough, or if some other systemic issue leads to such
a breach.

7 OTHER CASES – SOCIAL ENGINEERING

7.1 CASE No. 17: Identity theft

The contact centre of a telecommunication company receives a telephone call from someone that
poses as a client. The supposed client demands the company to change the email address to which
the billing information should be sent from there on. The worker of the contact centre validates
the  client’s  identity  by  asking  for  certain  personal  data,  as  defined  by  the  procedures  of  the
company. The caller correctly indicates the requested client’s fiscal number and postal address
(because he had access to these elements). After the validation, the operator makes the requested
change and, from there on, the billing information is sent to the new email address. The procedure
does not foresee any notification to the former email contact. The following month the legitimate
client contacts the company, inquiring why he is not receiving billing to his email address, and
denies any call from him demanding the change of the email contact. Later, the company realizes
that the information has been sent to an illegitimate user and reverts the change.

7.1.1 CASE No. 17 - Risk assessment, mitigation and obligations

124. This case serves as an example on the importance of prior measures. The breach, from a risk aspect, presents
a high level of risk33, as billing data can give information about the data subject’s private life (e.g. habits,
contacts) and  could  lead  to  material  damage (e.g.  stalking,  risk  to  physical  integrity).  The  personal  data
obtained during this attack can also be used in order to facilitate account takeover in this organisation or
exploit further authentication measures in other organisations. Considering these risks, the “appropriate”
authentication measure should meet a high bar, depending on what personal data can be processed as a
result of authentication.

125. As a result, both a notification to the SA and a communication to the data subject are needed from the

controller.

126. The  prior  client  validation  process  is  clearly  to  be  refined  in  light  of  this  case.  The  methods  used  for
authentication were not sufficient. The malicious party was able to pretend to be the intended user by the
use of publicly available information and information that they otherwise had access to.

127. The use of this type of static knowledge-based authentication (where the answer does not change, and where

the information is not “secret” such as would be the case with a password) is not recommended.

128.

Instead,  the  organisation  should  use  a  form  of  authentication  which  would  result  in  a  high  degree  of
confidence that the authenticated user is the intended person, and not anyone else. The introduction of an
out-of-band multi-factor authentication method would solve the problem, e.g. to verify the change demand,
by sending a confirmation request to the former contact; or adding extra questions and requiring information
only visible on the previous bills. It is the controller’s responsibility to decide which measures to introduce,
as it knows the details and requirements of its internal operation the best.

7.2 CASE No. 18: Email exfiltration

A hypermarket chain detected, 3 months after its configuration, that some email accounts had been
altered  and  rules  created so  that  every  email  containing  certain  expressions  (e.g.  “invoice”,
“payment”, “bank wiring”, “credit card authentication”, “bank account details”) would be moved
to an unused folder and also forwarded to an external email address. Also, by that time, a social
engineering attack had already been performed, i.e., the attacker, posing as a supplier, had had
that supplier bank account details altered into his own. Finally, by that time, several fake invoices
had been sent that included the new bank account detail. The monitoring system of the email
platform ended up giving an alert regarding the folders. The company was unable to detect how
the attacker was able to gain access to the email accounts to begin with, but it supposed that an
infected email was to blame for giving access to the group of users in charge of the payments.

Due  to  the keyword-based  forwarding  of  emails,  the  attacker  received  information  on 99
employees: name and wage of a particular month regarding 89 data subjects; name, civil status,
number  of  children,  wage,  work  hours  and  remainder  information  on  the  salary  receipt  of 10
employees whose contracts were ended. The controller only notified the 10 employees belonging
to the latter group.

7.2.1 CASE No. 18 - Risk assessment, mitigation and obligations

129. Even if the attacker was probably not aiming at collecting personal data, since the breach could lead to both
material (e.g. financial loss) and non-material damage (e.g. identity theft or fraud), or the data could be used
to facilitate other attacks (e.g. phishing), the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
and freedoms of natural persons. Therefore the breach should be communicated to all 99 employees and
not only to the 10 employees whose salary information was leaked.

130. After becoming aware of the breach, the controller forced a password change for the compromised accounts,
blocked sending emails to the attacker’s email account, notified the service provider of the email used by the
attacker regarding his or her actions, removed the rules set by the attacker and refined the alerts of the
monitoring  system  in  order  to  give  an  alert  as  soon  as  an  automatic  rule  is  created.  Alternatively,  the
controller could remove the right for users to set forwarding rules, needing the IT service team to do it only
on request or it could introduce a policy that users should check and report on the rules set on their accounts
once per week or more often, in areas handling financial data.

131. The fact that a breach could happen and go undetected for so long and the fact that, in a longer time, social
engineering could have been used for altering more data, highlighted significant problems in the controller’s
IT  security  system.  These  should  be  addressed without  delay,  like  emphasizing  automation  reviews  and
change controls, incident detection and response measures. Controllers handling sensitive data, financial
information, etc. have a larger responsibility in terms of providing adequate data security.
