under the GDPR 

 

Version 1.0 

Adopted on 12 May 2022 

 Adopted - version for public consultation 

Executive Summary 
 
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has adopted these guidelines to harmonise the methodology 
supervisory authorities use when calculating of the amount of the fine. These Guidelines complement the 
previously adopted Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purpose of the 
Regulation 2016/679 (WP253), which focus on the circumstances in which to impose a fine.  
 
The calculation of the amount of the fine is at the discretion of the supervisory authority, subject to the rules 
provided  for  in  the  GDPR.  In  that  context,  the  GDPR  requires  that  the  amount  of  the  fine  shall  in  each 
individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR). Moreover, when setting the 
amount of the fine, supervisory authorities  shall give due regard to a list of  circumstances that refer  to 
features of the infringement (its seriousness) or of the character of the perpetrator (Article 83(2) GDPR). 
Lastly, the amount of the fine shall not exceed the maximum amounts provided for in Articles 83(4) (5) and 
(6) GDPR. The quantification of the amount of the fine is therefore based on a specific evaluation carried out 
in each case, within the parameters provided for by the GDPR.  
 
Taking the abovementioned into account, the EDPB has devised the following methodology, consisting of five 
steps, for calculating administrative fines for infringements of the GDPR. 
 
Firstly, the processing operations in the case must be identified and the application of Article 83(3) GDPR 
needs to be evaluated (Chapter 3). Second, the starting point for further calculation of the amount of the 
fine needs to be identified (Chapter 4). This is done by evaluating the classification of the infringement in the 
GDPR, evaluating the seriousness of the infringement in light of the circumstances of the case, and evaluating 
the turnover of the undertaking. The third step is the evaluation of aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
related  to  past  or  present  behaviour  of  the  controller/processor  and  increasing  or  decreasing  the  fine 
accordingly  (Chapter  5).  The  fourth  step  is  identifying  the  relevant  legal  maximums  for  the  different 
infringements. Increases applied in previous or next steps cannot exceed this maximum amount (Chapter 6). 
Lastly, it needs to be analysed whether the calculated final amount meets the requirements of effectiveness, 
dissuasiveness and proportionality. The fine can still be adjusted accordingly (Chapter 7), however without 
exceeding the relevant legal maximum.  
 
Throughout all abovementioned steps, it must be borne in mind that the calculation of a fine is no mere 
mathematical exercise. Rather, the circumstances of the specific case are the determining factors leading to 
the final amount, which can – in all cases – vary between any minimum amount and the legal maximum.  
 
These Guidelines and its proposed methodology will remain under constant review of the EDPB.

The European Data Protection Board 

 
Having regard to Article 70(1)(k), (1)(j) and (1)(e) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, (hereafter “GDPR”), 
 
Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended by 
the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,1 
 
Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure, 
 
Having regard to Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines 
for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679, WP253, which were endorsed by the European Data Protection 
Board (hereafter “EDPB”) at its first Plenary meeting, 

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES 

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 

1.1 - Legal framework 
The EU has – with the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”), which has 
been applicable since 25 May 2018 – completed a comprehensive reform of data protection regulation in 
Europe.  The  Regulation  rests  on  several  key  components,  one  being  stronger  enforcement  powers  for 
supervisory  authorities.  The  Regulation  imposes  a  new,  substantially  increased  level  of  fines,  as  well  as 
providing for harmonization of fines between Member States.  

Data controllers and data processors have increased responsibilities to ensure that the personal data of the 
individuals are protected effectively. Supervisory authorities have powers to ensure that the principles of the 
GDPR as well as the rights of the individuals concerned are upheld according to the wording and the spirit of 
the GDPR. 

 

 

Therefore,  the  EDPB  developed  guidance  to  provide  a  clear  and  transparent  basis  for  the  supervisory 
authorities’  setting  of  fines.  The  previously  published  Guidelines  on  the  application  and  setting  of 
administrative fines address the circumstances in which an administrative fine would be an appropriate tool 
and interpret the criteria of Article 83 GDPR in this respect2.The present Guidelines address the methodology 
for the calculation of administrative fines. The two sets of Guidelines are  applicable simultaneously and 
should be seen as complementary.  

1.2 - Objective 

                                                             
1 References to “Member States” made throughout this document should be understood as references to “EEA Member 
States”. 
2 Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purpose of the Regulation 2016/679, WP253 
(hereinafter referred to as “Guidelines WP253”).  Guidelines WP253 were endorsed by the EDPB in its first Plenary 
meeting, on 25 May 2018. See Endorsement 1/2018, available online here.

These Guidelines are intended for use by the supervisory authorities to ensure a consistent application and 
enforcement of the GDPR and express the EDPB’s common understanding of the provisions of Article 83 
GDPR. 

The aim of these Guidelines is to create harmonized starting points as a common orientation, on the basis of 
which the calculation of administrative fines in individual cases can take place. However, it is settled case law 
that  any  such  guidance  need  not  be  as  specific  as  to  allow  a  controller  or  processor  to  make  a  precise 
mathematical calculation of the expected fine3. It is emphasized throughout these Guidelines that the final 
amount  of  the  fine  depends  on  all  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  The  EDPB  therefore  envisages 
harmonization on the starting points and methodology used to calculate a fine, rather than harmonization 
on the outcome.  

These Guidelines can be seen as following a step-by-step approach, though supervisory authorities are not 
obliged to to follow all steps if they are not applicable in a given case, nor to provide reasoning surrounding 
aspects of the Guidelines that are not applicable.  

 

 

Notwithstanding these Guidelines, supervisory authorities remain subject to all procedural obligations under 
national and EU law, including the duty to state reasons for their decisions and their obligations under the 
one  stop  shop  mechanism.  In  that  light,  although  the  supervisory  authorities  are  required  to  provide 
sufficient reasoning for their findings in accordance with national and EU law, these guidelines should not be 
interpreted as requiring the supervisory authority to state the exact starting amount or quantify the precise 
impact of each aggravating or mitigating circumstance. Moreover, mere reference to these Guidelines cannot 
replace the reasoning to be provided in a specific case.   

The Guidelines will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as practices in the EU and the EEA are developed. It 
should be noted that, with the exception of Denmark and Estonia4, supervisory authorities are authorized to 
issue administrative fines, which are binding if not appealed. Thus, over time, both administrative and judicial 
practice will further develop. 
 

1.3 - Scope 
These Guidelines are intended to govern and lay the foundation of the supervisory authorities’ setting of 
fines on an overarching level. The guidance set out applies to all types of controllers and processors according 
to  Article  4(7)  and  (8)  GDPR  except  natural  persons  when  they  do  not  act  as  undertakings.  This  is  not 
withstanding the powers of national authorities to fine natural persons. 

According to Article 83(7) GDPR, each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent 
administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in that Member State. 
Provided that supervisory authorities have this power on the basis of national law, these Guidelines apply to 
the calculation of the fine to be imposed on public authorities and bodies, with the exception of Chapter 4.4. 
Supervisory authorities remain free, however, to apply a methodology similar to the one described in this 
Chapter.  In  addition,  Chapter  6  is  not  applicable  to  the  calculation  of  the  fine  to  be  imposed  on  public 
authorities and bodies, in case national law provides for different legal maximums and the public authority 
or body does not act as an undertaking as defined in Chapter 6.2.1.

The Guidelines cover cross border cases as well as non-cross border cases. 

 

The Guidelines are not exhaustive, neither will they provide explanations about the differences between 
national administrative, civil or criminal law systems when imposing administrative sanctions in general.   

1.4 - Applicability 
According to Article 70(1)(e) GDPR, the EDPB is empowered to issue guidelines, recommendations and best 
practices in order to encourage consistent application of the GDPR. Article 70(1)(k) GDPR specifies that the 
Board shall ensure the consistent application of the GDPR and shall, on its own initiative or, where relevant, 
at  the request of  the European Commission, in particular draw up guidelines for supervisory authorities 
concerning  the  application  of  measures  referred  to  in Article  58  and  the  setting  of  administrative  fines 
pursuant to Article 83. 
 
In order to achieve a consistent approach to the imposition of administrative fines that adequately reflects 
all of the principles in the GDPR, the EDPB has agreed on a common understanding of the assessment criteria 
in Article 83 GDPR. The individual supervisory authorities will reflect this common approach, in accordance 
with the local administrative and judicial laws applicable to them. 
 

CHAPTER 2 – METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF THE 
FINE 

2.1 - General considerations 

16. 

15.  Notwithstanding cooperation and consistency duties, the  calculation of the  amount of  the fine is at  the 
discretion of the supervisory authority. The GDPR requires that the amount of the fine shall in each individual 
case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR). Moreover, when setting the amount of 
the fine, supervisory authorities shall give due regard to a list of circumstances that refer to features of the 
infringement (its seriousness) or of the character of the perpetrator (Article 83(2) GDPR). The quantification 
of the amount of the fine is therefore based on a specific evaluation carried out in each case, taking account 
of the parameters included in the GDPR.  
 
For conduct infringing data protection rules, the GDPR does not provide for a minimum fine. Rather, the 
GDPR only provides for maximum amounts in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR, in which several different types of 
conduct are grouped together. A fine can ultimately only be calculated by weighing up all the elements 
expressly identified in Article 83(2)(a)–(j) GDPR, relevant to the case and any other relevant elements, even 
if not explicitly listed in the said provisions (as Article 83(2)(k) GDPR requires to give due regard to any other 
applicable factor). Finally, the final amount of the fine resulting from this assessment must be effective, 
proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case (Article 83(1) GDPR). Any fine imposed must sufficiently 
take into account all of these parameters, whilst at the same time not exceeding the legal maximum provided 
for in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR.

2.3 - Infringements with fixed amounts 
In certain circumstances the supervisory authority may consider that certain infringements can be punished 
with a fine of a predetermined, fixed amount. It is at the discretion of the supervisory authority to establish 
which types of infringements qualify as such, based on their nature, gravity and duration. The supervisory 
authority cannot make such a determination if this is prohibited or would otherwise conflict with the national 
law of the Member State.  

The application of a fixed amount to certain types of infringements cannot hamper the application of the 
GDPR,  in  particular  Article  83  thereof.  Moreover,  applying  fixed  amounts  does  not  relieve  supervisory 
authorities from complying with cooperation and consistency (Chapter VII GDPR).  
 
Fixed amounts can be established at the discretion of the supervisory authority, taking into account – inter 
alia – the social and economic circumstances of that particular Member State, in relation to the seriousness 
of the infringement as construed by Article 83(2)(a), (b) and (g) GDPR. It is recommended that the supervisory 
authority communicates the amounts and circumstances for application beforehand. 

CHAPTER 3 – CONCURRENT INFRINGEMENTS AND THE APPLICATION OF 
ARTICLE 83(3) GDPR 

Before being able to calculate a fine based on the methodology of these guidelines, it is important to first 
consider  what  conduct  (factual  circumstances  regarding  the  behavior)  and  infringements  (abstract  legal 
descriptions  of  what  is  sanctionable)  the  fine  is  based  upon.  Indeed,  a  particular  case  might  include 
circumstances that could either be considered as one and the same or separate sanctionable conducts. Also 
it is possible that one and the same conduct could give rise to a number of different infringements where the 
attribution of one infringement precludes attribution of another infringement or can be attributed alongside 
each  other.  In  other  words,  there  can  be  cases  of  concurrent  infringements.  Depending  on  the  rules  of 
concurrences such can lead to different calculations of fines.

24. 

Examining the analysis of Member States’ traditions of rules on concurrences as outlined in CJEU case-law, 5 
and considering the different scopes of application and legal consequences, these principles can be roughly 
grouped into the following three categories:  

-  Concurrence of offences (Chapter 3.1.1),  
-  Unity of action (Chapter 3.1.2), 
-  Plurality of actions (Chapter 3.2).  

 
These different categories of concurrences  do not conflict with each other, but have different scopes of 
application and fit into place in a coherent overall system, providing for a logical testing scheme.  
 
Therefore, it is important to first establish 

a.  Whether  or  not  the  circumstances  are  to  be  considered  as  one    (Chapter  3.1)  or

multiple sanctionable conducts (Chapter 3.2),  
In  case  of  one  conduct  (Chapter  3.1),  whether  or  not  this  conduct  gives  rise  to  
one or more infringements, and 
In  case  of  one  conduct  that  gives  rise  to  multiple  infringements,  attribution  of  one 
infringement precludes the attribution of another infringement (Chapter 3.1.1) or whether 
they are to be attributed alongside each other (Chapter 3.1.2).

3.1 - One sanctionable conduct 

 

 

25. 

26. 

As a first step, it is essential to establish whether there is one and the same sanctionable conduct (“idem”) 
or there are multiple ones in order to identify the relevant sanctionable behavior to be fined. Therefore, it is 
important to understand what circumstances are considered as one and the same conduct, as opposed to 
multiple conducts. The relevant sanctionable behavior needs to be assessed and identified on a case-by-case 
basis. For example in a certain case “the same or linked processing operations” might constitute one and the 
same conduct.  

The term “processing operation” is included in Article 4(2) GDPR, where “processing” is defined as “any 
operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or 
not by  automated means, such  as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or 
alteration,  retrieval,  consultation,  use,  disclosure  by  transmission,  dissemination  or  otherwise  making 
available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.” 

27.  When assessing, ”the same or linked processing operations”, it should be kept in mind that  all obligations 
legally  necessary  for    the  processing  operations  to  be  lawfully  carried  out  can  be  considered  by  the 
supervisory authority for its assessment of infringements, including like for instance transparency obligations 
(e.g. Article 13 GDPR). This is also underlined by the phrase “for the same or linked processing operations”, 
which indicates that the scope of this provision includes any infringement that relates to and may have an 
impact on the same or linked processing operations.  
 
 The term “linked” refers to the principle that a unitary conduct might consist of several parts that are carried 
out by a unitary will and are contextually (in particular regarding identity in terms of data subject, purpose 
and nature), spatially and temporally related in such a close way that an outside observer would consider 
them as one coherent conduct. A sufficient link should not be assumed easily, in order for the supervisory 
authority to avoid infringement of the principles of deterrence and effective enforcement of European law. 
Therefore, these aspects of relations for a sufficient link need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis and 
need to be handled restrictively.  
  

28. 

Example 1a – The same or linked processing operations 
A financial institution requests a credit check from a credit reporting agency (CRA). The financial institution 
receives this information and stores it in its system. 
 
Although the collection and storage of the creditworthiness data by the financial institution each are by 
themselves processing operations, they form a set of processing operations that are carried out by a unitary 
will and are contextually, spatially and temporally related in such a close way that an outside observer 
would consider  them as  one coherent conduct. Therefore,  the processing operations performed by the 
financial institution are to be considered as being “linked” and form the same conduct. 

 

Example 1b – The same or linked processing operations 
A data broker decides to implement a new processing activity as follows: it decides to collect – as a third 
party  –  the  consumer  transaction  history  from  dozens  of  retailers  without  a  legal  basis,  to  perform 
psychometric  analysis  to  predict  future  behavior  of  individuals,  including  political  voting  behavior, 
willingness to quit their job and more. In the same decision the data broker decides to not include this 
procedure in the records of processing activities, not to inform data subjects and to ignore any data subject 
access  requests  related  to  the  new  processing  operations.  The  processing  operations  involved  in  this 
processing  activity  form  a  set  of  processing  operations  that  are  carried  out  by  a  unitary  will  and  are 

 Adopted - version for public consultation 

11 

 

contextually, spatially and temporally related. They are to be considered as being “linked” and forming the 
same conduct. This also includes the failure to register the processing activity in the records, to inform data 
subjects and to establish procedures to give effect to the right of access with regard to the new processing 
operations. These obligations have been infringed for linked processing operations.  

Example 1c – Not the same or linked processing operations 
(i) A building authority performs a background check of a job applicant. The background check also includes 
the political affinity, union membership and sexual orientation. (ii) Five days later, the building authority 
demands from its vendors (sole traders) excessive self-disclosure regarding their business deals with other 
entities,  irrespective  of  any  relevance  to  the  contract  with  or  compliance  obligations  of  the  building 
authority. (iii) Another week later, the building authority suffers a personal data breach. The network of 
the building authority is hacked – despite having adequate technical and organizational measures in place 
– and the hacker gains access to a system that processes personal data of citizens that had filed requests 
with the building authority. Despite the data were adequately encrypted in line with applicable standards, 
the hacker is able to break it with military decryption technology and sells the data in the dark net. The 
building authority refrains from notifying the supervisory authority, despite its obligation to do so. The 
processing operations concerned in this case i.e. the background check, the demands of self-disclosure from 
vendors and the failure to notify a personal data breach, are not contextually related. Therefore, they are 
not to be considered “linked”, but instead form different conducts.  

 

29.  Where it is established that the circumstances of the case form one and the same conduct and give rise to a  
single infringement, the fine can be calculated based on that infringement and its legal maximum. However, 
if the circumstances of the case form one and the same conduct, but this conduct gives rise to not only one, 
but multiple infringements, it must be established whether the attribution of one infringement precludes 
attribution of another infringement (Chapter 3.1.1) or can they be attributed alongside each other (Chapter 
3.1.2). Where the circumstances of the case form multiple conducts, they are to be considered a plurality of 
actions and handled in line with Chapter 3.2. 

3.1.1 - Concurrence of Offences 
The principle of concurrence of offences (also referred to as “apparent concurrence”6 or “false concurrence”) 
applies wherever the application of one provision precludes or subsumes the applicability of the other. In 
other words, concurrence occurs already on the abstract level of statutory provisions. This could either be 
on grounds of the principle of specialty7, subsidiarity or consumption, which often apply where provisions 
protect the same legal interest. In such cases, it would be unlawful to sanction the offender for the same 
wrongdoing twice8. 

In such a case of concurrence of offences, the amount of the fine should be calculated only on the basis of 
the infringement selected according to above rules (superseding infringement)”9.

The principle of specialty (specialia generalibus derogant) is a legal principle that means that more specific 
provision (derived from the same legal  act  or different legal acts of  the same force) supersedes a more 
general  provision,  although  both  pursue  the  same  objective.  The  more  specific  infringement  then  is 
sometimes considered a “qualified type” to the less specific one. Qualified type of infringement might subject 
to a higher tier of fine, higher legal maximum or more extensive period of limitation.  
 

33.  However, sometimes by way of interpretation specialty can also apply, where for reasons of nature and 
systematics one infringement is considered a qualification of an apparently more specific one, although its 
wording alone does not explicitly name an additional element. 
 

34.  Where instead two provisions pursue autonomous objectives, this constitutes a differentiating factor that 
justifies the imposition of separate fines. For example, if an infringement of one provision automatically 
results in an infringement of the other, but the converse is not true, these infringements pursue autonomous 
objectives. 
 
These  principles  of  specialty  can  only  apply,  if  and  as  far  as  the  objectives  pursued  by  the  concerned 
infringements are actually congruent in the individual case. As the data protection principles in Article 5 GDPR 
are established as overarching concepts, there can be situations where other provisions are a concretization 
of such principle, but not circumscribing the principle in its entirety. In other words, a provision does not 
always define the full scope of the principle.11 Therefore, depending on the circumstances12, in some cases 
they overlap in a congruent way and one infringement might supersede the other, while in other cases the 
overlap  is  only  partial  and  therefore  not  fully  congruent.  As  far  as  they  are  not  congruent,  there  is  no 
concurrence of offences. Instead, they can be applied alongside each other, when calculating the fine.

Principle of subsidiarity 
 
Another form of concurrence of offences is often referred to as the principle of subsidiarity. It applies were 
one infringement is considered subsidiary to another infringement. This could be either because the law 
formally declares subsidiarity or because subsidiarity is given for material reasons. The latter can be the case 
where the infringements have the same objective, but one contains a lesser accusation of immorality or 
wrongdoing (e.g. an administrative offence can be subsidiary to criminal offence, etc.).  
 
Principle of consumption 
 
The principle of consumption applies in cases where the infringement of one provision regularly leads to the 
infringement of the other, often because one infringement is a preliminary step to the other.  
 

3.1.2 - Unity of action - Article 83(3) GDPR 
Similar to the situation of concurrence of offences the principle of unity of action (also referred to as “ideal 
concurrence”)  applies  in  cases  where  one  conduct  is  caught  by  several  statutory  provisions,  with  the 
difference that one provision is neither precluded nor subsumed by the applicability of the other, because 
they do not fall in scope of the principles of specialty, subsidiarity or consumption and mostly pursue different 
objectives.

The principle of unity of action was further specified on the level of secondary law in Article 83(3) GDPR in 
form  of  a  “unity  of  processing”.  It  is  important  to  understand  that  Article  83(3)  GDPR  is  limited  in  its 
application and will not apply to every single case in which multiple infringements are found to have occurred, 
but  only  to  those  cases  where  multiple  infringements  have  arisen  from  “the  same  or  linked  processing 
operations” as explained above13. 
 
If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringed 
several provisions of GDPR, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified 
for the gravest infringement (Article 83(3) GDPR). 
 
In some special cases a unity of action might also be assumed, where a single action infringes the same 
statutory provision several times. This could be particularly the case, where circumstances form an iterative 
and congeneric infringement of the same statutory provision in a close spatial and temporal succession. 
 
Example 2 – Unity of action 
A controller sends bundles of marketing e-mails to groups of data subjects in different waves during the course 
of one day without having a legal ground and thereby infringes Article 6(1) GDPR with one unity of action 
several times.  
 
The wording in Article 83(3) GDPR does not seem to directly cover this latter case of a unity of action, since 
“several provisions” are not infringed. However, it would constitute unequal and unfair treatment, if an 
offender that by one action infringes different provisions that pursue different objectives would be privileged 
against an offender that infringes with the same action the same provision   that pursues the same objective 
multiple times. To avoid inconsistency of legal principle and in order to comply with the fundamental right 
on equal treatment in the Charter, in such cases Article 83(3) GDPR shall be applied mutatis mutandis.   
 
In case of a unity of action the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified 
for the gravest infringement. As regards the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, the EDPB points out that 
the effet utile principle requires all institutions to give full force and effect to EU law.14 In this regard Article 
83(3) GDPR must not be interpreted in a manner where it would not matter if an offender committed one or 
numerous infringements of the GDPR when assessing the fine15. 
 
The term “total amount” implies that all the infringements committed have to be taken into account when 
assessing the amount of the fine and the wording “amount specified for the gravest infringement” refers to 
the  legal  maximums  of  fines  (e.g.  Articles  83(4)–(6) GDPR).16 Therefore,  although  the  fine  itself  may  not 
exceed the legal maximum of the highest fining tier, the offender shall still be explicitly found guilty of having 
infringed  several  provisions  and  these  infringements  have  to  be  taken  into  account  when  assessing  the 
amount of the final fine that is to be imposed17. While this is without prejudice to the duty for the supervisory 
authority  imposing  the  fine  to  take  into  account  the  need  for  the  fine  to  be  proportionate,  the  other 
infringements committed cannot be discarded and instead have to be taken into account when calculating 
the fine.

3.2 - Multiple sanctionable conducts  

 

 

The  principle  of  plurality  of  actions  (also  referred  to  as  “Realkonkurrenz”,  “factual  concurrence”  or 
“coincidental  concurrence”)  describes  all  cases  not  caught  by  the  principles  of  concurrence  of  offences 
(Chapter 3.1.1) or Article 83(3) GDPR (Chapter 3.1.2).  
 
The only reason that these infringements are handled in one decision is by having coincidentally come to the 
attention  of  the  supervisory  authority  at  the  same  time  without  being  the  same  or  linked  processing 
operations in the meaning of Article 83(3) GDPR. Therefore, the offender is found to have infringed several 
statutory provisions and separate fines are imposed according to the national procedure either in the same 
fining decision or separate fining decisions. Moreover, since Article 83(3) GDPR does not apply, the total 
amount  of  the  administrative  fine  may  exceed  the  amount  specified  for  the  gravest  infringement 
(argumentum e contrario). Cases of plurality of actions do not pose any reason to privilege the offender with 
regard to the fining calculation. However, this is without prejudice to the obligation to still comply with the 
general principle of proportionality. 

Example 3 – Plurality of action 
After conducting a data protection inspection at the premises of a controller, the supervisory authority finds 
that the controller failed to establish a procedure for review and continued improvement of its website 
security, to provide Article 13 information to employees regarding HR data processing and to inform the 
supervisory  authority  of  a  recent  data  breach  regarding  its  vendor  data.  None  of  the  infringements  is 
precluded or subsumed by way of specialty, subsidiarity or consumption. Also, they do not qualify as the 
same  processing  operation  or  linked  processing  operations:  they  do  not  form  a  unity  of  action,  but  a 
plurality of actions. The supervisory authority therefore will find the controller to have infringed by different 
conducts Articles 13, 32, and 33 GDPR. It will impose in its fining decision individual fines for each, without 
there being a single legal maximum applicable to their sum. 

 

CHAPTER 4 – STARTING POINT FOR CALCULATION 

The EDPB considers that the calculation of administrative fines should commence from a harmonised starting 
point18 .This starting point forms the beginning for further calculation, in which all circumstances of the case 
are  taken  into  account  and  weighted,  resulting  in  the  final  amount  of  the  fine  to  be  imposed  upon  the 
controller or processor.  
 
The  identification  of  harmonised  starting  points  in  these  Guidelines  does  not  and  should  not  preclude 
supervisory authorities from assessing each case on its merits. The fine imposed upon a controller/processor 
can range from any minimum fine until the legal maximum of the fine, provided that this fine is effective, 
dissuasive and proportionate. The existence of a starting point does not prevent the supervisory authority 
from lowering or increasing the fine (up to its maximum) if the circumstances of the case so require.  

 

                                                             
18 Provided that Guidelines leave sufficient room for the tailoring of an administrative fine to the circumstances of the 
case, the Court of Justice generally accepts calculations to commence from an abstract starting point. Particularly in 

joined  cases  C-189/02  P,  C-202/02  P,  C-205/02  P  to  C-208/02  P  and  C‑213/02  P,  Dansk  Rørindustri,  but  also  more

The EDPB considers three elements to form the starting point for further calculation: the categorisation of 
infringements by nature under Articles 83(4)–(6) GDPR, the seriousness of the infringement pursuant to 
Article 83(2) GDPR and the turnover of the undertaking as one relevant element to take into consideration 
with a view to imposing an effective, dissuasive and proportionate fine, pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR. These 
are outlined in Chapter 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 below.  
 

4.1 - Categorisation of infringements under Articles 83(4)–(6) GDPR 
Almost all of the obligations of the controllers and processors according to the Regulation are categorised 
according to their nature in the provisions of Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR.19 The GDPR provides for two categories 
of infringements: infringements punishable under Article 83(4) GDPR on the one hand, and infringements 
punishable under Article 83(5) and (6) GDPR on the other. The first category of infringements is punishable 
by a fine maximum of €10 million or 2% of the undertaking’s annual turnover, whichever is higher, whereas 
the second is punishable by a fine maximum of €20 million or 4% of the undertaking’s annual turnover, 
whichever is higher.  
 

51.  With this distinction, the legislator provided a first indication of the seriousness of the infringement in an 

abstract sense. The more serious the infringement, the higher the fine is likely to be.  

52. 

53. 

54. 

4.2 - Seriousness of the infringement in each individual case 
Additionally, the GDPR provides that due regard should be given to circumstances that qualify the seriousness 
of the infringement in an individual case. More specifically, the GDPR requires the supervisory authority to 
give due regard to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope 
or purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of 
damage suffered by them (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR); the intentional or negligent character of the infringement 
(Article 83(2)(b) GDPR); and the categories of personal data affected by the infringement (Article 83(2)(g) 
GDPR). 
 
The supervisory authority has to review these elements in the light of the circumstances of the specific case 
and has to conclude – on the basis of this analysis – on the degree of seriousness as indicated in paragraph 
61 In this respect, the supervisory authority may also consider whether the data in question was directly 
identifiable below. Even though they are discussed individually in these Guidelines, in reality these elements 
are often intertwined and should be viewed in relation to the facts of the case as a whole.   

4.2.1 - Nature, gravity and duration of the infringement  
Article  83(2)(a)  GDPR  is  broad  in  scope  and  requires  the  supervisory  authority  to  carry  out  a  complete 
examination of all the elements that constitute the infringement and that are suitable to differentiate it from 
other  infringements  of  the  same  kind.  This  assessment  should  therefore  consider  the  following  specific 
elements:  

 
a)  The nature of the infringement, assessed by the concrete circumstances of the case. In that 
sense, this analysis is more specific than abstract classification of Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR. The 
supervisory authority may review the interest that the infringed provision seeks to protect and 
the  place  of  this  provision  in  the  data  protection  framework.  In  addition,  the  supervisory 
authority may consider the degree to which the infringement prohibited the effective application 
of the provision and the fulfilment of the objective it sought to protect.

b)  The gravity of the infringement, assessed on the basis of the specific circumstances. As stated in 
Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, this concerns the nature of the processing, but also the scope, purpose of 
the  processing  concerned  as  well  as  the  number  of  data  subjects  affected  and  the  level  of 
damage suffered by them,” will be indicative of the gravity of the infringement. 

 

 

i.  The  nature  of  the  processing,  including  the  context  in  which  the  processing  is 
functionally  based  (e.g.  business  activity,  non-profit,  political  party,  etc.)  and  all  the 
characteristics of the processing.20 When the nature of processing entails higher risks, 
e.g. where the purpose is to monitor, evaluate personal aspects or to take decisions or 
measures with negative effects for the data subjects, depending on the context of the 
processing and the role of the controller or processor, the supervisory authority may 
consider to attribute more weight to this factor. Further, a supervisory authority may 
attribute more weight to this factor when there is a clear imbalance between the data 
subjects  and  the  controller  (e.g.  when  the  data  subjects  are  employees,  pupils  or 
patients) or the processing involves vulnerable data subjects, in particular children. 

ii.  The scope of the processing, with reference to the local, national or cross-border scope 
of the processing carried out  and  the relationship between  this information  and  the 
actual  extent    of  the  processing  in  terms  of  the  allocation  of  resources  by  the  data 
controller. This element highlights a real risk factor, linked to the greater difficulty for 
the data subject and the supervisory authority to curb unlawful conduct as the scope of 
the processing increases. The larger the scope of the processing, the more weight the 
supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. 

iii.  The purpose of the processing, will lead the supervisory authority  to attribute more 
weight to this factor. The supervisory authority may also consider whether the purpose 
falls within the so-called core activities of the controller. The more central the processing 
is to the controller’s or processor’s core activities, the more severe irregularities in this 
processing will be. The supervisory authority may attribute more weight to this factor in 
these circumstances. There may be circumstances though, in which the processing of 
personal data is further removed from the core business of the controller or processor, 
but significantly impacts the evaluation nonetheless (this is the case, for example, of 
processing  concerning  personal  data  of  workers  where  the  infringement  significantly 
affects those workers’ dignity). 

iv.  The number of data subjects concretely but also potentially affected. The higher the 
number  of  data  subjects  involved,  the  more  weight  the  supervisory  authority  may 
attribute to this factor. In many cases it may also be considered that the infringement 
takes  on  "systemic"  connotations  and  can  therefore  affect,  even  at  different  times, 
additional  data  subjects  who  have  not  submitted  complaints  or  reports  to  the 
supervisory authority. The supervisory authority may, depending on the circumstances 
of the case, consider the ratio between the number of data subjects affected and the 

 

  

 

                                                             
20 By way of example, when analysing the element relating to the “nature of the infringement”, the EDPB in its  
Decision  01/2020  on  the  dispute  arisen  on  the  draft  decision  of  the  Irish  Supervisory  Authority  regarding  Twitter 
International Company under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR (hereinafter “Binding Decision 01/2020”) noted that the “processing 
concerned”  involved  communications  by  data  subjects  who  deliberately  chose  to  restrict  the  audience  of  such 
communications,  and  recommended  that  this  aspect  be  taken  into  account  when  evaluating  the  nature  of  the 
processing.

55. 

56. 

total number of data subjects in that context (e.g. the number of citizens, customers or 
employees) in order to assess whether the infringement is of a systemic nature.  

v.  The level of damage suffered and the extent to which the conduct may affect individual 
rights  and  freedoms.  The  reference  to  the  "level"  of  damage  suffered,  therefore,  is 
intended to draw the attention of the supervisory authorities to the damage suffered, or 
likely to have been suffered as a further, separate parameter with respect to the number 
of data subjects involved (for example, in cases where the number of individuals affected 
by  the  unlawful  processing  is  high  but  the  damage  suffered  by  them  is  marginal). 
Following Recital 75 GDPR, the level of damage suffered refers to physical, material or 
non-material damage. The assessment of the damage, in any case, be limited to what is 
functionally necessary to achieve correct evaluation of the level of seriousness of the 
infringement as indicated in paragraph 61 below, without overlapping with the activities 
of judicial authorities as tasked with ascertaining the different forms of individual harm.   

c)  The duration of the infringement, meaning that a supervisory authority may generally attribute 
more weight to an infringement with longer duration. Noting that a given conduct might have 
been illicit also within the previous regulatory framework, thus adding an additional element to 
assess the gravity of the infringement. The longer the duration of the infringement, the more 
weight the supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. If permitted by national law, both 
the period after the GDPR's effective date and the previous period may be taken into account 
when quantifying the fine, taking into account the conditions of that framework. 

 
The  supervisory  authority  may  attribute  weight  to  the  abovementioned  factors,  depending  on  the 
circumstances of the case. If not of particular relevance, they may also be considered as neutral.  

4.2.2 - Intentional or negligent character of the infringement 
In its previous guidance, the EDPB stated that “in general, intent includes both knowledge and wilfulness in 
relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas “unintentional” means that there was no intention to 
cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the 
law.”21 Unintentional in this sense does not equate to non-voluntary.  
 

Example 4 – Illustrations of intent and negligence (from WP253)22 
“Circumstances indicative of intentional breaches might be unlawful processing authorised explicitly 
by the top management hierarchy of the controller, or in spite of advice from the data protection 
officer  or  in  disregard  for  existing  policies,  for  example  obtaining  and  processing  data  about 
employees  at  a  competitor  with  an  intention  to  discredit  that  competitor  in  the  market.  Other 
examples here might be: 
- 

amending personal data to give a misleading (positive) impression about whether targets have 
been met – we have seen this in the context of targets for hospital waiting times, 
the  trade  of  personal  data  for  marketing  purpose  i.e.  selling  data  as  ‘opted  in’  without 
checking/disregarding data subjects’ views about how their data should be used. 

 
Other circumstances, such as failure to read and abide by existing policies, human error, failure to 
check  for  personal  data  in  information  published,  failure  to  apply  technical  updates  in  a  timely 

-

61. 

manner, failure to adopt policies (rather than simply failure to apply them) may be indicative of 
negligence.” 

 
The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) should be assessed taking 
into account the objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case. The EDPB highlighted 
that “it is generally admitted that intentional [infringements], demonstrating contempt for the provisions of 
the law, are more severe than unintentional ones.”23 In case of an intentional infringement, the supervisory 
authority is likely to attribute more weight to this circumstance. Depending on the circumstances of the case, 
the supervisory authority may also attach weight to the degree of negligence. At best, negligence could be 
regarded as neutral.  

4.2.3 - Categories of personal data affected 
Concerning the requirement to take account of the categories of personal data affected (Article 83(2)(g) 
GDPR), the GDPR clearly highlights the types of data that deserve special protection and therefore a stricter 
response in terms of fines. This concerns, at the very least, the types of data covered by Articles 9 and 10 
GDPR, and data outside the scope of these Articles the dissemination of which causes immediate damages 
or distress to the data subject24 (e.g. location data, data on private communication, national identification 
numbers, or financial data, such as transaction overviews or credit card numbers).25 In general, the more of 
such categories of data involved or the more sensitive the data, the more weight the supervisory authority 
may attribute to this factor. 
 
Further, the amount of data regarding each data subject is of relevance, considering that the infringement 
of the right to privacy and protection of personal data increases with the amount of data regarding each data 
subject. 

4.2.4 - Classifying the seriousness of the infringement and identifying the appropriate starting 

amount 

The assessment of the factors above (Chapter 4.2.1–4.2.3) determines the seriousness of the infringement 
as  a  whole.  This  assessment  is  no  mathematical  calculation  in  which  the  abovementioned  factors  are 
considered individually, but rather a thorough evaluation of the concrete circumstances of the case, in which 
all  of  the  abovementioned  factors  are  interlinked.  Therefore,  in  reviewing  the  seriousness  of  the 
infringement, regard should be given to the infringement as a whole.  
 
Based on the evaluation of the factors outlined above, the supervisory authority may find the infringement 
to be of a low, medium or high level of seriousness. These categories are without prejudice to the question 
whether or not a fine can be imposed. 
 

-  When  calculating  the  administrative  fine  for  infringements  of  a  low  level  of  seriousness,  the 
supervisory authority will determine the starting amount for further calculation at a point between 
0 and 10% of the applicable legal maximum.

25 Dissemination of private communications and location data can causes immediate damages or distress to the data 
subject, which has been highlighted by the special protection awarded by the EU Legislator to private communications 
in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Directive 2002/58/EC and by the CJEU for location data in certain 
cases, see joined cases C-511/18, C-512/18 and C-520/18, La Quadrature du Net et al, para. 117 and the case law there 
cited.

-  When calculating the administrative fine for infringements of a medium level of seriousness, the 
supervisory authority will determine the starting amount for further calculation at a point between 
10 and 20% of the applicable legal maximum. 

 
-  When calculating the administrative fine infringements of a high level of seriousness, the supervisory 
authority will determine the starting amount for further calculation at a point between 20 and 100% 
of the applicable legal maximum. 

 
As a general rule, the more severe the infringement within its own category, the higher the starting amount 
is likely to be.  
 
The  ranges  within  which  the  starting  amount  is  determined  remains  under  review  by  the  EDPB  and  its 
members and can be adapted when necessary.   
 

Example 5a – Qualifying the seriousness of an infringement (high level of seriousness) 
After  investigating  numerous  complaints  about  unsolicited  calls  from  customers  of  a  telephone 
company,  the  competent  supervisory  authority  found  that  the  telephone  company  used  contact 
details of its customers for telemarketing purposes without a valid legal basis (infringement of Article 
6 GDPR). In particular, the telephone company had offered the names and registered phone numbers 
of its customers to third parties for marketing purposes. The telephone company did this despite 
advice  against  it  from  the  data  protection  officer,  without  undertaking  any  efforts  to  curb  the 
practice or to offer customers a way of objecting. In fact, the practice had been going on since May 
2018 and was  still ongoing at the time of the investigation. The telephone company in  question 
operated  nationwide  and  the  practice  affected  all  of  its  4  million  customers.  The  supervisory 
authority found that all of these customers had been regularly subjected to unsolicited calls by third 
parties, without any effective means to stop them.  
 
The supervisory authority was tasked with assessing the seriousness of this case. As a starting point, 
the  supervisory  authority  noted  that  an  infringement  of  Article  6  GDPR  is  listed  among  the 
infringements of Article 83(5) GDPR and therefore falls within the higher tier of Article 83 GDPR. 
Secondly,  the  supervisory  authority  assessed  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  In  that  regard,  the 
supervisory authority attributed significant weight to nature of the infringement, as the infringed 
provision (Article 6 GDPR) underpins the legality of the data processing as a whole. Non-compliance 
with  this  provision  removes  the  lawfulness  of  the  processing  as  a  whole.  Also,  the  supervisory 
authority attributed significant weight to the duration of the infringement, which started at the 
entry into force of the GDPR and had not ceased at the time of the investigation. The fact that the 
telephone company operated nationwide increased the weight of the scope of the processing. The 
number  of  data  subjects  involved  was  considered  very  high  (4  million,  offset  against  a  total 
population  of  14  million  people),  while  the  level  of  damage  suffered  by  them  was  considered 
moderate (non-material damage, in the form of nuisance). The latter assessment was made taking 
into account  the categories of data affected (name and phone  number). The  seriousness of  the 
infringement was increased, however, by the fact that the infringement was committed in contrary 
to an advice from the data protection officer and, thus, considered intentional. 
 
Taking  all  the  above  into  account  (serious  nature,  long  duration,  high  number  of  data  subjects, 
nationwide scope, intentional nature, vis-à-vis moderate damage), the supervisory concludes that 
the infringement is considered to be at a high level of seriousness. The supervisory authority will 
determine the starting amount for further calculation at a point between 20 and 100% of the legal 
maximum included in Article 83(5) GDPR.

Example 5b  – Qualifying the seriousness of an infringement (medium level of seriousness) 
A  supervisory  authority  received  a  personal  data  breach  notification  from  a  hospital.  From  this 
notification, it appeared that several staff members had been able to view parts of patients’ health 
files that – based on their department – should not have been accessible to them. The hospital had 
been working on procedures to regulate access to patient files, and had implemented strict measures 
for  restricted  access.  That  entailed  that  staff  from  one  department  could  only  access  medical 
information relevant to that specific department. In addition, the hospital had invested in privacy 
awareness amongst its staff members. However, as it turned out, there were issues concerning the 
monitoring of authorizations. Staff members that transferred between departments were still able 
to gain access to the patient files from their “old” departments and the hospital had no procedures 
in  place  to  match  the  current  position  of  the  staff  member  with  their  authorization.  Internal 
investigation by the hospital showed that at least 150 staff members (out of the 3500) had inaccurate 
authorisations, affecting at least 20,000 of the 95,000 patient files. The hospital could show that in 
at  least  16  instances  staff  members  had  used  their  authorisations  to  view  patient  files.  The 
supervisory authority considers that there has been a breach of Article 32 GDPR.  
 
In assessing the seriousness of the case, the supervisory authority first noted that an infringement of 
Article 32 GDPR is listed among the infringements of Article 83(4) GDPR and therefore falls within 
the lower tier of Article 83 GDPR. Secondly, the supervisory authority assessed the circumstances of 
the case. In that regard, the supervisory authority considered that even though the number of data 
subjects  affected  by  the  breach  was  only  16,  this  could  potentially  have  been  20,000  in  the 
circumstances of the case and even 95,000 given the systemic nature of the issue. Furthermore, the 
supervisory authority categorized the infringement as negligent, but to a low degree, which was 
considered  a  neutral  factor  in  the  circumstances  of  this  particular  case  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
hospital failed to adopt authorization policies where it surely should have done so but had, otherwise, 
taken steps to implement strict measures to restrict access. This evaluation was not impacted by the 
fact that other data protection and security policies were implemented successfully, as the GDPR 
requires. Lastly, the supervisory authority attributed significant weight to the fact that the patient 
files include health data, which are special categories of data according to Article 9 GDPR.  
 
Taking all the above into account (nature of the processing and special categories of data vis-à-vis 
the number of data subjects actually and potentially affected, the supervisory authority concludes 
that the infringement is considered to be at a medium level of seriousness. The supervisory authority 
will determine the starting amount for further calculation at a point between 10 and 20% of the legal 
maximum included in Article 83(4) GDPR. 

Example 5c – Qualifying the seriousness of an infringement (low level of seriousness) 
A supervisory authority has received numerous complaints about the way in which an online store 
handles the right of access of its data subjects. According to the complainants, the handling of their 
access requests has taken between 4 and 6 months, which is outside the timeframe permitted by the 
GDPR. The supervisory authority investigates the complaints and finds that the online store responds 
to access requests a maximum of three months too late in 5% of the cases. In total the store received 
around 1,000 access requests on an annual basis and confirmed that 950 of these were handled on 
time. Moreover, the online store had policies in place to safeguard that all access requests were 
handled correctly and fully. Nevertheless, the supervisory authority concluded that the online store 
infringed Article 12(3) GDPR and decided to impose a fine.

During the calculation of the amount of the fine to be imposed, the supervisory authority was tasked 
with assessing the seriousness of this case. As a starting point, the supervisory authority noted that 
an infringement of Article 12 GDPR is listed among the infringements of Article 83(5) GDPR and 
therefore falls within the higher tier of Article 83 GDPR. Secondly, the supervisory authority assessed 
the circumstances of the case. In that regard, the supervisory authority carefully analysed the nature 
of  the  infringement.  Even  though  the  timely  right  to  access  to  personal  data  is  one  of  the 
cornerstones of the data subject rights, the supervisory authority considered that the infringement 
was of limited seriousness in this respect, given that all requests were handled eventually and with 
a limited delay. Considering the purpose of the processing, the supervisory authority found that the 
processing of personal data was not the core business of the online store, but still an important 
ancillary in fulfilling its objective of selling goods online. The supervisory authority considered this to 
increase the seriousness of the infringement. On the other hand, the level of damage suffered by the 
data subjects was considered minimal, as all access requests were handled within 6 months. 
 
Taking all the above into account (nature of the infringement, purpose of the processing and level of 
damage), the supervisory authority concludes that the infringement is considered to be at a low level 
of seriousness. The supervisory authority will determine the starting amount for further calculation 
at a point between 0 and 10% of the legal maximum included in Article 83(5) GDPR.

4.3 - Turnover of the undertaking with a view to imposing an effective, dissuasive and 

proportionate fine  

The  GDPR  requires  each  supervisory  authority  to  ensure  that  the  imposition  of  administrative  fines  is 
effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case (Article 83(1) GDPR). The application of these 
principles of European Union law can have far-reaching consequences in individual cases, as the starting 
points that the GDPR offers for calculating administrative fines apply to micro-enterprises and multinational 
corporations  alike.  In  order  to  impose  a  fine  that  is  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  in  all  cases, 
supervisory authorities are expected to tailor administrative fines within the entire range available up until 
the legal maximum. This can lead to significant increases or decreases of the amount of the fine, depending 
on the circumstances of the case.  
 
The EDPB considers that it is fair to reflect a distinction of the size of the undertaking in the starting points 
identified below and therefore takes into account its turnover26.However, this does not dismiss a supervisory 
authority from the responsibility to carry out a review of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality at 
the end of the calculation (see Chapter 7). The latter covers all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. 
the  accumulation  of  multiple  infringements,  increases  and  decreases  for  aggravating  and  mitigating 
circumstances and financial/socio-economic circumstances. It is, however, incumbent upon the supervisory 
authority to ensure that the same circumstances are not counted twice. In particular, supervisory authorities 
should not, under Chapter 7, repeat the increases or decreases relative to the turnover of the company, but 
rather revisit their evaluation of the appropriate starting amount. 
 
For  the  reasons  outlined  above,  the  supervisory  authority  may  consider  adjusting  the  starting  amount 
corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement in cases where this infringement is committed by an 
                                                             
26 See also EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paras. 411 and 412: “[Insofar] the turnover of an undertaking is not exclusively 
relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but it may also 
be considered [as one relevant element among others] for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure 
the  fine  is  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  in  accordance  with  Article  83(1)  GDPR.”  The  turnover  of  the 
undertaking concerned is further elaborated on in Chapter 6.2 of these Guidelines.

undertaking with an annual turnover not exceeding 2 million euros, an annual turnover not exceeding 10 
million euros, or an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euros.27. 

 
For undertakings with an annual turnover of ≤ €2m, supervisory authorities may consider to proceed 
calculations on the basis of a sum down to 0.2% of the identified starting amount. 
 
For  undertakings  with  an  annual  turnover  of  ≤  €10m,  supervisory  authorities  may  consider  to 
proceed calculations on the basis of a sum down to 0.4% of the identified starting amount. 

For  undertakings  with  an  annual  turnover  of  ≤  €50m,  supervisory  authorities  may  consider  to 
proceed calculations on the basis of a sum down to 2% of the identified starting amount. 

For the same reasons, the supervisory authority may consider adjusting the starting amount corresponding 
to the seriousness of the infringement in cases where this infringement is committed by an undertaking with 
an annual turnover not exceeding 100 million euros, an annual turnover not exceeding 250 million euros and 
an annual turnover not exceeding 500 million euros28. 
 

For undertakings with an annual turnover of €50m up until €100m, supervisory authorities may 
consider to proceed calculations on the basis of a sum down to 10% of the identified starting amount.

For undertakings with an annual turnover of €100m up until €250m, supervisory authorities may 
consider to proceed calculations on the basis of a sum down to 20% of the identified starting amount.

For undertakings with an annual turnover of €250m or above, supervisory authorities may consider 
to proceed calculations on the basis of a sum down to 50% of the identified starting amount. 

 
As a general rule, the higher the turnover of the undertaking within its applicable tier, the higher the starting 
amount is likely to be. The latter holds particularly true for the largest of undertakings, for which the category 
of starting amounts has the widest range.  
 

69.  Moreover, the supervisory authority is under no obligation to apply this adjustment if it is not necessary from 
the point of view of effectiveness, dissuasiveness and proportionality to adjust the starting amount of the 
fine.  
 
It should be reiterated that these figures are the starting points for further calculation, and not fixed amounts 
(price tags) for infringements of provisions of the GDPR. The supervisory authority has the discretion to utilize 
the full fining range from any minimum fine until the legal maximum, ensuring that the fine is tailored to the 
circumstances of the case, as the Court of Justice requires in case an abstract starting point is used.  
 

70. 

Example 6a – Identifying the starting points for further calculation 
A  supermarket  chain  with  a  turnover  of  €8  billion  has  infringed  Article  12  of  the  GDPR.  The 
supervisory authority, based on a careful analysis of the circumstances of the case, decided that the 
infringement is of a low level of seriousness. To determine the starting point for further calculation, 
the supervisory authority first identifies that Article 12 GDPR is listed in Article 83(5)(b) GDPR and 
                                                             
27 These turnover figures are inspired by the Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of 
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. In determining the starting points, the EDPB relies on the annual turnover 
of the undertaking alone (see Chapter 6 below). 
28 These figures are added to bridge the gap between the highest threshold of the previous paragraph and the turnover 
threshold identified in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR.

that,  based  on  the  turnover  of  the  undertaking  (€8  billion),  a  legal  maximum  of  €320,000,000,- 
applies. 
 
Based on the level of seriousness determined by the supervisory authority (low), a starting amount 
between €0,- and €32,000,000,- should be considered (between 0 and 10% of the applicable legal 
maximum,  see  paragraph  61  above).  Based  on  the  turnover  of  the  undertaking  (€8  billion),  the 
supervisory authority may consider to further reduce this amount to 50% of the identified starting 
amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement. 
 
The supervisory authority considers that – due to the relatively low seriousness of the infringement, 
offset against the relatively high turnover of the undertaking – a starting amount of €25,000,000,- 
is  considered  effective,  dissuasive  and  proportionate.  This  amount  forms  the  basis  for  further 
calculation, which should result in a final amount not exceeding the applicable legal maximum of 
€320,000,000,-.  

Example 6b – Identifying the starting points for further calculation 
A start-up dating app with a turnover of €500,000,- is discovered to have sold sensitive personal data 
of its customers to several data brokers for analytics and thereby infringed Articles 9 and 5(1)(a) of 
the GDPR. The supervisory authority, based on a careful analysis of the circumstances of the case, 
decided that the infringement is of a high level of seriousness. To determine the starting point for 
further calculation, the supervisory authority first identifies that Articles 9 and 5 GDPR are listed in 
Article  83(5)(a)  GDPR  and  that,  based  on  the  turnover  of  the  undertaking  (€500,000,-),  a  legal 
maximum of €20,000,000,- applies. 
 
Based on the level of seriousness determined by the supervisory authority (high), a starting amount 
between  €4,000,000,-  and  €20,000,000,-  should  be  considered  (between  20  and  100%  of  the 
applicable  legal  maximum,  see  paragraph  61  above).  Based  on  the  turnover  of  the  undertaking 
(€500,000,-), the supervisory authority may consider to further reduce this amount to 0.2% of the 
identified starting amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement. 
 
The supervisory authority considers that – due to the high level of seriousness of the infringement – 
a  starting  amount  of  €16,000,- 
is  considered  effective,  dissuasive  and  proportionate, 
notwithstanding  the  low  turnover  of  the  undertaking.  This  amount  forms  the  basis  for  further 
calculation, which should result in a final amount not exceeding the applicable maximum of €20 
million.

CHAPTER 5 – AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES  

71. 

5.1 - Identification of aggravating and mitigating factors  
Following  the  structure  of  the  GDPR,  after  having  evaluated  the  nature,  gravity  and  duration  of  the 
infringement  as  well  as  its  intentional  or  negligent  character  of  the  infringement  and  the  categories  of 
personal  data  affected,  the  supervisory  authority  must  take  account  of  the  remaining  aggravating  and 
mitigating factors as listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.  
 

72.  With regard to the assessment of these elements, increases or decreases of a fine cannot be predetermined 
through tables or percentages. It is reiterated that the actual quantification of the fine will depend on all the 
elements  collected  during  the  course  of  the  investigation  and  on  further  considerations  also  linked  to 
previous fining experiences of the supervisory authority.  
 
For clarity, it should be noticed noted that each criterion of Article 83(2) GDPR – whether it is assessed under 
Chapter 4 or this Chapter – should only be taken into account once as part of the overall assessment of Article 
83(2) GDPR.

5.2 - Actions taken by controller or processor to mitigate damage suffered by data subjects  
A  first  step  in  determining  whether  aggravating  or  mitigating  circumstances  have  occurred,  is  to  review 
Articles 83(2)(c), which concerns “any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage 
suffered by data subjects.” 
 
As recalled in Guidelines WP253, data controllers and processors are already obliged to “implement technical 
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, to carry out data protection 
impact assessments and mitigate risks arising from the processing of personal data to the rights and freedoms 
of the individuals.” However, in case of an infringement, the controller or processor should “do whatever 
they can do in order to reduce the consequences of the breach for the individual(s) concerned.”29. 
 
The  adoption  of  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the  damage  suffered  by  the  data  subjects  may  be 
considered a mitigating factor, decreasing the amount of the fine.  
 
The measures adopted must be assessed, in particular, with regard to the element of timeliness, i.e. the time 
when they are implemented by the controller or processor, and their effectiveness. In that sense, measures 
spontaneously  implemented  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  supervisory  authority’s  investigation 
becoming known to the controller or processor are more likely to be considered a mitigating factor, than 
measures that have been implemented after that moment.  

5.3 - Degree of responsibility of the controller or processor 
Following Article 83(2)(d), the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor will have to be assessed, 
taking  into  account  measures  implemented  by  them  pursuant  to  Articles  25  and  32  GDPR.  In  line  with 
Guidelines WP253, “the question that the supervisory authority must then answer is to what extent the 
controller “did what it could be expected to do” given the nature, the purposes or the size of the processing, 
seen in light of the obligations imposed on them by the Regulation.”30

79. 

80. 

81. 

83. 

84. 

In particular, with regard to this criterion, the residual risk for the freedoms and rights of the data subjects, 
the impairment caused to the data subjects and the damage persisting after the adoption of the measures 
by the controller as well as the degree of robustness of the measures adopted pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 
GDPR must be assessed.  
 
In  this  respect,  the  supervisory  authority  may  also  consider  whether  the  data  in  question  was  directly 
identifiable and/or available without technical protection31. However, it should be borne in mind that the 
existence of such protection does not necessarily constitute a mitigating factor (see paragraph 82 below). 
This depends on all the circumstances of the case.  
 
In order to adequately assess the above elements, the supervisory authority should take into account any 
relevant documentation provided by the controller or processor, e.g. in the context of the exercise of their 
right of defence. In particular, such documentation could provide evidence of when the measures were taken 
and how they were implemented, whether there were interactions between the controller and the processor 
(if applicable), or whether there has been contact with the DPO or data subjects (if applicable).  
 

82.  Given the increased level of accountability under the GDPR in comparison with Directive 95/46/EC,32 it is 
likely that the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor will be considered an aggravating or a 
neutral factor. Only in exceptional circumstances, where the controller or processor has gone above and 
beyond the obligations imposed upon them, will this be considered a mitigating factor.  
 

5.4 - Previous infringements by the controller or processor 
According  to  Article  83(2)(e)  GDPR,  any  relevant  previous  infringements  committed  by  the  controller  or 
processor must be considered when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the 
amount of the administrative fine. Similar wording is found in Recital 148 GDPR.  

5.4.1 - Time frame 
Firstly, regard must be given to the point in time when the prior infringement took place, considering that 
the longer the time between a previous infringement and the infringement currently being investigated, the 
lower its significance. Consequently, the longer ago the infringement was committed, the less relevance shall 
be given by the supervisory authorities. This assessment is left at the discretion of the supervisory authority, 
subject to applicable national- and European law and principles. 
 

85.  However, since infringements committed a long time ago might still be of interest when assessing the “track 
record” of the controller or processor, fixed limitation periods are not to be set to this purpose. However, 
some national laws do prevent the supervisory authority from considering previous infringements after a 
settled period. Likewise, certain national laws impose a record deletion obligation after a certain period of 
time, which prevents the acting supervisory authorities from taking into account these precedents.  
 
For the same reason, it should be noted that infringements of the GDPR, since they will be more recent, must 
be  considered  as  more  relevant  than  infringements  of  the  national  provisions  adopted  for  the 
implementation of Directive 95/46/EC (if national laws allow such infringements to be taken into account by 
the supervisory authority). 

86.

89. 

5.4.2 - Subject matter 
For the purpose of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, previous infringements of either the same or  different subject 
matter to the one being investigated might be considered as “relevant”.  
 
Even though all prior infringements might provide an indication about the controller’s or processor’s general 
attitude towards the observance of the GDPR, infringements of the same subject matter must be given more 
significance,  as  they  are  closer  to  the  infringement  currently  under  investigation,  especially  when  the 
controller or processor previously committed the same infringement (repeated infringements). Thus, same 
subject-matter infringements must be considered as more relevant than previous infringements concerning 
a different topic.  
 
For example, the fact that the controller or the processor had failed in the past to respond to data subjects 
exercising their rights in a timely manner must be considered more relevant when the infringement being 
investigated refers also to a lack of response to a data subject exercising their rights than when it refers to a 
personal data breach. 
 

90.  However, due account must be taken of previous infringements of a different subject matter, but that were 
committed in the same manner, as they might be indicative of persisting problems within the controller or 
processor organization. For example, this would be the case for infringements arising as a consequence of 
having ignored the advice provided by the Data Protection Officer.  

91. 

5.4.3 - Other considerations 
If considering a previous infringement of the national provisions adopted for the implementation of the 
Directive 95/46/EC, the supervisory authorities must take into account the fact that the requirements in the 
Directive and the GDPR might differ (if national laws allow such infringements to be taken into account by 
the supervisory authority).  
 

93. 

92.  When considering the relevance of a previous infringement, the supervisory authority should take account 
of  the  status  of  the  procedure  in  which  the  previous  infringement  was  established  –  particularly  of  any 
measures taken by the supervisory authority or by the judicial authority – in accordance with national law.  
 
Previous infringements could also be considered when they were found by a different supervisory authority 
concerning  the  same  controller/processor.  For  example,  the  lead  supervisory  authority  dealing  with  an 
infringement through the cooperation (one-stop-shop) mechanism in accordance with Article 60 GDPR could 
take  into  account  infringements  previously  determined  in  local  cases,  by  another  supervisory  authority, 
concerning  the  same  controller/processor.  Likewise,  infringements  previously  determined  by  the  lead 
supervisory authority could be taken into account when a different authority must handle a complaint lodged 
with it in cases with only local impacts under Article 56(2) GDPR. Where there is no lead supervisory authority 
(for  example,  in  case  the  controller  or  processor  is  not  established  in  the  European  Union),  supervisory 
authorities  could  also  take  into  account  infringements  previously  determined  by  another  supervisory 
authority concerning the same controller/processor. 
 
The existence of previous infringements can be considered an aggravating factor in the calculation of the 
fine. The weight given to this factor is to be determined in view of the nature and frequency of the previous 
infringements.  The  absence  of  any  previous  infringements,  however,  cannot  be  considered  a  mitigating 
factor, as compliance with the GDPR is the norm. If there are no previous infringements, this factor can be 
regarded as neutral.

5.5 - Degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the 

infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement 

95. 

96. 

Article  83(2)(f)  requires  the  supervisory  authority  to  take  account  of  the  degree  of  the  controller’s  or 
processor’s cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the 
possible adverse effects of the infringement. 
 
Before  further  assessing  the  level  of  cooperation  the  controller  or  processor  has  established  with  the 
supervisory  authority,  it  must  be  reiterated  that  a  general  obligation  to  cooperate  is  incumbent  on  the 
controller and  the processor pursuant to Article 31 GDPR, and that lack of cooperation may lead  to  the 
application  of  the  fine  provided  for  in  Article  83(4)(a)  GDPR.  It  should  therefore  be  considered  that  the 
ordinary duty of cooperation is mandatory and should therefore be considered neutral (and not a mitigating 
factor).  
 

97.  However,  where  cooperation  with  the  supervisory  authority  has  had  the  effect  of  limiting  or  avoiding 
negative consequences for the rights of the individuals that might otherwise have occurred, the supervisory 
authority may consider this a mitigating factor in the sense of Article 83(2)(f) GDPR, thereby decreasing the 
amount of the fine. This may for instance be the case when a controller or processor “has responded in a 
particular manner to the supervisory authority’s requests during the investigation phase in that specific case 
which has significantly limited the impact on individuals’ rights as a result”33. 
 

98. 

5.6 - The manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority 
Following Article 83(2)(h), the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority 
could be a relevant aggravating or mitigating factor. In assessing this, particular weight can be given to the 
question whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement out of its 
own motion, before the infringement was known to the supervisory authority by – for instance – a complaint 
or an investigation. This circumstance is not relevant when the controller is subject to specific notification 
obligations  (such  as  in  the  case  of  personal  data  breaches  according  to  Article  33 34).  In  such  cases,  this 
notification should be considered as neutral35. 
 

99.  Where the infringement became known  to  the supervisory authority by, for instance, a complaint or  an 
investigation this element should also, as a rule, be considered as neutral. The supervisory authority may 
consider this a mitigating circumstance if the controller or processor notified the infringement out of its own 
motion, prior to the supervisory authority’s knowledge of the case.   
 

5.7 - Compliance with measures previously ordered with regard to the same subject matter 
100.  Article 83(2)(i) GDPR states that “where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered 
against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those 
measures” must be considered when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on its 
amount.

101.  As opposed to Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, this assessment only refers to measures that supervisory authorities 
themselves  have  previously  issued  to  the  same  controller  or  processor  with  regard  to  the  same  subject 
matter36. 
 
In  this  respect,  the  controller  or  processor  might  hold  reasonable  expectations  that  compliance  with 
measures previously issued against them would prevent a same subject-matter infringement from taking 
place in the future. However, since compliance with measures previously ordered is mandatory for the data 
controller or processor, it should not be taken into account as a mitigating factor per se. On the contrary, a 
reinforced commitment on the part of the controller or processor in the fulfilment of previous measures is 
required for this factor to apply as mitigating, e.g. taking additional measures beyond those ordered by the 
supervisory authority. 

103.  Conversely, non-compliance with a corrective power previously ordered may be considered either as  an 
aggravating factor, or as a different infringement in itself, pursuant to Article 83(5)(e) and Article 83(6) GDPR. 
Therefore, due note should be taken that the same non-compliant behaviour cannot lead to a situation where 
it is punished twice.  
 

5.8 - Adherence to approved codes of conduct or approved certification mechanisms 

104.  Article 83(2)(j) GDPR states that adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR or approved 
certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42 GDPR may be a relevant factor in deciding whether to impose 
a fine, and the amount of the administrative fine.  

105.  As recalled by Guidelines WP253, adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR or approved 
certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42 GDPR may in some circumstances constitute a mitigating 
factor. Approved codes of conduct will, according to Article 40(4) GDPR, contain “mechanisms which enable 
the (monitoring) body to carry out mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions.” Certain forms 
of sanctioning non-compliant behaviour may be made through the monitoring scheme, according to Article 
41(4)  GDPR,  including  suspension  or  exclusion  of  the  controller  or  processor  concerned  from  the  code 
community.  Although  the  supervisory  authority  can  take  into  account  previously  imposed  sanctions 
pertaining to the self-regulatory scheme, the powers of the monitoring body are “without prejudice to the 
tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority”, which means that the supervisory authority is not 
under an obligation to take into account any sanctions by the monitoring body37. 

 

 

 

106.  On the other hand, if failure to comply with the codes of conduct or certification is directly relevant to the 

infringement, the supervisory authority may consider this an aggravating circumstance. 
 

5.9 - Other aggravating and mitigating circumstances 

107.  Article 83(2)(k) GDPR gives the supervisory authority room to take into account any other aggravating or 
mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case. In the individual case there may be many 
elements involved, which cannot all be codified or listed and which will have to be taken into account in order 
to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.

108.  Article 83(2)(k) GDPR mentions examples of “any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the 
circumstances of the case,” i.e. financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the 
infringement. It is considered that this provision is of fundamental importance for adjusting the amount of 
the fine to the specific case. In this sense, it is considered that it should be interpreted as an instance of the 
principle of fairness and justice applied to the individual case.  
 

109.  The scope of this provision, which is necessarily open-ended, should include all the reasoned considerations 
regarding the socio-economic context in which the controller or processor operates, those relating to the 
legal context and those concerning the market context. 
 
In particular, economic gain from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides 
information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR.  
 

111.  Exceptional circumstances that can lead to significant changes in the socio-economic context (e.g. the onset 
of a serious pandemic emergency that could radically change the way processing of personal data is carried 
out) could also be considered under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. 
 

110. 

NB: The examples in this Chapter are illustrations of the effect that aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances may have on the amount of the fine. The increases or decreases mentioned in these 
imaginary cases cannot be considered precedents or indications of percentages to be used in real 
life cases. 
 
Example 7a – Weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
A  sports  club  used  cameras  with  facial  recognition  technology  at  the  entrance  of  one  of  their 
locations  for  the  purpose  of  identifying  their  clients  upon  entry.  As  the  sports  club  did  so  in 
contravention  of  Article  9  GDPR  (processing  of  biometric  data  without  a  valid  exception),  the 
supervisory authority competent to investigate the infringement decided to impose a fine. Taking 
into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, the supervisory authority considered this an 
infringement with a high level of seriousness, and since the sports club had an annual turnover of 
€150 million, a starting amount of €2,000,000,- (at the very top of the category) was considered 
appropriate.  
 
However, the same sports club was fined two years earlier for using fingerprint technology at the 
turnstiles in another location. The supervisory authority decided to take this into account as a repeat 
offence (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR). In doing so, it attributed weight to the fact that this concerned nearly 
the same subject matter and the infringement was committed only two years prior. Because of this 
aggravating factor, the supervisory authority decided to increase the fine in this particular case to 
€2,600,000,-,38 not exceeding the applicable legal maximum of €20 million.

38 This illustrates that the categories for starting amounts do not limit the supervisory authorities’ abilities to take into 
account aggravating and mitigating circumstances to an amount above  or below the categories.  As is reiterated in 
Chapter  4.4,  these  figures  are  the  starting  points  for  further  calculation,  and  not  fixed  amounts  (price  tags)  for 
infringements of provisions of the GDPR. The supervisory authority retains the discretion to utilize the full fining range 
from a point above €0,- until the legal maximum, ensuring that the fine is tailored to the circumstances of the case.

Example 7b – Weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
The operator of a short-term car rental platform suffered a data breach, causing the personal data 
of its clients to have been vulnerable for a short amount of time. Taking into account all the relevant 
circumstances of the case, the supervisory authority considered the shortcomings of the operator in 
securing its platform to infringe Article 32 GDPR, to be an infringement of a low level of seriousness, 
and since the operator had an annual turnover of €255 million, a starting amount of €260,000,- was 
considered appropriate.  
 
The compromised personal data included copies of drivers’ licences and ID’s. For that reason, all 
clients that suffered from the data breach were forced to reapply for these documents in order to 
limit the possibility of identity theft. While informing the data subjects of this incident, the operator 
offered  all  data  subjects  assistance  in  reapplying  for  these  documents  with  the  correct  public 
institutions and created a system to reimburse any fees paid for the application. The supervisory 
considered this as ‘actions to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects’ (Article 83(2)(c) GDPR), 
which had a mitigating effect on the fine. Given the proactive attitude and the effectiveness of the 
measures taken by the operator, the supervisory authority decided to lower the fine to €225,000,-,39 
again not exceeding the legal maximum of €10 million.

Example 7c – Weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
A  small  credit  rating  agency  was  found  to  have  infringed  several  provisions  safeguarding  data 
subject rights, most notably because it charged its clients a fee for exercising their right to access. 
The agency did so for all access requests, not just those mentioned in Article 12(5)(a) GDPR. Taking 
into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, the supervisory authority considered the 
infringements found to be of a high level of seriousness, and since the agency had an annual turnover 
of €35 million, a starting amount of €100,000,- was considered appropriate. 
 
However, the supervisory authority considered the fact that the agency was able to profit from the 
infringement an aggravating circumstance (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. With a view to counterbalancing 
the gains from the infringement, while maintaining an effective, dissuasive and proportionate fine 
in this case, the supervisory authority decided to increase the fine to €130,000,-, not exceeding the 
applicable legal maximum of €20 million.

Considering  all  the  relevant  circumstances  of  the  case,  the  supervisory  authority  considered  the 
infringements found to be of a medium level of seriousness, and since the company had an annual 
turnover of €45 million, a starting amount of €150,000, - was considered appropriate. 
 
Moreover,  the  authority  considered  that  this  was  an  infringement  that  benefited  the  controller 
because the fact of not having collected the consent of the people for the transmission of their data 
for the purpose of sending targeting advertising increased the mass of data that it has been able to 
resell afterwards. Thus, the supervisory authority considered the fact that the agency was able to 
profit from the infringement an aggravating circumstance (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR).  
 
With a view to counterbalancing the gains from the infringement, while maintaining an effective, 
dissuasive and proportionate fine in this case, the supervisory authority decided to increase the fine 
to €200,000, not exceeding the applicable legal maximum of €20 million. 

CHAPTER 6 – LEGAL MAXIMUM AND CORPORATE LIABILITY 

6.1 - Determining the Legal Maximum 

112.  As already outlined in the Guidelines WP253, the GDPR does not tag fixed sums to specific infringements. 
Instead, the GDPR provides for overall maximum amounts40 and thereby follows the general tradition of EU 
law on sanctions already established by other legal acts41.  
 

113.  The amounts in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR constitute the legal maximum and prohibit the supervisory authorities 
from imposing fines that in their outcome exceed the applicable maximum amounts. In order to determine 
the  correct  legal  maximum,  Article  83(3)  GDPR  needs  to  be  taken  into  account 42, where  applicable  (see 
Chapter 3.1.2). Each supervisory authority therefore has to ensure that these maximum amounts are not 
exceeded  when  calculating  fines  based  on  these  Guidelines.  Depending  on  the  individual  case,  different 
maximum amounts may become relevant. 
 

6.1.1 - Static maximum amounts 

114.  Article  83(4)–(6)  GDPR  provide  for  static  amounts  as  a  rule  and  differentiate  between  infringements  of 
different categories of obligations under the GDPR. As explained above Article 83(4) GDPR allows for fines up 
to €10 million for infringing the obligations outlined therein, while Article 83(5) and (6) GDPR allow for fines 
up to €20 million for infringing the obligations outlined in them. 

                                                             
40 Recital 150 GDPR, second sentence: “This Regulation should indicate infringements and the upper limit and criteria 
for setting the related administrative fines, which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each 
individual case, taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to 
the  nature,  gravity  and  duration  of  the  infringement  and  of  its  consequences  and  the  measures  taken  to  ensure 
compliance  with  the  obligations  under  this  Regulation  and  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the  consequences  of  the 
infringement.”

competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.

115. 

6.1.2 - Dynamic maximum amounts 
In case of an undertaking43 the fining range may shift towards a higher turnover-based44 maximum amount. 
This turnover-based maximum amount is dynamic and individualized towards the respective undertaking in 
order to achieve the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence.   
 

116.  More specifically, Article 83(4) GDPR allows for a maximum amount of 2% and Article 83(5) and (6) for a 
maximum  amount  of  4%  of  the  undertaking’s  total  annual  turnover  of  the  previous  financial  year.  The 
wording of the GDPR requires consideration of the static maximum amount or the dynamic turnover-based 
maximum  amount,  “whichever  is  higher”.  Consequently,  these  turnover-based  maximum  amounts  only 
apply if they exceed the static maximum in the individual case. That is the case when the undertaking’s total 
annual turnover of the previous financial year amounts to more than €500 million.45. 
 

Example 8a – Dynamic maximum 
A credit reporting agency (CRA) collects and sells all creditworthiness data of all EU citizens to advertising 
and retailing companies without a legal basis. The CRA’s annual worldwide turnover of the preceding year 
amounts  to  €3  billion.  Here,  the  CRA  infringed  inter  alia  Article  6,  which  can  be  punished  with  a  fine 
pursuant to Article 83(5) GDPR. The static maximum would amount to €20 million. The dynamic maximum 
would amount to €120 million (4% of €3 billion). The fine can amount up to €120 million as this dynamic 
maximum is higher than the static maximum of €20 million. As a consequence, the fine is allowed to exceed 
the static maximum of €20 million, but must not exceed the applicable legal maximum of €120 million.  

 

 

Example 8b – Static maximum 
A retailer of sunglasses operates an online shop, which allows customers to place their orders. By way of 
the order form the retailer processes also personal data, including bank account details. The retailer fails 
to provide for a proper https transport encryption so that third parties are potentially able to intercept the 
personal data during the transaction. The retailer infringes Article 32(1) GDPR and can be fined pursuant 
to Article 83(4) GDPR. The retailer’s annual worldwide turnover of the preceding year amounts to €450 
million. In this case the static maximum of €10 million is higher than the dynamic maximum of €9 million 
(=2% of €450 million), so that the maximum of €10 million takes precedence. Therefore, the fine must not 
exceed the legal maximum of €10 million.  

Example 8c – Controllers and processors that are not an undertaking 
A municipality has an online system that allows its citizens to register for appointments, such as to apply 
for  a  passport  or  a  marriage  license.  The  municipality  is  the  sole  controller  for  this  online  system. 
Unfortunately, it is found that the system also transmits on a permanent basis the collected data to external 
servers of a processor in an inadequate third country, where they are stored. No adequate safeguards are 
put in place with regard to the third country transfer. Except for the transfer, the data are collected and 
processed on the basis of valid consent. The municipality infringed Article 44 GDPR by transferring special 
categories of personal data into an inadequate third country without appropriate safeguards. Therefore, it 
can be fined pursuant to Article 83(5). As the municipality does not meet the definition of an undertaking 
the static legal maximum applies, so that the fine must not exceed €20 million. However, this is only the 
case if the Member State in which this municipality is located has not laid down specific rules on whether 
and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in 
that Member State (Article 83(7) GDPR).

44 As for the term ”turnover“, please note Chapter 6.2.2 of these Guidelines. 
45 2% of 500 million amounts to 10 million (the static maximum amount envisaged in Article 83(4) GDPR) and 4% of 
500 million amounts to 20 million (the static maximum amount envisaged in Article 83(5) GDPR).

6.2 - Determining the undertaking’s turnover and corporate liability 
In order to determine the correct turnover for the dynamic legal maximum, it is important to understand the 
concepts of undertaking and turnover as used in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR. In this regard, utmost consideration 
must  be  given  to  the  recitals  of  the  GDPR,  provided  by  the  European  legislator  for  guidance  on  GDPR 
interpretation. 

6.2.1 - Determining an undertaking and corporate liability 

118.  As for the term “undertaking”, the European legislator provides explicit further clarification. Recital 150 GDPR 
states: “Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to 
be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes.”  

119.  Therefore, Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR in light of recital 150 relies on the concept of undertaking in accordance 
with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU,46 without prejudice to Article 4(18) GDPR (which gives a definition of an 
enterprise) and Article 4(19) GDPR (which defines a group of undertakings). The former concept is mainly 
used in Chapter V GDPR, in the phrase group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity. Besides that, 
the term is applied in a general sense, not as the addressee of a provision or obligation.   

120.  Accordingly, in cases where the controller or processor is (part of) an undertaking in the sense of Articles 101 
and 102 TFEU, the combined turnover of such undertaking as a whole can be used to determine the dynamic 
upper limit of the fine (see Chapter 6.2.2), and to ensure that the resulting fine is in line with the principles 
of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1) GDPR)47. 

121.  The  Court  of  Justice  has  developed  a  vast  body  of  case  law  on  the  concept  of  undertaking.  The  term 
‘undertaking’ “encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of the legal status of 
the entity and the way in which it is financed.”48 For the purpose of competition law, "undertakings” are 
therefore identified with economic units rather than legal units. Different companies belonging to the same 
group can form an economic unit and therefore an undertaking within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 
TFEU49. 

 

 

 

 

122. 

In line with settled CJEU case law the term undertaking in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU can refer to a single 
economic unit (SEU), even if that economic unit consists of several natural or legal persons. Whether several 
entities form a SEU depends largely on whether the individual entity is free in its decision-making ability or 
whether a leading  entity, namely the parent company, exercises decisive influence over the others. The 
criteria for determining this are based on the economic, legal and organizational links between the parent 
company and its subsidiary, for example, the amount of the participation, personnel or organizational ties, 
instructions and the existence of company contracts50.

124. 

In line with the SEU doctrine, Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR follow the principle of direct corporate liability, which 
entails that all acts performed or neglected by natural persons authorized to act on behalf of undertakings 
are  attributable  to  the  latter  and  are  considered  as  an  act  and  infringement  directly  committed  by  the 
undertaking itself.51 The fact that certain employees did not comply with a code of conduct is not sufficient 
to disrupt this attribution52. Rather it is only disrupted where the natural person acts solely for its own private 
purposes or for purposes of a third party, thereby becoming itself a separate controller (i.e. the natural 
person  has  acted  in  excess  of  their  permitted  remit) 53.  This  European  Union  law  principle  and  scope  of 
corporate  liability  takes  precedence  and  must  not  be  undermined  by  limiting  it  to  the  acts  of  certain 
functionaries (like principal managers) by contradicting national law. It is not relevant which natural person 
acted on behalf of which of the entities. The supervisory authority and national courts therefore must not be 
required to determine or identify a natural person in the investigations or the fining decision54.   

In the specific case where a parent company holds 100% of shares or almost 100% of shares in a subsidiary 
which has infringed Article 83 GDPR and therefore is able to exercise decisive influence over the conduct of 
its subsidiary, a presumption arises that the parent company does in fact exercise this decisive influence over 
the conduct of its subsidiary (so-called Akzo presumption)55. This also applies if the parent company does not 
directly hold the shares in the total capital directly, but indirectly through one or more subsidiaries56. For 
example, there might also be a chain of subsidiaries, where one entity holds 100% or almost 100% of shares 
of an intermediate entity that holds 100% or almost 100% of shares of another entity, and so forth. Also a 
parent company might hold 100% or almost 100% of shares of two entities that each hold about 50% of an 
entity, thereby providing the parent company with decisive influence on all of them. In those circumstances, 
it is sufficient for the supervisory authority to prove that the subsidiary is directly or indirectly wholly or 
almost wholly owned by the parent company in order to presume – as a rule of practical experience – that 
the parent exercises a decisive influence. 

 

 

126. 

125.  However, the Akzo presumption is not an absolute one, but can be rebutted by other evidence57. In order to 
rebut the presumption, the company(ies) must provide evidence relating to the organizational, economic 
and legal links between the subsidiary and its parent company which are apt to demonstrate that they do 
not  constitute  a  SEU  despite  holding  100%  or  almost  100%  of  shares.  In  order  to  ascertain  whether  a 
subsidiary itself acts autonomously, account must be taken of all the relevant factors relating to those links 
that tie the subsidiary to the parent company, which may vary from case to case and cannot therefore be set 
out in an exhaustive list.  
 
If, on the other hand, the parent company does not hold all or almost all of the capital, additional facts must 
be evidenced by the supervisory authority to justify the existence of a SEU. In such a case, the supervisory 
                                                             

there is a rebuttable presumption of influence in case of a wholly owned subsidiary. See case C‑97/08 P, Akzo and joined

authority has to demonstrate, not only that the parent company has the ability to exercise decisive influence 
over the subsidiary, but also that it has actually exercised such decisive influence so that it can intervene at 
any time in the subsidiary's freedom of choice and determine its behavior. The nature or type of instruction 
is irrelevant when determining the parent company’s influence.  
 

127.  The fine is addressed58 to the (joint-) controller(s)/processor(s), and the competent supervisory authority has 

the option to hold the parent company jointly and severally liable59 for the payment of the fine. 

 

 

 

6.2.2 - Determining the turnover  

128.  Turnover is taken from the annual accounts of an undertaking, which are drawn up with reference to its 
business year and provide an overview of the past financial year of a company or of a group of companies 
(consolidated accounts). Turnover is defined as the sum of all goods and services sold. The term turnover 
within the meaning of Article 83(4)–(5) GDPR is to be understood in terms of the net turnover of Directive 
2013/34/EU60. According to this directive, net turnover means the amount derived from the sale of products 
and the provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value added tax (VAT) and other taxes directly 
linked to turnover.61  

129.  Turnover is taken from the presentation of the profit and loss account within the meaning of Annexes V or 
VI to Article 13(1) of Directive 2013/34/EU under the heading "net turnover". Net turnover includes revenue 
from the sale, rental and leasing of products and revenue from the sale of services less sales deductions (e.g. 
rebates, discounts) and VAT. Revenue therefore does not include items which are unrelated to the business 
object/sector of the company such as for example the proceeds from the sale of fixed assets, rental of unused 
parts of buildings, insurance premiums, commissions and interest income in case of an industrial company.62 
 
If the undertaking is subject to the obligation within the meaning of Article 21 et seq. of Directive 2013/34/EU 
and has to prepare consolidated annual financial statements, these consolidated financial statements of the 
parent company heading the group are relevant for reflecting the combined turnover of the undertaking. If 
such statements do not exist, any other documents shall be obtained and used that are apt to infer the 
worldwide annual turnover of the undertaking in the relevant business year. 

130. 

131.  Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR state that the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year is to be 
used. As to the question of which event the term “preceding” relates to, the CJEU case law in competition 
law  is  also  to  be  applied  for  GDPR  fines  so  that  the  relevant  event  is  the  fining  decision  issued  by  the 
supervisory authority and neither the time of infringement nor the court decision63. In case of cross-border 
processing the relevant fining decision is not the draft decision, but rather the final decision issued by the 
                                                             
58 The decision is  addressed and delivered to the controller(s)/processor(s) as the offender(s) of the infringement and 
can additionally be addressed and delivered to other legal entities of the SEU that are jointly and severally liable for the 
fine.

Lead Supervisory Authority64. Where the draft decision enters the Article 60 co-decision-making process 
towards the end of a calendar year, such that the final decision is unlikely to be adopted within that same 
calendar year, the Lead Supervisory Authority will calculate any proposed fine by reference to the most up 
to  date  financial  information  available  as  at  the  date  on  which  the  draft  decision  is  circulated  to  the 
supervisory authorities concerned for their views. That information will then be updated, as required, prior 
to the finalization and adoption of the final national decision by the Lead Supervisory Authority. 

CHAPTER 7 – EFFECTIVENESS, PROPORTIONALITY AND DISSUASIVENESS 

 

132. 

It is required that the administrative fine imposed for infringements of the GDPR referred to in Article 83(4)–
(6) shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In other words, the amount of the 
fine  imposed  is  tailored  to  the  infringement  committed  in  its  specific  context.  The  EDPB  considers  it 
incumbent  upon  the  supervisory  authorities  to  verify  whether  the  amount  of  the  fine  meets  these 
requirements, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary.  

133.  As explained in Chapter 4, the evaluation performed in this Chapter covers the entirety of the fine imposed 
and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple infringements, increases 
and decreases for aggravating and mitigating circumstances and financial/socio-economic circumstances. It 
is,  however,  incumbent  upon  the  supervisory  authority  to  ensure  that  the  same  circumstances  are  not 
counted twice. 
 
In case these adjustments merit an increase in fine, such increase can – by definition – not exceed the legal 
maximum identified in Chapter 6 above.  

134. 

7.1 - Effectiveness 

135.  Generally speaking, a fine can be considered effective if it achieves the objectives with which it was imposed. 
This could be to reestablish compliance with the rules, to punish unlawful behavior, or both.65 Moreover, 
Recital  148  GDPR  emphasizes  that  administrative  fines  should  be  imposed  “in  order  to  strengthen  the 
enforcement of the rules of this Regulation.” The amount of the fine imposed on the basis of these Guidelines 
should therefore be sufficient to meet these objectives. 
 

136.  As Article 83(2) GDPR requires, the supervisory authority has to evaluate the effectiveness of the fine in each 
individual case. To that end, due regard must be given to the circumstances of the case, and in particular to 
the assessment made above,66 bearing in mind that the fine should also be proportionate and dissuasive as 
outlined below.  
 

7.2 - Proportionality 

                                                             
64 EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, para. 298. 
65 Guidelines WP253, p. 6.  
66 As Recital 148 GDPR also outlines: “the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the intentional character of 
the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the  damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any relevant previous 
infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, compliance with 
measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or 
mitigating factor”. 

 Adopted - version for public consultation

137.  The  principle  of  proportionality  requires  that  measures  adopted  do  not  exceed  the  limits  of  what  is 
appropriate and necessary in order to attain the objectives legitimately pursued by the legislation in question; 
where there is a choice between several appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the least onerous, 
and the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued67. 

138. 

It follows that fines must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued (i.e. compliance with the rules relating 
to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the 
free movement of personal data), and that the amount of the fine imposed must be proportionate to the 
infringement, viewed as a whole, account being taken, in particular, of the gravity of the infringement68.  
 

139.  The supervisory authority shall therefore verify that the amount of the fine is proportionate both to the 
severity  of  the  infringement  and  to  the  size  of  the  undertaking  to  which  the  entity  that  committed  the 
infringement belongs,69 and that the fine imposed shall thereby not exceed what is necessary to achieve the 
objectives pursued by the GDPR. 

140.  As a particular derivative of the principle of proportionality, the supervisory authority may consider – in 
accordance with national law – to further reduce the fine on the basis of the principle of inability to pay. Any 
such reduction requires exceptional circumstances. In line with the European Commission’s Guidelines on 
the  method  of  setting  fines70,  there  has  to  be  objective  evidence  that  the  imposition  of the  fine  would 
irretrievably jeopardise the economic viability of the undertaking concerned. Furthermore, the risks need to 
be analysed in a specific social and economic context. 

 

 

 

a)  Economic viability: The undertaking is required to provide detailed financial data (for the last five 
years as well as projections for the current and next two years) to allow the supervisory authority 
to examine the likely future development of key factors such as solvency, liquidity and profitability. 
The European Courts have stated that, the mere circumstance that an undertaking is in a poor 
financial situation, or will be after a large fine, does not meet the requirement “since recognition 
of  such  an  obligation  would  be  tantamount  to  giving  an  unjustified  competitive  advantage  to 
undertakings least well adapted to the market conditions.”71 The assessment of the undertaking’s 
ability to pay the fine considers also possible restructuring plans and their state of implementation, 
relations  with  external  financial  partners/institutions  such  as  banks  and  relations  with 
shareholders72. 

 

b)  Proof of value loss:  A  fine  reduction  may  be  granted  only  if  the  imposition  of  the  fine  would 
jeopardise the economic viability of an undertaking and cause its assets to lose all or most of their

in which the fine needed to be “appropriate to the circumstances and proportionate both to the breach that has been 
established and to the ability to pay of the Member State concerned.“ 
70 See on this principle, for instance, the Commission Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to 
Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003 (2006/C 210/02).

value73. A direct causal link between the fine and the significant loss of value of the assets must be 
shown. There is no automatic acceptance that bankruptcy or insolvency will necessarily result in 
significant loss of asset value. Furthermore, there can be no question of the fine having threatened 
the economic viability of an undertaking when that undertaking had itself decided to terminate its 
activities and to sell all its assets. The undertaking must prove that it will likely exit the market, and 
its assets will be dismantled or sold at substantially discounted prices with no alternatives for the 
undertaking (or its assets) to continue operations. This means that the supervisory authority should 
require the undertaking to prove that there are no clear indications that the undertaking (or its 
assets) will be acquired another undertaking/owner and continue operations.  

 

c)  Specific social and economic context: The specific economic context can be considered if the sector 
concerned is going through a cyclical crisis (e.g. suffering from overcapacity or falling prices) or if 
companies  have  difficulties in  obtaining  access  to  capital  or  credit  as  a  result  of  the  prevailing 
economic conditions. The specific social context is likely to be present in the context of high and/or 
mounting  unemployment  at  a  regional  or  wider  level.  It  can  also  be  assessed  considering  the 
consequences that the payment of the fine may have in terms of increase of unemployment or 
deterioration of the economic sectors up and downstream74. 

141. 

  
If the criteria are met, the supervisory authorities may take the undertaking’s inability to pay into account, 
and reduce the fine accordingly.  

7.3 - Dissuasiveness 

142.  Finally, a dissuasive fine is one that has a genuine deterrent effect75. In that respect, a distinction can be 
made  between  general  deterrence  (discouraging  others  from  committing  the  same  infringement  in  the 
future)  and  specific  deterrence  (discouraging  the  addressee  of  the  fine  from  committing  the  same 
infringement again)76. When imposing a fine, the supervisory authority takes into account both general and 
specific deterrence. 

 

 

143.  A fine is dissuasive where it prevents an individual from infringing the objectives pursued and rules laid down 
by Union law. What is decisive in this regard is not only the nature and level of the fine but also the likelihood 
of it being imposed. Anyone who commits an infringement must fear that the fine will in fact be imposed on 
them. There is an overlap here between the criterion of dissuasiveness and that of effectiveness77. 

144.  The  supervisory  authorities  may  consider  increasing  the  fine  if  they  do  not  consider  the  amount  to  be 
sufficiently dissuasive. In some circumstances, the imposition of a deterrence multiplier can be justified78. 
This multiplier can be set on the discretion  of the supervisory authority, in order to reflect  the goals of 
deterrence as outlined above.

CHAPTER 8 – FLEXIBILITY AND REGULAR EVALUATION 

145.  The  above  Chapters  outline  a  general  method  for  the  calculation  of  fines  and  shall  facilitate  further 
harmonization  and  transparency  on  the  fining  practice  of  supervisory  authorities.  However,  this  general 
method  should  not  be  misunderstood  as  a  form  of  automatic  or  arithmetical  calculation. The  individual 
setting of a fine must always be based on a human assessment of all relevant circumstances of the case and 
must be effective, proportionate and deterrent with regard to that specific case.  

 

146. 

It should be kept in mind that these guidelines cannot anticipate each and every possible particularity of a 
case and in this regard cannot provide an exhaustive guidance for supervisory authorities. Consequently, 
these  guidelines  are  subject  to  regular  review  in  order  to  evaluate  whether  their  application  effectively 
achieves the objectives called for by GDPR.  The EDPB may revise  these guidelines based on supervisory 
authorities’ further experiences in everyday practical application and may discontinue, change, limit, amend 
or replace these guidelines at any given time with effect for the future.
