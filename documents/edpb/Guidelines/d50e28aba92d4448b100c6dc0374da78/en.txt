1 INTRODUCTION

Annex  2  provides  guidance  for  review  and  assessment  of certification criteria  pursuant  to
Article 42(5). It identifies topics that a data protection supervisory authority and the EDPB will
consider  and  apply  for  the  purpose  of  approval  of  certification  criteria  of  a  certification
mechanism. The questions should be considered by certification bodies and scheme owners
who wish to draft and present criteria for approval. The list is not exhaustive, but presents the
minimum topics to be considered. Not all questions will be applicable, however they should
be considered when drafting criteria and reasoning may be needed to explain why criteria do
not  cover  specific  aspects.  Some questions  are  repeated,  as  they  are  from  different
perspectives. This guidance should be considered in accordance with the legal requirements
provided by the GDPR and, where applicable, by national legislation.

2 SCOPE AND TOE

a.

b.



Is the scope for which the data protection criteria shall be used clearly described?

Is the scope meaningful to its addressed audience and not misleading?

Example: A “Trusted Company Seal” suggests that the processing activities of an entire
company have been audited, even though only specified processing operations, e.g.
the online payment process, are actually subject to certification.

c. Does  the  scope  include  all  relevant  aspects  of  processing  operations  that  are

addressed by it?



Example: A “Privacy Health Mark” shall not exclude from evaluation data concerning
health in order to circumvent requirements pursuant to Article 9.

d. Does the scope allow meaningful data protection certification taking into account its

nature, content, risk and the scope of processing?



Example: A scope focussing only on specific aspects of processing such as the collection
of data but not on the further processing, excluding e.g. processing for the purpose of
creating advertising profiles or the management of data subject’s rights is generally
not meaningful for those addressed by the certification, e.g. the data subject.

e. Does the scope cover personal data processing in the relevant country of application

or does it address cross border processing and/or transfers?

f. Do  the  scope  and/or  the  criteria  require  a  clearly  described  individual  Target  of

Evaluation (ToE)?



Example: A “Privacy Seal” offering a general scope only requiring “a specification of
the processing subject to certification” would not provide clear enough guidance on
how to set and describe a ToE. E.g., a ToE describing processing operations, such as the

adopted

“processing of personal data carried out by company “C” offering a social network”
would be too general and do not clearly describe the particular processing operation(s).



Example: A (specific) scope, “The Privacy Vault Seal”, addressing secure storage should
describe in detail the requirements to meets this scope in its criteria, e.g. definition of
vault,  system  requirements,  mandatory  technical  and  organisational  measures
(TOMs).

g. Do the criteria require the ToE to include an identification of all relevant processing
operations,  illustration  of  data  flows  and  a  determination  of  the  ToE’s  area  of
application?



Example:  A  certification  mechanism  offers  certification  of  processing  operations  of
controllers under the GDPR without specifying further the area of application (general
scope).  The  criteria  used  by  the  mechanism  require  the  applicant  controller  to
determine the targeted processing operation (ToE) in terms of data types, systems and
processes deployed.

h. Do the criteria require from the applicant to make clear where the processing that is
subject  to  evaluation  starts  and  ends?  Do  the  criteria  require  the  ToE  to  include
interfaces where interdependent processing operations are not included as part of the
ToE? And is this satisfactorily justified?



Example: A ToE describing in sufficient detail the processing operation of a web based
service such as including the registration of users, the provision of service, invoicing,
logging of IP-addresses, interfaces to users and to third parties and excluding server
hosting (yet including processing and TOM agreements).

i. Do the criteria guarantee that the (individual) ToEs are understandable to its audience,

including data subjects where relevant?

3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

and the whole life-cycle of data including the deletion and or anonymisation?

PROTECTION

representations  of  data  protection  standards,e.g. “gold  standard”  when  in  fact  the
processing merely meets state of the art?

allow controllers and processors to pass certification successfully, but is only compliant with
the minimum requirements set by the GDPR.
