1 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

1.

2.

Article  65(1)(a) GDPR requires  the  EDPB  to  issue  a  legally binding decision whenever  a  Lead
Supervisory  Authority  (LSA)  issues  a  draft  decision  within  the  meaning  of  Article  60(3)  GDPR  and
decides  not  to  follow  a  relevant  and  reasoned  objection expressed  by  a  Concerned  Supervisory
Authority (CSA) or is of the opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned1.
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR is a dispute resolution mechanism meant to ensure the correct and consistent
application of the GDPR in cases involving cross-border processing of personal data2. It aims to resolve
conflicting views among the LSA(s) and CSA(s) on the merits of the case, in particular whether there is
an infringement of the GDPR or not, in order to ensure the correct and consistent application of the
GDPR in individual cases3.

3. Under the so-called ‘one-stop-shop mechanism’, which applies to cross-border processing of personal
data, the LSA acts as the sole interlocutor for the controller or processor for the processing at issue4.
The  LSA  is  responsible  for carrying  out  the  necessary  investigations, communicating  the  relevant
information to all CSAs and preparing a draft decision5. Prior to the adoption of the draft decision, the
LSA is required to cooperate with the CSAs in an endeavour to reach consensus and the LSA and CSAs
to exchange all relevant information6.

4. Once a draft decision has been prepared, the LSA shall submit this draft decision to all CSAs for their
opinion and take due account of their views7. Within four weeks after having been consulted, a CSA
can express a “relevant and reasoned objection” to the draft decision8. When no CSA objects, the LSA
may proceed to adopt the decision. If any CSA expresses an objection, the LSA must decide whether
it will follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the opinion that the objection is not relevant
or reasoned. If the LSA does not intend to follow the objection(s) or considers the objection(s) are not
relevant and reasoned, the LSA is obliged to refer the case to the EDPB for dispute resolution9.

1 On the concept of relevant an reasoned objection see European Data Protection Board, Guidelines 9/2020 on
relevant  and  reasoned  objection  under  Regulation  2016/679,  Version  2.0,  9  March  2021  (hereafter,  “RRO
Guidelines”), https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202009_rro_final_en.pdf.
2 The cooperation and consistency mechanism is applicable to ‘individual cases’ regardless of whether the case
concerns a complaint or ex officio inquiry/investigation.
3 Recital (136) and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.
4 Article 56(6) GDPR. In cases involving data subject complaint(s), each CSA acts as the main point of contact for
the data subject(s) in the territory of its Member State. See Article 60(7)-(9), Article 65(6) and article 77(2) GDPR.
See also Recitals (130) and (141) GDPR.
5 See Article 60(3) GDPR. In accordance with Article 60(2) GDPR, the LSA may request at any time the other CSA
to provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 and may conduct joint operations pursuant to Article 62
GDPR.
6 This duty of cooperation applies to every stage of the procedure, starting with the inception of the case and
extending to the whole decision-making process, see Article 60(1) GDPR and RRO Guidelines, paragraph 1. As
part of the cooperation procedure, the LSA and CSAs are also required to exchange all relevant information with
each other (Article 60(1) GDPR).
7 Article 60(3) GDPR.
8 Article 60(4) GDPR.
9 Articles 60(4), 63 and 65(1)(a) GDPR. If the LSA intends to follow the objection(s) that are deemed relevant and
reasoned, it shall submit a revised draft decision to all the CSAs. The CSAs then have a period of two weeks

The EDPB will then act as a dispute resolution body and adopt a legally binding decision. The LSA, and
in some situations the CSA with which the complaint was lodged10, must adopt its final decision on the
basis of the EDPB decision. The final decision of the competent supervisory authority will be addressed
to the controller or processor and, where relevant, to the complainant.

These  Guidelines  clarify  the  application  of  Article  65(1)(a) GDPR. In  particular,  they clarify  the
application of the relevant provisions of the GDPR and Rules of Procedure, delineate the main stages
of the procedure and clarify the competence of the EDPB when adopting a legally binding decision on
the  basis  of Article  65(1)(a) GDPR. The Guidelines also include  a  description  of  the  applicable
procedural safeguards and remedies.
The present Guidelines do not concern dispute resolution by the EDPB in cases where:


there are conflicting views on which of the supervisory authorities concerned is competent for the
main establishment (Article 65(1)(b) GDPR);
a competent supervisory authority does not request the opinion of the Board in the cases referred
to in Article 64(1), or does not follow the opinion of the Board issued under Article 64 (Article
65(1)(c) GDPR).



2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND RULES OF PROCEDURE

2.1 Right to good administration

The EDPB is subject to the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (CFEU), including
Article  41  (right  to  good  administration).  This  is  also  reflected  in  Article  11(1)  EDPB  Rules  of
Procedure11, which confirms that the EDPB must respect the right to good administration as set out
by Article 41 CFEU.

Article 41 CFEU grants every person the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and
within a reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union. This includes
the right of every person:


to be heard before any individual measure, which would affect him or her adversely is taken; and
to have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of
professional and business secrecy.



The right to good administration also includes the obligation of the administration to give reasons for
its decisions.

2.2 GDPR

during which they can express their relevant and reasoned objections to the revised draft decision (Article 60(5)
GDPR). See also RRO GLS, paragraphs 2-3.
10 This will apply in particular if the complaint is totally or partially dismissed (Article 60 (8)-(9) GDPR). See further
at paragraph 51 and following.
11 EDPB Rules of Procedure, adopted on 25 May 2018, as last modified and adopted on 8 October 2020, available
at
https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_rop_version_7_adopted_20201008_en.pdf
(hereafter ‘RoP’).

10. Article 65(1) GDPR identifies three different situations in which the EDPB acts as a dispute resolution
body. The main rules applicable to the dispute resolution procedures are set out in Article 65(2)-(6)
GDPR.

11.

In case of a dispute resolution on the basis of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, regard must also be given to
Article  60  GDPR,  which applies  to the  cooperation  between  the  LSA  and  CSA in  individual  cases
involving cross-border processing and specifies in which cases the LSA submit the matter to the EDPB
for dispute resolution. While these Guidelines focus primarily on the application of Article 65(1)(a)
GDPR, reference will also be made to the provisions of Article 60 GDPR insofar as they are relevant to
clarify the main stages of the procedure and competence of the EDPB under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

2.3 EDPB Rules of procedure (RoP)

12. Article 11 RoP further clarifies the rules applicable in cases where the EDPB is called upon to take a
binding  decision,  including  in  the  context  of  the  dispute  resolution  procedure.  Article  11(2) RoP
contains rules that apply specifically to the dispute resolution procedure of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

13. While not the focus of these Guidelines, regard will also be had to Article 22 (Voting), Article 32 (Access
to documents), Article 33 (Confidentiality of discussions) and Article 40 (Calculation of time limits) of
the RoP, as appropriate.

3 MAIN STAGES OF THE PROCEDURE (OVERVIEW)

3.1 Conditions for adopting a binding decision

14. The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4)-

(5) and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

15. The EDPB shall be competent to issue binding decisions on the basis of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR when the

following conditions are met:






the submission of a draft decision within the meaning of Article 60(3) by the LSA to the CSAs;
at least one CSA has raised (one or more) objection(s) to the (revised) draft decision of the LSA
within the deadline provided by Article 60(4)-(5) GDPR; and
the LSA has decided to not follow the objection(s) on the draft decision or rejected it (them) as
not relevant or reasoned.

16. When these conditions are met, the EDPB shall be competent to adopt a binding decision on the basis
of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and
reasoned objection(s), in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR12.

17. A mere “comment” expressed by a CSA in relation to a draft decision does not amount to an objection
within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR. The existence of comments shall therefore not give rise to
the obligation to trigger the Article 65(1)(a) procedure if the LSA decides not to give any effect to the
comment. Moreover, any comment expressed does not constitute as such a matter to be decided by
the EDPB as part of its binding decision. The LSA is required, however, to take due account of the views

12 See Section 4 for further details concerning the competence of the EDPB in accordance with Article 65(1)(a)
GDPR.

expressed  by  all  CSAs13 and,  in  cases  where  the  conditions  of Article 56(2)  are  met, take  utmost
account of the views expressed by the CSA with whom the complaint has been lodged when preparing
the draft decision and take due account of the views expressed by all CSAs14.

3.2 Assessment of the completeness of the file

18. Article 11(2) RoP provides that the Chair and the LSA are responsible for deciding whether the file is
complete15. The assessment of the completeness of the file is an important step in the procedure,
designed to ensure that all conditions for adopting a binding decision are met and that the EDPB has
all the information necessary for doing so16. The assessment of completeness of the file also serves as
the starting point for the legal deadlines mentioned in Article 65(2)-(3) GDPR17. Finally, the assessment
of completeness of the file also seeks to ensure compliance with the right to be heard contained in
Article 41 CFEU.

19. When submitting the matter to the EDPB for dispute resolution, the LSA shall include:

a) the draft decision or revised draft decision subject to the objection(s);
b) a summary of the relevant facts and grounds;
c) the objection(s) made by the supervisory authority(/-ies) concerned in accordance with Article 60
(4) (and where relevant Article 60(5) GDPR);
d) an indication as to whether the LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of
the opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned;
e) documentation proving the timing and format of the provision of the (revised) draft decision and
of the objection(s) by the concerned supervisory authority (/-ies)18; and
f)  in  accordance  with  Article  41  of  the  European  Charter  on  Fundamental  Rights,  the written
observations the LSA collected from the persons that might be adversely affected by the Board ́s
decision, together with confirmation and evidence of which documents submitted to the Board were
provided to them when they were invited to exercise their right to be heard or a clear identification
of the elements for which it is not the case19.

20. The wording of Article 60(4) GDPR and Article 11(2) RoP makes clear that the LSA is responsible for
ensuring  that  the  file  is  complete  and submitting all  relevant  information  to  the  EDPB. Where
necessary, however, the Secretariat may request from the LSA and/or CSAs additional information
within a specific timeframe20. The ability to request additional information should be interpreted in
light of the objective of ensuring that the EDPB is provided with all information necessary to take a

13 Article 60(3) GDPR.
14 Article 56(4) and Article 60(1) GDPR.
15 The Secretariat carries out the analysis on the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair.
16 When necessary, the documents submitted by the competent authority will be translated into English by the
EDPB Secretariat.
17 See Article 11(4) RoP and see further Section 3.3.
18 The aim of providing this information is to allow the Secretariat to verify the objection has been provided in
writing and within the legal deadline. The timing and format of the provision of the (revised) draft decision and
of  the  objection(s)  can  be  proven,  for  example,  via  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objections  report  from  the
information and communication system mentioned in Article 17 of the RoP.
19 Article 11(2) RoP. See also section 5.
20 Article 11(2) RoP.

binding  decision  concerning  all  the  matters  which  are  the  subject  of  the  relevant and  reasoned
objection(s), in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.

Example 1:
A draft decision includes several references to internal documentation of the controller. Even though
the LSA’s (disputed) finding of an infringement is evidenced in its draft decision with reference to the
contents of this documentation, the LSA does not include a copy thereof when submitting the matter
to the EDPB for dispute resolution. The Secretariat may request the LSA to provide a copy of the
documentation that is referenced within a specific timeframe if needed to help decide the subject
matter of the relevant and reasoned objection(s).

The ability to request additional information at a later stage does not diminish the responsibility of
the LSA to provide all relevant information from the outset when submitting the matter to the EDPB.
As the responsibility for ensuring that the file is complete lies with the LSA, the requesting of additional
information  from  the  LSA  and/or  CSA  should  in  principle  only be  necessary  in  exceptional
circumstances. Moreover, as the LSA and CSA are obliged to exchange all relevant information in the
course of the cooperation procedure, the relevant information should already have been provided to
CSAs prior to launching the dispute resolution procedure. If all information necessary to take a binding
decision on the objections raised is also transmitted by the LSA when referring the subject matter to
the EDPB, it will not be necessary for the Secretariat to request additional information before declaring
the file complete.

21.

It should be noted that a request for additional information merely seeks to ensure the completeness
of the file. It does not imply any judgement regarding the merit of the objections raised, nor does it
alter in any way the subject matter referred to the EDPB. Once the file is deemed complete and the
subject matter is referred to the EDPB, in exceptional circumstances, additional information may also
be requested at a later stage in the procedure (i.e. once the subject matter has been referred to the
Board) if necessary to remedy any omissions. This will be subject to a decision by the EDPB21.

22. When necessary, the documents submitted by the LSA and/or CSA will be translated into English by
the Secretariat22. The  translation  may  also  be  limited  to  the  specific  parts  which  are  likely  to  be
relevant to help decide the subject matter of the relevant and reasoned objection(s). The LSA and/or
CSA will have to agree on the translation23.

Example 2:
In its draft decision, the LSA concludes that only one of the infringements of the GDPR alleged by the
complainant materialised. The CSA considers in its relevant and reasoned objection that the other
infringements alleged by the complainant were also committed while the draft decision does not fully
explain the factual elements necessary to conclude the infringements did not occur. Therefore, the
Secretariat requests the LSA to provide a copy of the necessary parts of the investigation report within

21 Article  11(2)  RoP  provides  that  in  exceptional  circumstances,  the  EDPB  can  decide  to  consider  further
documents it deems necessary. As a result, the additional information may be requested by the Secretariat/Chair
but the EDPB will have to decide if it will consider or not the additional info received.
22 The competent authority must express its agreement with the translation provided (Article 11(2) RoP).
23 Article 11(2) RoP.

a specific timeframe24. If the translation of these parts is necessary, it will be translated into English
by the Secretariat and the LSA will have to agree on the translation.

23. Once the Chair and the LSA have decided that the file is complete (and the competent supervisory
authority agreed on any required English translations), the Secretariat on behalf of the Chair will refer
the subject-matter to the members of the EDPB without undue delay25.

24.

If the LSA fails to provide the information listed above within the set timeframe26, the Chair will ask
the Secretariat to refer the subject-matter to the EDPB. The EDPB will then assess, on a case-by-case
basis, whether it can proceed to adopt its decision on the basis of the information already provided,
or whether it is necessary to first obtain the information requested (e.g., confirmation and evidence
of  which  documents  submitted  to  the  Board  were  provided  to  them  when  they  were  invited  to
exercise their right to be heard or a clear identification of the elements for which it is not the case)
before adopting a decision.

Relationship with the right to be heard

25. The assessment of completeness of the file also seeks to ensure compliance with the right to be heard
contained in Article 41 CFEU. Article 11(2) RoP provides that the EDPB shall take into account only the
documents which were provided by the LSA and the other CSA(s) before the matter is referred to the
Board. Any person who might be adversely affected should therefore in principle already have been
invited to exercise their right to be heard27. Where necessary, the Board will take further actions
ensuring  the  right  to  be  heard  of  the  affected persons  in  relation  to  the elements within the
documents that are part of the file that will be considered by the EDPB in making its decision28.

26. Once the file has been declared complete, LSA and CSA(s) are in principle not able to submit any
additional  information concerning  the  subject  matter  of  the  dispute (unless  requested  by  the
Secretariat with a view of remedying an omission in accordance with Article 11(2) RoP29). Only in
exceptional  circumstances  can the  Board  decide  to  consider  further  documents that it  deems
necessary. For example, the LSA cannot introduce new elements of fact supporting its decision not to
follow  one or  more  objections  which  were  not  previously  communicated before  the  matter  was
referred to the EDPB30. Moreover, all information relevant to the assessment of the objections raised
should already be exchanged between the LSA and CSA prior to the initiation of the Article 65(1)(a)
procedure in an endeavour to reach consensus (as in doing so it may also help avoid the need for
trigger the dispute resolution mechanism).

24 Article 11(2) RoP.
25 Article 11(2) RoP.
26 Such a time-frame should be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature and volume of
the documents requested. The Secretariat should consult with the LSA (or where applicable, CSA) to seek their
views as to what constitutes an appropriate timeframe.
27 See  in  particular  Article  11(2)  RoP:  “[  ...] together  with  confirmation  and  evidence  of  which  documents
submitted to the Board were provided to them when they were invited to exercise their right to be heard or a
clear identification of the elements for which it is not the case.”
28 See Section 5 for additional information regarding the exercise of the right to be heard.
29 See paragraph 20 above.
30 Indeed, the wording of Article 11(2)d RoP confirms that when launching the procedure, the LSA should give
an “indication” as to whether it does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection or is of the opinion that
the objection is not relevant or reasoned (i.e. simply an indication as to whether it follows or not the objections).
As a result, no new elements may be submitted going beyond those of which the CSAs were informed prior to
the submission to the Board.

27. Once the file has been declared complete and the subject matter has been referred to the EDPB, the
EDPB must issue a binding decision in relation to each objection raised, unless the CSA who raised a
particular objection decides to withdraw it. As the withdrawal of the objection signifies the end of the
dispute between the LSA and CSA, it is no longer necessary for the EDPB to resolve the matter31.
Similarly, the LSA may be able to withdraw a referral to the EDPB on the basis of Article 60(4) GDPR in
cases where it later decides that it would like to follow each of the objections raised. The withdrawal
of  either  an  objection  or  referral should occur  only  in very exceptional  cases,  however,  as  the
obligation  for  LSA  and  CSAs  to  seek  consensus under  Article  60  GDPR requires that the  dispute
resolution mechanism will only be triggered in cases of persistent disagreement and where reaching
consensus was not possible.

3.3 Establishment of deadline(s)

28. The default legal deadline for the EDPB to adopt a binding decision is one month after the Chair and
the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file is complete32. The deadline may be
extended by a further month on account of the complexity of the subject-matter33. If the EDPB has
not been able to adopt a decision, upon expiry of such an extension, it shall do so within two weeks
following the expiration of the extension34.

3.3.1 Calculation

29. The calculation of the deadline for the adoption of the binding decision must be done on the basis of

Regulation 1182/7135. According to Article 3(2)(c) of Regulation 1182/71,

“a period expressed in weeks, months or years shall start at the beginning of the first hour of
the first day of the period, and shall end with the expiry of the last hour of whichever day in
the last week, month or year is the same day of the week, or falls on the same date, as the day
from which the period runs”.

The Court of Justice has confirmed that, for instance, if an event which is the point from which a period
of a week starts to run happens on a Monday, the period will end on the following Monday, which will
be the dies ad quem (deadline expiration date).36 Likewise, if the time limit is expressed in months and
the triggering event occurs on the 20th March, the period will end on the 20th April.

30. The start date (‘dies a quo’) in the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR consists of the day when the
Chair and the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file is complete and the subject
matter is referred to the EDPB by the Secretariat via the information and communication system
mentioned in Article 17 of the EDPB Rules of Procedure.

31 In  cases  where  the  withdrawal  concerns  the  only  objection  which  the  LSA  has  decided  not  to  follow  or
considered as not relevant and reasoned, the EDPB shall no longer be required to issue a binding decision in
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.
32 Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) RoP.
33 Article 65(2) GDPR.
34 Article 65(3) GDPR. See also paragraph 32.
35 Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of  3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to
periods, dates and time limits, O.J. 8.6.197, L 124/1. Article 40 RoP confirms that “In order to calculate the periods
and time limits expressed in the GDPR and in these Rules of Procedure, Regulation 1182/71 of the Council of 3
June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits shall apply”.
36 See  the  Judgment  in Maatschap  Toeters, MC  Verberk  v.  Productschap  Vee  en  Vlees,  C-171/03,
ECLI:EU:C:2004:714, paragraph 33.

31. Since the GDPR does not express periods in working days, the time limits concerned include public
holidays, Sundays and Saturdays37. However, when the last day of a period is a public holiday, Sunday
or Saturday, the period shall end with the expiry of the last hour of the following working day38, thus
the deadline expiration date (‘dies ad quem’) shall be the following working day.

3.3.2 Decision to extend by one month

32. Article 65(2) GDPR allows the first one-month deadline to be extended by a further month, taking into
account the complexity of the subject-matter. The extension needs to be decided by the Chair of the
EDPB, either on its own initiative or at the request of at least one third of the members of the EDPB39.
The extension decision must be taken prior to the expiration of the one month deadline.

3.3.3 Extension by two weeks

33. The binding decision must in principle be adopted by two-thirds majority at the latest two months
after the file has been considered complete and the subject-matter has been referred to the EDPB.
However, if the EDPB has not been able to adopt a decision within the extended timeframe because
the  required  majority  is  not  reached, the  EDPB  shall then adopt  the  decision  within  two  weeks
following the expiration of the second month by simple majority of its members40.

34. During the two additional weeks, modifications can be made to the draft binding decision that was
previously submitted for adoption by two-thirds majority if necessary to achieve the simple majority.
In other words, the draft binding decision may be adapted and adjusted in case the two-thirds majority
is not reached.

3.4 Preparation of the draft EDPB binding decision

35. According to Article 11(5) RoP, the binding decisions “shall be prepared and drafted by the secretariat
and,  upon  decision  of  the  Chair,  together  with  a  rapporteur  and  expert  subgroups  members”41.
Therefore, the EDPB Secretariat should act as lead rapporteur and the Chair should decide on the
involvement of an expert subgroup and of co-rapporteurs.

36. As soon as the LSA has submitted the matter to the EDPB for dispute resolution, the Secretariat should
start the assessment of the completeness of the file. During this assessment, the Chair is invited to
decide on the possible involvement of co-rapporteurs and will invite EDPB members to express an
interest to become co-rapporteurs (unless the Chair decides not to involve co-rapporteurs for this
case)42. In order to ensure fairness and impartiality, the (group of) co-rapporteur(s) should not include
delegations from either the LSA or CSAs that submitted objections in relation to the draft decision43.

37. Finally, it should be noted that the Chair may also decide to involve the members of one or more other

expert subgroups, depending on the needs of the case.

38. As indicated earlier, Article 11(2) RoP states that the EDPB shall take into account only the documents
which were provided by the LSA and the other CSA(s) once the matter is referred to the EDPB. This
means  that  the  LSA  or  CSA(s)  cannot  during  the  drafting  stage  introduce  new  elements  of  fact
supporting their respective positions.

39.

In accordance with Article 76(1) GDPR, discussions of the Board and of expert subgroups shall be
confidential when they concern the consistency mechanism44. Moreover, an obligation of professional
secrecy is also imposed on the staff of all EEA national supervisory authorities45, the EDPS and the
EDPB Secretariat46. This means that the duty of confidentiality and professional secrecy, which is of
paramount importance, shall be respected by the EDPB and its members also in relation to Article
65(1)(a) dispute resolution cases. This concerns both the discussions and the documents exchanged.

3.5 Adoption of the EDPB binding decision

40. All majorities referred to by the GDPR (or by the RoP) refer to the total number of members of the

EDPB entitled to vote, regardless of whether they are present or not47.

41. While not having the right to vote, EFTA EEA supervisory authorities (i.e. Iceland, Liechtenstein and

Norway) shall have the right to express their positions on all items discussed and/or voted48.

42.

In  accordance  with Article 68(6) GDPR, the EDPS shall  have voting  rights only  on  decisions  which
concern principles and rules applicable to the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies which
correspond in substance to those of the GDPR. Where that is the case, the EDPS is entitled to vote on
the decision as a whole.

43. Every EDPB member entitled to vote who is not represented at a plenary meeting can delegate its
voting rights to another member of the Board entitled to vote and attending the plenary meeting49.

44. The majority required for the adoption of a binding decision under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR is two-thirds
of the EDPB members entitled to vote50. Where the EDPB has been unable to adopt a decision by two-
thirds majority, the EDPB shall adopt its decision within the following two weeks by simple majority.
Where the members of the Board are split, the decision shall by adopted by the vote of the Chair51.

45. Once the EDPB has adopted its binding decision, the Chair of the EDPB shall notify the decision to all
the supervisory authorities concerned without undue delay52. Therefore, all the CSAs in the case need
to be notified of the draft decision.

46. The notification will be performed by the Secretariat on behalf of the Chair via the information and

communication system mentioned in Article 17 RoP.

3.7 Final Decision of the supervisory authority(ies)

47. Within one month after the notification of the EDPB decision to the supervisory authorities, the LSA
and/or CSA (as the case may be53) must adopt a final decision54. Each final decision must be adopted
“on the basis of” the decision of the EDPB. Moreover, the final decision(s) must refer to the decision
by the EDPB and must specify that this decision will be published on the EDPB website. The final
decision(s) of the LSA and/or CSA shall also “attach” the decision of the EDPB55.

3.7.1 “On the basis of”

48. The requirement of adopting a final decision “on the basis of” the EDPB decision reflects the fact that
the EDPB’s decision is legally binding upon the LSA (and/or eventually the CSA(s) in case of need to
adopt a final decision toward the data subjects56) as addressee(s) of the decision57.

49. The aim of the binding decision is to resolve conflicting views among the LSA(s) and CSA(s) on the
merits of the case, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR, in order to ensure the
correct and consistent application of the GDPR in individual cases58.

50. The final decision must be adopted on the basis of the EDPB’s decision and must, therefore, give full
effect  to  the  binding  direction(s) as  set  out  in  the EDPB’s  decision. For  example,  if  the EDPB  has
determined  that  there  has  indeed  been  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR,  the  LSA  or  CSA  may  not
determine otherwise. In the same vein, if the EDPB has determined that envisaged action in relation
to the controller or processor does not comply with the GDPR, the LSA or CSA must adapt their course
of action accordingly59.

3.7.2 Decision(s) by LSA and/or CSA

51. The final decision of the LSA and, as the case may be, the CSA with whom the complaint has been

lodged, shall be adopted under the terms of Article 60(7), (8) and (9) GDPR60.

52. The point of departure is that the LSA will be required to adopt and notify its final decision to the main
establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor and inform the other supervisory
authorities concerned as well as the EDPB of its final decision (including a summary of the relevant

52 Article 65(5) GDPR.
53 In case of partial or complete dismissal of a complaint, see Article 60(8) and (9) GDPR.
54 Article 65(6) GDPR.
55 The requirement that the final decision « attach » the EDPB decision does not mean that the EDPB decision
must  be  annexed  to  the  final  decision  within  a  single  document  (it  is  sufficient  that  the  EDPB  decision  is
communicated to the controller or processor together with the final decision).

58 Recital (136) and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

reasoned objection).

facts and grounds)61. One important derogation to this requirement concerns the situation where a
complaint has been dismissed or rejected.

In cases where a complaint has been dismissed or rejected, the supervisory authority with which the
complaint was lodged shall adopt the decision and notify it to the complainant and shall inform the
controller thereof62.

In case of need to take a decision to only partially dismiss a complaint, the LSA shall adopt the decision
for the part concerning actions in relation to the controller or the processor, shall notify it to the main
establishment or single establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its Member
State and shall inform the complainant thereof, while the supervisory authority of the complainant
shall adopt the decision for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint, and shall
notify it to that complainant and shall inform the controller or processor thereof63.

55. Each  natural  or  legal  person has  the  right  to an  effective  judicial  remedy  before  the  competent
national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning
that person, in line with Article 78 GDPR64.

3.7.3 Notification of the EDPB

56. The LSA or, as the case may be, the CSA with which the complaint has been lodged, is required to
inform the EDPB of the date when its final decision is notified respectively to the controller or the
processor and to the data subject65.

57.

58.

3.8 Publication of the EDPB binding decision
In accordance with Article 65(5) GDPR, the publication of the EDPB binding decision on the website of
the Board shall occur “without undue delay” after the LSA has notified the final national decision to
the controller/processor and/or the CSA has notified the data subject (in case of a dismissal of a
complaint). Whenever possible, “without undue delay” should be interpreted as suggesting that the
publication of the EDPB binding decision should happen on the same day where the final national
decision is notified to the controller/processor/complainant.

In order to allow the EDPB to publish its binding decision “without undue delay” after the notification
of the final national decision, Article 65(6) GDPR requires the competent supervisory authority to
inform  the  Board  of  the  date  when  its  final  decision  is  notified  respectively  to  the  controller  or
processor  and  to the  data  subject. To  avoid  undue delays, each competent  supervisory  authority
should inform the Secretariat of the date on which notification of the national decision is expected to
take place, preferably at least one day in advance.

59. Article 339 TFEU requires the members and staff of the EU institutions not to disclose information of
the  kind  covered  by the  obligation  of  professional  secrecy,  in  particular  information  about
undertakings, their business relations or their cost components66. As a consequence, some portions

61 Article 60(7) GDPR.
62 Article 60(8) GDPR.
63 Article 60(8) GDPR.
64 See also Recital (143) GDPR. See further Section 8 (Judicial remedies).
65 Article 65(6) GDPR.
66 An obligation of professional secrecy is also imposed on the staff of the EU institutions by the Staff Regulations
and on the staff of the EDPS, including the EDPB Secretariat, also by Article 56 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. An

Adopted - version for public consultation

14

of the EDPB binding decision may need to be redacted in order to avoid disclosure of information
covered by professional secrecy. The Secretariat will evaluate the need to redact such elements on
the basis of EU law and the case law of the CJEU67.

60. The  EDPB will  also  publish  the final national  decision(s) in  its register68, taking into  consideration
possible  restrictions under  national  law  of  the  competent supervisory  authority concerning  the
publication of its decisions. Where such restrictions apply, the SAs should inform the Secretariat of
any such restrictions.

4 COMPETENCE OF THE EDPB

61. The  aim  of  the  consistency  mechanism,  including Article  65(1)(a) GDPR,  is to  contribute  to  the
consistent  application of the  GDPR throughout the Union.  Recital  (136) clearly  indicates that  the
competence of the EDPB to issue a binding decision in case of conflicting views among LSA and CSAs
in the context of the cooperation mechanism relates to the merits of the case, in particular whether
there is an infringement of the GDPR69.

62. According to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB binding decision shall concern all the matters which are
the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  will  assess only issues
included in the objections that have been raised in relation to the draft or revised draft decision of the
LSA. The EDPB will not reassess the whole case nor will it address issues that might be raised in the
course of the Article 65 procedure but were not the subject of the reasoned and relevant objections
submitted prior to the submission of the dispute to the EDPB.

63. The dispute between the LSA and the CSA(s) may concern either the fact that the LSA does not follow
one or more relevant and reasoned objections or that the LSA is of the opinion that one or more
objections is not relevant or reasoned. The EDPB will assess, in relation to each objection raised,
whether the objection meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and, if so, address the merits of
the objection in the binding decision.

4.1 Assessment of whether the objections are relevant and reasoned

obligation of professional secrecy is also imposed by Article 54 (2) GDPR on the members and staff of each
supervisory authority.

69 Recital (136) stipulates that "[...] The Board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where
there are disputes between supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue, in principle by a two-thirds
majority of its members, legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views
among  supervisory  authorities,  in  particular  in  the  cooperation  mechanism  between  the  lead  supervisory
authority  and  supervisory  authorities  concerned on  the  merits of  the  case,  in  particular  whether  there  is  an
infringement of this Regulation.”

64.

In its Guidelines on relevant and reasoned objections, the EDPB has clarified the conditions that must
be met in order for an objection to be considered “relevant and reasoned” within the meaning of
Article 4(24) GDPR70.

65. When a LSA refers a dispute to the EDPB for resolution in accordance with Article 60(4) and 63 GDPR,
the EDPB must first assess whether the objection(s) raised in fact meet the conditions of being relevant
and reasoned71.

66. The EDPB recalls that in order for an objection to be considered as “relevant”, there must be a direct
connection between the objection and the substance of the draft decision at issue. More specifically,
the objection needs to concern either whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR72.

67.

In  order  for  an  objection  to  be “reasoned”, it  should  be  coherent,  clear,  precise  and  detailed  in
explaining  the  reasons  for the objection.  It  should  set  forth,  clearly  and  precisely,  the  essential
elements on which the CSA based its assessment, and the link between the envisaged consequences
of the draft decision (if it was to be issued as it is) and the significance of the anticipated risks for data
subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms and, where applicable, for the free flow of personal data
within the Union73.

68. When assessing whether the objections in fact meet the conditions of being relevant and reasoned,
the assessment carried out by the EDPB will be both substantial and formal. In other words, the EDPB
will take into account the specific wording used by the CSA within each of the objections raised and
whether  each  element  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR  is  explicitly  mentioned  in  relation  to  each  specific
objection; thus requiring an explicit reference to the risks posed by the draft decision as regards the
fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects74.

69.

In its binding decision, the EDPB will not take any position on the merits of any substantial issues raised
by objections that do not meet the conditions of Article 4(24) GDPR. If an objection does not meet the
conditions of Article 4(24) GDPR, the binding decision of the EDPB remains without any prejudice to
any assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties,
taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.

4.2 Matters subject of the relevant and reasoned objection
In its Guidelines on relevant and reasoned objections, the EDPB also clarified the possible subject
matter (substance) of a relevant and reasoned objection75. Those Guidelines describe a number of

70.

70 RRO GLS, paragraphs 12-21.
71 As clarified earlier, the LSA shall submit the matter to the EDPB either if it does not follow the relevant and
reasoned objection or if it is of the opinion that the objection is not relevant or reasoned. See section 3.1 above.
72 RRO GLS, paragraph 12. An objection raised fulfils the criterion of being “relevant” when, if followed, it would
entail a change leading to a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or as to
whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor, as proposed by the LSA, complies with
the GDPR. RRO GLS, paragraph 13.
73 RRO GLS, paragraph 19. See also RRO GLS, paragraph 16. (“In order for the objection to be “reasoned”, it needs
to include clarifications and arguments as to why an amendment of the decision is proposed (i.e. the legal /
factual  mistakes  of  the  LSA's  draft  decision).  It  also  needs  to  demonstrate  how  the  change would  lead  to  a
different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether the envisaged action in
relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR.”).

examples of objections that may meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. These examples relate
to possible disagreements between the LSA and CSA on the following matters:

1.
the existence of a given infringement of the GDPR;
2.
the existence of additional or alternative infringements of the GDPR;
3. gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation;
4.
5. procedural aspects; and
6.

the specific action envisaged by the draft decision.

insufficient factual information or reasoning;

4.2.1 Existence of a given infringement of the GDPR

71. A first example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves the disagreement between the
LSA  and  CSA as  to  whether  or  not  a given  provision  of  the  GDPR has  been  infringed76. Such  a
disagreement may arise where the draft decision adopted by the LSA either:





explicitly confirms the existence of an infringement of a specific article of the GDPR, but the
CSA considers that this article of the GDPR has not been infringed77;
explicitly confirms that a particular article of the GDPR has not been infringed, whereas the
CSA considers that the article in question has been infringed.

72.

In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, “in particular whether there is
an infringement of the GDPR”. The EDPB must make a binding decision which shall whenever possible,
taking into account the elements of the file and the right to be heard, provide a final conclusion on
the application of the GDPR in relation to the case at hand. In other words, the EDPB shall assess the
merits of the arguments raised by the CSA in the objection against those of the LSA and make a final
determination as to whether or not the given infringement of the GDPR took place or not. The EDPB
will instruct the LSA to alter a finding of an infringement or to include one whenever necessary. In
such cases, the LSA will then be obliged to implement the change in its final decision, taking into
account the binding decision of the EDPB in relation to the objection raised.

4.2.2 Additional or alternative infringements of the GDPR

73. A second example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves disagreement between the
LSA and CSA as to the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the investigation. For instance, the
objection may state that the findings amount to the infringement of a provision of the GDPR other
than (and/or in addition to) those already analysed by the draft decision78.

74. As previously indicated, the EDPB must make a binding decision which shall whenever possible, taking
into account the elements of the file and the respondent’s right to be heard, provide a final conclusion
on  the  application  of  the  GDPR  in  relation  to  the  case  at  hand. This can potentially include a
determination  of  the  existence  of  additional (or  alternative)  infringements,  provided that the file
contains sufficient factual elements to substantiate the alleged infringement and the persons who

76 RRO GLS, paragraphs 24-25.
77 The RRO GLS include the following example : The CSA argues that LSA did not take into consideration the fact
that the household exemption is not applicable to some of the processing operations conducted by a controller
and involving the use of CCTV, hence that there is no infringement of the GDPR.

would be adversely affected have been or can be heard in relation to the objections alleging the
existence of an additional or alternative infringement79.
Example 3:
The draft decision of a LSA states that the controller failed to comply with the duty to inform pursuant
to Article 14 GDPR (information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the
data subject). The draft decision states that the controller should have provided the information in
paragraphs 14(1) and 14(2)(a) and (e) GDPR and finds no other infringements of Article 14. One of the
CSAs  considers that the controller  should  have  provided  all  the  information referred  to  in  Article
14(2)(b) and (f) GDPR, as the default position is that all such information set out in that subarticle
should be provided to the data subject unless one or more categories of the information does not
exist or is not applicable.80 Provided the objection raised by the CSA meets the requirements of Article
4(24), and taking into account the elements of the file and the right to be heard, the EDPB will decide
whether or not the controller additionally infringed Article 14(2)(b) and (f) GDPR, in addition to Article
14(1) and Art. 14(2)(a) and (e) GDPR.
If the EDPB determines, following a relevant and reasoned objection to this effect, that additional
and/or alternative provisions of the GDPR have been infringed, the LSA will be obliged to reflect this
in its final decision, taking into account the binding decision of the EDPB in relation to the objection
raised.
It may be possible, in exceptional cases, that the file submitted to the EDPB does not contain sufficient
factual  elements  to  allow  the  EDPB  to  make  a  final  conclusion  regarding  the  existence  of  the
infringement  identified  by  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection.  In  most  cases,  however,  the
information exchanged during the cooperation procedure should be sufficient to enable the CSA to
substantiate  its  objection  in  such  a  way  that  the  EDPB shall  be  able make  a  final  determination
whether or not there has been an infringement of the GDPR81. Furthermore, when the LSA submits
the matter to the Secretariat to obtain a binding decision on the basis of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the
Secretariat may also request the LSA and/or CSA to provide additional information that is necessary
to ensure the file is complete82.
4.2.3 Gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation by the LSA

75.

76.

77. A third example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves disagreement between the
LSA and CSA as to whether the draft decision has sufficiently investigated the relevant infringements
of the GDPR83.
Example 4:
The  LSA,  upon  receiving  a  complaint,  considers  that  not  all  of  the  allegations  of  infringements
contained in the complaint merit investigation. In its draft decision, the LSA only addresses those
aspects of the complaint which it decided to investigate without any statement regarding the other
alleged infringements of the GDPR. The CSA considers that the LSA in its investigation unjustifiably
failed to address a number of alleged infringements raised by the complainant and submits a relevant

79 See section 5 regarding the right to be heard.
80 See also Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, 29 November 2017,
WP260 rev.01, 11 April 2018, paragraph 46.
81 Where appropriate, the CSA and LSA can make use of Article 61 and 62 GDPR with a view of obtaining the
necessary information prior to the issuance of the draft decision.
82 See section 3.2 above.
83 RRO GLS, paragraph 27.

Adopted - version for public consultation

18

and reasoned objection based on the failure of the LSA to properly handle the complaint to safeguard
the rights of the data subject.

78. Article 57(1)(f) GDPR imposes a duty upon supervisory authorities to handle each and every complaint
submitted to them and to investigate the subject matter of the complaint “to the extent appropriate”.
The term “to the extent appropriate” provides the competent supervisory authority with a margin of
discretion as regards the extent or depth of the investigation needed. However, this discretionary
power must be exercised with all due diligence84 and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
GDPR implying mutual cooperation.
If  the  EDPB,  on  the  basis  of  a  relevant and  reasoned  objection,  determines  that  the  LSA  has
unjustifiably  failed to investigate or  in  any  other  way  address some  of  the  issues  raised  by  the
complaint, the EDPB can issue a binding decision specifying the need for LSA to handle the matter
further and to investigate – to the extent appropriate – the remaining subject matter of the complaint.
To the extent that the draft decision allows it, the LSA should in principle first seek to finalise its draft
decision  as  regards  those  matters  that  do  not  require  further  investigation  within  the  deadline
specified by Article 65(6).

79.

the  outstanding  alleged 

80. For those matters requiring further investigation, it may be necessary for the LSA to open a new case
file. In case a new case file is opened to address the remaining issues, the LSA is required to comply
with all cooperation provisions under the GDPR. This may lead to submitting a new draft decision in
accordance  with  A60(3)  GDPR  which  addresses 
infringement.
In situations where it is not possible for the LSA to follow this course of action (e.g., when there is
inextricable link between the matter requiring further investigation and the other parts of the LSA’s
draft decision that are to be finalised), it may be necessary for the LSA to first investigate the matter
further and prepare an updated draft decision.
In any event, the LSA shall be required to further address the matter and keep the members of the
EDPB  informed  of  the  steps  taken.  Moreover,  the  CSAs  can  seek  to  use  the  cooperation  and
consistency mechanisms provided for in the GDPR in case the LSA does not fulfil its obligations flowing
from the Article 65 decision (i.e addressing the remaining issues to be resolved) 85.
4.2.4 Insufficient factual information or reasoning

81.

82. A fourth example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves disagreement between the
LSA and CSA as to whether sufficient factual elements and/or reasoning have been included in the
draft decision86. For instance, a CSA might consider that the conclusion by the LSA included the draft
decision is not adequately supported by the assessment carried out and the evidence presented87. In
such a case the EDPB shall also be competent to issue a binding decision, provided the objection raised

84 Judgment in Schrems, C-362/14, 6 October 2015, ECLI:EU:C:2015:650, paragraph 63.
85 The  EDPB  recalls  the  possibility  for  CSAs  make  use,  where  appropriate,  of  the  ability  to  request mutual
assistance  pursuant  to  Article  61  GDPR  (which  also  allow  CSAs,  in  case  the  LSA  fails  to  comply,  to  adopt  a
provisional measure in accordance with Article 66) or requests for an opinion pursuant to Article 64(2) GDPR
(which is explicitly deemed by the legislator as particularly appropriate where a SA does not comply with its
obligations for  mutual  assistance  under  Article  61  GDPR). The  latter  procedure may,  eventually,  produce  a
binding  decision of  the  EDPB  in  accordance  with  Article  65(1)(c)  GDPR. See  also  Advocate  General  Bobek,
Opinion in Facebook Ireland Limited, C-645/19, ECLI:EU:C:2021:5, paragraphs 115-121. Additionally, the EDPB
may also,  in  its  binding  decision  under  Article  65(1)(a)  GDPR, invite  the  CSA  to  request  the  LSA  to  further
investigate via an Article 61 Mutual Assistance request.

meets the whole threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR, including a link between the allegedly insufficient
analysis and the existence of an infringement or the envisaged action88.
In a situation where the draft decision of the LSA contains insufficient factual elements or reasoning,
there are essentially two possible scenarios.
In the first scenario, the file on the basis of which the EDPB shall make its decision already contains
sufficient information that would allow to address the lack of sufficient factual elements or reasoning
in the draft decision. In such cases, the EDPB shall, within the scope of the relevant and reasoned
objection, determine to what extent the LSA should amend its draft decision in order to remedy the
insufficiency of reasoning, by making reference to the relevant elements included in the file.
Example 5:
The  draft  decision  of  the  LSA  establishes  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR  based  on  findings  of  fact
supported by documentary evidence which were provided in the file to the EDPB. A number of CSAs
submit relevant and reasoned objections outlining that the link between the documentary evidence
and the finding of infringement is not sufficiently reasoned in the draft decision. The EDPB decision
finds that the objection(s) are relevant and reasoned and indicates the correct legal interpretation and
reasoning that the LSA should incorporate in its final decision.
In the second scenario, the file on the basis of which the EDPB shall make its decision does not contain
sufficient factual elements to address the insufficiency of factual elements or reasoning.
Example 6:
The draft decision of the LSA finds that there is no infringement of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and that the
processing in question is lawful on the basis of the data subject’s consent. However, neither the draft
decision nor any other document in the file provides any further materials or analysis as to whether
the conditions of Article 7 GDPR have been met. The draft decision simply states that the processing
has been lawfully based on consent, without providing further reasoning or evidence. A CSA raises an
objection  against  this  lack  of  reasoning,  arguing  that  the  absence  of  this  analysis  gives  rise  to
uncertainty surrounding the finding of no infringement in this case.
If the EDPB determines that the file on the basis of which the EDPB shall make its decision does not
contain sufficient factual elements that would allow to remedy the insufficiency of reasoning, the
EDPB can issue a binding decision specifying the need for LSA to investigate or address the matter
further  with  a  view  of  obtaining  sufficient  factual  information,  in  line  with what is  specified  in
paragraphs 79-81 above.
4.2.5 Procedural aspects

86. A fifth example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves a disagreement between the
LSA and CSA as to whether the procedural requirements imposed by the GDPR have been properly
respected and this affects the conclusion reached in the draft decision89.

87. The EDPB recalls that the aim of the dispute resolution mechanism of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR is to
resolve conflicting views on the merits of the case90. It is not intended to resolve possible disputes
regarding procedural requirements or duties of cooperation91.

88 RRO GLS, paragraph 29.
89 RRO GLS, paragraph 30.
90 See above at paragraph 61.
91 In this regard, the EDPB recalls Articles 61, 64(2), 65(1)(c) and 66 of the GDPR.

89.

88. An objection involving a disagreement concerning procedural requirements will only be considered
relevant and reasoned if the objection also puts forward arguments clarifying the different conclusion
that the LSA should have reached in its draft decision. In its decision, the EDPB will resolve the dispute
surrounding the conclusions reached in the draft decision.
If  the  procedural  deficiencies  leave  the  EDPB  unable  to  resolve  the  dispute  surrounding  the
conclusions reached by the draft decision (e.g. due to a lack of sufficient factual elements), the EDPB
will recall the importance of the duty of cooperation and issue a binding decision specifying the need
for LSA to investigate or address the matter further, in line with what is specified in paragraphs 79-81
above and ensuring full compliance with the procedural requirements in the GDPR which were not
met.
4.2.6 Action envisaged

90. A sixth example of a possible relevant and reasoned objection involves disagreement between the LSA
and CSA as to whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with
the GDPR92.

91. The EDPB recalls that Recital (150) GDPR states that the consistency mechanism may also be used to
promote a consistent application of administrative fines. As a result, if the assessment of the EDPB
within this context identifies shortcomings in the reasoning leading to the imposition of the fine at
stake, the LSA will be instructed to re-assess the fine and remedy the identified shortcomings93.

92. Fines are by no means the only action a supervisory authority can envisage. A relevant and reasoned
objection  may  therefore  also  relate  to  other  envisaged  actions,  taking  into  account  the  range  of
powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR. Each envisaged measure should be appropriate, necessary and
proportionate  in  view  of  ensuring  compliance  with  this  Regulation,  taking  into  account  the
circumstances of each individual case94. In this context, it should be recalled that the decision to reject
or dismiss a complaint, in whole or in part, also constitutes an envisaged action capable of being
subject of a relevant and reasoned objection.
If the EDPB, on the basis of a relevant and reasoned objection, determines that the envisaged action
included in the draft decision does not comply with the GDPR, it shall instruct the LSA to re-assess the
envisaged action and change the draft decision in accordance with the binding decision of the EDPB.

5 THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD

5.1 Applicability

94. The right to be heard before an administration takes a measure that would adversely affect a person
is enshrined in Article 41 CFEU and has long been recognised as a general principle of EU law95. The
right to be heard is also included in Article 16 of the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour
and reflected in Article 11 RoP.

95. Article 41 CFEU is addressed not to the Member States but solely to the institutions, bodies, offices
and agencies of the European Union96. Nevertheless, the right to be heard has also been recognised
as “inherent in respect for the rights of the defence, which is a general principle of EU law”97 and
therefore also applies when Member States adopt decisions which come within the scope of EU law98.

96. The right to be heard applies to administrative proceedings of which the outcome is likely to affect
the (legal or natural) person’s interests. It also applies in situations where the administration of EU
law is divided or shared between EU and the Member States (so-called “composite procedures”99).
Article 41(2)(a) CFEU is framed in terms of individual measures that would adversely affect the person,
with no specific requirement that the contested measure should be initiated against that person100.

97. Article 65(2) GDPR provides that the EDPB’s decision “shall be [...] addressed to the lead supervisory
authority  and  all  the  supervisory  authorities  concerned  and  binding  on  them”. Article 65(2) GDPR
reflects the fact that the binding decision of the EDPB aims to resolve a dispute that has emerged
among two or more national supervisory authorities. In accordance with the procedure under Article
60 GDPR, LSA will have shared its legal analysis in the draft decision and in relation the objections
raised during the cooperation procedure. The CSA(s) likewise will have shared its (their) objection(s)
in relation to the draft decision, including any materials to substantiate their objection. In addition,
both the LSA and CSAs can share their views in the course of the preparation and adoption of the EDPB
decision101.

98. Article 65(2) GDPR also confirms that the EDPB decision does not address directly any party other than
the LSA and CSAs. Nevertheless, the decision adopted by the EDPB at European level shall be binding
on the LSA or, as the case may be, the CSA with which the complaint has been lodged and is therefore

decisive for the outcome of the procedure at national level. It therefore also may affect the interests
of persons who were part of the procedure that gave rise to the draft decision.

99. As a result, any of these persons which would be adversely affected by the decision, in particular the
controller(s) and/or processor(s) who are addressed by the draft decision of the LSA, as well as any
other person which would be adversely affected by the decision, must be afforded the right to be
heard in relation to the subject matter which is brought before the EDPB pursuant to Articles 60(4),
63 and 65(1)(a) GDPR.

5.2 Purpose

100. The right to be heard is described by the Court as guaranteeing “every person the opportunity to make
known his views effectively during an administrative procedure and before the adoption of any decision
liable to affect his interests adversely”102. As clarified by the CJEU, the purpose of the rule, that the
addressee of an adverse decision must be placed in a position to submit his observations before that
decision  is  taken, is  to  put  the  competent  authority  in  a  position  effectively  to  take  all  relevant
information  into  account.  In  order  to  ensure that  the  person  concerned  is  in  fact  protected,  the
purpose of that rule is, inter alia, to enable that person to correct an error or submit such information
relating to his or her personal circumstances as will argue in favour of the adoption or non-adoption
of the decision, or in favour of it having a specific content103.

101. The right to respond is also part of the right to be heard since an “administrative procedure requires
that the person concerned should be able [...] to put his own case and properly make his views known
on the relevant circumstances and, where necessary, on the documents taken into account by the
Community institutions”104. Except in cases where legislation expressly provides for the possibility of
an oral hearing, such as in the competition proceedings, the right to be heard does not necessarily
require an oral hearing105.

5.3 Timing
5.3.1 At national level and prior to referral to the EDPB

102. Before the EDPB is given the task of issuing a binding decision, every supervisory authority is under
and obligation to respect the right to be heard in the context of its national procedure, as a general
principle of EU law106. Indeed, every supervisory authority needs to “respect the right of every person
to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken”107. The
right to be heard applies regardless of whether the case is cross-border in nature or not.

103. Even in the absence of specific provisions under national law, the LSA should, in advance of triggering
Article 65(1)(a)  GDPR,  ensure  that  procedure  conducted  at  national  level takes into account  the
requirements of the right to be heard as a general principle of EU law.

102 See  e.g.  Judgments  in M.M.,  C-277/11,  22  November  2012, EU:C:2012:744,  paragraph 87; Mukarubega,
paragraph 46; Glencore Agriculture Hungary, paragraph 39 and the case law cited therein.

5.3.2 During the assessment of completeness of the file

104. When the LSA submits the matter to the Secretariat with a view of obtaining a binding decision of the
EDPB under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the Secretariat should assess which persons would possibly be
adversely affected by the EDPB decision in the sense of Article 41 of the Charter. It should also assess
whether each of those persons was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard.

105. It is not sufficient that the LSA has heard the persons who might be adversely affected in the course
of the national procedure prior to the adoption of its draft decision within the meaning of Article 60(3)
GDPR. Before the EDPB will be in a position to resolve the dispute, the right to be heard must also be
afforded in relation to any objections raised in relation to the draft decision, in particular where the
LSA chooses not to follow the objection (or considers it as not being relevant reasoned).

106. When submitting the matter to the Secretariat, the LSA is expected to demonstrate how the right to
be  heard  has  been  afforded  to  persons  benefitting  from  this  right  in  the  course  of  the  national
procedure leading to the draft decision. As regards the documents shared when submitting the matter
to  the  Secretariat,  the  LSA  should  specifically  mention  whether  or  not  these  documents  (or  the
relevant  contents  thereof108)  were  subject  to  the  right  to  be  heard  and  with  regard  to  which
persons109. Replies or summaries of the hearing(s) should be provided as well.

107. The accommodation of the right to be heard is an essential element of the procedure, in the absence
of which the subject matter of the dispute cannot be settled by the EDPB. As a result, the gathering
and  verification  of  the  relevant  information is carried  out  in  the  context  of  the  check  on  the
completeness of the file, before the subject matter is referred to the EDPB. Only after all the relevant
verifications have been made by the Secretariat, the Chair shall be in the position to declare the file
complete110.

108. If there are relevant documents or information that have not been subject to the right to be heard,
the  Chair may  instruct  the  Secretariat  to ask  the  supervisory  authorities  (LSA  /  CSA)  to  take  the
necessary actions to enable any party that could be affected to be heard. If necessary, the Chair may
instruct the Secretariat to take measures to directly ensure the right to be heard at the EDPB level. In
both instances, the persons who would be adversely affected shall be invited to exercise the right to
be heard on the relevant documents or information within a specific timeframe, taking into account
the complexity of the subject matter (as well as possible needs for translation).

108 For purposes of the procedure under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the scope of which is limited resolving disputes
concerning the objections raised, the right to be heard does not need to extend to elements beyond the subject
matter of the dispute.
109 See Article 11(2)(f) RoP, which specifies that the LSA when submitting the matter to the Secretariat should
include, inter alia, ““in accordance with Article 41 of the European Charter on Fundamental Rights, the written
observations  the  LSA  collected  from  the  persons  that  might  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Board ́s decision,
together with confirmation and evidence of which documents submitted to the Board were provided to them
when they were invited to exercise their right to be heard or a clear identification of the elements for which it is
not the case”.

6 ACCESS TO THE FILE

109. The right to good administration includes the right of every person to have access to the file, while

respecting the legitimate interests of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy111.

110. Access to the documents and information that form the basis of an administrative decision is closely
connected with the right to be heard112. In accordance with that principle, ‘the addressees of decisions
which significantly affect their interests must be placed in a position in which they can effectively make
known their views as regards the information on which the authorities intend to base their decision’113.

111. The right of access to the file of the EDPB as part of the right to good administration is distinct from
the general right  of  access  to  documents  held  by  the European institutions,  bodies,  offices  and
agencies pursuant  to  Regulation  (EC)  No  1049/2001114, Article  15(3) TFEU or  Article  42  of  the
Charter115. The right of access to the file and the right of access to documents are subject to different
criteria and exceptions and pursue different purposes.

112. The right of access to the file extends to the documents shared with the EDPB to resolve the dispute
in accordance  with Article  65(1)(a) procedure,  save  where  they  involve  business  secrets  of  other
undertakings, confidential information, as assessed by the EDPB on a case by case basis.

113. The right of access to the file shall not extend to confidential information and internal documents of
the EDPB or the SAs (e.g. email correspondence or preparatory documents). In particular, the right of
access shall not extend to exchanges between the EDPB and its members once the procedure has
been launched116.

111 Article 41(2)b CFEU. The SA acting on behalf of the EDPB cannot make a general reference to confidentiality
to justify a total refusal to disclose documents in its file to persons adversely affected, nor can it give blank pages
on the ground that they contained business secrets without providing a more comprehensible non-confidential
version, or a summary of the documents.

7 THE DUTY TO GIVE REASONS

114. The  right  to  good  administration contained  in  Article  41  CFEU  also  includes  the  obligation  of  the

administration to give reasons for its decisions117.

115. The duty to give reasons entails informing the addressee of the decision of the factual and legal
grounds on which it is based, thereby enabling the person to decide whether to seek judicial review
and facilitate the exercise of that review by the courts118.

116. The EDPB must articulate, in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning underlying in its decision
in such a way as to enable the persons affected to ascertain the reasons for its decision. While the
EDPB does not need to state all legal and factual reasons leading to its decision, it must explain those
which were of decisive importance119. In the same vein, the EDPB is also not obliged to adopt an
explicit position on all the arguments raised. It is sufficient for the decision to set out, in a clear and
unambiguous manner, the principal issues of law and of fact upon which it is based and which are
necessary in order that the reasoning which has led the EDPB to its decision may be understood. What
ultimately matters is that the statement of reasons by the EDPB enables all persons affected by the
decision to ascertain whether the relevant provisions have been applied correctly.

117. The  EDPB must  in its  statement  of  reasons  set  out  all  the  relevant grounds  and motives  for the
adoption of its decision – including those that originate from the national level. This means that insofar
as the facts set out in the draft decision or related documents are decisive for the decision of the EDPB,
then the EDPB should include them in its statement of reasons120.

118. In relation to objections where the EDPB simply agrees with the reasons contained in the draft decision
by the LSA or the decision of the LSA not to follow the relevant and reasoned objection (or to consider
them not relevant or reasoned), the EDPB may fulfil its duty to state reasons by simply referring back
to the position of the LSA, provided the affected persons were informed of those positions of the LSA
and given the opportunity to be heard in relating to those positions121.

119. In light of the aforementioned considerations, the binding decision adopted by the EDPB on the basis
of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR should in principle include a summary of dispute as well as an assessment of
whether the conditions for adopting a binding decision are met. For each objection raised, the EDPB
will then in principle122:

summarise main elements of the draft decision which are related to the subject matter of the
objection;
summarise the main elements of the objection raised;
summarise the position of the LSA or CSA in relation to the objection raised; and
summarise  the  position  of  the persons  who  may  be  adversely  affected  in  relation  to  the
objection.

Once the relevant elements have been set out, the EDPB will assess, in relation to each objection
raised, whether the EDPB meets requirements of Article (24) GDPR and, if so, address the merits of
the objection in the binding decision123.

120. The operative parts of the decision should be clearly identified as such and included at the end of the
decision, rendering explicit to what extent the competent authority is required/not required to amend
its draft decision before finalisation.

8 JUDICIAL REMEDIES

121. Article 47 of the Charter guarantees the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. This is linked
to the need to ensure the compatibility of the acts of the EU institutions with the European Union
legal order, which is a task generally entrusted to the Court of Justice and to the courts of the European
Union.

122. Good administrative behaviour entails informing persons affected by the measure of the available
appeal mechanism124. The EDPB decision will refer to the possibilities open to appeal it (i.e. to seek
annulment), whereas  the  competent  supervisory  authority  will  refer  to  the  appeal  mechanisms
available at national level. The competent supervisory authority may in its final decision also choose
make reference to the possibilities to seek annulment of the decision of the EDPB on the basis of which
the final decision was adopted, as clarified by Recital (143) GDPR (in addition to providing information
regarding possible appeal mechanisms at national level in relation to its final decision).

123 It should be noted that the EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by
objections deemed not to meet the requirements stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR. Where that is the case, the
decision of the EDPB is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other
cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the
objections raised by the CSAs.
124 See also Commission ‘Code of Good administrative behaviour’, Point 3, third indent: ‘Where Community law
so provides, measures notified to an interested party should clearly state that an appeal is possible and describe
how to submit it, (the name and office address of the person or department with whom the appeal must be
lodged and the deadline for lodging it).Where appropriate, decisions should refer to the possibility of starting
judicial proceedings and/ or of lodging a complaint with the European Ombudsman in accordance with Article
230  or  195  of  the  Treaty  establishing  the  European  Community.’  European  Ombudsman  ‘Code  of  Good
administrative behaviour’, Article 19 - indication of the possibilities of appeal: ‘A decision of the Institution which
may  adversely  affect  the  rights  or  interests  of  a  private  person  shall  contain  an  indication  of  the  appeal
possibilities available for challenging the decision. It shall in particular indicate the nature of the remedies, the
bodies before which they can be exercised, as well as the time limits for exercising them. Decisions shall in
particular refer to the possibility of judicial proceedings and complaints to the European Ombudsman under the
conditions specified in, respectively, Articles [263] and Articles [228 TFEU].’

123. While Recital (143) refers to the possibility of persons directly and individually concerned by a decision
of the EDPB bringing an action for annulment before the CJEU, the position on standing will ultimately
be assessed by the CJEU in light of the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU.

124. An action for annulment before the Court of Justice does not suspend the effects of the decision of
the EDPB125. The competent SAs will therefore still have to comply with the decision of the EDPB
adopted on the basis of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, notwithstanding the appeal. This is without prejudice
to the right to effective judicial remedy by the controller or processor at national level in accordance
with Article 78 GDPR.

8.1 Supervisory authorities

125. Article 65(2) GDPR makes clear that decisions adopted by the EDPB on the basis of Article 65(1)(a)
GDPR are binding upon the lead supervisory authority and all the concerned supervisory authorities.
National SAs must adopt their final decision on the basis of the EDPB decision. Article 65(2) also makes
clear the decision is an act “addressed to” the LSA and the CSAs - it does not directly address any third
parties126.

126. According  to  Recital (143) GDPR,  as  addressees  of  the  decisions  of  the  Board,  the  concerned
supervisory authorities which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being
notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. This means, inter alia, that the supervisory
authorities acting before the Court of Justice against a binding decision of the EDPB would need to do
so relying on one of the listed grounds for annulment contained in Article 263 TFEU.

127. Although  only  the  LSA  and  some CSAs  (pursuant  to  Article  60(8)  and  (9)  GDPR)  shall  adopt  their
national decision on the basis of the EDPB binding decision, the decision is addressed to all the CSAs
involved  in the  cross-border  case.  Article 65(2) GDPR  mentions  all  the  CSAs as  addressees of the
decision and the final national decision is the product of a co-decision making process which is strongly
affected  by  the  decision  of  the  EDPB.  As  a  consequence,  all  the  supervisory  authorities  that  are
concerned in a given cross-border case (see Article 4(22) GDPR) are “addressed“ by the decision and
therefore entitled to bring action for annulment of the EDPB decision.

128. Although the supervisory authorities concerned, as Members of the EDPB, gain knowledge of the
content of the EDPB binding decision in the occasion of its adoption pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR,
the time limitation for them to bring action will start when the decision is notified to them by the EDPB
Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Chair127 and using the internal information and communication
system128.

125 Article 278 TFEU (ex Article 242 TEC): “Actions brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union shall
not have suspensory effect. The Court may, however, if it considers that circumstances so require, order that
application of the contested act be suspended.”
126 See also paragraph 98 above.
127 See, e.g. Judgment of  the  General  Court in Access  Info  Europe  v  Council, T-233/09, ECLI:EU:T:2011:105,
paragraph 28 (“Where the addressee has been notified, it is the date of notification which is to be taken into
consideration for the purposes of calculating the time allowed [...] for bringing proceedings, not the date on
which  cognisance was  taken,  which  comes  into  play  only  as  an  alternative  in  cases  where  there  is  no
notification”).

8.2 Controller, processor, complainant, or other entity

129. Entities other than the addressees may be entitled to act before the Court of Justice for the annulment

of the EDPB binding decision if the decision is of direct and individual concern to them129.

130. Recital (143) explicitly mentions that controllers, processors, or complainants may be directly and
individually concerned by an EDPB binding decision. These requirements are, however, interpreted
restrictively by the Court of Justice and therefore a case-by-case analysis is necessary130.

131. The action for annulment by a controller, processor or complainant, needs to be brought within two
months of the publication of the EDPB binding decision on the website of the Board131. As indicated
earlier, the  publication of the  EDPB’s  decision on  its website occurs without  delay  after  the  final
national decision is notified to the controller, processor and/or data subject132.

132. Since the national decision needs to attach the EDPB decision, the person who receives notification of
the national decision will at the same time receive the Article 65(1)(a) decision. However, this does
not amount to “notification” of the EDPB decision in the sense of the Treaties as interpreted by the
CJEU133. Additionally, according to Article 263 TFEU and the CJEU case law, the criterion of the day on
which a measure comes to the knowledge of the applicant is a subsidiary one, i.e. it is only relevant
where  the  act  is  neither  published  nor  notified  to  the  applicant134. Consequently,  the  two-month
period starts when the decision is published on the website of the Board.

133. Without  prejudice  to  this  right  under  Article 263  TFEU,  each  natural  or  legal  person  also  has  an
effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against those final decisions taken by
supervisory authorities, which produces legal effects concerning that person135. This right has to be
exercised in accordance to the applicable national legislation. Article 78(4) GDPR specifies that where
proceedings  are brought  against  a  decision of  a  supervisory  authority which was  preceded  by  an
opinion or decision of the Board in the consistency mechanism, the supervisory authority shall forward
that opinion or decision to the court.

134. Where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing an Article 65 GDPR decision of the EDPB is
challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the EDPB is at issue, the national
court  does  not  have  the  power  to  declare  the  EDPB’s  Article 65  GDPR  decision  invalid. Where  it

131 Recital 143 GDPR.
132 Article 65 (5) GDPR.
133 According to the CJEU case law, “notification is the operation by which the author of a decision of individual
relevance communicates the latter to the addressees and thus puts them in a position to take cognisance of it”
(Judgment of the Court of First Instance in Olsen v Commission, T-17/02, ECLI:EU:T:2005:218, paragraph 74).
134 Judgment of the Court of First Instance in Olsen v Commission, T-17/02, ECLI:EU:T:2005:218, paragraphs 73
and 81 (specifying that “the criterion of the day on which a measure came to the knowledge of an applicant, as
the starting point of the period prescribed for instituting proceedings, is subsidiary to the criteria of publication
or notification of the measure”, and therefore where there is publication “it is of little importance whether the
applicant  had  sufficient  knowledge  of  the  contested  decision  [earlier]”  since  that  “issue  is  not  relevant  for
determining the starting point of the period for bringing an action because it is not appropriate to apply [...] the
criterion of the day on which a measure came to the knowledge of an applicant, which is provided for in the
alternative” in Article 263 TFEU).

dismissal or rejection of complaints, but not including non-legally binding measures.

considers  the  decision  invalid, it must  refer  the  question  of  validity  to  the  Court  of  Justice  in
accordance with Article 267 TFEU136.

135. However, a national court may not refer a question on the validity of a decision of the EDPB when the
requesting natural or legal person was under the legal conditions to bring an action for annulment of
that decision before the CJEU (in particular if it was directly and individually concerned), but had not
done so within the two-month period laid down in Article 263 TFEU. Therefore, when the directly and
individually  concerned  persons decide  to not  bring  an  action  for  annulment  of  the  EDPB  binding
decision, this will prevent them from challenging the validity of the EDPB binding decision in front of
national courts.
