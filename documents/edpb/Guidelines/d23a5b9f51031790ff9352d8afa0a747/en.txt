The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 70(1)(e) and (l) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament 
and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing 
of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data,  and  repealing  Directive  95/46/EC, 
(hereinafter “GDPR”), 

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended 
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20181, 

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure, 

Having regard to the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Personal data breach notification under 
Regulation 2016/679, WP250 rev.01, 

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES 

0  PREFACE 

1.  On 3 October 2017, the Working Party 29 (hereinafter “WP29”) adopted its Guidelines on Personal 
data breach notification under Regulation 2016/679 (WP250 rev.01)2, which were endorsed by the 
European Data Protection Board (hereinafter “EDPB”) at its first Plenary meeting3. This document is a 
slightly updated version of those guidelines. Any reference to the WP29 Guidelines on Personal data 
breach notification under Regulation 2016/679 (WP250 rev.01) should, from now on, be interpreted 
as a reference to these EDPB Guidelines 9/2022. 

2.  The  EDPB  noticed  that  there  was  a  need  to  clarify  the  notification  requirements  concerning  the 
personal data breaches at non-EU establishments. The paragraph concerning this matter has been 
revised and updated, while the rest of the document was left unchanged, except for editorial changes. 
The revision concerns, more specifically, paragraph 73 in Section II.C.2 of this document. 

INTRODUCTION   

3.  The GDPR introduced the requirement for a personal data breach (henceforth “breach”) to be notified 
to the competent national supervisory authority4 (or in the case of a cross-border breach, to the lead 
authority) and, in certain cases, to communicate the breach to the individuals whose personal data 
have been affected by the breach.   

4.  Obligations  to  notify  in  cases  of  breaches  existed  for  certain  organisations,  such  as  providers  of 
publicly-available  electronic  communications  services  (as  specified  in  Directive  2009/136/EC  and 
Regulation (EU) No 611/2013)5. There  were  also some Member States that already had  their own

national breach notification obligation. This might included the obligation to notify breaches involving 
categories  of  controllers  in  addition  to  providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communication 
services (for example in Germany and Italy), or an obligation to report all breaches involving personal 
data (such as in the Netherlands). Other Member States might had relevant Codes of Practice (for 
example, in Ireland6). Whilst a number of EU data protection authorities encouraged controllers to 
report breaches, the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC7, which the GDPR replaced, did not contain a 
specific  breach  notification  obligation  and  therefore  such  a  requirement  was  new  for  many 
organisations. The GDPR makes notification mandatory for all controllers unless a breach is unlikely to 
result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals8. Processors also have an important role to 
play and they must notify any breach to their controller9.  

5.  The EDPB considers that the notification requirement has a number of benefits. When notifying the 
supervisory authority, controllers can obtain advice on whether the affected individuals need to be 
informed. Indeed, the supervisory authority may order the controller to inform those individuals about 
the breach10. Communicating a breach to individuals allows the controller to provide information on 
the  risks  presented  as  a  result  of  the  breach  and  the  steps  those  individuals  can  take  to  protect 
themselves from its potential  consequences. The focus of any breach response plan should be on 
protecting individuals and their personal data. Consequently, breach notification should be seen as a 
tool enhancing compliance in relation to the protection of personal data. At the same time, it should 
be noted that failure to report a breach to either an individual or a supervisory authority may mean 
that under Article 83 GDPR a possible sanction is applicable to the controller.  

6.  Controllers and processors are therefore encouraged to plan in advance and put in place processes to 
be  able  to  detect  and  promptly  contain  a  breach,  to  assess  the  risk  to  individuals11,  and  then  to 
determine whether it is necessary to notify the competent supervisory authority, and to communicate 
the breach to the individuals concerned when necessary. Notification to the supervisory authority 
should form a part of that incident response plan.     

7.  The GDPR contains provisions on when a breach needs to be notified, and to whom, as well as what 
information should be provided as part of the notification. Information required for the notification 
can be provided in phases, but in any event controllers should act on any breach in a timely manner.  

8. 

In its Opinion 03/2014 on personal data breach notification12, WP29 provided guidance to controllers 
in  order  to  help  them  to  decide  whether  to  notify  data  subjects  in  case  of  a  breach.  The  opinion 
considered the obligation of providers of electronic communications regarding Directive 2002/58/EC 
and provided examples from multiple sectors, in the context of the then draft GDPR, and presented 
good practices for all controllers.  

9.  The current Guidelines explain the mandatory breach notification and communication requirements 
of the GDPR and some of the steps controllers and processors can take to meet these obligations. They

a provider that is contracted to deliver part of an electronic communications service (without having a direct 
contractual relationship with subscribers) is obliged to notify the contracting provider in the event of a personal 
data breach.  
10 See Articles 34(4) and 58(2)(e) GDPR.

operations likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Article 35(1) and (11).

scenarios.  
I. PERSONAL DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION UNDER THE GDPR   

 A.  Basic security considerations  

10. One  of  the  requirements  of  the  GDPR  is  that,  by  using  appropriate  technical  and  organisational 
measures, personal data shall be processed in a manner to ensure the appropriate security of the 
personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental 
loss, destruction or damage13.   

11. Accordingly, the GDPR requires both controllers and processors to have in place appropriate technical 
and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the personal 
data being processed. They should take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation 
and the nature, the scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood 
and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons14. Also, the GDPR requires all appropriate 
technological protection an organisational measures to be in place to establish immediately whether 
a breach has taken place, which then determines whether the notification obligation is engaged 15.  

12. Consequently, a key element of any data security policy is being able, where possible, to prevent a 

breach and, where it nevertheless occurs, to react to it in a timely manner.  

 B.   What is a personal data breach?  

1. Definition  

13. As part of any attempt to address a breach the controller should first be able to recognise one. The 

GDPR defines a “personal data breach” in Article 4(12) as:  

“a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised 
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.”  

14. What is meant by “destruction” of personal data should be quite clear: this is where the data no longer 
exists, or no longer exists in a form  that is of any use to the controller. “Damage” should also be 
relatively clear: this is where personal data has been altered, corrupted, or is no longer complete. In 
terms of “loss” of personal data, this should be interpreted as the data may still exist, but the controller 
has lost control or access to it, or no longer has it in its possession. Finally, unauthorised or unlawful 
processing may include disclosure of personal data to (or access by) recipients who are not authorised 
to receive (or access) the data, or any other form of processing which violates the GDPR.   

Example 

An example of loss of personal data can include where a device containing a copy of a controller’s 
customer database has been lost or stolen. A further example of loss may be where the only copy of 
a set of personal data has been encrypted by ransomware, or has been encrypted by the controller 
using a key that is no longer in its possession.  

15. What should be clear is that a breach is a type of security incident. However, as indicated by Article 
4(12), the GDPR only applies where there is a breach of personal data. The consequence of such a 
breach is that the controller will be unable to ensure compliance with the principles relating to the

processing of personal data as outlined in Article 5 GDPR. This highlights the difference between a 
security incident and a personal data breach – in essence, whilst all personal data breaches are security 
incidents, not all security incidents are necessarily personal data breaches16.   

16. The potential adverse effects of a breach on individuals are considered below.  

2. Types of personal data breaches  

17. In  its  Opinion  03/2014  on  breach  notification,  WP29  explained  that  breaches  can  be  categorised 

according to the following three well-known information security principles17:   

• 

• 

• 

“Confidentiality breach” - where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access 
to, personal data.  

“Integrity breach” - where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data.  

“Availability  breach”  -  where  there  is  an  accidental  or  unauthorised  loss  of  access 18 to,  or 
destruction of, personal data.  

18. It should also be noted that, depending on the circumstances, a breach can concern confidentiality, 

integrity and availability of personal data at the same time, as well as any combination of these.  

19. Whereas  determining  if  there  has  been  a  breach  of  confidentiality  or  integrity  is  relatively  clear, 
whether there has been an availability breach may be less obvious. A breach will always be regarded 
as an availability breach when there has been a permanent loss of, or destruction of, personal data.    

Example 

Examples of a loss of availability include where data has been deleted either accidentally or by an 
unauthorised person, or, in the example of securely encrypted data, the decryption key has been lost. 
In the event that the controller cannot restore access to the data, for example, from a backup, then 
this is regarded as a permanent loss of availability.   

A loss of availability may also occur where there has been significant disruption to the normal service 
of an organisation, for example, experiencing a power failure or denial of service attack, rendering 
personal data unavailable. 

20. The  question  may  be  asked  whether  a  temporary  loss  of  availability  of  personal  data  should  be 
considered  as  a  breach  and,  if  so,  one  which  needs  to  be  notified.  Article  32  GDPR,  “security  of 
processing”, explains that when implementing technical and organisational measures to ensure a level 
of security appropriate to the risk, consideration should be given, amongst other things, to “the ability 
to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and 

                                                     

16 It should be noted that a security incident is not limited to threat models where an attack is made on an 
organisation  from  an  external  source,  but  includes  incidents  from  internal  processing  that  breach  security 
principles.  
17 See WP29 Opinion 03/2014.  
18 It is well established that “access” is fundamentally part of “availability”. See, for example, NIST 
SP80053rev4, which defines “availability” as: "Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information," 
available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf. CNSSI-4009 also refers 
to: “Timely, reliable access to data and information services for authorized users”. See 
https://rmf.org/wpcontent/uploads/2017/10/CNSSI-4009.pdf. ISO/IEC 27000:2016 also defines “availability” as 
“Property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity”: 
https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:isoiec:27000:ed-4:v1:en

services,” and “the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in 
the event of a physical or technical incident”.  

21. Therefore, a security incident resulting in personal data being made unavailable for a period of time is 
also a type of breach, as the lack of access to the data can have a significant impact on the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons. To be clear, where personal data is unavailable due to planned system 
maintenance being carried out this is not a ‘breach of security’ as defined in Article 4(12) GDPR.   

22. As with a permanent loss or destruction of personal data (or indeed any other type of breach), a breach 
involving the temporary loss of availability should be documented in accordance with Article 33(5) 
GDPR. This assists the controller in demonstrating accountability to the supervisory authority, which 
may ask to see those records19. However, depending on the circumstances of the breach, it may or 
may not require notification to the supervisory authority and communication to affected individuals. 
The controller will need to assess the likelihood and severity of the impact on the rights and freedoms 
of natural persons as a result of the lack of availability of personal data. In accordance with Article 33 
GDPR, the controller will need to notify unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals’ 
rights and freedoms. Of course, this will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.   

Example 

In the context of a hospital, if critical medical data about patients are unavailable, even temporarily, 
this could present a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms; for example, operations may be cancelled 
and lives put at risk.                                                                                                          

Conversely, in the case of a media company’s systems being unavailable for several hours (e.g. due to 
a power outage), if that company is then prevented from sending newsletters to its subscribers, this is 
unlikely to present a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. 

23. It should be noted that although a loss of availability of a controller’s systems might be only temporary 
and may not have an impact on individuals, it is important for the controller to consider all possible 
consequences of a breach, as it may still require notification for other reasons.   

Example 

Infection by ransomware (malicious software which encrypts the controller’s data until a ransom is 
paid) could lead to a temporary loss of availability if the data can be restored from backup. However, 
a network intrusion still occurred, and notification could be required if the incident is qualified as 
confidentiality breach (i.e. personal data is accessed by the attacker) and this presents a risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals.   

3. The possible consequences of a personal data breach  

24. A breach can potentially have a range of significant adverse effects on individuals, which can result in 
physical, material, or non-material damage. The GDPR explains that this can include loss of control 
over their personal data, limitation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, 
unauthorised  reversal  of  pseudonymisation,  damage  to  reputation,  and  loss  of  confidentiality  of 
personal data protected by professional secrecy. It can also include any other significant economic or 
social disadvantage to those individuals20.  

25. Accordingly,  the  GDPR  requires  the  controller  to  notify  a  breach  to  the  competent  supervisory 
authority, unless it is unlikely to result in a risk of such adverse effects taking place. Where there is a 

                                                     

19 See Article 33(5) GDPR. 
20 See also Recitals 85 and 75 GDPR. 
 
Adopted 

 

9 

likely high risk of these adverse effects occurring, the GDPR requires the controller to communicate 
the breach to the affected individuals as soon as is reasonably feasible21.  

26. The importance of being able to identify a breach, to assess the risk to individuals, and then notify if 

required, is emphasised in Recital 87 of the GDPR:  

“It  should  be  ascertained  whether  all  appropriate  technological  protection  and  organisational 
measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken 
place  and  to  inform  promptly  the  supervisory  authority  and  the  data  subject.  The  fact  that  the 
notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the 
nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data 
subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with 
its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.”   

27. Further guidelines on assessing the risk of adverse effects to individuals are considered in section IV.   

28. If controllers fail to notify either the supervisory authority or data subjects of a data breach or both 
even  though  the  requirements  of  Articles  33  and/or  34  GDPR  are  fulfilled,  then  the  supervisory 
authority is presented with a choice that must include consideration of all of the corrective measures 
at its disposal, which would include consideration of the imposition of the appropriate administrative 
fine22, either accompanying a corrective measure under Article 58(2) GDPR or on its own. Where an 
administrative fine is chosen, its value can be up to 10,000,000 EUR or up to 2 % if the total worldwide 
annual turnover of an undertaking under Article 83(4)(a) of the GDPR. It is also important to bear in 
mind  that  in  some  cases,  the  failure  to  notify  a  breach  could  reveal  either  an  absence  of  existing 
security  measures  or  an  inadequacy  of  the  existing  security  measures.  The  WP29  Guidelines  on 
administrative fines state: “The occurrence of several different infringements committed together in 
any particular single case means that the supervisory authority is able to apply the administrative fines 
at a level which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive within the limit of the gravest infringement”. 
In that case, the supervisory authority will also have the possibility to issue sanctions for failure to 
notify  or  communicate  the  breach  (Articles  33  and  34  GDPR)  on  the  one  hand,  and  absence  of 
(adequate)  security  measures  (Article  32  GDPR)  on  the  other  hand,  as  they  are  two  separate 
infringements.    
II. ARTICLE 33 - NOTIFICATION TO THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY  

A. When to notify  
1. Article 33 requirements  

29. Article 33(1) GDPR provides that:  

“In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, 
not  later  than  72  hours  after  having  become  aware  of  it,  notify  the  personal  data  breach  to  the 
supervisory  authority  competent  in  accordance  with  Article  55,  unless  the  personal  data  breach  is 
unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the 
supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.”  

30. Recital 87 GDPR states23:

“It  should  be  ascertained  whether  all  appropriate  technological  protection  and  organisational 
measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken 
place  and  to  inform  promptly  the  supervisory  authority  and  the  data  subject.  The  fact  that  the 
notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the 
nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data 
subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with 
its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation.”  

2. When does a controller become “aware”?  

31. As detailed above, the GDPR requires that, in the case of a breach, the controller shall notify the breach 
without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it. This 
may raise the question of when a controller can be considered to have become “aware” of a breach. 
The  EDPB  considers  that  a  controller  should  be  regarded  as  having  become  “aware”  when  that 
controller has a reasonable degree of certainty that a security incident has occurred that has led to 
personal data being compromised.   

32. However, as indicated earlier, the GDPR requires the controller to implement all appropriate technical 
protection and organisational measures to establish immediately whether a breach has taken place 
and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subjects. It also states that the fact that 
the notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular 
the nature and gravity of the breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject24. 
This puts an obligation on the controller to ensure that they will be “aware” of any breaches in a timely 
manner so that they can take appropriate action.  

33. When, exactly, a controller can be considered to be “aware” of a particular breach will depend on the 
circumstances of the specific breach. In some cases, it will be relatively clear from the outset that there 
has been a breach, whereas in others, it may take some time to establish if personal data have been 
compromised.  However,  the  emphasis  should  be  on  prompt  action  to  investigate  an  incident  to 
determine whether personal data have indeed been breached, and if so, to take remedial action and 
notify if required.  

Examples  
  
1. 
In the case of a loss of a USB key with unencrypted personal data it is often not possible to 
ascertain whether unauthorised persons gained access to that data. Nevertheless, even though the 
controller may not be able to establish if a confidentiality breach has taken place, such a case has to 
be notified as there is a reasonable degree of certainty that an availability breach has occurred; the 
controller would become “aware” when it realised the USB key had been lost.     

2. 
A third party informs a controller that they have accidentally received the personal data of 
one of its customers and provides evidence of the unauthorised disclosure. As the controller has been 
presented  with  clear  evidence  of  a  confidentiality  breach  then  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  has 
become “aware”.  

3. 
A controller detects that there has been a possible intrusion into its network. The controller 
checks its systems to establish whether personal data held on that system has been compromised and 
confirms this is the case. Once again, as the controller now has clear evidence of a breach there can 
be no doubt that it has become “aware”.

4. 
A cybercriminal contacts the controller after having hacked its system in order to ask for a 
ransom. In that case, after checking its system to confirm it has been attacked the controller has clear 
evidence that a breach has occurred and there is no doubt that it has become aware.  

34. After first being informed of a potential breach by an individual, a media organisation, or another 
source, or when it has itself detected a security incident, the controller may undertake a short period 
of investigation in order to establish whether or not a breach has in fact occurred. During this period 
of investigation the controller may not be regarded as being “aware”. However, it is expected that the 
initial investigation should begin as soon as possible and establish with a reasonable degree of certainty 
whether a breach has taken place; a more detailed investigation can then follow.   

35. Once the controller has become aware, a notifiable breach must be notified without undue delay, and 
where feasible, not later than 72 hours. During this period, the controller should assess the likely risk 
to individuals in order to determine whether the requirement for notification has been triggered, as 
well as the action(s) needed to address the breach. However, a controller may already have an initial 
assessment of the potential risk that could result from a breach as part of a data protection impact 
assessment (DPIA)25 made prior to carrying out the processing operation concerned. However, the 
DPIA may be more generalised in comparison to the specific circumstances of any actual breach, and 
so in any event an additional assessment taking into account those circumstances will need to be made. 
For more detail on assessing risk, see section IV.   

36. In most cases these preliminary actions should be completed soon after the initial alert (i.e. when the 
controller or processor suspects there has been a security incident which may involve personal data.) 
– it should take longer than this only in exceptional cases.  

Example  

An individual informs the controller that they have received an email impersonating the controller 
which contains personal data relating to his (actual) use of the controller’s service, suggesting that the 
security  of  the  controller  has  been  compromised.  The  controller  conducts  a  short  period  of 
investigation and identifies an intrusion into their network and evidence of unauthorised access to 
personal data. The controller would now be considered as “aware” and notification to the supervisory 
authority is required unless this is unlikely to present a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. 
The controller will need to take appropriate remedial action to address the breach.  

37. The controller should therefore have internal processes in place to be able to detect and address a 
breach. For example, for finding some irregularities in data processing the controller or processor may 
use certain technical measures such as data flow and log analysers, from which is possible to define 
events and alerts by correlating any log data26. It is important that when a breach is detected it is 
reported upwards to the appropriate level of management so it can be addressed and, if required, 
notified  in  accordance  with  Article  33  and,  if  necessary,  Article  34.  Such  measures  and  reporting 
mechanisms  could  be  detailed  in  the  controller’s  incident  response  plans  and/or  governance 
arrangements. These will help the controller to plan effectively and determine who has operational 
responsibility  within  the  organisation  for  managing  a  breach  and  how  or  whether  to  escalate  an 
incident as appropriate.  

38. The controller should also have in place arrangements with any processors the controller uses, which 

themselves have an obligation to notify the controller in the event of a breach (see below).   

                                                     

25 See WP29 Guidelines WP248 on DPIAs here: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44137     
26 It should be noted that log data facilitating auditability of, e.g., storage, modifications or erasure of data may 
also qualify as personal data relating to the person who initiated the respective processing operation.

39. Whilst it is the responsibility of controllers and processors to put in place suitable measures to be able 
to prevent, react and address a breach, there are some practical steps that should be taken in all cases.  

• 

Information concerning all security-related events should be directed towards a responsible 
person or persons with the task of addressing incidents, establishing the existence of a breach 
and assessing risk.  

•  Risk to individuals as a result of a breach should then be assessed (likelihood of no risk, risk or 

high risk), with relevant sections of the organisation being informed.  

•  Notification to the supervisory authority, and potentially communication of the breach to the 

affected individuals should be made, if required.  

•  At the same time, the controller should act to contain and recover the breach. Documentation 

of the breach should take place as it develops.  

40. Accordingly, it should be clear that there is an obligation on the controller to act on any initial alert and 
establish whether or not a breach has, in fact, occurred. This brief period allows for some investigation, 
and for the controller to gather evidence and other relevant details. However, once the controller has 
established with a reasonable degree of certainty that a breach has occurred, if the conditions in Article 
33(1) GDPR have been met, it must then notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and, 
where feasible, not later than 72 hours27. If a controller fails to act in a timely manner and it becomes 
apparent that a breach did occur, this could be considered as a failure to notify in accordance with 
Article 33 GDPR.  

41. Article 32 GDPR makes clear that the controller and processor should have appropriate technical and 
organisational measures in place to ensure an appropriate level of security of personal data: the ability 
to detect, address, and report a breach in a timely manner should be seen as essential elements of 
these measures.   

3. Joint controllers  

42. Article 26 GDPR concerns joint controllers and specifies that joint controllers shall determine their 
respective responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR28. This will include determining which party 
will have responsibility for complying with the obligations under Articles 33 and 34 GDPR. The EDPB 
recommends  that  the  contractual  arrangements  between  joint  controllers  include  provisions  that 
determine which controller will take the lead on, or be responsible for, compliance with the GDPR’s 
breach notification obligations.   

4. Processor obligations  

43. The controller retains overall responsibility for the protection of personal data, but the processor has 
an important role to play to enable the controller to comply with its obligations; and this includes 
breach notification. Indeed, Article 28(3) GDPR specifies that the processing by a processor shall be 
governed by a contract or other legal act. Article 28(3)(f) states that the contract or other legal act shall 
stipulate  that  the  processor  “assists  the  controller  in  ensuring  compliance  with  the  obligations 
pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available 
to the processor”.   

44. Article 33(2) GDPR makes it clear that if a processor is used by a controller and the processor becomes 
aware of a breach of the personal data it is processing on behalf of the controller, it must notify the 
controller “without undue delay”. It should be noted that the processor does not need to first assess 
the likelihood of risk arising from a breach before notifying the controller; it is the controller that must 
make this assessment on becoming aware of the breach. The processor just needs to establish whether 
                                                     

27 See Regulation No 1182/71 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits, available at:

a breach has occurred and then notify the controller. The controller uses the processor to achieve its 
purposes; therefore, in principle, the controller should be considered as “aware” once the processor 
has  informed  it  of  the  breach.  The  obligation  on  the  processor  to  notify  its  controller  allows  the 
controller  to  address  the  breach  and  to  determine  whether  or  not  it  is  required  to  notify  the 
supervisory authority in accordance with Article 33(1) and the affected individuals in accordance with 
Article 34(1). The controller might also want to investigate the breach, as the processor might not be 
in a position to know all the relevant facts relating to the matter, for example, if a copy or backup of 
personal data destroyed or lost by the processor is still held by the controller. This may affect whether 
the controller would then need to notify.   

45. The GDPR does not provide an explicit time limit within which the processor must alert the controller, 
except that it must do so “without undue delay”. Therefore, the EDPB recommends the processor 
promptly notifies the controller, with further information about the breach provided in phases as more 
details become available. This is important in order to help the controller to meet the requirement of 
notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.   

46. As  is  explained  above,  the  contract  between  the  controller  and  processor  should  specify  how  the 
requirements expressed in Article 33(2) should be met in addition to other provisions in the GDPR. This 
can include requirements for early notification by the processor that in turn support the controller’s 
obligations to report to the supervisory authority within 72 hours.     

47. Where  the  processor  provides  services  to  multiple  controllers  that  are  all  affected  by  the  same 

incident, the processor will have to report details of the incident to each controller.  

48. A  processor  could  make  a  notification  on  behalf  of  the  controller,  if  the  controller  has  given  the 
processor the proper authorisation and this is part of the contractual arrangements between controller 
and processor. Such notification must be made in accordance with Article 33 and 34 GDPR. However, 
it is important to note that the legal responsibility to notify remains with the controller.  

B. Providing information to the supervisory authority  
1. Information to be provided  

49. When a controller notifies a breach to the supervisory authority, Article 33(3) GDPR states that, at the 

minimum, it should:  

“(a)  describe  the  nature  of  the  personal  data  breach  including  where  possible,  the  categories  and 
approximate  number  of  data  subjects  concerned  and  the  categories  and  approximate  number  of 
personal data records concerned;   

(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point 

where more information can be obtained;   

(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;   

(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data 

breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.”  

50. The GDPR does not define categories of data subjects or personal data records. However, the EDPB 
suggests categories of data subjects to refer to the various types of individuals whose personal data 
has been affected by a breach: depending on the descriptors used, this could include, amongst others, 
children  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  people  with  disabilities,  employees  or  customers.  Similarly, 
categories of personal data records can refer to the different types of records that the controller may 
process,  such  as  health  data,  educational  records,  social  care  information,  financial  details,  bank 
account numbers, passport numbers and so on.  

 
Adopted 

 

14 

51. Recital 85 GDPR makes it clear that one of the purposes of notification is limiting damage to individuals. 
Accordingly, if the types of data subjects or the types of personal data indicate a risk of particular 
damage occurring as a result of a breach (e.g. identity theft, fraud, financial loss, threat to professional 
secrecy), then it is important the notification indicates these categories. In this way, it is linked to the 
requirement of describing the likely consequences of the breach.  

52. Where precise information is not available (e.g. exact number of data subjects affected) this should 
not be a barrier to timely breach notification. The GDPR allows for approximations to be made in the 
number of individuals affected and the number of personal data records concerned. The focus should 
be directed towards addressing the adverse effects of the breach rather than providing precise figures.  

53. Thus, when it has become clear that here has been a breach, but the extent of it is not yet known, a 

notification in phases (see below) is a safe way to meet the notification obligations.   

54. Article 33(3) GDPR states that the controller “shall at least” provide this information with a notification, 
so  a  controller  can,  if  necessary,  choose  to  provide  further  details.  Different  types  of  breaches 
(confidentiality,  integrity  or  availability)  might  require  further  information  to  be  provided  to  fully 
explain the circumstances of each case.  

Example 

As  part  of  its  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority,  a  controller  may  find  it  useful  to  name  its 
processor if it is at the root cause of a breach, particularly if this has led to an incident affecting the 
personal data records of many other controllers that use the same processor.  

55. In any event, the supervisory authority may request further details as part of its investigation into a 

breach.  

2. Notification in phases  

56. Depending on the nature of  a breach, further investigation by  the  controller may be necessary to 

establish all of the relevant facts relating to the incident. Article 33(4) GDPR therefore states:  

“Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information 
may be provided in phases without undue further delay.”  

57. This  means  that  the  GDPR  recognises  that  controllers  will  not  always  have  all  of  the  necessary 
information concerning a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, as full and comprehensive 
details of the incident may not always be available during this initial period. As such, it allows for a 
notification in phases. It is more likely this will be the case for more complex breaches, such as some 
types  of  cyber  security  incidents  where,  for  example,  an  in-depth  forensic  investigation  may  be 
necessary to fully establish the nature of the breach and the extent to which personal data have been 
compromised.  Consequently,  in  many  cases  the  controller  will  have  to  do  more  investigation  and 
follow-up with additional information at a later point. This is permissible, providing the controller gives 
reasons for the delay, in accordance with Article 33(1) GDPR. The EDPB recommends that when the 
controller first notifies the supervisory authority, the controller should also inform the supervisory 
authority if the controller does not yet have all the required information and will provide more details 
later  on.  The  supervisory  authority  should  agree  how  and  when  additional  information  should  be 
provided. This does not prevent the controller from providing further information at any other stage, 
if it becomes aware of additional relevant details about the breach that need to be provided to the 
supervisory authority.  

58. The focus of the notification requirement is to encourage controllers to act promptly on a breach, 
contain it and, if possible, recover the compromised personal data, and to seek relevant advice from 
the supervisory authority. Notifying the supervisory authority within the first 72 hours can allow the 
controller to make sure that decisions about notifying or not notifying individuals are correct.  
 
Adopted 

15 

 

59. However,  the  purpose  of  notifying  the  supervisory  authority  is  not  solely  to  obtain  guidance  on 
whether to notify the affected individuals. It will be obvious in some cases that, due to the nature of 
the  breach  and  the  severity  of  the  risk,  the  controller  will  need  to  notify  the  affected  individuals 
without delay. For example, if there is an immediate threat of identity theft, or if special categories of 
personal data29 are disclosed online, the controller should act without undue delay  to contain the 
breach  and  to  communicate  it  to  the  individuals  concerned  (see  section  III).  In  exceptional 
circumstances, this might even take place before notifying the supervisory authority. More generally, 
notification of the supervisory authority may not serve as a justification for failure to communicate the 
breach to the data subject where it is required.   

60. It should also be clear that after making an initial notification, a controller could update the supervisory 
authority if a follow-up investigation uncovers evidence that the security incident was contained and 
no breach actually occurred. This information could then be added to the information already given to 
the supervisory authority and the incident recorded accordingly as not being a breach. There is no 
penalty for reporting an incident that ultimately transpires not to be a breach.   

Example 

A controller notifies the supervisory authority within 72 hours of detecting a breach that it has lost a 
USB key containing a copy of the personal data of some of its customers. The USB key is later found 
misfiled  within  the  controller’s  premises  and  recovered.  The  controller  updates  the  supervisory 
authority and requests the notification be amended.  

61. It  should  be  noted  that  a  phased  approach  to  notification  is  already  the  case  under  the  existing 

obligations of Directive 2002/58/EC, Regulation 611/2013 and other self-reported incidents.  

3. Delayed notifications  

62. Article 33(1) GDPR makes it clear that where notification to the supervisory authority is not made 
within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. This, along with the concept of 
notification in phases, recognises that a controller may not always be able to notify a breach within 
that time period, and that a delayed notification may be permissible.  

63. Such  a  scenario  might  take  place  where,  for  example,  a  controller  experiences  multiple,  similar 
confidentiality breaches over a short period of time, affecting large numbers of data subjects in the 
same way. A controller could become aware of a breach and, whilst beginning its investigation, and 
before notification, detect further similar breaches, which have different causes. Depending on the 
circumstances, it may take the controller some time to establish the extent of the breaches and, rather 
than notify each breach individually, the controller instead organises a meaningful notification that 
represents several very similar breaches, with possible different causes. This could lead to notification 
to the supervisory authority being delayed by more than 72 hours after the controller first becomes 
aware of these breaches.  

64. Strictly  speaking,  each  individual  breach  is  a  reportable  incident.  However,  to  avoid  being  overly 
burdensome, the controller may be  able to  submit a “bundled” notification  representing all these 
breaches, provided that they concern the same type of personal data breached in the same way, over 
a  relatively  short  space  of  time.  If  a  series  of  breaches  take  place  that  concern  different  types  of 
personal data, breached in different ways, then notification should proceed in the normal way, with 
each breach being reported in accordance with Article 33.   

                                                     

29 See Article 9 GDPR.  
 
Adopted 

 

16 

65. Whilst the GDPR allows for delayed notifications to an extent, this should not be seen as something 
that regularly takes place. It is worth pointing out that bundled notifications can also be made for 
multiple similar breaches reported within 72 hours.  

C. Cross-border breaches and breaches at non-EU establishments   
1. Cross-border breaches  

66. Where there is cross-border processing30 of personal data, a breach may affect data subjects in more 
than  one  Member  State.  Article  33(1)  GDPR  makes  it  clear  that  when  a  breach  has  occurred,  the 
controller  should  notify  the  supervisory  authority  competent  in  accordance  with  Article  55  of  the 
GDPR31. Article 55(1) GDPR says that:  

“Each supervisory authority shall be competent for the performance of the tasks assigned to and the 
exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation on the territory of its own 
Member State.”  

67. However, Article 56(1) GDPR states:  

“Without prejudice to Article 55, the supervisory authority of the main establishment or of the single 
establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as lead supervisory authority for 
the  cross-border  processing  carried  out  by  that  controller  or  processor  in  accordance  with  the 
procedure provided in Article 60.”  

68. Furthermore, Article 56(6) GDPR states:  

“The lead supervisory authority shall be the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor for the cross-
border processing carried out by that controller or processor.”  

69. This  means  that  whenever  a  breach  takes  place  in  the  context  of  cross-border  processing  and 
notification is required, the controller will need to notify the lead supervisory authority32. Therefore, 
when drafting its breach response plan, a controller must make an assessment as to which supervisory 
authority is the lead supervisory authority that it will need to notify33. This will allow the controller to 
respond promptly to a breach and to meet its obligations in respect of Article 33. It should be clear 
that in the event of a breach involving cross-border processing, notification must be made to the lead 
supervisory authority, which is not necessarily where the affected data subjects are located, or indeed 
where the breach has taken place. When notifying the lead authority, the controller should indicate, 
where appropriate, whether the breach involves establishments located in other Member States, and 
in which Member States data subjects are likely to have been affected by the breach. If the controller 
has any doubt as to the identity of the lead supervisory authority then it should, at a minimum, notify 
the local supervisory authority where the breach has taken place.   

2. Breaches at non-EU establishments  

70. Article 3 GDPR concerns the territorial scope of the GDPR, including when it applies to the processing 
of personal data by a controller or processor that is not established in the EU. In particular, Article 3(2) 
GDPR states34:

“This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a 
controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:   

(a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, 

to such data subjects in the Union; or   

(b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.”  

71. Article 3(3) GDPR is also relevant and states35:  

“This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by a controller not established in the Union, 
but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law.”  

72. Where  a  controller  not  established  in  the  EU  is  subject  to  Article  3(2)  or  Article  3(3)  GDPR  and 
experiences a breach, it is therefore still bound by the notification obligations under Articles 33 and 34 
GDPR. Article 27 GDPR requires a controller (and a processor) to designate a representative in the EU 
where Article 3(2) GDPR applies. 

73. However, the mere presence of a representative in a Member State does not trigger the one-stop-
shop system.36 For this reason the breach will need to be notified to every supervisory authority for 
which affected data subjects reside in their Member State. This (These) notification(s) shall be the 
responsibility of the controller.37 

74. Similarly, where a processor is subject to Article 3(2) GDPR, it will be bound by the obligations on 
processors, of particular relevance here, the duty to notify a breach to the controller under Article 
33(2) GDPR.  

D. Conditions where notification is not required   

75. Article 33(1) GDPR makes it clear that breaches that are “unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons” do not require notification to the supervisory authority. An example 
might be where personal data are already publically available and a disclosure of such data does not 
constitute a likely risk to the individual. This is in contrast to existing breach notification requirements 
for providers of publically available electronic communications services in Directive 2009/136/EC that 
state all relevant breaches have to be notified to the competent authority.   

76. In  its  Opinion  03/2014  on  breach  notification 38,  WP29  explained  that  a  confidentiality  breach  of 
personal data that were encrypted with a state of the art algorithm is still a personal data breach, and 
has  to  be  notified.  However,  if  the  confidentiality  of  the  key  is  intact  –  i.e.,  the  key  was  not 
compromised in any security breach, and was generated so that it cannot be ascertained by available 
technical means by any person who is not  authorised to access it –  then  the data  are  in principle 
unintelligible.  Thus,  the  breach  is  unlikely  to  adversely  affect  individuals  and  therefore  would  not

37  In 
https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-
article-3-version_en,  the EDPB considers the function of a representative in the Union as not compatible with 
the role of an external data protection officer (“DPO”), therefore the responsibility to notify the supervisory 
authority in case of a  personal data breach remains that of the controller in line with Article  27(5) GDPR. A 
representative can however be involved in the notification process if this has been explicitly stipulated in the 
written mandate.

require  communication  to  those  individuals 39.  However,  even  where  data  is  encrypted,  a  loss  or 
alteration can have negative consequences for data subjects where the controller has no adequate 
backups. In that instance communication to data subjects would be required, even if the data itself 
was subject to adequate encryption measures.   

77. WP29 also explained this would similarly be the case if personal data, such as passwords, were securely 
hashed and salted, the hashed value was calculated with a state of the art cryptographic keyed hash 
function, the key used to hash the data was not compromised in any breach, and the key used to hash 
the data has been generated in a way that it cannot be ascertained by available technological means 
by any person who is not authorised to access it.  

78. Consequently, if personal data have been made essentially unintelligible to unauthorised parties and 
where the data are a copy or a backup exists, a confidentiality breach involving properly encrypted 
personal data may not need to be notified to the supervisory authority. This is because such a breach 
is unlikely to pose a risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms. This of course means that the individual 
would not need to be informed either as there is likely no high risk. However, it should be borne in 
mind that while notification may initially not be required if there is no likely risk to the rights and 
freedoms of individuals, this may change over time and the risk would have to be re-evaluated. For 
example, if the key is subsequently found to be compromised, or a vulnerability in the encryption 
software is exposed, then notification may still be required.    

79. Furthermore, it should be noted that if there is a breach where there are no backups of the encrypted 
personal data then there will have been an availability breach, which could pose risks to individuals 
and therefore may require notification. Similarly, where a breach occurs involving the loss of encrypted 
data, even if a backup of the personal data exists this may still be a reportable breach, depending on 
the length of time taken to restore the data from that backup and the effect that lack of availability 
has on individuals. As Article 32(1)(c) GDPR states, an important factor of security is the “the ability to 
restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or 
technical incident”.  

Example 

A  breach  that  would  not  require  notification  to  the  supervisory  authority  would  be  the  loss  of  a 
securely encrypted mobile device, utilised by the controller and its staff. Provided the encryption key 
remains within the secure possession of the controller and this is not the sole copy of the personal 
data then the personal data would be inaccessible to an attacker. This means the breach is unlikely to 
result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects in question. If it later becomes evident 
that the encryption key was compromised or that the encryption software or algorithm is vulnerable, 
then the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons will change and thus notification may now 
be required.  

80. However, a failure to comply with Article 33 GDPR will exist where a controller does not notify the 
supervisory  authority  in  a  situation  where  the  data  has  not  actually  been  securely  encrypted. 
Therefore, when selecting encryption software controllers should carefully weigh the quality and the 
proper  implementation  of  the  encryption  offered,  understand  what  level  of  protection  it  actually 
provides and whether this is appropriate to the risks presented. Controllers should also be familiar 
with the specifics of how their encryption product functions. For instance, a device may be encrypted 
once it is switched off, but not while it is in stand-by mode. Some products using encryption have 
“default keys” that need to be changed by each customer to be effective. The encryption may also be 
considered currently adequate by security experts, but may become outdated in a few years’ time,

Adopted 

 

19 

meaning  it  is  questionable  whether  the  data  would  be  sufficiently  encrypted  by  that  product  and 
provide an appropriate level of protection.  
III. ARTICLE 34 – COMMUNICATION TO THE DATA SUBJECT  

A. Informing individuals  

81. In  certain  cases,  as  well  as  notifying  the  supervisory  authority,  the  controller  is  also  required  to 

communicate a breach to the affected individuals.   

Article 34(1) GDPR states:  

“When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural 
persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue 
delay.”  

82. Controllers should recall that notification to the supervisory authority is mandatory unless there is 
unlikely to be a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals as a result of a breach. In addition, where 
there is likely a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals as the result of a breach, individuals 
must also be informed. The threshold for communicating a breach to individuals is therefore higher 
than  for  notifying  supervisory  authorities  and  not  all  breaches  will  therefore  be  required  to  be 
communicated to individuals, thus protecting them from unnecessary notification fatigue.    

83. The GDPR states that communication of a breach to individuals should be made “without undue delay,” 
which means as soon as possible.  The main objective of notification to individuals is to provide specific 
information about steps they should take to protect themselves40. As noted above, depending on the 
nature of the breach and the risk posed, timely communication will help individuals to take steps to 
protect themselves from any negative consequences of the breach.   

84. Annex B of these Guidelines provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of when a breach may be likely 
to result in high risk to individuals and consequently instances when a controller will have to notify a 
breach to those affected.  

B. Information to be provided  

85. When notifying individuals, Article 34(2) GDPR specifies that:  

“The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear 
and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and 
measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).”  

86. According to this provision, the controller should at least provide the following information:  

• 
• 
• 
• 

a description of the nature of the breach;  
the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point;   
a description of the likely consequences of the breach; and   
a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the 
breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  

87. As an example of the measures taken to address the breach and to mitigate its possible adverse effects, 
the controller could state that, after having notified the breach to the relevant supervisory authority, 
the controller has received advice on managing the breach and lessening its impact. The controller 
should  also,  where  appropriate,  provide  specific  advice  to  individuals  to  protect  themselves  from 
                                                     

40 See also Recital 86 GDPR.   
 
Adopted 

 

20 

possible adverse consequences of the breach, such as resetting passwords in the case where their 
access credentials have been compromised. Again, a controller can choose to provide information in 
addition to what is required here.    

C. Contacting individuals  

88. In principle, the relevant breach should be communicated to the affected data subjects directly, unless 
doing  so  would  involve  a  disproportionate  effort.  In  such  a  case,  there  shall  instead  be  a  public 
communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective 
manner (Article 34(3)(c) GDPR).  

89. Dedicated messages should be used when communicating a breach to data subjects and they should 
not be sent with other information, such as regular updates, newsletters, or standard messages. This 
helps to make the communication of the breach to be clear and transparent.  

90. Examples of transparent communication methods include direct messaging (e.g. email, SMS, direct 
message),  prominent  website  banners  or  notification,  postal  communications  and  prominent 
advertisements in print media. A notification solely confined within a press release or corporate blog 
would not be an effective means of communicating a breach to an individual. The EDPB recommends 
that  controllers  should  choose  a  means  that  maximizes  the  chance  of  properly  communicating 
information to all affected individuals. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean the controller 
employs several methods of communication, as opposed to using a single contact channel.     

91. Controllers may also need to ensure that the communication is accessible in appropriate alternative 
formats and relevant languages to ensure individuals are able to understand the information being 
provided to them. For example, when communicating a breach to an individual, the language used 
during  the  previous  normal  course  of  business  with  the  recipient  will  generally  be  appropriate. 
However, if the breach affects data subjects who the controller has not previously interacted with, or 
particularly those who reside in a different Member State or other non-EU country from where the 
controller is established, communication in the local national language could be acceptable, taking into 
account the resource required. The key is to help data subjects understand the nature of the breach 
and steps they can take to protect themselves.  

92. Controllers are best placed to determine the most appropriate contact  channel to communicate a 
breach to individuals, particularly if they interact with their customers on a frequent basis. However, 
clearly a controller should be wary of using a contact channel  compromised by the breach as this 
channel could also be used by attackers impersonating the controller.   

93. At the same time, Recital 86 GDPR explains that:   

“Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close 
cooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant 
authorities such as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk 
of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement 
appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for 
communication.”  

94. Controllers might therefore wish to contact and consult the supervisory authority not only to seek 
advice about informing data subjects about a breach in accordance with Article 34, but also on the 
appropriate messages to be sent to, and the most appropriate way to contact, individuals.   

95. Linked to this is the advice given in Recital 88 GDPR that notification of a breach should “take into 
account  the  legitimate  interests  of  law-enforcement  authorities  where  early  disclosure  could 
unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the circumstances of a personal data breach”. This may 
mean that in certain circumstances, where justified, and on the advice of law-enforcement authorities, 
the controller may delay communicating the breach to the affected individuals until such time as it 
 
Adopted 

21 

 

would  not  prejudice  such  investigations.  However,  data  subjects  would  still  need  to  be  promptly 
informed after this time.  

96. Whenever it is not possible for the controller to communicate a breach to an individual because there 
is insufficient data stored to contact the individual, in that particular circumstance the controller should 
inform the individual as soon as it is reasonably feasible to do so (e.g. when an individual exercises 
their Article 15 right to access personal data and provides the controller with necessary additional 
information to contact them).  

D. Conditions where communication is not required  

97. Article 34(3) GDPR states three conditions that, if met, do not require notification to individuals in the 

event of a breach. These are:  

• 

• 

• 

The  controller  has  applied  appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures  to  protect 
personal data prior to  the breach, in particular those measures that render personal data 
unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it. This could, for example, include 
protecting personal data with state-of-the-art encryption, or by tokenization.  
Immediately following a breach, the controller has taken steps to ensure that the high risk 
posed  to  individuals’  rights  and  freedoms  is  no  longer  likely  to  materialise.  For  example, 
depending on the circumstances of the case, the controller may have immediately identified 
and taken action against the individual who has accessed personal data before they were able 
to do anything with it. Due regard still needs to be given to the possible consequences of any 
breach of confidentiality, again, depending on the nature of the data concerned.    
It would involve disproportionate effort41 to contact individuals, perhaps where their contact 
details have been lost as a result of the breach or are not known in the first place. For example, 
the warehouse of a statistical office has flooded and the documents containing personal data 
were stored only in paper form. Instead, the controller must make a public communication or 
take a similar measure, whereby the individuals are informed in an equally effective manner. 
In  the  case  of  disproportionate  effort,  technical  arrangements  could  also  be  envisaged  to 
make information about the breach available on demand, which could prove useful to those 
individuals who may be affected by a breach, but the controller cannot otherwise contact.   

98. In  accordance  with  the  accountability  principle  controllers  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  to  the 
supervisory authority that they meet one or more of these conditions  42.  It should be borne in mind 
that while notification may initially not be required if there is no risk to the rights and freedoms of 
natural persons, this may change over time and the risk would have to be re-evaluated.  

99. If a controller decides not to communicate a breach to the individual, Article 34(4) GDPR explains that 
the supervisory authority can require it to do so, if it considers the breach is likely to result in a high 
risk to individuals. Alternatively, it may consider that the conditions in Article 34(3) GDPR have been 
met in which case notification to individuals is not required. If the supervisory authority determines 
that the decision not to notify data subjects is not well founded, it may consider employing its available 
powers and sanctions.

IV. ASSESSING RISK AND HIGH RISK  

A. Risk as a trigger for notification  

100. 

Although the GDPR introduces the obligation to notify a breach, it is not a requirement to do 

so in all circumstances:   

•  Notification to the competent supervisory authority is required unless a breach is unlikely to 

result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.  

•  Communication of a breach to the individual is only triggered where it is likely to result in a 

high risk to their rights and freedoms.   

101. 

This means that immediately upon becoming aware of a breach, it is vitally important that the 
controller should not only seek to contain the incident but it should also assess the risk that could 
result from it. There are two important reasons for this: firstly, knowing the likelihood and the potential 
severity of the impact on the individual will help the controller to take effective steps to contain and 
address  the  breach;  secondly,  it  will  help  it  to  determine  whether  notification  is  required  to  the 
supervisory authority and, if necessary, to the individuals concerned.   

102. 

As explained above, notification of a breach is required unless it is unlikely to result in a risk to 
the rights and freedoms of individuals, and the key trigger requiring communication of a breach to data 
subjects is where it is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. This risk 
exists when  the breach may lead to physical, material or non-material damage for the individuals 
whose data have been breached. Examples of such damage are discrimination, identity theft or fraud, 
financial loss and damage to reputation. When the breach involves personal data that reveals racial or 
ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or includes 
genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life, or criminal convictions and offences 
or related security measures, such damage should be considered likely to occur43.   

B. Factors to consider when assessing risk  

103. 

Recitals 75 and 76 of the GDPR suggest that generally when assessing risk, consideration should 
be given to both the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It 
further states that risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment.  

104. 

It should be noted that assessing the risk to people’s rights and freedoms as a result of a breach 
has a different focus to the risk considered in a DPIA)44. The DPIA considers both the risks of the data 
processing being carried out as planned, and the risks in case of a breach. When considering a potential 
breach, it looks in general terms at the likelihood of this occurring, and the damage to the data subject 
that might ensue; in other words, it is an assessment of a hypothetical event. With an actual breach, 
the event has already occurred, and so the focus is wholly about the resulting risk of the impact of the 
breach on individuals.  

Example 
 
A DPIA suggests that the proposed use of a particular security software product to protect personal 
data is a suitable measure to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk the processing would 
otherwise present to individuals. However, if a vulnerability becomes subsequently known, this would 
change the software’s suitability to contain the risk to the personal data protected and so it would 
need to be re-assessed as part of an ongoing DPIA. A vulnerability in the product is later exploited and

Adopted

a  breach  occurs.  The  controller  should  assess  the  specific  circumstances  of  the  breach,  the  data 
affected, and the potential level of impact on individuals, as well as how likely this risk will materialise.  

105. 

Accordingly, when assessing the risk to individuals as a result of a breach, the controller should 
consider the specific circumstances of the breach, including the severity of the potential impact and 
the likelihood of this occurring. The EDPB therefore recommends the assessment should take into 
account the following criteria45:  

106. 

• 

The type of breach  
The type of breach that has occurred may affect the level of risk presented to individuals. For 
example, a confidentiality breach whereby medical information has been disclosed to unauthorised 
parties may have a different set of consequences for an individual to a breach where an individual’s 
medical details have been lost, and are no longer available.   

• 

The nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data  

107. 

Of course, when assessing risk, a key factor is the type and sensitivity of personal data that has 
been compromised by the breach.  Usually, the more sensitive the data, the higher the risk of harm 
will be to the people affected, but consideration should also be given to other personal data that may 
already be available about the data subject. For example, the disclosure of the name and address of 
an individual in ordinary circumstances is unlikely to cause substantial damage. However, if the name 
and address of an adoptive parent is disclosed to a birth parent, the consequences could be very severe 
for both the adoptive parent and child.  

108. 

Breaches  involving  health  data,  identity  documents,  or  financial  data  such  as  credit  card 
details, can all cause harm on their own, but if used together they could be used for identity theft. A 
combination of personal data is typically more sensitive than a single piece of personal data.  

109. 

Some types of personal data may seem at first relatively innocuous, however, what that data 
may reveal about the affected individual should be carefully considered. A list of customers accepting 
regular deliveries may not be particularly sensitive, but the same data about customers who have 
requested that their deliveries be stopped while on holiday would be useful information to criminals.  

110. 

Similarly,  a  small  amount  of  highly  sensitive  personal  data  can  have  a  high  impact  on  an 
individual, and a large range of details can reveal a greater range of information about that individual. 
Also, a breach affecting large volumes of personal data about many data subjects can have an effect 
on a corresponding large number of individuals.  

111. 

• 

Ease of identification of individuals  
An  important  factor  to  consider  is  how  easy  it  will  be  for  a  party  who  has  access  to 
compromised personal data to identify specific individuals, or match the data with other information 
to identify individuals. Depending on the circumstances, identification could be possible directly from 
the personal data breached with no special research needed to discover the individual’s identity, or it 
may be extremely difficult to match personal data to a particular individual, but it could still be possible 
under certain conditions. Identification may be directly or indirectly possible from the breached data, 
but it may also depend on the specific context of the breach, and public availability of related personal 
details. This may be more relevant for confidentiality and availability breaches.   

                                                     

45 Article 3.2 of Regulation 611/2013 provides guidance the factors that should be taken into consideration in 
relation to the notification of breaches in the electronic communication services sector, which may be useful in 
the context of notification under the GDPR. See http://eur- 
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:173:0002:0008:en:PDF   
 
Adopted 

24 

 

112. 

As  stated  above,  personal  data  protected  by  an  appropriate  level  of  encryption  will  be 
unintelligible  to  unauthorised  persons  without  the  decryption  key.  Additionally,  appropriately-
implemented pseudonymisation (defined in Article 4(5) GDPR as “the processing of personal data in 
such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the 
use  of  additional  information,  provided  that  such  additional  information  is  kept  separately  and  is 
subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed 
to an identified  or identifiable natural person”) can  also reduce the likelihood of individuals being 
identified in the event of a breach. However, pseudonymisation techniques alone cannot be regarded 
as making the data unintelligible.  

• 

Severity of consequences for individuals  

113. 

Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  personal  data  involved  in  a  breach,  for  example,  special 
categories of data, the potential damage to individuals that could result can be especially severe, in 
particular where the breach could result in identity theft or fraud, physical harm, psychological distress, 
humiliation  or  damage  to  reputation.  If  the  breach  concerns  personal  data  about  vulnerable 
individuals, they could be placed at greater risk of harm.   

114. 

Whether the controller is aware that personal data is in the hands of people whose intentions 
are unknown or possibly malicious can have a bearing on the level of potential risk. There may be a 
confidentiality breach, whereby personal data is disclosed to a third party, as defined in Article 4(10), 
or other recipient in error. This may occur, for example, where personal data is sent accidentally to the 
wrong department of an organisation, or to a commonly used supplier organisation. The controller 
may request the recipient to either return or securely destroy the data it has received. In both cases, 
given  that  the  controller  has  an  ongoing  relationship  with  them,  and  it  may  be  aware  of  their 
procedures, history and other relevant details, the recipient may be considered “trusted”. In other 
words, the controller may have a level of assurance with the recipient so that it can reasonably expect 
that party not to read or access the data sent in error, and to comply with its instructions to return it. 
Even if the data has been accessed, the controller could still possibly trust the recipient not to take any 
further action with it and to return the data to the controller promptly and to co-operate with its 
recovery.  In  such  cases,  this  may  be  factored  into  the  risk  assessment  the  controller  carries  out 
following  the  breach  –  the  fact  that  the  recipient  is  trusted  may  eradicate  the  severity  of  the 
consequences of the breach but does not mean that a breach has not occurred. However, this in turn 
may remove the likelihood of risk to individuals, thus no longer requiring notification to the supervisory 
authority, or to the affected individuals. Again, this will depend on case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, 
the  controller  still  has  to  keep  information  concerning  the  breach  as  part  of  the  general  duty  to 
maintain records of breaches (see section V, below).   

115. 

Consideration should also be given to the permanence of the consequences for individuals, 

where the impact may be viewed as greater if the effects are long-term.  

• 

Special characteristics of the individual  

116. 

A breach may affect personal data concerning children or other vulnerable individuals, who 
may be placed at greater risk of danger as a result. There may be other factors about the individual 
that may affect the level of impact of the breach on them.  

117. 

• 

Special characteristics of the data controller  
The nature and role of the controller and its activities may affect the level of risk to individuals 
as a result of a breach. For example, a medical organisation will process special categories of personal 
data, meaning that there is a greater threat to individuals if their personal data is breached, compared 
with a mailing list of a newspaper.  

• 

The number of affected individuals  

 
Adopted 

 

25 

118. 

A breach may affect only one or  a few individuals or several thousand, if not many more. 
Generally, the higher the number of individuals affected, the greater the impact of a breach can have. 
However, a breach can have a severe impact on even one individual, depending on the nature of the 
personal data and the context in which it has been compromised. Again, the key is to consider the 
likelihood and severity of the impact on those affected.  

•  General points  

119. 

Therefore, when assessing the risk that is likely to result from a breach, the controller should 
consider a combination of the severity of the potential impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals 
and the likelihood of these occurring. Clearly, where the consequences of a breach are more severe, 
the  risk  is  higher  and  similarly  where  the  likelihood  of  these  occurring  is  greater,  the  risk  is  also 
heightened. If in doubt, the controller should err on the side of caution and notify. Annex B provides 
some useful examples of different types of breaches involving risk or high risk to individuals.  

120. 

The  European  Union  Agency  for  Network  and  Information  Security  (ENISA)  has  produced 
recommendations  for  a  methodology  of  assessing  the  severity  of  a  breach,  which  controllers  and 
processors may find useful when designing their breach management response plan46.  
V. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECORD KEEPING  

A. Documenting breaches  

121. 

Regardless of whether or not a breach needs to be notified to the supervisory authority, the 

controller must keep documentation of all breaches, as Article 33(5) GDPR explains:  

“The  controller  shall  document  any  personal  data  breaches,  comprising  the  facts  relating  to  the 
personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the 
supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.”  

122. 

This is linked to the accountability principle of the GDPR, contained in Article 5(2) GDPR. The 
purpose  of  recording  non-notifiable  breaches,  as  well  notifiable  breaches,  also  relates  to  the 
controller’s obligations under Article 24 GDPR, and the supervisory authority can request to see these 
records. Controllers are therefore encouraged to establish an internal register of breaches, regardless 
of whether they are required to notify or not47.   

123. 

Whilst  it  is  up  to  the  controller  to  determine  what  method  and  structure  to  use  when 
documenting a breach, in terms of  recordable information  there are key elements that should be 
included  in  all  cases.  As  is  required  by  Article  33(5)  GDPR,  the  controller  needs  to  record  details 
concerning  the  breach,  which  should  include  its  causes,  what  took  place  and  the  personal  data 
affected. It should also include the effects and consequences of the breach, along with the remedial 
action taken by the controller.  

124. 

The GDPR does not specify a retention period for such documentation. Where such records 
contain personal data, it will be incumbent on the controller to determine the appropriate period of 
retention in accordance with the principles in relation to the processing of personal data48 and to meet 
a lawful basis for processing49. It will need to retain documentation in accordance with Article 33(5) 
                                                     

46 ENISA, Recommendations for a methodology of the assessment of severity of personal data breaches,  
https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/dbn-severity   
47 The  controller  may  choose  to  document  breaches  as  part  of  if  its  record  of  processing  activities  which  is 
maintained pursuant to Article 30 GDPR. A separate register is not required, provided the information relevant 
to the breach is clearly identifiable as such and can be extracted upon request.

GDPR insofar as it may be called to provide evidence of compliance with that Article, or with the 
accountability principle more generally, to the supervisory authority. Clearly, if the records themselves 
contain no personal data then the storage limitation principle50 of the GDPR does not apply.  

125. 

In  addition  to  these  details,  the  EDPB  recommends  that  the  controller  also  document  its 
reasoning for the decisions taken in response to a breach. In particular, if a breach is not notified, a 
justification for that decision should be documented. This should include reasons why the controller 
considers  the  breach  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  individuals 51. 
Alternatively, if the controller considers that any of the conditions in Article 34(3) GDPR are met, then 
it should be able to provide appropriate evidence that this is the case.  

126. 

Where the controller does notify a breach to the supervisory authority, but the notification is 
delayed, the controller must be able to provide reasons for that delay; documentation relating to this 
could help to demonstrate that the delay in reporting is justified and not excessive.   

127. 

Where  the  controller  communicates  a  breach  to  the  affected  individuals,  it  should  be 
transparent  about the breach and communicate in an effective and timely manner. Accordingly, it 
would help the controller to demonstrate accountability and compliance by retaining evidence of such 
communication.  

128. 

To aid compliance with Articles 33 and 34 GDPR, it would be advantageous to both controllers 
and processors to have a documented notification procedure in place, setting out the process to follow 
once a breach has been detected, including how to contain, manage and recover the incident, as well 
as assessing risk, and notifying the breach. In this regard, to show compliance with GDPR it might also 
be useful to demonstrate that employees have been informed about the existence of such procedures 
and mechanisms and that they know how to react to breaches.   

129. 

It should be noted that failure to properly document a breach can lead to  the supervisory 
authority  exercising  its  powers  under  Article  58  GDPR  and,  or  imposing  an  administrative  fine  in 
accordance with Article 83 GDPR.  

B. Role of the Data Protection Officer  

130. 

A controller or processor may have a Data Protection Officer (DPO)52, either as required by 
Article 37 GDPR, or voluntarily as a matter of good practice. Article 39 of the GDPR sets a number of 
mandatory tasks for the DPO, but does not prevent further tasks being allocated by the controller, if 
appropriate.   

131. 

Of  particular  relevance  to  breach  notification,  the  mandatory  tasks  of  the  DPO  includes, 
amongst other duties, providing data protection advice and information to the controller or processor, 
monitoring compliance with the GDPR, and providing advice in relation to DPIAs. The DPO must also 
cooperate with the supervisory authority and act as a contact point for the supervisory authority and 
for data subjects. It should also be noted that, when notifying the breach to the supervisory authority, 
Article 33(3)(b) GDPR requires the controller to provide the name and contact details of its DPO, or 
other contact point.   

132. 

In terms of documenting breaches, the controller or processor may wish to obtain the opinion 
of its DPO as to the structure, the setting up and the administration of this documentation. The DPO 
could also be additionally tasked with maintaining such records.  

133. 

These factors mean  that  the DPO should play an key role in assisting the prevention of or 
preparation for a breach by providing advice and monitoring compliance, as well as during a breach 
                                                     

50 See Article 5(1)(e) GDPR.

Adopted 

 

27 

(i.e.  when  notifying  the  supervisory  authority),  and  during  any  subsequent  investigation  by  the 
supervisory authority. In this light, the EDPB recommends that the DPO is promptly informed about 
the existence of a breach and is involved throughout the breach management and notification process.  
VI. NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER OTHER LEGAL INSTRUMENTS  
In addition to, and separate from, the notification and communication of breaches under the 
GDPR, controllers should also be aware of any requirement to notify security incidents under other 
associated legislation that may apply to them and whether this may also require them to notify the 
supervisory authority of a personal data breach at the same time. Such requirements can vary between 
Member States, but examples of notification requirements in other legal instruments, and how these 
inter-relate with the GDPR, include the following:   

134. 

•  Regulation  (EU)  910/2014  on  electronic  identification  and  trust  services  for  electronic 

transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation)53.  

135. 

Article 19(2) of the eIDAS Regulation requires trust service providers to notify their supervisory 
body  of  a  breach  of  security  or  loss  of  integrity  that  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  trust  service 
provided or on the personal data maintained therein. Where applicable—i.e., where such a breach or 
loss is also a personal data breach under the GDPR—the trust service provider should also notify the 
supervisory authority.  

•  Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network 

and information systems across the Union (NIS Directive)54.  

136. 

Articles 14 and 16 of the NIS Directive require operators of essential services and digital service 
providers to notify security incidents to their competent authority. As recognised by Recital 63 of NIS55, 
security incidents can often include a compromise of personal data. Whilst NIS requires competent 
authorities  and  supervisory  authorities  to  co-operate  and  exchange  information  that  context,  it 
remains the case that where such incidents are, or become, personal data breaches under the GDPR, 
those operators and/or providers would be required to notify the supervisory authority separately 
from the incident notification requirements of NIS.   

Example 

A cloud service provider notifying a breach under the NIS Directive may also need to notify a controller, 
if this includes a personal data breach. Similarly, a trust service provider notifying under eIDAS may 
also be required to notify the relevant data protection authority in the event of a breach.  

•  Directive 2009/136/EC (the Citizens’ Rights Directive) and Regulation 611/2013 (the Breach 

Notification Regulation).   

137. 

Providers  of  publicly  available  electronic  communication  services  within  the  context  of 

Directive 2002/58/EC56 must notify breaches to the competent national authorities.

54 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG   
55 Recital 63: “Personal data are in many cases compromised as a result of incidents. In this context, competent 
authorities and data protection authorities should cooperate and exchange information on all relevant matters 
to tackle any personal data breaches resulting from incidents.”  
56  On  10  January  2017,  the  European  Commission  proposed  a  Regulation  on  Privacy  and  Electronic 
Communications which will replace Directive 2009/136/EC and remove notification requirements. However, 
until this proposal is approved by the European Parliament the existing notification requirement remains in

B. Examples of personal data breaches and who to notify   

The following non-exhaustive examples will assist controllers in determining whether they need to 
notify  in  different  personal  data  breach  scenarios.  These  examples  may  also  help  to  distinguish 
between risk and high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

Notes/recommendations 

As long as the data are 
encrypted with a state of

breach. However if it is later 
compromised, notification 
is required.  

Yes, report to the

This is not a notifiable 
breach, but still a recordable 
incident under Article 33(5).   

Appropriate records should 
be maintained by the 
controller.  

If there was a backup 
available and data could be 
restored in good time, this

centre to report a 
data breach. The 
individual has 
received a monthly 
statement for 
someone else.   

The controller 
undertakes a short 
investigation (i.e. 
completed within 
24 hours) and 
establishes with a 
reasonable 
confidence that a 
personal data 
breach has occurred

systemic flaw that 
may mean other 
individuals are or 
might be affected.
