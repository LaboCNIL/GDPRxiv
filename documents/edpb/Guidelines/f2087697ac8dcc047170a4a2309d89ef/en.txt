EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

With the introduction of the GDPR, the concept of the one-stop shop was established as one of the 
main innovations. In cross-border processing cases, the supervisory authority in the Member State of 
the  controller's  or  processor's  main  establishment  is  the  authority  leading  the  enforcement  of  the 
GDPR for the respective cross-border processing activities, in cooperation with all the authorities which 
may  face  the  effects  of  the  processing  activities  at  stake:  be  it  through  the  establishments  of  the 
controller  or  processor  on  their  territory  or  through  complaints  from  their  residents  against  these 
processing activities. Indeed, data subjects should be able to easily pursue their data protection rights 
and should be able to complain to a supervisory authority  at their place of habitual residence. This 
supervisory authority also remains the contact point for the complainant in the further course of the 
complaint-handling process. In order to meet all  these requirements, Article 60 GDPR regulates the 
cooperation procedure between the lead supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities 
concerned. 

These guidelines handle the interactions of the supervisory authorities with each other, with the EDPB 
and with third parties under Article 60 GDPR. The aim is to analyse the cooperation procedure and to 
give guidance on the concrete application of the provisions. 

General considerations  

A  common  understanding  of  the  terms  and  basic  concepts  is  a  prerequisite  for  the  cooperation 
procedure to run as smoothly as possible. 

Firstly, the guideline states that:  

- 
- 

- 

the cooperation procedure applies in principle to all cross-border processing cases, 
the lead supervisory authority is primarily responsible for handling such cases, without being 
empowered to ultimately decide on its own, and that 
the cooperation procedure does not impact the independence of the supervisory authorities, 
which retain their own discretionary powers within the framework of cooperation. 

It is recalled that the effects of national procedural regulations must not lead to limiting or hampering 
the cooperation under the GDPR. 

Structure and Content of the guidelines 

These guidelines are based on the requirements of Article 60 and clarify paragraph by paragraph the 
conditions arising from the regulation itself and its practical implementation. 

In the context of Article 60(1) GDPR, it is established that the principles to be observed throughout the 
whole  cooperation  procedure  are  mutual  obligations.  It  is  stressed  that  while  the  achievement  of 
consensus among the SAs is not an obligation, the endeavour to reach an agreed consensual decision 
is an overarching objective to be achieved through a mutual and consistent exchange of all relevant 
information. This exchange of information is obligatory for all CSAs, including the LSA. The meaning of 
"relevant"  in  this  context  is  further  clarified  through  examples.  In  terms  of  timeliness,  the  paper 
recommends  sharing  the  relevant  information  proactively  and  as  quickly  as  possible.  Lastly,  the 
possibility to use informal means of communication to reach consensus is recalled. 

The following section on Article 60(2) GDPR addresses the situation of the LSA requesting CSA(s) to 
provide mutual assistance pursuant to Article 61 GDPR and conducting joint operations pursuant to 
Article 62 GDPR and provides guidance on the specifications of these instruments in the context of an 
ongoing cooperation procedure.

The paper addresses the process of the submission of the draft decision under Article 60(3) GDPR. It 
highlights that the LSA has to act proactively and as quickly as possible and that the CSAs should be 
able  to  contribute  to  the  overall  procedure,  also  before  the  creation  of  the  draft  decision  (e.g. 
exchange of information). In addition, the LSA is required to submit a draft decision to the CSAs in all 
cases of cross border processing.  

The sections on Article 60(4)-(6) GDPR outline the different scenarios that follow the submission of a 
draft  decision  by  the  lead  supervisory  authority  and  thus  provide  a  consistent  approach  to  the 
procedure between the submission of a (revised) draft decision and either the triggering of the binding 
effect in the absence of relevant and reasoned objections or the submission to the dispute resolution 
procedure. The guidelines also recognise the possibility for the LSA to adapt and resubmit the draft 
decision submitted under Article 60(4) GDPR prior to the expiry of the four-week period, provided that 
new  factors  or  considerations  justify  such  adaptation  and  that  their  importance  is  fairly  balanced 
against  the  expediency of  the cooperation  procedure.  In addition, it is specified  that there may  be 
multiple revised decisions but only in cases where it is likely to reach a consensus due to substantive 
convergence between the LSA and other CSA(s).   

This is followed by the analysis of the different scenarios after the (revised) draft decision has become 
binding  on  the  lead  supervisory  authority  and  the  supervisory  authorities  concerned.  It  is  clarified 
which supervisory authority has to adopt the final national decision pursuant to Article 60(7)-(9) GDPR 
on  the basis of  the draft decision  that  has become binding and which  supervisory  authority  has to 
notify the controller/processor or the complainant. In this context, the distinction between notifying 
and informing is also addressed. 

Furthermore,  the guidelines address the important distinction between situations that constitute a 
dismissal/rejection of a complaint, with the consequence that the complaint-receiving SA adopts the 
final decision, and situations in which the lead supervisory authority acts on the complaint in relation 
to the controller, with the consequence that the lead supervisory authority adopts the final decision. 
In this context, it is highlighted that terms of EU law not making express reference to member state 
law must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation.  

The  following  section  outlines  the  duties  of  the  controller  or  processor  to  ensure  that  processing 
activities in all its establishments are in compliance with the final decision (Article 60(10) GDPR). 

The last section addresses the specific requirements of the application of Article 66 GDPR (Urgency 
Procedure) in the course of an ongoing cooperation procedure (Article 60 (11) GDPR). 

A quick reference guide annexed to the guidelines is intended to give practitioners in the supervisory 
authorities a quick overview of the procedure and to illustrate the complex procedure.

The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 70(1)(e) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of  27 April 2016 on  the protection  of natural persons with  regard  to  the processing  of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, (hereinafter 
“GDPR”), 

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended 
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20181, 
 
Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure; 

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES 

 

INTRODUCTION 

1.  The number of national enforcement proceedings concerning cross-border data processing activities 
is constantly increasing, with many being resolved within  the GDPR cooperation mechanism. While 
Article 57(1)(g), (f) set the frame for the general cooperation, the One Stop Shop (OSS) is established 
under Article 56 and 60 GDPR2. This specific procedure requires the Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) 
to cooperate with the other Concerned Supervisory Authorities (other CSAs) in an endeavour to reach 
consensus.  

2. 

It should be underlined that the OSS model, allowing the supervisory authorities (SAs) of all Member 
States (MS) to be involved in a type of co-decision procedure, is a novel concept to data protection 
legislation introduced by the GDPR.  

3.  These  guidelines  handle the interactions of the SAs with  each  other, with  the EDPB  and with  third 
parties under Article 60. The aim is to analyse and give guidance on the concrete application of the 
provisions.  As the cooperation  procedure relates to processing activities, its outcome concerns, by 
definition, the actors involved in such processing (data subject, controller, processor(s), etc.). However, 
since the duty to cooperate contained in Article 60 applies to SAs, this paper focuses on the obligations 
of the LSA and other CSA(s).   

4. 

It is, not in the scope of these guidelines to address the issue of designation of the LSA and other CSAs. 
These guidelines presume that this has been clarified and agreed according to Article 56 as the Article 
60 procedure attributes specific competences and actions to the involved SAs based on their roles. 
Therefore, it is assumed that sufficient information to establish the different roles has been already 
shared at the point that the work under Article 60 GDPR starts. 

                                                             
1 References to “Member States” made throughout these Guidelines should be understood as references to 
“EEA Member States”. 
2 The term “Article” without further specification refers to those of the GDPR.

5.  However, in specific situations there might occur later on a shift in the competences and roles of the 
SAs (e.g. a new location of the main establishment or a case of joint controllership). Therefore, as soon 
as the SAs get knowledge of any circumstance that might affect the competence for handling the case 
during  the  cooperation  phase,  information  should  be  shared  immediately  among  SAs,  in  order  to 
identify the new presumed LSA and to reach an agreement on the allocation of roles3.  

6.  Upon  agreement,  the  Article  60  procedure  would  proceed  accordingly.  If  consensus  cannot  be 

achieved, the matter is to be referred to the EDPB making use of Article 65(1)(b). 

7.  Whenever in these Guidelines reference is made to the use of the "EDPB Information System", such 
reference  means  the  Internal  Market  Information  System  ("IMI")  in  pursuant  to  Regulation  (No) 
1024/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  administrative 
cooperation  using  the  Internal  Market  Information  System  and  repealing  Commission  Decision 
2008/49/EC ("IMI Regulation") 4. The EDPB Information System shall be used in accordance with Article 
60(12) for the supply of all information required under Article 60. In addition, SAs should use all forms 
of communication, such as e-mails, phone, videoconference or in person, to facilitate the process of 
achieving consensus. 

 

 ARTICLE 60 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE OSS-SYSTEM 

  Applicability of the cooperation procedure  

8.  The cooperation procedure between  the LSA and the other  CSAs under Article 56(1) and Article 60 
essentially has the following conditions: the processing operation has to be cross-border according to 
Article  4(23),  which  also  means  that  the  controller  or  processor  must  have  a  main  or  single 
establishment in the EU. Article 4(23) provides for two alternative connected definitions. Firstly, Article 
4(23)(a) requires that the controller or processor has establishments in more than one MS. Secondly, 
the specific data processing operation in question has to be carried out in the context of the activities 
of  several  EU  establishments.  According  to  Article  4(23)(b)  the  effects  on  data  subjects  can  define 
cross-border processing. In case the processing takes place in the context of the activities of a single 
establishment of a controller or processor within the EU, cross-border processing is assumed if the 
processing substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one MS.5 

9.  The EDPB stresses that Articles 56 and 606 apply to the cooperation between SAs in all cases based on 
cross-border processing, without regard to the origin of the case (complaint, ex officio inquiry, etc.). 
This is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 557 and Article 65. 

10.  While only Article 60(7) last sentence as well as paragraphs 8 and 9 refer to the handling of complaints, 
Article 56(1) and Article 60 as the core provisions concerning the cooperation procedure refer to cross-
border processing in general. With regard to the cooperation mechanism, Article 60(3) also refers to 
the  fact  that  the  LSA  shall  “communicate  the  relevant  information  on  the  matter”,  i.e.  the  case  in 

                                                             
3 See also: Opinion 8/2019 on the competence of a supervisory authority in case of a change in circumstances 
relating to the main or single establishment

general, so that it is not at all limited to complaint-based cases. The term “matter” includes for instance 
"ex officio" proceedings and the possibility under Article 57(1)(h) to conduct an investigation e.g. on 
the basis of information from another SA or other public authority. As complaint handling is already 
covered by Article 57(1)(f), this information provided according to Article 57(1)(h) does not have to be 
based on a complaint. 

11.  Furthermore, this is supported by a systematic approach with regard to possible sanctions or remedies 

under Article 58(2), which applies to all types of processing and not just to complaints.  

Example 1: Sources originating from the media or from whistle-blowers provided by a CSA may also 
initiate an Article 60 procedure if they are specific and substantial, i.e. facts are presented in a concrete 
and  complete  manner.  However,  simply  forwarding  a  newspaper  article  without  more  detailed 
information, e.g. an initial evaluation by the CSA, does not regularly constitute sufficient evidence of a 
data protection breach and would therefore not be considered to be sufficiently substantiated to cause 
supervisory measures. On the contrary, firm evidence does not need to be provided to open an Article 
60 procedure, because the procedure itself aims to establish whether an infringement exists or not. 
However, the LSA has wide discretionary powers to decide when to initiate an investigation ex officio 
based on information received on potential infringements from other CSAs or sources. 

12.  The application in all cross-border cases also follows from the purpose of the cooperation mechanism: 
It  was  created  “to  foster  a  uniform  application  of  the  data  protection  rules  through  a  consistent 
interpretation”8 and to ensure effective supervision and enforcement within the Union. A limitation to 
complaint-based cases would contradict this purpose. 

13.  For  cases  with  only  local  impacts,  Article  56(2)  and  56(3)  provide  that  the  SA,  which  received  the 
complaint or was made aware of a possible infringement, shall be competent if the LSA decides not to 
handle the case. Article 60 does not apply in these cases. Only where the LSA decides to handle the 
case Article 60 is applicable according to Article 56(4).   

  LSA/CSA as involved actors 

14.  Article  56(1)  contains  a  legal  definition  of  the  competent  LSA;  that  definition  is  to  be  read  in 
conjunction with Article 60, which sets out the essential tasks and powers of the LSA in the Article 60 
procedure9. The LSA is defined as the SA of the main establishment or of the single establishment of 
the controller or processor in the Union, which is competent for the cross-border processing carried 
out by  that  controller,  or  processor.  It is also  the  sole interlocutor  for that  controller or processor 
according to Article 56(6). 

15.  The  relevant  starting  point  for  determining  the  LSA  is  the  specific  cross-border  processing  of  data 

(“carried out”) by the respective controller or the processor10. 

16.  WP244 clarifies that “a lead supervisory authority is the authority with the primary responsibility for 
dealing with a cross-border data processing activity”. In other words, the LSA has the competence for 
the cross-border processing carried out by the given controller or processor, being the sole interlocutor 

                                                             
8 COM (2020)264 final, p.6. 
9 For “local cases” under Article 56(2), the provisions of Article 56(3) and (4) must be observed.

processor’s lead supervisory authority”

for that controller or processor in the respective MS under Article 56(6). Within the framework of the 
cooperation procedure set out in Article 60, and pursuant to Article 56(1), this competence translates 
into a ‘leading function’, i.e. into a steering role in taking the case forward, organising the cooperation 
procedure with a view to involving the other CSAs, coordinating investigations, gathering evidence etc. 
as well as in the responsibility for submitting a draft decision which is subject to opinions or objections 
by the other CSAs11. 

17.  However,  the  EDPB  considers  the  LSA  not  to  have  exclusive  competences  with  regard  to  the 
cooperation process, i.e.  the GDPR provides for a shared  responsibility to monitor and enforce the 
application of the GDPR in a consistent manner, so that the LSA's position is subject to the views of the 
other  CSAs and the  outcome should  be a  consensually  reached  decision. This is made clear by  the 
decision of the Union legislator that in cases of persistent disagreements between SAs, these must be 
resolved by the EDPB pursuant to Article 65(1)(a). 

18.  According to Article 4(22) a CSA means a SA which is concerned by the processing of personal data 

because:  

(a)  the controller or processor is established on the territory of the MS of that SA12; 
(b)  data  subjects  residing  in  the  MS  of  that  SA  are  substantially  affected  or  likely  to  be 

substantially affected by the processing; or 
(c)  a complaint has been lodged with that SA. 

 

19.  The EDPB considers these requirements to be basically obvious and simple to state so that, in principle, 
no  special  requirements  need  to  be  observed  here.  In  terms  of  factor  (a),  the  existence  of  an 
establishment will generally be easy to determine. The same applies to (c) and the question whether 
a particular  SA has received a complaint.  It is to be noted that in (b) the data subject must merely 
reside in the MS in question; he or she does not have to be a citizen of that state13.  

20.  In the event of doubt, it seems appropriate with regard to the legal consequences that basically each 

authority needs to substantiate its reasoning for being concerned.  

21.  The term "substantially affected" has been further defined in WP244 by naming factors (such as use 
of a particular language, use of a particular currency, availability of a service in the MS concerned, 
concrete address through controller or processor etc.) which shall be taken into consideration by each 
authority when assessing whether they are concerned. 

22.  When at any point a previously non-concerned SA becomes concerned during an ongoing Article 60 

procedure (for instance by receiving a complaint), the following basic procedure can be envisaged: 

  The CSA should immediately notify the LSA of its status and request its inclusion into the OSS 

procedure.  

                                                             
11 In this respect the role of the LSA has been characterised as at several points “primus inter pares”, e.g. by the 
Advocate General in his Opinion on Case 645/19, para. 111.  
12 For further information in the context of the term “establishment” see EDPB Guidelines 3/2018, p.5-7 as well 
as regarding the term of “in the context of the activities of an establishment” 3/2018 p.7-9. 
13 See also: WP244 Guidelines for identifying a controller or processor’s lead supervisory authority, p.9.

  The LSA should make sure to involve this new CSA as such, especially in the respective case 
register, and should inform the new CSA of its inclusion into the decision-making procedure. If 
the LSA becomes aware that a not yet involved authority is or has become a CSA, it should 
inform it about this change of status14. 

23.  The involvement of a newly concerned SA in an ongoing cooperation procedure should be possible at 
any stage of the case but cannot have any effect on the procedure enshrined in Article 60. As a result, 
all deadlines and procedures prescribed by Article 60 remain unaffected, i.e. for instance the deadline 
of Article 60(4), once the LSA has submitted its draft decision, applies irrespective of the fact that in 
the meantime a new CSA could join the procedure. 

24.  For this reason, the CSA may consider whether its respective case can still be handled effectively within 
the ongoing cooperation procedure and whether it should rather open a new procedure, for instance 
because the current one does not cover (some) core issues in the case before the CSA. 

 

Independence of SAs within the cooperation procedure 

25.  Within the cooperation procedure, both the LSA and the other CSAs act as independent SAs according 

to Article 52(1).   

26.  However, the CJEU stressed15 that the independence of the SAs was introduced in order to give greater 
protection to the data subjects concerned and not to confer a special status on the supervisory bodies 
themselves16. Independence is therefore to be understood as absolute protection against any external 
influence.  However,  in  this  context,  the  SAs  form  a  unit  within  the  framework  of  a  European 
administrative network, within which they are responsible for ensuring the consistent application of 
the GDPR throughout the Union. 

27.  The  reference  to  the  cooperation  procedure  in  the  provision  establishing  the  SAs  (Article  51(2)) 
underlines the importance of the cooperation mechanism for the functioning of a unified supervision 
and an effective protective standard through a consistent application of the GDPR within the Union.  

28.  In this respect, the EDPB underlines that all steps within the cooperation procedure are compatible 
with the legally prescribed independence granted to SAs pursuant to primary law and Article 52, as 
such independence is from external influence as clarified above and has no bearing on the general 
obligation to cooperate that is set out as an overarching duty within Article 60. 

29.  It should be noted that SAs, as national administrative authorities, enjoy a certain margin of discretion 
pursuant to domestic law in deciding with all due diligence the course of action that can best achieve 
the public interest they serve (see Article 51(1)).  This discretionary power must be exercised in line 
with the provisions of the GDPR and in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in 
Union and Member State Law, impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time.  

30.  Thus, the discretion to be acknowledged to SAs acting as independent administrative authorities, free 
from the influence of external stakeholders, cannot be unlimited in particular vis-à-vis EU law, as they

Impact of national procedural rules 

31.  Since the GDPR does not regulate all details of cooperation, the tasks and powers entrusted to SAs by 

Article 57 and Article 58 have to be fulfilled by relying on national procedural law. 

32.  It  is  usual  that  EU  legal  instruments  may  include  procedural  provisions  (such  as  the  GDPR  Articles 
conferring certain powers on SAs), but insofar as EU law does not provide for specific procedural rules, 
national procedural law applies. In these cases the principle of national procedural autonomy, which 
is  a  general  principle  of  EU  law,  generally  applies.  This  general  principle  is  limited,  as  is  outlined 
extensively in the case law of the CJEU, by the EU principles of equivalence and effectiveness17. These 
principles stipulate that the applicable national rules must not treat an EU determined  matter more 
unfavorably than purely national ones (equivalence). In addition, the application of national provisions 
must  not  significantly  complicate  or  make  it  practically  impossible  to  realise  the  purpose  of  the 
European legal standards (effectiveness).  

33.  However,  since  such  different  national  administrative  rules  exist,  their  application  may  lead  to 
differences and may (partly) be the  reason why SAs handle cases in different ways and  investigate 
them  differently.  Nevertheless,  these  distinctions  in  national  (procedural)  law  must  not  lead  to 
situations in which the principles of equivalence and effectiveness are undermined. 

34.  Accordingly, if it is not possible to reconcile EU law and national requirements in this way, i.e. if the 
national provision contradicts EU law, the national regulations that contradict EU law must in principle 
remain unapplied18. 

35.  Regarding  the  cooperation  mechanism  the  EDPB  stresses  therefore  that  national  (procedural)  law 
having impact to the effect of 'significantly complicating or making it practically impossible to realise' 
effective cooperation is not compatible with the GDPR and 'must be reconciled with the requirement 
of uniform application of Community law so as to avoid unequal treatment' (ECJ, C-290/91, para. 8). 
This being an obligation imposed on all Member States, if the above reconciliation proves impossible, 
the consequence is that an authority should consider not applying such national law. 

  ARTICLE 60(1) – MUTUAL OBLIGATION 

  General 

36.  Article 60(1) provides for a general duty of cooperation, which obliges all involved SAs equally. The 
wording clarifies by the use of “shall” that the obligation to cooperate is not a matter of discretion but 
a legal obligation. 

37.  Article  60(1)  lays  down  basic  and  overarching  principles,  which  apply  throughout  the  entire 
cooperation  between  SAs.  In  accordance  with  the  wording  of  this  Article,  the  key  concepts  of  the 

                                                             
17  Regarding the OSS see: Case 645/19 para. 53: ‘The application of the ‘one-stop shop’ mechanism consequently 
requires, as confirmed in recital 13 of Regulation 2016/679, sincere and effective cooperation between the lead 
supervisory authority and the other supervisory authorities concerned.’

cooperation procedure consist of “an endeavour to reach consensus” and the obligation to “exchange 
all relevant information”.   

38.  The EDPB expressly points out that these obligations are to be complied with by the LSA and every 

other CSA (mutual obligation). 

  The endeavour to reach consensus 

39.  The “endeavour to reach consensus” is to be understood as a legal objective19, which does not lead to 
a legal obligation to reach consensus in a respective case. However, this legal objective has a decisive 
influence on all actions of all CSAs throughout the entire cooperation process, i.e. it sets the direction 
for cooperative acting in such a way that SAs do their utmost and make a “serious determined effort”20 
in order to achieve consensus.   

40.  The  cooperation  procedure  conducted  in  an  “endeavour  to  reach  consensus”  necessarily  entails  a 
mutual exchange of views and documents on the subject matter. This mutual exchange is intended to 
ensure that all circumstances relevant to the case have been taken into account  and could thus also 
contribute to prevent disputes21. 

41.  That consensual acting should be the rule is further illustrated by the provisions contained in Article 
60(11)  and  Article  66(1)  whereby  “in  exceptional  circumstances”  and  “by  derogation  to  (…)  the 
procedure referred to in Article 60”, respectively, a CSA may take urgent measures22.  

42.  The importance of this objective is confirmed by the comparison between the current text and the 
original 2012 Commission proposal for the GDPR, which did not mention “consensus” and envisaged 
simply the exclusive competence of the LSA in cross-border cases. The current text mirrors a different 
approach endorsed by the EU legislator, where emphasis is placed on the mandatory cooperation of 
the SAs, which is supposed to be fair and constructive23. In their efforts to reach consensus, SAs should 
use all possible tools, including mutual exchanges of relevant information, providing each other with 
an opportunity to express their views on exchanged information and take into account the point of 
view of other CSAs24.  

43.  As  a  result,  this  translates  into  a  mutual  obligation  placed  on  the  LSA  and  other  CSAs  to  select 

cooperation approaches that are best suited to achieve consensus as described.  

  The obligation to exchange all relevant information 

A key as well as further priority element of the cooperation procedure lies in the mandatory (“shall”) 
exchange of “all relevant information” between the involved SAs – this applies throughout the whole 
cooperation procedure.

44.  The exchange of relevant information is a mutual obligation that is necessary to enable the LSA and 
the  other  CSAs  to  effectively  fulfil  their  roles  e.g.  when  determining  whether  there  has  been  an 
infringement of the GDPR25. 

45.  The mutual exchange of information is particularly important if no joint operations (Articles 60(2), 62) 
are envisaged  by the  LSA  and  no  mutual assistance requests (Articles  60(2), 61) are relied  upon  to 
jointly  gather  relevant  information.  Without  these  additional  procedures,  which  naturally  require 
further engagement and coordination, the LSA and other CSAs have to rely on the mutual exchange of 
information as per Article 60(1)(2). 

3.3.1  The term “Relevant information”  

46.  Which information is to be considered as “relevant” depends on the circumstances of each individual 
case.  In  principle,  all  information  that  is  directly  or  indirectly  conducive  to  the  conclusion  of  the 
proceeding  should  be  classified  as  relevant.  This  includes  sufficient  information  about  the  factual 
elements and legal issues specific to the case. Information that is already known or publicly available 
does not necessarily need to be shared. 

47.  The exchange of information is therefore not an end in itself, but serves all SAs involved to deal with 
the case and to be able to fulfil their role as SAs properly. For practical implementation, it is therefore 
imperative  that  all  parties  involved  act appropriately, i.e.  proportionately and in  the spirit of good 
cooperation. Therefore, the question in each case should be basically what information every SA would 
necessarily need itself in order to deal with the case. 

48.  For instance, in the case of a LSA, this refers to all relevant information gathered in dealing with the 
controller  or  processor  –  the  LSA  being  “the  sole  interlocutor”  of  the  controller  (findings  of 
investigations, reports, exchanges with the controller, records of meetings, further evidence etc.).  

49.  If the information is especially substantial in amount and scope the LSA should find ways to provide 

summaries, extracts, reports to substantiate the arguments made in the draft decision. 

50.  In the case of another CSA, this should translate into an obligation to proactively disclose, to the LSA 
as  well  as  the  other  CSAs,  all  the  relevant  information  regarding  the  case  (complaint,  data  breach 
notification etc.) of which that SA is in possession and that is helpful in assessing the legal and factual 
situation of the case. This may include any pleadings, arguments, correspondence with data subjects 
or any findings made by the CSA in the course of e.g. the vetting phase, or national inspections that 
have led to the detection of a possible infringement at the national establishment of the controller in 
a cross-border context.  

For instance, the following information could be exchanged between the SAs: 

- 

Information that has consequences for the reallocation of the competences of the LSA and the 
distribution of roles/qualification of CSAs26 (e.g. change in controllership or main establishment, 
etc.)  

-  Correspondence with data controller/data subjects on the subject of a complaint or investigation

- 

Information required to set the right focus: for instance, for an investigation into a very technical 
subject matter, it is likely that information relating to the technical aspects is very relevant, where 
in other cases the technical aspects are less relevant 

-  Note: The examples given above are non-exhaustive. Which information will be deemed by SAs to 

be relevant information will depend on the circumstances of the specific case.  

For exchange of such information, the EDPB Information system should be used.  

51.  With regard to the data minimisation principle of Article 5(1)(c), it should be assessed case by case 
whether  the  communication  of  personal  data  is  necessary.  Personal  data  should  be  shared  only  if 
required to deal with a specific issue.  

52.  The LSA  and other CSAs may flag specific pieces of information as (highly) confidential, particularly 
when this seems necessary in order to meet requirements of confidentiality constraints laid down in 
national  laws.  In  such  a  case,  the  SAs  should  inform  each  other  immediately  and  jointly  find  legal 
options for a solution against the background that confidentiality provisions usually relate to external 
third parties and not to CSAs. In this regard, any information received that is subject to national secrecy 
rules  should  not  be  published  or  released  to  third  parties  without  prior  consultation  with  the 
originating authority, whenever possible.  

53.  As  regards  requests  for  public  access,  without  prejudice  to  national  transparency  regulations,  SAs 
should consult each other before granting or refusing access to documents, which were exchanged 
during the cooperation procedure.  

3.3.2  Timing of the information exchange 

54.  No specific timeline is provided in paragraph 1, as this is a general obligation irrespective of the timing 
involved.  However,  effective  enforcement  of  the  GDPR  throughout  the  EU  requires  that  all  CSAs 
receive all relevant information in a timely manner, i.e. as soon as reasonably possible. Therefore, the 
EDPB considers the mutual obligation to exchange all relevant information necessarily to apply already 
prior to the submission of a draft decision by the LSA.  

55.  In order to facilitate the reaching of consensus, the information should be shared at a moment where 
it is still possible for the LSA to take on board the viewpoints of the other CSAs. This should apply to 
any stage of the proceedings, and in particular, it should prevent the other CSAs from being presented 

Adopted 

 

14 

 

with  accomplished  facts, for example because certain  stages of the proceedings may  be precluded 
under national law. 

56.  In this respect, Article 60 provides also ‘space for thought’ to both LSA and other CSAs in that there is 
room  for  facilitating  the  achievement  of  consensus  through  ‘informal’  exchanges  of  “all  relevant 
information” without strict deadlines prior to triggering the ‘formal’ steps. The more comprehensive 
and  timely  the  exchange  of  information  between  the  SAs  involved,  the  greater  the  likelihood  of 
reaching a consensus as early as possible will be.  

57.  The EDPB recommends therefore as a minimum standard that the LSA makes all efforts to proactively 
share, with the other CSAs, the scope and main conclusions of its draft decision prior to the formal 
submission of the latter. This enables the other CSAs to form their own views in that respect and timely 
flag possible questions to the LSA. The LSA may decide to address these issues prior to issuing the draft 
decision formally and thus before triggering the very strict procedure envisaged in Article 60(4) and 
60(5) for raising objections to the draft decision.  

58.  After all, it should be kept in mind that the cooperation mechanism is intended to be supportive and 
serve  the  effective  enforcement  of  data  protection  within  the  EU.  SAs  will  need  to  develop  best 
practices  through  the  continuous  gathering  of  practical  experience  by  being  flexible  in  choosing 
optimal ways for cooperation. 

  ARTICLE 60(2) – MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AND JOINT OPERATIONS 

  General 

59.  Article 60(2) addresses specific forms of cooperation between the LSA and the other CSAs throughout 
the cooperation procedure provided for by Article 60, i.e. within the framework of the OSS mechanism. 

60.  Article 60(2) goes beyond the duty to exchange all relevant information, provided for by Article 60(1), 
and provides for a specific kind of cooperation that the LSA may pursue if necessary in a concrete case: 
either  requesting  CSA(s)  to  provide  mutual  assistance  or  requesting  CSA(s)  to  engage  into  a  joint 
operation conducted by the LSA. 

61.  The application of Articles 61 and 62 in the remit of Article 60(2) entails reading the provisions of those 
articles in conjunction with Article 60, and, therefore, they have to be adjusted to the precise context 
of a cooperation  procedure and  to the  allocation  of roles provided  by the  OSS mechanism, and in 
particular provided by Article 60(2). 

62.  By  specifying  the  main  purposes  of  such  cooperation,  i.e.  for  carrying  out  investigations  or  for 
monitoring the implementation of a measure concerning a controller or a processor in another  MS, 
Article 60(2) emphasises two stages of the cooperation procedure where those cooperation tools are 
applicable: firstly, during the investigatory phase, before the final decision is adopted ; secondly, during 
the  implementation  phase,  after  the  final  decision  was  adopted  and  notified  to  the  controller  or 
processor. 

  Requirements of Article 60(2) 

Adopted 

 

15 

 

4.2.1  The LSA may request 

63.  By referring to the LSA, this provision frames the action to be taken within the OSS mechanism while 
placing it within a specific case being handled, after the LSA has been identified. It should then be 
stressed that the possible resort to mutual assistance or to joint investigations pursuant to Article 60(2) 
is limited to the cooperation procedure related to the specific ongoing cross-border case. 

64.  Following the LSA’s level of discretion to conduct the investigation or to follow-up the measures taken 
by the controller or processor to comply with its decision, the wording “may request” empowers the 
LSA to take the initiative, but only if it deems necessary or appropriate for the case at hand. It is up to 
the  LSA  to  decide  whether  to  make  a  request  for  mutual  assistance  or  to  have  a  joint  operation, 
pursuant to Articles 61 and 62 respectively, as the GDPR does not impose on the LSA an obligation to 
use such possibilities.  

65.  Article 60(2) only covers requests made by the LSA, and not requests from the CSA27 addressed to the 
LSA in the context of the Article 60 cooperation procedure, as those are already envisaged by Article 
60(1) under the “exchange of relevant information”.  

4.2.2  The term “At any time” 

66.  This means that the LSA may send requests for mutual assistance or for a joint operation, whenever 
the  LSA  considers  the  action  justified  to  fully  exercise  its  competence  throughout  the  cooperation 
procedure provided for Article 60.  

67.  Indeed, within the same cooperation procedure, related to a specific case, the LSA may send several 
different requests, related to mutual assistance or to a joint operation or both. The LSA should bear in 
mind though that such requests should be necessary and adequate for the investigation and decision-
making  process  or  for  monitoring  the  implementation  by  the  controller  or  processor  of  the  LSA’s 
decision.  

4.2.3  The other CSAs as addressees 

68.  According to Article 60(2), the addressees of the requests by the LSA are in general the other CSAs, 
which  have  actively  expressed  to  be  concerned  in  the  specific  cooperation  procedure28.  In  case  of 
Article 61 mutual assistance requests, this does not imply that all CSAs are automatically addressees 
of the requests or have to be involved in the action at stake. That would depend on the assessment of 
the LSA on who is in the best position to contribute to the ongoing case. Conversely, when the LSA 
intends to carry out joint operations, all of the relevant CSAs have the right to participate pursuant to 
Article 62(2)29. 

69.  In the last phase of  the cooperation procedure, provided for in Article 60(10), which relates to  the 
follow-up of the compliance of the LSA’s final decision by the controller or processor, again the LSA 
may  decide, based  on  the  specifics of the case at hand, which  CSA(s) are to  be involved  in  actions 

                                                             
27 Pursuant to Article 56(5), whenever the LSA decides not to handle the case in view of its local nature, the CSA 
assumes then the leading role of the investigation and shall handle it according to Articles 61 and 62. If it happens 
that the CSA handling the case may need to request assistance to the LSA, Article 60 procedure does not apply, 
so Articles 61 and 62 will be directly applicable outside the scope of Article 60(2).  
28 See para. 36189 et seq. on the binding effect of the draft decision. 
29 However, the LSA is at liberty to extend the participation to SAs that are not CSAs. 

Adopted

intended  to  verify  on  the  spot  the  implementation  of  the  decision  and  it  will  send  the  assistance 
requests accordingly (e.g. the CSAs of the MS where the controller or processor have establishments).  

  Requests for mutual assistance 

70.  The mutual assistance instrument comprises a variety of possibilities for SAs to cooperate with each 
other,  in  order  to  implement and  apply  the GDPR in  a consistent manner,  taking into  account the 
geographical  dispersion  of  data  controllers’  or  processors’  establishments  and  of  data  subjects. 
However, the specific type of assistance requested will depend on the specific circumstances of the 
case, also taking into account that the LSA is the sole interlocutor of the controller or processor for the 
specific cross-border processing case being handled. 

71.  In a cross-border case within the Article 60 procedure, the LSA can send to the CSA(s) a request for any 
type of mutual assistance that is considered to be helpful for reaching a decision in the specific case.  

72.  During the investigatory phase, there are several situations where the LSA may need to request mutual 
assistance from other CSA(s). The most common one may be the case to ask for assistance of the CSA 
where  the  complaint  was  lodged  (e.g.  to  seek  for  additional  information  to  be  provided  by  the 
complainant; to have certain facts checked or evidence collected in the organisation establishment of 
that MS). In such situations, only one CSA would be involved. 

73.  However,  the  LSA  may  need  to  request  the  CSA(s)  to  provide  information  or  to  carry  out  an 
investigation  in  specific establishment(s) of the controller or processor in  some  MS, in  view of the 
conditions  under  which  the  data  is  being  processed  or  the  partition  of  responsibilities  among 
establishments. In these circumstances, the LSA will address the request to the relevant CSA(s).  

74.  At the end of the Article 60 procedure, after the controller or processor has notified the LSA on the 
measures taken to comply with the LSA’s final decision, as per Article 60(10), the LSA, upon information 
on that fact to the other CSA(s), may still request the CSA(s) to provide mutual assistance, in the form 
of verification, if – and how – the establishment of that controller or processor in that MS implemented 
the decision.  

75.  The mutual assistance requests sent under Article 60(2) should follow the general rules of Article 61, 
in what regards the purposes and reasons substantiating the request by the LSA on one hand, and the 
possible reply by the CSA(s) on the other. 

76.  In  accordance  with  Article  61(2),  when  receiving  a  request  by  the  LSA,  the  CSA(s)  shall  take  the 
appropriate  steps to  reply “without  undue delay”, and in any case “no later than one month after 
receiving the request”.  

77.  The principle of giving priority, to a certain extent, to the Article 60 procedure is already enshrined in 
Article 60(3) where the term “without delay” is used, as well as in the strict deadlines provided for in 
paragraphs 4 and 5. The term “undue delay”, used in Article 61, also stresses the need for the SA to act 
promptly, though the variety of actions covered by the mutual assistance requests may imply different 
timelines to fully give satisfaction to a request. In any way, the CSA(s) shall inform the LSA no later than 
one month after receiving the request “of the results or, as the case may be of the progress of the 
measures taken to respond to the request,” as per Article 61(2) in conjunction with Article 61(5).  

 

 

Adopted

  Setting up joint operations 

78.  In  accordance  with  Article  60(2),  the  LSA  may  conduct  joint  operations  pursuant  to  Article  62,  in 
particular  to carry  out  investigations or  to  monitor the implementation  of a measure  concerning a 
controller or processor established in another MS. 

79.  Therefore, within the LSA’s leading role in the Article 60 procedure, whenever it considers that the 
ongoing case benefits from a joint investigation or from joint enforcement measures, the LSA may set 
up a joint operation by requesting the CSA(s) to engage in such action, though there is no obligation 
for a CSA to reply positively. 

80.  A joint operation  can be hosted by the LSA in its  MS or it could be organized by the LSA as a joint 
investigation action of the CSAs to be deployed in several MS, where there are establishments of the 
controller or processor, to make verifications on the spot necessary for the outcome of the cooperation 
procedure. A joint operation can also be triggered by the LSA, as a joint enforcement measure of the 
relevant  CSAs  to  monitor  simultaneously  the  implementation  of  the  LSA’s  decision  in  each 
establishment of the controller or processor upon which the decision is binding. 

  ARTICLE 60(3) – INFORMATION BY THE LSA AND DRAFT DECISION 

OBLIGATION 

81.  Article 60(3) describes the decision-making process, which is a key step in the cooperation procedure 
between the LSA and the CSAs. The aim of this phase is to quickly find a consensus decision concerning 
the outcome of the case. 

82.  Article 60(3) focuses on the duties of the LSA and establishes three key obligations:  

 
 
 

communication of the relevant information on the matter to the CSAs without delay, 
submission of a draft decision to the other CSAs for their opinion without delay, and 
taking due account of the CSAs’ views. 
 

These obligations are to be regarded in line with the consensual approach established in Article 60(1). 

  Article 60(3)(1): LSA’s obligation to share information without delay 

5.1.1  The term of “without delay” 

83.  The term “without delay” is used in both sentences of Article 60(3). While sentence 1  contains the 
obligation of the LSA  to communicate  without delay  the relevant information on the matter to  the 
other CSAs, sentence 2 stipulates the LSA’s obligation to submit without delay a draft decision to the 
CSAs. 

84.  Although the term "without delay" is used in various places in the GDPR, it is not further defined in 

Article 4. 

85.  Since Article 60(3) is a legal provision under Union law, the term “without delay” must be interpreted 

autonomously from national law to ensure a uniform application of the GDPR.  

86.  The term “without delay” was subject of the judgement of the CJEU (18.11.1999, C-151/98 P, Recital 
25) in the context of the Regulation (EU) No. 2377/90. The CJEU found that the Court of First Instance 

Adopted 

 

18 

 

(ECJ)  was  right  to  hold  that  Article  8(3)(b)  does  not  specify  exactly  the  period  within  which  the 
Commission must propose to the Council the measures to be adopted and that in using the expression 
“without delay” the Community legislature, whilst requiring it to act swiftly, did allow the Commission 
a certain degree of latitude.  

87.  Therefore, in accordance with the ruling of the CJEU the EDPB considers the term “without delay” in 

the context of Article 60(3)(1) as the obligation to act swiftly30. 

88.  The fact that the legislator has inserted the term "without delay" in this context indicates that it has 
seen a need for action in terms of increasing the speed in the information flow connected with the 
draft decision. Nevertheless, due to the diversity of cases, no specific deadline could be determined in 
this respect. Therefore, the EDPB considers the term of "without delay" to mean that the information 
must be provided not literally immediately or in a specific timeframe but without hesitation, i.e. within 
a review period to be measured according to the circumstances of the individual case. In  summary, 
that means that the LSA has to act proactively and, as quickly as possible, appropriately to the case. 
This of course applies as well to the reaction by the other CSAs to requests by the LSA. 

89.  To facilitate the planning of the other CSAs for their contribution to the draft decision, the LSA should 
consider how it is possible to support the scheduling of work of the other CSAs. This could be done for 
example, where appropriate, by the way of creating an indicative timetable.  

Example 2: Prior to the investigation, the LSA proactively and quickly shares a timetable of the steps it 
intends to take. In due time, following the completion of the investigation, the LSA sends a summary 
of the results of the investigations to the CSAs in form of a note, with a short, reasonable deadline31 
for comments in the context of an “informal consultation” in the EDPB Information system.  

Following this, it shares the relevant information gathered and updates the timetable, adding a date 
for when it intends to share a preliminary draft decision, by when it requests comments by the CSAs 
on this preliminary draft decision and during which periods it intends to consult the affected parties.  

90.  As  a  best  practice,  the  LSA  and  the  CSAs  may  agree  that  the  obligation  to  exchange  relevant 
information “without delay” is fulfilled if there is a proactive, quick and comprehensive exchange of all 
relevant information, which enables the CSAs to screen, assess and react to it sufficiently early. 

5.1.2  The term of “relevant information” 

91.  With regard to the concept of relevant information, reference can be made to the remarks provided 

under section 3.3. 

92.  Article 60(3)(1) establishes an information obligation of the LSA towards the CSAs in contrast to Article 
60(1)(2),  which  regulates  a  mutual  exchange  of  information  between  LSA  and  other  CSAs.  The 
communication of relevant information by the LSA according to Article 60(3)(1) in conjunction with 

                                                             
30 In para. 115 of its opinion in the Case C 645/19 the Advocate General Bobek states that as a matter of 
principle, the GDPR requires, in cases concerning cross-border processing, the LSA to act promptly. Although 
acting promptly is not a synonym for acting swiftly, the EDPB considers that if the LSA acts proactively and as 
quickly as possible it also meets the requirements of acting promptly. 
31 What is understood as reasonable has to be assessed on a case by case basis and may vary from a few weeks 
up to a month or more. 

Adopted

Article 60(1)(2) is ultimately related to the submission of the draft decision. Relevant information that 
is accessible only to the LSA should be transmitted to the other CSAs via the EDPB Information system.  

93.  The core idea of the cooperation procedure is that the consensus decision is reached and the case is 
resolved by collaborative interaction between the LSA and the other CSAs. Therefore, the other CSAs’ 
involvement in the cooperation procedure is not limited to the right to express a relevant and reasoned 
objection pursuant to Article 60(4). In particular, before the creation of the draft decision the CSAs 
should be able to contribute to the overall procedure and may express their views also before the 
creation of the draft decision.  

94.  To that end, the LSA should in general endeavour to exchange preliminary results prior to submitting 
the draft decision, in particular, when divergent views could be expected, or when the other CSAs may 
need some time to familiarize themselves with the subject matter. This enables the LSA to be informed 
about the views of the other CSAs, in order to take these views duly into account already in preparation 
of the draft decision.   

Example 3: At an early stage, after a preliminary examination of a complaint-based case, indicating 
further use of personal data for other purposes by business partners, the LSA shares this discovery 
with the other CSAs to seek an agreement on whether to proceed exclusively within the remit of the 
complaint or to extend the scope of the investigation into such secondary data processing. 

Example 4: Upon conclusion of the fact-finding, the LSA provides a summary of the main results to the 
other CSAs, and, as appropriate in this case, also identifies key-issues for their consideration, in order 
to  start  building  a  common  ground  for  the  assessment  of  the  merits  of  the  case.  This  anticipated 
interaction between the LSA and the other CSAs proves essential to detect from the outset different 
points of view and, consequently, to promote as much as possible the necessary convergence.   

Example 5: At a later stage, closer to the submission of the draft decision, all involved SAs have an 
overview  of  the  facts  and  also  an  assessment  of  the  potential  infringements  found  during  the 
investigation  phase.  These  preliminary  results  and  further  evaluation  include  provisions  that  have 
possibly been violated and envisaged measures to be taken by the SAs under Article 58(2) and under 
Article 83(2).  

95.  As set out above and in the examples, the exchange of controversial or divergent legal views, as well 
as the exchange of views on  complementary steps taken or not, and/or elements provided or not, 
should be general practice. This could prevent the discussion on different interpretations of the GDPR 
and the decision on them from being shifted to the dispute resolution procedure. 

96.  Nevertheless, where the LSA decides to trigger an inquiry on its own initiative and not on the basis of 
elements forwarded  by  the  other  CSAs,  it does so  within  the remit of its discretionary  power  and, 
therefore, the views of the other CSAs cannot result in compelling the LSA to change the scope of its 
inquiry32.  

 

 

                                                             
32 Nonetheless, a CSA may raise, in a last resort situation, an objection regarding the scope as highlighted in 
para. 9 of the EDPB Guidelines 09/2020 on relevant and reasoned objection, provided that it meets all the 
requirements posed in Article 4(24), as explained in the Guidelines.

  Article 60(3)(2): LSA’s obligation to issue a “Draft Decision” 

5.2.1  Legal obligation to submit a draft decision 

97.  Article 60(3)(2) sets forth an obligation on the LSA to submit a draft decision to the other CSA(s). This 
is shown by the use of the “shall” form coupled with  the verb “submit”, which entails a rule to be 
followed in all cases where Article 60 is applicable.  

98.  The submission of a draft decision under Article 60(3)(2)  is an obligation applying to the LSA in the 
context of all OSS procedures. The competence of the LSA is grounded in Article 56(1), which is to be 
regarded as ‘lex specialis’ whenever an issue arises in respect of cross-border processing operations. 
The  competence  of  the  LSA  under  Article  56(1)  is  exercised  in  such  cases  “in  accordance  with  the 
procedure in Article 60”; therefore, the LSA acting within the framework of the OSS is bound by the 
provisions of Article 60, including Article 60(3)(2). 

99.  Accordingly, the LSA is required to submit a draft decision to the  other CSAs in all cases, also when 
complaints are withdrawn  by  the  complainant after the Article 60 procedure has been  initiated  or 
where no material (final) decision is issued according to national law. 

100. Also in these cases, the draft decision serves as a final coordination between all supervisory authorities 
involved  in  the  OSS procedure  including the legal opportunities provided  in  Article  60(4) et seq. In 
complaint-based cases, the draft decision also provides the ground for the CSAs decisions pursuant to 
Article 60(8) and (9). 

Example  6:  After  a  complaint-based  OSS  proceeding  has  been  initiated,  the  controller  promptly 
eliminates  the  infringement  after  being  approached  by  the  LSA.  In  view  of  the  case  and  the 
behaviour of the controller, the LSA concludes that the case may be closed. The LSA issues a draft 
decision stating its intention to close the case, which contains thorough reasoning for their course 
of action, and the remaining steps provided for by the Article 60 procedure are followed. 

101. As explained in section 3.2 above and recalled by the EDPB in the RRO Guidelines 2/2020, “the focus 
of all SAs involved should be on eliminating any deficiencies in the consensus-building process in such 
a way that a consensual draft  decision is the result”. The LSA shall submit the draft decision to the 
other CSAs “for their opinion”, i.e. the purpose is to consult the CSAs on the substance of the draft 
decision (see also reference in Article 60(4) to the “consultation” that the LSA is required to carry out 
“in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article”). The consultation to which the submission of the draft 
decision  is  geared  should  therefore  be  seen  in  the  light,  once  again,  of  the  consensus  objective 
underpinning the whole Article 60 mechanism (see the section 5.2.4 below on “take due account of 
their views”). 

102. As  a  best  practice,  the  EDPB  recommends  that  the  LSA  informs  the  other  CSAs  beforehand  of  the 
intention to submit a draft decision. This could be in line with an indicative timetable the LSA provided 
as part of the relevant information (according to Article 60(1)), in particular for cases which involve a 
large  number  of  CSAs  and/or  which  raise  sensitive  questions.  In  any  case,  knowing  what  is  in  the 
pipeline beforehand will help the CSAs organise their assessment of the draft decision and exploit the 
four-week deadline of Article 60(4) in full.   

103. Regarding the “submit” part of the obligation, the EDPB recommends that such submission should only 
take place by way of the EDPB Information system so that certainty can be achieved as to the date of 
the submission, which is the starting point for the running of the four-week period mentioned in Article 

Adopted 

 

21 

 

60(4), and that all the CSAs can receive the draft decision simultaneously. This approach will ensure 
security and confidentiality of the submission and is also necessary in light of possible objections to 
the draft decision and disagreements between LSA and CSA, triggering the Article 65(1)(a) procedure33. 
Use of the EDPB Information system appears to be the most appropriate channel to ensure a clear 
timestamp for the submission of the draft decision also in pursuance of Article 60(12). 

104. As for the contents of the submission, in principle the draft decision should be such as to contain all 
the elements required for the CSAs to assess it (see section 6.2.2 below). Moreover, in particular for 
cases  resulting  in  the  adoption  of  a  corrective  measure  and  involving  a  large  amount  of  relevant 
information exchanged to understand the reasoning and the analysis leading to the draft decision, the 
“relevant  information”  for  the  purposes  of  the  draft  decision  should  have  been  exchanged  before 
submitting  the  draft  decision  in  the  light  of  the  consensus  objective  underpinning  the  whole 
cooperation procedure. In other, simpler cases, where the draft decision is self-explanatory and no or 
very little relevant information needs to be exchanged, the relevant information may be shared along 
with the draft decision. Thus, in principle, the obligation under Article 60(3)(2) is for the LSA to submit 
only the draft decision as such.  

105. Furthermore, the EDPB recalls that, where it is applicable under national law, the LSA should make 
sure that the draft decision it submits in this phase is fully compliant with the national law provisions 
regarding the right to be heard of the parties targeted by it (in particular the controller/processor at 
issue and the complainant, if a complaint has to be dismissed or rejected according to the applicable 
national laws). The LSA is therefore not required to submit, jointly with the draft decision and at  the 
same time, such documents as may be necessary to provide evidence of compliance with the right to 
be heard, but it should reference the steps taken to ensure such compliance in the draft decision itself.  

5.2.2  The term of “draft decision” 

106. The  submission  of  a  draft  decision  is  to  be  considered  as  one  of  the  key  elements  within  the 
cooperation mechanism as it constitutes on the one hand the decisive and final opportunity for mutual 
consultation on remaining disagreements and on the other hand, the only opportunity for the other 
CSAs to express reasoned and relevant objections. 

107. The GDPR itself does not define the concept of the draft decision. In view of the meaning and purpose 
of  the  cooperation  procedure,  the  notion  of  a  draft  decision  at  EU  level  should  be  subject  to  the 
development of common minimum standards to enable all involved SAs to participate adequately in 
the decision-making process. 

108. According to Article 288(1) TFEU, a decision is an act of exercising [the Union’s] competences. In this 
context,  the GDPR  uses  the  terms  of  “tasks”  (Article 57) and “powers” (Article 58) to  establish  the 
competences of data protection authorities.  

109. Regarding legally binding measures supervisory authorities are empowered to take, a description of 

formal requirements can be found in Recital 129:  

                                                             
33 Indeed, Article 11(2), letter d) of the RoP requires the LSA to provide “documentation proving the timing and 
format of the provision of the (revised) draft decision”’ to enable the Secretariat to verify that the draft decision 
(or revised draft decision) and the objections were submitted within the applicable deadlines.

Indication of the SA which has issued the measure34 

  Written form 
  Clear and unambiguous wording 
 
  Date of issue of the measure 
  Signature of authorised SA staff 
  Reasons included 
  Reference to the right of an effective remedy. 

 

110. These formal aspects are in line with the ECJ case law on decisions of EU bodies as per Article 288(1)35 
TFEU as well as with the Charter of Fundamental Rights36. Even though these provisions are supposed 
to regulate EU bodies, they provide guidance and may allow conclusions on the form and content of a 
draft decision as the respective competences are conferred on the SAs by Union law.  

111. The  previous  conditions  lead  to  the  interpretation  that  every  decision  that  is  aimed  at  legal 
consequences  needs to  include  a  description  of relevant facts, sound  reasoning and a proper legal 
assessment. These requirements essentially serve the purpose of legal certainty and legal protection 
of  the  parties  concerned.  Applied  to  the  area  of  data  protection  supervision  this  means  that  the 
controller, processor and complainant should be able to acknowledge all the reasons in order to decide 
whether they should bring the case to trial37. Having regard to the decision making process within the 
cooperation mechanism, CSAs likewise need to be in the position to decide on possibly taking actions 
(e.g. agree to the decision, provide their views on the subject matter). 

112. According to Article 60(3)(2) the term “decision” is modified by the prefix “draft”. A draft generally 
names a document, which is not final. It is an earlier version of the document that still needs a further 
step for completion. Apart from that final step, a draft contains all elements of the final document, but 
may be subject to further discussion or adjustment. As a result of such discussions, the draft can either 
be accepted by reviewers or modified according to their remarks. This is consistent with the wording 
of  the  GDPR,  which  states  that  the  draft  decision  is  to  be  submitted  to  the  other  CSAs  “for  their 
opinion”. 

113. In order to fulfil their duties as CSAs in the framework of a cooperation procedure, it is necessary for 
the other CSAs to be able to assess the case on the basis of comprehensive documentation. The other 
CSAs need to be in the position to fully understand the case, the LSA’s conclusions and the reasoning, 
which have led to those conclusions. 

Example 7: In order to be able to understand the appropriateness of a fine, the other CSAs must know 
the amount of the proposed fine and the specific circumstances of the assessment. This will regularly 
be explained in a comprehensible manner in the context of a decision that meets the above-mentioned 
minimum standards.  

                                                             
34 This includes the dismissal/rejection of a complaint. 
35 Cf. ECJ, Joint Cases 11/66 (“legal effects which are binding“); ECJ, C 317/19 P (“examine their complaint in 
sufficient detail and to give adequate reasons“), ECJ, Joined Cases 8 to 11/66 (“reasons for this decision with 
sufficient clarity“); ECJ, C-24/62 (“principal issues of law and of fact upon which it is based”).

114. Taking into account the findings stated above, a draft decision is a provisional suggestion in the same 
form as a final decision would be. The only difference apart from procedural considerations between 
a draft decision and a final decision is that the step of the (final) consultation with the other CSAs has 
not been executed and the fact that the draft decision is not yet externally binding. If no relevant and 
reasoned  objections  according  to  Article  60(4)  and  (5)  are  expressed,  the  draft  decision  becomes 
legally binding for all SAs (cf. Article 60(6))38.  

115. In view of the aforementioned constitutional requirements for a legal decision within the meaning of 
Union law, and against the background of the meaning and purpose of the cooperation procedure, it 
appears  necessary  that  the  draft  decision  in  the  sense  of  Article  60(3)(2)  corresponds  in  form  and 
content to the decision that the competent SA is to adopt in the specific case. In this respect, the EDPB 
considers  the  notion  "draft"  to  refer  only  to  the  provisional  nature  resulting  from  the  mandatory 
involvement requirement of Article 60(3)(2). 

116. In cases where complaints are withdrawn after the Article 60 procedure has been initiated or where 
no material (final) decision is issued according to national law, the draft decision should be modified 
as is appropriate to the case with a view to providing the findings in line with paragraph 113 above. 
This means that the draft decision must in any case indicate the intention of the LSA to close the case 
and sufficient reasoning appropriate to the case, which shall, at a minimum, enable the other CSAs to 
defend the case within their jurisdictions. 

117. The  EDPB  points  out  further  that,  in  principle,  the  existing  information  obligations  under  the 
cooperation  procedure  do  not  affect  the  form  and  content  of  the  draft  decision.  Continuous 
transparency during all stages of the procedure is vital, but it does  not affect the need for a proper 
description of the case and the legal assessment as a part of the draft decision itself. 

118. The cooperation  system  designed  by  the legislator suggests that consensus on  all relevant matters 
regarding the respective case should be strived for at an earlier stage by the competent SAs through 
continuous exchange of information. Therefore, the EDPB would like to emphasise that the focus of all 
SAs involved should be on eliminating any deficiencies in the consensus-building process in such a way 
that a consensual draft decision is the result. 

119. These statements apply without prejudice to any additional requirements for decisions that may arise 

from respective national law. 

5.2.3  The term of “without delay” regarding the submission of the draft decision 

120. According to Article 60(3) (2), the LSA shall submit the draft decision to the other CSAs “without delay”. 
A timely submission of the draft decision also alleviates the risks for the protection of the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of data  subjects, since  corrective measures  taken  in due time by SAs prevent 
continuing infringements. 

121. As regards the legal characterisation of the term “without delay”, the analysis carried out in section 
5.1.1 above applies. Therefore, the LSA has to begin swiftly to create the draft decision in order to 

                                                             
38 At this stage, it should be clarified whether the decision will be finalised via Article 60(7), (8) or 9. See para. 
227. 

Adopted 

 

24 

 

submit it to the other CSA(s); nevertheless bearing in mind the complexity and the variety of cases, the 
timeline in which the LSA needs to submit swiftly the draft decision can be quite different. 

122. What time is necessary for the submission of the draft decision must be assessed on the basis of an 
objective  standard.  The  characteristics  of  the  individual  case  and  the  overarching  obligation  to 
cooperate ”in an endeavour to reach consensus” set out in Article 60(1), which in this case refers to 
the phase preceding the submission of the draft decision, shall be considered as well.  

Example 8: A relatively straightforward investigation into a complaint regarding data subjects rights, 
whose outcome is to be disclosed to the other CSA as being relevant information pursuant to Article 
60(3)(1),  should  enable  the  LSA  to  submit  the  draft  decision  shortly  after  the  conclusion  of  the 
investigations.  

In cases with complex findings and investigations, the LSA may be legitimised to take some time to 
submit the draft decision after the conclusion of the investigations (as made known to the CSAs)39. 

123. It should be pointed out that, pursuant to Article 41(1) CFR, the complainant has the right that his or 
her complaint is handled within a reasonable time. The ECJ has stated in a judgement of 8 May 2014 
(C  604/12)  that  the  right  to  good  administration,  enshrined  in  Article  41  of  the  Charter,  reflects  a 
general  principle  of  EU  law.  This  notion  must  also  be  respected  in  the  execution  of  Union  law 
throughout applying Member State administrative law like in the Article 60 procedure - all the more 
so considering that Recital 129 recalls that the powers of SAs (such as powers of investigation and 
corrective powers, including sanctions) should be exercised “(…) fairly and within a reasonable time”. 
Thus, the timeframe with which a LSA may submit a draft decision in a complaint-based case should 
be such as not to entail that the handling of that complaint requires unreasonable time.  

5.2.4  The term of “taking due account of their views” 

124. To  allow  the  LSA  to  take  into  account  the  views  of  other  CSAs,  the  other  CSAs  are  tasked  with 
expressing  their  views  as  early  as  possible  in  the  procedure.  The  views  to  be  expressed  are,  thus, 
understood  in  a  more  extensive  way  than  only  relevant  and  reasoned  objections.  Indeed,  Article 
60(3)(2) refers to a broader concept than the mere consideration by the LSA of relevant and reasoned 
objections (Article 60(4) and (5)), including also comments, expression of support or remarks. 

125. The EDPB considers that the LSA has the obligation to take due account of the other CSAs´ views prior 
to and after the submission of the draft decision, as the obligation to endeavour to reach consensus 
pervades  the  entire  cooperation  procedure  and  is  not  terminated  by  the  submission  of  the  draft 
decision. 

126. For this purpose, the draft decision  should already address as much as possible the arguments and 
views shared by the other CSAs. Recital 125(2) states that the LSA should closely involve and coordinate 

                                                             
39 It should be recalled that the need for a consensual scoping of the inquiries in the individual cases has been 
recognised by the EDPB in the RRO Guidelines 09/2020 (see para. 28): “In procedures based on a complaint or on 
an infringement reported by a CSA, the scope of the procedure (i.e. those aspects of data processing which are 
potentially the subject of a violation) should be defined by the content of the complaint or of the report shared by 
the CSA: in other words, it should be defined by the aspects addressed by the complaint or report. In own-volition 
inquiries, the LSA and CSAs should seek consensus regarding the scope of the procedure (i.e. the aspects of data 
processing under scrutiny) prior to initiating the procedure formally.”  

Adopted 

 

25 

 

the CSAs already in the decision-making process. To what extent this is necessary may vary from case 
to case. 

127. The obligation for the LSA to take due account of the other CSAs’ views in preparing the draft decision 
can also be inferred from the wording of Article 60(3)(2) to the extent that it relates to views expressed 
before the submission of the draft decision. The obligation for the LSA to take due account of the other 
CSAs’ views after submitting the draft decision requires that the LSA considers not only relevant and 
reasoned objections but also comments or remarks, expressed during the period provided in Article 
60(4) and (5). 

128. The obligation to take due account means that the LSA will have to consider the views and arguments 
of the other CSAs in substance, using due diligence, as the cooperation procedure aims for a consensual 
decision.  

129. As a best practice, the LSA should react to the views provided by all CSAs. The overarching obligation 
of endeavoring to reach consensus places concomitant obligations on both the LSA and the other CSAs. 
This means that the LSA is obliged to take account of all the views. However, the LSA is not obliged to 
follow each view that has been expressed. This is in particular the case where there are contradictory 
views among the other CSAs.  

130. Article 60(3)(2) uses the wording “take due account” of the other CSAs views, whereas Recital 130(2) 
refers to “take utmost account”40 of the view of the CSA with which the complaint has been lodged 
when taking measures intended to produce legal effects, including the imposition of administrative 
fines. The different wording (“utmost” instead of “due”) reflects the specific role of the CSA with which 
the complaint has been lodged and suggests that this CSA’s views have a more significant influence on 
the draft decision. This is due to the close link between this CSA and the case, because the CSA acts as 
a single point of contact for the complainant and, additionally, this CSA may be required to adopt and 
defend a decision, pursuant to Article 60(8) and (9).  

  ARTICLE 60(4) – ASSESSMENT OF THE OBJECTIONS AND 

POSSIBILITY TO TRIGGER A DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS 

  Purpose of the provision 

131. Article 60(4) concerns the period immediately following the submission of the draft decision by the 
LSA.  Upon  the  submission,  a  four-week  deadline  begins  to  run  during  which  any  CSA  may  raise 
objections to the draft decision.   

132. Within the individual provisions of Article 60, Article 60(4) has a unique position insofar as it establishes 
a link between the cooperation and consistency procedure. Where a CSA “expresses a relevant and 

                                                             
40 In cooperation procedures under Article 56, in which the LSA has exercised its right under Article 56(4)(1) and 
decided to handle the case itself, the GDPR provides for an even more significant involvement of the CSA. In 
these cases, the CSA may submit to the LSA a draft for a decision according to Article 56(4)(2) and the LSA is 
expressly  required  to  take  “utmost  account”  of  such  draft.  This  wording  suggests  a  higher  threshold  by 
introducing an even increased obligation for the LSA to consider the views of the CSA in comparison with “take 
due account of their views”.

reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead supervisory authority shall, if it does not follow the 
relevant and  reasoned objection or  is  of the opinion that  the  objection is not relevant or  reasoned, 
submit  the  matter  to  the  consistency  mechanism  referred  to  in  Article  63.”  This  deserves  special 
attention in light of the fact that in this scenario the goal of reaching a consensus between the SAs, 
which is essential to the cooperation procedure, could not be achieved. 

133. The EDPB recalls that the achievement of a consensual agreement on the outcome of the case is the 
ultimate goal of the whole procedure established by Article 60 and  that reaching consensus should 
take priority over initiating the dispute resolution process. The duty of cooperation applies to every 
stage of the procedure and for all involved SAs. With regard to Article 60(4), this means that both other 
CSAs and LSAs should carefully follow the previous steps established in Article 60(1) and (3). 

  Relevant and reasoned objections by a CSA 

134. After having been consulted by the LSA, in accordance with Article 60(3), the other  CSAs may raise 
relevant  and  reasoned  objections within  a  deadline of four weeks,  since the  CSAs must  have been 
consulted “in accordance with paragraph 3”.  

6.2.1  Calculation of the deadline 

135. The four-week period starts once the LSA has submitted the draft decision according to Article 60(3)(2) 
via the EDPB Information System. The calculation of the deadline for raising possible objections shall 
be done on the basis of Regulation 1182/7141. According to Article 3(2)(c) of Regulation 1182/71, “a 
period expressed in weeks…shall start at the beginning of the first hour of the first day of the period, 
and shall end with the expiry of the last hour of whichever day in the last week…is the same day of the 
week, or falls on the same date, as the day from which the period runs”.  

136. If an event from which a weekly period starts to run occurs, for example, on a Monday, the period also 

ends on Monday, in this case with the expiry of Monday (i.e. 11:59:59 p.m.) four weeks later.  

137. The period includes public holidays, Sundays and Saturdays, since the GDPR does not expressly exclude 
these42. However, when the last day of a period is a public holiday, Sunday or Saturday, the period shall 
end  with  the  expiry  of  the  last  hour  of  the  following  working  day,  thus  the  deadline  ends  on  the 
following working day43. Considering the European nature of the cooperation procedure, the holidays 
published  in  the  official  journal  for  the  EU  institutions44  should  be  considered  for  the  purpose  of 
determining public holidays. Further, the time zone of where the EDPB is established should be used.  

138. To avoid having the expiration date fall during the weekend, the initiator (i.e. LSA) should trigger the 
workflow only on working days and should make sure that the deadline does not expire on one of the 
EU holidays45. In the spirit of cooperation, the EDPB encourages LSAs to consider the possible impact

of extended holiday periods before submitting its draft decision to allow the other CSAs as much time 
as possible to react to its draft decision. 

139. During  the  four-week  period,  a  CSA  may  express  one  or  more  objections  to  the  draft  decision 
submitted  by  the  LSA.  However,  in  view  of  the  requirements  to  raise  relevant  and  reasoned 
objection(s) to the draft decision as  a  whole, the CSA should provide their objections in  one single 
submission, though clearly distinguishing the different objections. This best practice will facilitate the 
analysis by the LSA and eventually by the EDPB, in case the dispute resolution mechanism is triggered. 
If,  after  inserting  the  objection(s)  in  the  EDPB  Information  system,  the  CSA  wishes  to  modify  its 
submission, in any way and for any reason, this would still be possible, as long as this remains within 
the deadline provided for in Article 60(4). Therefore, the CSA should delete the previous version of the 
objection(s) and upload the new one in the EDPB Information system46, so the submission available for 
the LSA and the other CSAs is always the updated text of the objection(s). 

6.2.2  Relevant and reasoned objections 

140. One of the key elements in this stage of the cooperation procedure is a common understanding of the 
notion  of  the  term  “relevant  and  reasoned  objection”.  Article  4(24)  defines  relevant  and  reasoned 
objection as an objection to a draft decision as to whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, 
or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this Regulation, 
which  clearly  demonstrates the  significance of the risks posed  by the draft decision  as regards the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal 
data within the Union. 

141. As the EU legislator suggested (end of Recital 124), the EDPB has issued guidelines on what constitutes 
a relevant and reasoned objection. The following paragraphs therefore only contain clarifications that 
are essential for the Article 60 procedure and are not already contained in the Guidelines 09/2020.   

142. The  right  to  raise  an  objection  under  Article  60(4)  is  available  to  each  CSA  individually  and 
independently.  Therefore,  it  does  not  depend  on  whether  another  CSA  may  already  has  raised  an 
objection on the same matter. To the extent that a CSA objects on the basis of several items, each 
must separately meet the requirements for a relevant and reasoned objection under Article 4(24)47. 
Consequentially,  the  mere  endorsement  of  or  referral  to  another  CSA’s  relevant  and  reasoned 
objection does not constitute a relevant and reasoned objection on its own. In this context, for reasons 
of legal certainty as well as clarity and reliability within the objection process, the EDPB recommends 
that each CSA submit its own and complete (formal) objection to the LSA even if one CSA wishes to 
concur with the objection of another CSA48.  

                                                             
46 The EDPB Information system will automatically notify the LSA and other CSAs of the new addition.

https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-092020-relevant-and-reasoned-
objection-under_en. 
48 According to the EDPB Guidelines 09/2020 on relevant and reasoned objection under Regulation  2016/679, 
referencing  another  objection  cannot  be  seen  as  meeting  the  requirement  of  Article  4(24).  In  para.  7  the 
Guidelines  clarify  that  “(...)  a  submission  by  a  CSA  should  in  principle  explicitly  mention  each  element  of  the 
definition in relation to each specific objection.” Further, in para. 8 the Guidelines stipulate that “[t]herefore, the 
standard  of  “relevant  and  reasoned  objection”  is  grounded  on  the  assumption  that  the  LSA’s  obligation  to 
exchange all relevant information is complied with, allowing the CSA(s) to have an in-depth understanding of the 
case and therefore to submit a solid and well-reasoned objection.” 

Adopted 

 

28 

 

143. In order to meet the threshold set by Article 4(24), a submission by a CSA should in principle explicitly 
mention each element of this legal definition in relation to each specific objection. If possible, as a 
good practice, the objection may also include a new wording proposal for the LSA to consider, which 
in the opinion of the CSA allows remedying the alleged shortcomings in the draft decision.  

144. As required by Article 60(12), the CSAs shall submit the objections via an electronic and standardised 

format. The EDPB Information System shall be used for these purposes. 

145. A mere “comment” expressed by a CSA in relation to a draft decision does not amount to an objection 
within the meaning of Article 4(24). The existence of comments shall therefore not give rise to the 
obligation  to  trigger  the Article 65(1)(a)  procedure if the LSA  decides not to give  any effect to the 
comment49. 

6.2.3  Assessment of the objections to the draft submitted under Article 60(4) 

146. The LSA should make use of all possible means to exchange with the other CSAs on the issues raised in 
the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  draft  decision  of  the  LSA  should 
primarily be self-explanatory. Nevertheless, in response to an objection, the LSA should, also as a good 
practice, provide the CSA with explanation as to why a certain position has been taken in the draft 
decision, and it should as well provide the CSA with the opportunity to further explain its objections 
with undue delay. The LSA may also take the initiative to organise meetings, or otherwise use informal 
consultation to ensure that the reasoning employed by the respective authorities is understood.  

147. After this further cooperation following the raising of an objection, the CSA may consider whether the 
LSA’s response adequately addresses its concerns and, if so, the CSA may  consider withdrawing its 
objection50. It may be the case in particular,  when, following the LSA's explanations,  the conflicting 
views are only marginal in nature, in respect of the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
the data subjects. 

148. If a CSA decides to withdraw its objection it should always explicitly identify the objection it intends to 
withdraw and be explicit that it wishes to withdraw said objection. This withdrawal may take place 
during the four-week  period, or in  case of a revised  draft decision  two-week period, following the 
submission of the draft decision, in which case the withdrawal should take place in the same  EDPB 
Information system notification in which the objection has been raised. The withdrawal may as well 
take place after this period51. The LSA should make sure to document when this happened and notify 
this  withdrawal  to  other  CSA(s)  without  undue  delay,  via  the  EDPB  Information  system,  as  this 
information is to be understood as relevant information under Article 60(1).  

149. When objections from different CSAs contradict each other on the assessment of a specific matter52, 
the LSA should indicate which objections it intends to follow and to what extend/how it intends to 
follow them.  On  the other hand, the other  CSAs should carefully consider whether a withdrawal is 

                                                             
49 See para. 17 of the EDPB Guidelines 03/2021 on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR (version for public consultation). 
50 After the period of the procedure expired, the CSA may consider not raising again its objection if the draft 
decision is to be revised. 
51 As provided for in para. 27 of the EDPB Guidelines 03/2021 on Article 65(1)(a) a CSA may withdraw even after 
an Article 65(1)(a) procedure has been initiated. . 
52 A constant exchange of information between the SAs involved could prevent such situations. 

Adopted

appropriate  in  light  of  the  opinions  expressed  by  the  LSA  and/or  other  CSAs53.  It  is  important  to 
remember that the overarching aim of Article 60 is for decisions to be made by consensus, insofar as 
possible. This goal regards the LSA as well as on the other CSAs.  

  Submission to Board 

150. Article 60(4) provides for two alternative conditions, each of which has the effect of requiring the LSA 

to seek a decision from the Board: 

 
 

The LSA is of the opinion that the objection(s) is/are not relevant or reasoned. 
The LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objection(s). 

151. In the first situation, the LSA is of the opinion that the objection submitted by the CSA does not meet 
all the requirements set out in Article 4(24), i.e. it considers that the objection is either not relevant 
and/or  not  reasoned,  or  both,  in  terms  of  whether  there  is  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR  and/or 
whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. In the 
second situation, the LSA considers the objection(s) to be both relevant and reasoned, but does not 
intend to follow them. 

152. “The matter” to be submitted to the Board only concerns objections that the LSA does not intend to 
follow or that the LSA does not consider to meet the threshold stipulated in Article 4(24). Therefore, 
the items on which there is no dispute are not to be addressed via the dispute resolution under Article 
65(1)(a). 

153. Although Article 60(4) does not provide for an explicit time limit for the submission, the fact that a 
decision is pending which affects the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects 
should result in the requirement of a submission as soon as possible as appropriate to the individual 
case54.  

154. On the other hand, in situations where the LSA wishes to follow some objections, but does not wish to 
follow other objections and/or does not consider them to be relevant and/or reasoned, the LSA should 
submit a revised draft in the procedure as per Article 60(5), according to the following section. The LSA 
should  indicate  clearly, through an  informal exchange,  which  of the objections it  intends to  follow 
within the revised draft decision and how it intends to do so. Further, the LSA should indicate clearly, 
which objections have been noted as being the subject of a possible later dispute resolution via Article 
65(1)(a)55. 

155. Nonetheless, as the revised draft decision is a new instrument, if they want to sustain their objections 
previously raised, the other CSAs will have to reiterate their position by (re)submitting their objections 
once the revised draft decision is shared. The EDPB is of the opinion that this course of action should 
be followed because it will allow relying on the dispute resolution procedure only for the objections 
that  remain  on  the  table  in  spite  of  the  efforts  made  by  all  the  parties  to  first  seek  a  consensual 
solution. 

                                                             
53 The CSAs should bear in mind that, should it come to a dispute resolution, the EDPB will adopt its decision 
based on a (qualified) majority vote.

  ARTICLE 60(5) - THE REVISED DRAFT DECISION 

  Submission to the other CSAs 

7.1.1 

 The LSA intends to follow 

156. Article 60(5)(1) gives the LSA the possibility to follow a relevant and reasoned objection. It is important 
to  note  that  to  follow  a  relevant  and  reasoned  objection  means  to  follow  such  objection  as  it  is, 
because  the  objection  at  issue  is  found  by  the  LSA  to  be  both  relevant  and  reasoned  and  the  LSA 
concurs with the reasoning.  

157. The focus is on the “intention” to follow. The LSA’s intention to follow an objection is reflected in the 
fact that the LSA submits a revised draft decision. To what extent the revised draft decision does follow 
the relevant and reasoned objection as a whole raised by a CSA is, among other things, the subject of 
the procedure regulated by Article 60(5)(2) (see below, section 7.2), and ultimately by Article 65(1)(a) 
in case of disputes.  

158. It should also be recalled that the threshold set forth by the EU legislator in the definition of a relevant 
and reasoned objection under Article 4(24) has to be met also in light of the manner the relevant and 
reasoned objection is to be structured by a CSA as set in the Guidelines 09/202056. This impacts the 
assessment  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection  by  the  LSA.  Still,  it  is  unquestionable  that  the 
intention to follow a relevant and reasoned objection is in line with the consensus objective underlying 
the whole Article 60 procedure. The revision should aim to completely address the risk posed by the 
initial draft decision as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects and, where 
applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union that was identified in the objection. 

159. The EDPB recalls that the LSA should make use of all possible means to exchange with the other CSAs 
on the issues raised in the relevant and reasoned objection. The LSA may take the initiative to organise 
meetings,  or  otherwise  use  informal  consultation  to  ensure  that  the  reasoning  employed  by  the 
respective  authorities  is  understood57.  In  any  case,  this  exchange  should  lead  to  the  fact  that  the 
content of the revised draft decision does not come as a surprise to the other CSAs, as it should be the 
result of a sincere cooperation. 

7.1.2  The obligation to submit a revised draft decision 

160. The LSA is obliged to submit a revised draft decision if it intends to follow a relevant and reasoned 
objection, i.e. there is no alternative under the GDPR as clarified by the use of the “shall” auxiliary with 
the verb “submit”’. Indeed, the alternative to submitting a revised draft decision can only consist in 
submitting the matter to the consistency mechanism as per Article 60(4) final sentence.  

161. It should be pointed out that it is only a relevant and reasoned objection the LSA intends to follow that 
triggers the obligation on, and the possibility for the LSA to submit a revised draft decision under the 
GDPR. Article 60(5)(1) (and Article 60(4), for that matter) only refers to the  “relevant and reasoned 
objection” submitted by a CSA – contrary to, in particular, Article 60(3), which refers to the “views” of 
the other CSAs58.  

                                                             
56 For details, see EDPB Guidelines 09/2020 on Relevant and Reasoned Objection para. 6-8. 
57 See also para. 146 et seq. 
58 See above in section 5.2.4 on “take due account”. 

Adopted 

 

31 

 

162. Accordingly, the fact that a CSA provided comments, remarks, observations to the LSA in the course of 
the four-week period mentioned in Article 60(4) which are not clearly and unambiguously declared as 
a relevant and reasoned objection does not entail an obligation or the possibility for the LSA to submit 
a revised draft decision. It should be recalled in this respect that both the LSA and the other CSAs are 
bound  by  the  draft  decision  in  case  no  objections  are  submitted  “in  the  period  referred  to  in 
paragraphs 4  and 5” pursuant to Article 60(6). This means that the LSA is  m issuing a revised draft 
decision if no objections are submitted formally by the CSA, via the EDPB information system, in the 
four-week period set forth in Article 60(4) (more details in section 8) 59.  

163. Should the LSA consider it necessary to nevertheless adapt its draft decision as submitted under Article 
60(4)  on  account  of  factors  or  considerations  supervening  during  the  four-week  period,  including 
comments  or  remarks  submitted  by  the  other  CSAs,  or 
further  submissions  by  the 
controller/processor, the LSA should withdraw its draft decision prior to the expiry of the four-week 
period and submit a new draft decision to the other CSAs. In doing so, the LSA should strike a balance 
between on one hand the importance of the factors or considerations supervening and on the other 
hand the need to ensure the expediency of the cooperation procedure60. In all cases, the LSA should 
make clear to all the CSAs why it is withdrawing its draft decision by referring to the specific factor or 
consideration that is prompting it to take such a step. A new four-week period will start once the new 
draft decision is submitted. As said, this option is barred after the expiry of the above period in the 
absence of reasoned and relevant objections and the draft decision as initially issued becomes binding 
on the LSA and the other CSAs. 

164. Considering the above, it is important for the LSA and the other CSAs to consult each other on how the 

LSA interprets the objections and how it intends to follow the objections. 

165. Regarding the manner of submitting the revised draft decision, the same considerations apply as to 
the submission of the draft decision by the LSA61. A clear timestamp (date, hour) of the submission is 
the starting point for the two-week period referred to in Article 60(5)(2), therefore the revised draft 
decision shall only be submitted by way of the EDPB Information system. 

7.1.3  The submission of the revised draft decision 

166. As for the contents of the submission, the considerations made regarding the contents of the draft 
decision  apply62.  In  short,  the  LSA  is  required  to  only  submit  a  revised  draft  decision  as  such.  The 
considerations made regarding the draft decision and the need to ensure compliance with the right to 
be heard63 apply mutatis mutandis to the revised draft decision as well, so that the LSA should make 
sure that the revised draft decision references the steps taken to ensure such compliance and is self-
explanatory regarding the changes introduced to follow the RRO and the underlying reasons64.  

                                                             
59 Comments signalling editorial errors and typos may however be taken into account to avoid material mistakes 
in the final decision.  
60 See the consideration regarding for instance the reasonable time for handling complaints mentioned in Recital 
129. 
61 See above in section 5.2.3 on Article 60(3)(2) on submission/timing. 
62 See above section 5.2.2 specifying the term draft decision. 
63 See above para. 105. 
64 See also para. 159 as for informal exchanges prior to submission of a revised draft decision. 

Adopted 

 

32 

 

167. Article 60(5)(1) does not set any specific deadline for the submission of the revised draft decision by 
the LSA. This is one of the instances where there is a flexibility given to the SAs by the GDPR, also in 
order to facilitate the endeavour to reach a consensus. However, the principle of good administration, 
including the principles of reasonable timeframe and procedural economy still applies. Further, some 
factors that should be taken into account by the LSA in this respect include the following:  

 

 

 

the  fact  that  a  revised  draft  decision  is  subject  to  a  shorter  assessment  period  (2  weeks) 
compared to the draft decision;  

the reference to “without delay” applying to the submission of the draft decision under Article 
60(3);  

the consideration made in Section 5.2.4 on Article 60(3)(2) as to the need to take account in this 
regard of the complexity of the case at hand, and here in particular of the number and nature 
of the relevant and reasoned objections received by the LSA;  

  more generally, the obligation on all SAs to cooperate fairly and in a spirit of mutual trust.  

168. All the above considerations would point to the need for the LSA to make sure that the lapse of time 
between receipt of the relevant and reasoned objections under Article 60(3) and submission of the 
revised draft decision is as short as possible and appropriate to the context of the OSS procedure. This 
is without prejudice to the efforts made to reach consensus and to the eventual obligation of the LSA 
to provide the right to be heard again, pursuant to national law, in view of envisaged changes in the 
revised draft decision that will newly affect the rights of the controller or processor. 

7.1.4  The views of the other CSAs 

169. The purpose of the submission of a revised draft decision by the LSA is to allow all involved SAs to find 
consensus and to gather their opinions on the proposed revised draft decision. It is important to note, 
in this regard, that the purpose of Article 60(5) is to afford the CSAs the opportunity to express a view 
on any amendments / revisions that have been made to the original text of the draft decision that was 
originally  circulated  by  the LSA  pursuant to  Article 60(4).  The wording  “for  their  opinion”  of Article 
60(5)(1) mirrors, in this respect, the wording of Article 60(3)(2) (see above section 5.2.1).  

170. This means that  – like for the draft decision  –  the submission of a revised draft decision should be 
preceded by exchanges between the LSA and all the CSAs to share the new conclusions the LSA has 
reached  in  the  light  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection(s)  it  intends  to  follow  along  with  the 
relevant reasoning, in order to gather the opinions of the other CSAs65. This is especially appropriate if 
the relevant and reasoned objections address several issues in the case at hand, so that the extent and 
depth of the  exchanges may vary from  case to case. The LSA may for instance, where appropriate, 
share a preliminary revised draft decision before issuing the formal revised draft decision. 

171. In turn, this will enable the other CSAs to flag remaining issues or questions that the LSA may wish to 
address at this stage, again in an endeavour to reach consensus, prior to the formal submission of a 
revised  draft  decision.  In  particular, the  other  CSAs should  clearly  indicate the points in respect of 
which they consider that the relevant and reasoned objections have not in fact been taken on board 
(i.e.  followed)  by  the  LSA.  Ultimately,  this  informal  consultation  stage  is  intended  to  prevent  the 
opinions by other CSAs from turning into relevant and reasoned objections to the revised draft decision 

                                                             
65 At this moment, the LSA should as well take account of the views of the other CSAs raised as comments.

and therefore from triggering the next steps in the procedure as outlined in the following section, with 
all the relevant consequences. 

  The Revised Draft Decision: Assessment Procedure 

7.2.1 

Joint application of Article 60(5) second sentence and the procedure of Article 60(4) 

172. Article  60(5)(2)  sets  forth  the  formal  procedure  applying  to  the  examination  of  the  revised  draft 
decision by the other CSAs. This procedure is the one referred to in Article 60(4), with the difference 
that the timeline is limited to two weeks66.  

173. It should be noted that, by referencing Article 60(4), (5)(2) also regulates the procedure to be followed 
by the LSA in case it rejects or does not follow any relevant and reasoned objection to the revised draft 
decision  as  expressed  by  other  CSAs  in  the  two  weeks  following  submission.  This  has  several 
consequences: 

174. In both cases the only outcome envisaged according to the procedure provided for under Article 60(4) 
is the submission of the matter by the LSA to the consistency mechanism, i.e. to the EDPB (as described 
in Section 6.2.3) with a view to a binding decision settling the dispute, which the LSA and other CSAs 
are then required to abide by (under Article 65(2) and (6)).  

175. If no objections are raised by the other CSAs in the two-week period mentioned in Article 60(5)(2), 
Article 60(6) applies. Subsequently, the revised draft decision becomes binding on both the LSA and 
other CSAs, since Article 60(6) refers to the absent submission of  relevant and reasoned objections 
within the periods referred to “in paragraphs 4 and 5”.  

176. Thus, if relevant and reasoned objections are raised in the two-week period and the LSA intends to 
follow them, the only alternative is to apply Article 60(5)(1) again, in order to ultimately achieve the 
agreement on the (revised) draft decision, as per  Article 60(6), which will become then binding for 
both the LSA and other CSAs.  

177. This would be in line, on the one hand, with the endeavour to reach consensus, as prescribed by Article 
60(1), and on the other hand, it would prevent triggering Article 65(1)(a) when there is no dispute to 
be settled at this point. Indeed, Recital 138 clearly supports such an approach, in that all means within 
the cooperation mechanism should be exhausted before activating the consistency mechanism. 

178. Nevertheless,  considering  the  enhanced  cooperation  procedures  as  outlined  in  this  guidance  (e.g. 
exchange of relevant information in different stages and informal consultation before submitting a 
draft decision), this situation should be very exceptional and limited to the cases where, despite all 
efforts, specific circumstances did not allow reaching a consensual position before. 

179. However, it shall be borne in mind by the other CSAs and the LSA that that the GDPR provides for a 
swift  action  and  for  the  powers  of  the  SAs  to  be  exercised  fairly  and  within  a  reasonable  time,  as 
mentioned in Recital 129. Actually, it can be argued that it was not the intention of the legislator to 
promote an indefinite loop of revised draft decisions. For that reason, the possible submission of new 
revised draft decisions should be of an extraordinary character, as necessary in the particular case to 
strive for final consensus.

180. Recognising  that  the  endeavour  to  reach  consensus  set  forth  as  an  overarching  objective  of  the 
cooperation procedure in Article 60(1) does not entail an obligation to achieve consensus at all costs, 
when the LSA mindfully intends to follow a relevant and reasoned objection, and, by this way, achieve 
such goal, that should be made possible by submitting a (re-)revised draft decision. 

181. Where  the  LSA  concludes  that  consensus  is  not  possible,  as  there  is  no  substantive  convergence 
between the LSA and other CSA(s), either because there are contradictory views from CSAs or because 
some legal issues remain unsettled, the LSA is then obliged by Article 60(5)(2) to prompt the procedure 
provided for in Article 60(4) and, consequently, to refer the case to the EDPB for the dispute resolution 
procedure as per Article 65(1)(a). 

7.2.2  Constraints on other CSAs in submitting relevant and reasoned objections to the 

revised draft decision 

182. A further issue to be considered concerns the scope of the “procedure referred to in paragraph 4” as 
applied in the context of Article 60(5)(2). This refers in particular to whether specific legal constraints 
apply on either the CSAs or the scope of a relevant and reasoned objection to the revised draft decision 
issued by the LSA. 

183. It should be recalled that the LSA and other CSAs are bound by the (revised) draft decision under Article 
60(6) only if no objections have been submitted to the (revised) draft decision. If this is not the case, 
i.e. if relevant and reasoned objections were indeed raised to the draft decision pursuant to procedure 
provided for under Article 60(4), then no CSA is bound by the draft decision; moreover, the revised 
draft decision submitted by the LSA under Article 60(5)(1) is a different legal instrument compared to 
the draft decision mentioned in Article 60(4). Accordingly, a CSA may raise a relevant and reasoned 
objection to the revised draft decision even if it had not raised any objections to the draft decision 
during the four-week period mentioned in Article 60(4).  

184. Indeed, the changes introduced by the LSA to follow the relevant and reasoned objections may raise 
new questions and issues a CSA disagrees with in the context of the revised draft decision. As per the 
above guidance, the CSA should make sure that each relevant and reasoned objection it submits should 
“indicate  each  part  of  the  draft  decision  [here:  revised  draft  decision]  that  is  considered  deficient, 
erroneous or lacking some necessary elements, either by referring to specific articles/paragraphs or by 
other clear indications”67.  

185. The EDPB strongly encourages the LSA to share in advance its intention to revise the draft decision not 
only to the CSA that has raised an objection but also to all other CSAs. This will ensure that the revised 
draft decision and the reasoning employed will not come as a surprise to the other CSAs, and will help 
in preventing their possible negative reaction on the proposed changes. 

186. The aim of a revised draft decision within the meaning of Article 60(5) is to endeavour to find consensus 
on issues for which no consensus was previously found. As a result, a CSA should not raise a relevant 
and reasoned objection in relation to a revised draft decision if there was previously no relevant and 
reasoned objection directed  at that specific issue and the LSA has not  revised the draft decision in 
respect of such issue.

THE BINDING EFFECT OF A (REVISED) DRAFT DECISION 

187. Article  60(6)  describes  the  final step  of  the  decision  finding  process  in  cases in  which  a  consensus 
between the LSA and other CSAs could be reached. In this case, consensus is signalled by the absence 
of objections to the (revised) draft decision, which means that Article 60(6) is applicable. This has two 
legal consequences:  

  that the LSA and other CSA(s) are deemed to be in agreement,  
  that they are bound by the decision in the sense that the assessment process following the 

issuing of the draft decision came to an end.  

  Deemed to be in agreement with the draft decision 

188. Firstly,  Article  60(6)  states  that,  in  the  absence  of  an  objection,  the  SAs  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in 
agreement with  the  (revised)  draft  decision in  its entirety.  The term  “deemed to  be in agreement” 
clarifies that the CSAs do not have to explicitly endorse the (revised) draft decision. The GDPR provides 
for  a  tacit  agreement  and  supposes  that  the  SAs  have  successfully  reached  consensus  in  the 
cooperation procedure. This tacit agreement refers to the content of the (revised) draft decision.  

 

Bound by the draft decision 

189. Since the LSA and other CSAs are presumed to be in agreement, they shall be bound by the content of 
the (revised) draft decision. This has immediate binding effects for all involved SAs. This means, that 
any further adoption of a measure under national law, such as the dismissal of a complaint, has to be 
strictly in line with the agreed draft decision. 

190. Two different dimensions of the binding effect can be distinguished, i.e. as regards the entities bound 

by the (revised) draft decision (LSA/CSAs) and the scope of that (revised) draft decision. 

191. Firstly, both the LSA and other CSAs are bound by the (revised) draft decision because no objections 
were  raised  or  maintained.  The  legal  consequences  of  the  binding  effect  are  that  in  this  case  the 
(revised)  draft  decision  cannot  be  changed  further  or  withdrawn  afterwards68.  The  decision  to  be 
adopted by the LSA (Article 60(7)) or by a CSA (Article 60(8)) or in a shared form by both SAs (Article 
60(9)) shall be based on the (revised) draft decision as it is.  

192. The decision only binds the LSA and the other CSAs that participated in the cooperation procedure. 
Only SAs which have participated in the cooperation procedure (i.e. which have formally confirmed 
their  role as  a  CSA  in  the context  of  this Article 60 procedure),  and had  the opportunity  to  raise  a 
relevant and reasoned objection against the draft decision can be bound by a decision which was taken 
in that procedure. The other SAs neither had the opportunity to present their views in the cooperation 
procedure nor could raise a relevant and reasoned objection against the draft decision.  

193. Therefore, if a CSA with a complaint which could be handled within the ongoing procedure asks the 
LSA to include its case in this procedure and join the cooperation procedure prior to the submission of 
the draft decision and had the opportunity to raise a relevant and reasoned objection, the procedure 

                                                             
68 In certain exceptional cases provided for by law such changes or withdrawal might still be necessary; see para. 
207. 

Adopted

can continue and the “new” CSA will be bound by the draft decision provided that the requirements 
of Article 60(6) are met. 

194. Conversely, if a CSA with a complaint which could be handled in the ongoing cooperation procedure 
only sends its case to the LSA to be bundled with the other(s) after the deadline of Article 60(4) or 
Article 60(5) has expired (e.g. because a SA received a complaint referring to the same infringement 
after the expiry of the deadlines), and, therefore, had not had the opportunity to express a relevant 
and reasoned objection, this CSA should very carefully consider whether a new cooperation procedure 
should rather be triggered for that purpose, as by requesting the LSA to bundle the new case within 
the ongoing procedure at this stage, this CSA is de facto waiving its possibility to raise an objection to 
the decision69. 

195. The EDPB considers that, in principle, the LSA is not required to continuously check that all possible 
relevant CSAs  with  cases, which could be bundled to the ongoing procedures being dealt  with, are 
informed about the ongoing cooperation procedure.  

196. The binding effect granted by Article 60(6) to the specific decision is thus strictly limited to the specific 
cooperation  procedure.  The  cooperation  procedure  deals  with  a  specific  issue  and  aims  to  reach 
consensus regarding the specific case.  

197. Therefore,  besides  the  binding  effect  of  the  decision  as  per  Article  60(6),  the  outcome  of  a  given 
cooperation procedure may not be automatically extended to other cooperation procedures, in spite 
of possible similarities. However, according to Article 51(2), each SA shall contribute to the consistent 
application of the GDPR and therefore, the LSA may reuse the text and conclusions of a draft decision 
agreed upon in a previous cooperation procedure involving the same or different controller and the 
same infringement of the GDPR to speed up the procedure at hand if it considers that this can facilitate 
reaching an agreement also in the current case. 

198. The EDPB considers that the binding effect under Article 60(6) of a specific decision cannot cover the 
clarification of abstract legal questions, which are not connected to the real case. A SA that intends to 
ask  the  EDPB  for  clarification  of  abstract  legal  questions  should  instead  consider  the  Article  64(2) 
procedure if the question refers to a matter of general application or producing effects in more than 
one MS.  

  ARTICLE 60(7) – THE LSA ADOPTING AND NOTIFYING THE 

DECISION  

  General 

199. Article 60(7-9) address the different scenarios after the LSA and other CSAs have been bound by the 

draft decision. These steps can be reached after:  

(i)  either the procedure laid down in the previous chapter has been concluded and consensus 

has been reached, or  

(ii) after a dispute resolution by the Board has been concluded. 

                                                             
69 See above para. 22 et seq. 

Adopted 

 

37 

 

200. The abovementioned paragraphs outline:  

(i)  which SA shall adopt a final decision following the previous steps, and  
(ii) which SA notifies or informs the controller, processor and complainant respectively.  

201. Article 60(7) provides the procedure to follow in case a decision targeted at the controller or processor 
is to be adopted by the LSA. Article 60(8) and (9) are only relevant in complaint-based cases. Article 
60(8) regulates the cases where the decision dismisses or rejects the complaint and should be adopted 
by the complaint receiving SA(s)70. Finally, Article 60(9) clarifies the procedure to be followed where 
some parts of a complaint have been dismissed or rejected, and the respective decision is adopted 
towards  the  complainant  by  the  complaint  receiving  SA,  while  other  parts  have  been  acted  upon, 
leading to a decision towards a controller or processor by the LSA. 

202. Due  to  this  relation,  many  of  the  concepts  and  considerations  related  to  Article  60(7)  will  be 

analogously applicable for Article 60(8) and (9). 

  Adoption of the final decision by the LSA 

203. Article 60(7)(1) stipulates that the LSA will be required to adopt a decision. This adoption is either:  

  the implementation by way of a national decision of the consensus reached under Article 

60(6), and/or  

  the implementation by way of a national decision on the basis of the binding decision of the 

EDPB adopted under Article 65, following the procedure provided under Article 65(6) . 

204. In either case, the national decision needs to give full effect to the binding consensus reached under 

Article 60(6), and/or to the binding directions set out in the EDPB’s decision under Article 6571.  

205. At the same time, the LSA will need to adjust the format to comply with its national administrative 

rules. Lastly, it will be able to make purely editorial changes before adopting its national decision72.  

206. Article 60(7) does not stipulate a concrete timeframe within which  this adoption has to take place. 
Nonetheless, the adoption should take place as swiftly as possible, in line with the principle of good 
administration. In contrast, if this point was reached following a consistency procedure, the deadline 
of one month provided by Article 65(6) has to be followed. 

207. However, there could be exceptional situations, where adopting a decision, which is implementing the 
conclusions to which the SAs are bound under Article 60(6) would affect the legality of the national 
decision. This may be due to a ruling by the CJEU with an interpretation different to which the other 
CSAs and the LSA are bound or a change in legislation. In case of such circumstances, the CSA who 
becomes aware of those new facts should immediately inform the LSA and vice versa. Following this, 
the LSA should inform the other CSAs accordingly and submit to the other CSAs a new draft decision 

                                                             
70 Article 60 gives the CSA(s) that have received a complaint, which is subject to the procedure, a special role. 
This is further elaborated in the part on Article 60(8) and Article 60(9). To avoid confusion between these SAs 
and other CSAs, the term complaint receiving SA is used. It is important to note that even the LSA can have the 
role of a complaint receiving SA. 
71 See para. 114 and para. 192. See also para. 50 of EDPB Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) 
GDPR - version for public consultation. 
72 See footnote 58.  

Adopted 

 

38 

 

that takes account of the changed circumstances. This new draft decision should be aligned as much 
as possible with the previous draft decision, to make use of the already found consensus. 

  Notification and information 

208. Once the decision has been adopted, the LSA shall notify the decision to its addressee(s). In complaint-
based cases, the complaint receiving SA(s) shall also inform the complainant(s) of the decision. While 
the terms “notify” and “inform” are not specified in the GDPR, they may be specified in national law. 
However,  the  CJEU  clarified  that  the  duty  to  notify  is  satisfied  when  the  addressee  is  placed  in  a 
position in which it can effectively become aware of the existence of the decision and the reasons why 
the institution intends to justify it73. 

209. In line with the above, Article 60(7-9) appears to give the term “notify” a more formal value, as it is 
used for the communication to the party that may suffer adverse effects by the decision, and therefore 
may intend to challenge it74.  

210. Therefore, for Article 60(7-9), when notifying the decision to the addressee, the SA should provide a 
full copy of the decision in a language complying with its national laws. Additionally, the MS in which 
the decision  was notified  will  be  the  MS  in  which  the decision  may  be challenged  and,  as outlined 
below, it should be brought to the attention of the parties that were merely informed that judicial 
action should be sought in such MS. 

211. In any case, in the context of Article 60(7), after the LSA has notified the decision75 to the main or single 
establishment of the controller or processor, as the case may be, it shall inform the other CSAs and the 
Board of the decision in question, including the information specified in the subsection below. For this 
purpose, the SA should make use of the Article 60 Final Decision notification procedure in the EDPB 
information system. 

212. Besides ensuring transparency towards the CSAs, providing this information to the Board is essential 
to allow the SAs to comply with their obligation to contribute to the consistent application of the GDPR 
as stipulated in Article 51(2). This will allow them  to  avoid an inconsistent application of the GDPR 
should they in the future need to handle a similar case.  

213. The  complaint  receiving  SA(s)  is  then  required  to  inform  the  complainant  of  the  outcome  of  the 
complaint, in accordance with its national laws and/or practices. Additionally, the complaint receiving 
SA(s) should inform their complainant(s) pursuant to Article 77(2) that they may seek judicial remedy 
before a court in the MS of the LSA, if they are concerned by the decision of the LSA in the meaning of 
Article 78(1)76. 

Example 9: After a media report casting doubt about the lawfulness of the processing conducted by 
HappyCompany,  multiple  individuals  file  a  complaint  with  their  local  SA.  Once  the  LSA  has  been 
identified, it decides to handle the complaints, as they refer to the same processing activity and the 
same infringement, in one file. Following the adoption of a decision by the LSA and the notification of

the  controller,  each  of  the  complaint  receiving  SAs  informs  their  respective  complainants  on  the 
decision. When doing so, the complaint receiving SAs also inform their complainants that they can 
effectively seek judicial remedy in the MS of the LSA. 

214. At this moment, the  LSA should  as well inform  the controller or processor of its obligations under 

Article 60(10) and the possible consequences of non-compliance. 

  A summary of the relevant facts and grounds 

215. When the LSA informs the other CSA(s) and the Board, it provides a summary77 of the relevant facts 
and grounds regarding the decision in question. This summary should include the formal steps and 
grounds, as well as the substance, of the decision.  

216. Therefore, the summary should include, at least, the following information78: 

  The date of the final decision; 
  The identification of the LSA and other CSAs; 
  The name of the controller(s) and/or processor(s); 
  The  relevant  legal  conclusions  in  question  (infringed  provisions/rights  not  granted79),  in 

relation to the factual basis of the case80; 

  The outcome of the procedure and, if applicable, the corrective measures taken81. 

 

217. As the case may be, the summary should allow any Member of the Board to understand the subject 
matter and conclusion of the decision reached. It is recommended that the LSA also provide a copy of 
the  decision  in  English.  This  should  be  done  by  making  use  of  the  appropriate  fields  in  the  EDPB 
information system. 

   ARTICLE 60(8) –THE DISMISSAL/REJECTION OF A COMPLAINT 

218. Article 60(8) concerns the situation where the CSAs including the LSA have agreed to dismiss or reject 
a complaint in full, or where this was concluded by the EDPB following Article 65. The SA with which 
the complaint was lodged can be either the LSA or another CSA. It introduces three obligations on the 
SA with which the complaint was lodged:  

 

 

 

to adopt the decision,  
to notify it to the complainant,  
to inform the controller.  

This is to be done by derogation from Article 60(7).

78 This information is contained in the fields that are to be filled out in the “final  decision” form  in  the EDPB 
Information system.  
79 This could be due to restrictions under Article 23.

   Derogation from paragraph 7 

219. Article 60(8) introduces a derogation from the situation where the LSA adopts and notifies the decision 
to the main, or single, establishment of the controller or processor in the EU. It applies solely in the 
situation where a complaint is dismissed or rejected in full.  

220. Although  in  general,  in  the  OSS  mechanism,  the  LSA  should  remain  the  sole  interlocutor  of  the 
controller/processor for their cross-border processing, in this specific situation a CSA has to inform the 
controller/processor about the dismissal or rejection of the case.  

  The term “Dismissal/Rejection” 

221. The concepts of dismissal and rejection may have different definitions at national level, and therefore 
also different procedural/administrative implications. However, the GDPR does always refer to both 
actions, a dismissal or a rejection82.  

222. The  CJEU  has  consistently  held  that  the  terms  of  a  provision  of  EU  law  which  makes  no  express 
reference to the law of the MS for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally 
be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the EU, having regard not only to its 
wording  but  also  to  the  context  of  the  provision  and  the  objective  pursued  by  the  legislation  in 
question.  This  follows  from  the  need  for  uniform  application  of  EU  law  and  from  the  principle  of 
equality83. 

223. Regarding  more  specifically  the  interpretation  to  be  given  of  what  dismissal/rejection  entails, 
reference can be made to the wording of Article 60(9) where dismissal/rejection are contrasted with 
a decision to “act on” the complaint. It should be noted that Article 60(9) refers to the LSA adopting 
the decision “for the part concerning actions in relation to the controller”, in which case the decision 
will be notified by the LSA to the controller/processor, whilst it refers to the CSA adopting the decision 
“for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of that complaint”, in which case the decision will be 
notified by the complaint-receiving SA to the complainant. Thus, Article 60(9) read jointly with Article 
60(8) can be interpreted in  the sense that dismissal/rejection of a complaint as the outcome of an 
Article 60 procedure entails that the (part of the) final decision to be adopted does not contain any 
action to be taken in relation to the controller. 

224. From this standpoint, such a decision can be considered to adversely affect the complainant. This is 
confirmed by the GDPR legislative process, where a more general reference to decisions “adverse” to 
complainant was made84. The explicit reference to the right to judicial remedy and proximity to the 
complainant (as recalled above in particular in paragraph 213) also suggests that adverse decisions for 
the complainants should fall within this category. When the complaint is not followed at any level in 
the final decision and the LSA does not take any action in relation to the controller/processor in that 

                                                             
82 The CSAs will have agreed beforehand on the substantive consequences of the decision. The implementation 
of the consequences has to be done in line with national law, e.g. via a rejection or via a dismissal.  
83 See e.g. Case C-617/15, Hummel Holding, para. 22 and case law cited therein. 
84  See  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14788-2014-REV-1/en/pdf.  In  this  version,  the 
provision read: “Where the decision jointly agreed upon concerns a complaint and as far as it adversely affects 
the complainant, notably where the complaint is rejected, dismissed or granted only in part, each supervisory 
authority that have received such complaint shall adopt the single decision concerning that complaint and serve 
it on the complainant.” p. 36.

decision, the controller/processor will not have an interest in a judicial remedy within the MS of its 
main  establishment.  The  complainant  on  the  other  hand,  will  have  an  interest  in  challenging  the 
decisions adversely affecting him/her within their own MS, and in their own language85. 

225. Thus, a decision dismissing or rejecting a complaint (or parts of it) should be construed as a situation 
where  the LSA has found, in handling the complaint, that  there is no cause of action regarding  the 
complainant's claim, and no action is taken in relation to the controller. In such case, the complaint 
has to be dismissed or rejected via the decision adopted by the complaint receiving SA, as the case 
may be86. 

226. Notification received in  application of Article 60(8) can be used by the complainant to exercise the 
right to judicial remedy against the decision taken by a SA. Because this decision has to be adopted by 
the complaint receiving SA, this will allow proximity of the complainant to the competent court, under 
Article  78(3)  and  under  Article  47  of  the  Fundamental  Rights  Charter  (by  seizing  a  court  in  the 
complainant’s MS as the decision will be adopted by the CSA in that MS)87.  

227. This means that, for the purpose of the application of Article 60(8) and (9), and of the final sentence 
of Article 60(7), the decision that is the outcome of the cooperation procedure should clearly provide 
for the dismissal or rejection of the complaint, or for the action to be taken in relation to the controller 
by the LSA, so that  the LSA  and CSA can direct the subsequent adoption of the respective national 
decisions accordingly, in pursuance of Article 60(8), (9) or (7).  

228. If provided in national law, SAs should rely on these definitions of dismissal/rejection, as well as in the 
national  administrative  practices  that  configure  a  case  of  dismissal/rejection  of  a  complaint,  and 
proceed, in such cases accordingly88. In any case, the draft decision, shared as indicated in the previous 
sections,  should  provide  clear  reasoning  as  to  why  the  complaint  is  dismissed/rejected  under  the 
relevant national laws.  

229. It is important to note that a dismissal or rejection at this stage is different from a possible finding of 
dismissal or rejection at the vetting stage of the complaint procedure. As highlighted in paragraph 50, 
this vetting precedes any submission of the complaint to the LSA and is performed by the complaint 
receiving  SA.  In  such  a  case,  the  complaint  would  be  dismissed  or  rejected  before  reaching  the 
cooperation stage. 

230. It should also be acknowledged that there may be situations where the interests of the data subject 
are not adversely affected by the outcome of the OSS procedure, on account of the steps taken by the 
LSA in the course of handling the complaint. In such cases, the key factor is the demonstrated removal 

                                                             
85 See also the A.G. Opinion in case C-645/19 Facebook. In para. 105 the Opinion states: 
“These  mechanisms  of  shifting  the  competence  to  adopt  the  decisions  and,  where  necessary,  of  potentially 
adopting  two-tier  decisions  (the  LSA  vis-à-vis  the  controller  or  processor,  and  the  local  authority  vis-à-vis  the 
complainant) seem specifically intended to avoid data subjects having to ‘tour’ the courtrooms of the European 
Union in order to bring proceedings against inactive supervisory authorities.” 
86  Possibly  in  conformity  with  the  applicable  national  provisions  where  they  do  define  the  precise  scope  of 
dismissal/rejection. 
87 See Recital 141: “the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter (…) 
where the supervisory authority partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint (…)”. 
88 The SAs should make sure that the application of such definitions is consistent with the understanding of the 
terms as set out in this section.

of the cause of action - that is to say the complainant obtained the vindication of his/her rights through 
the  intervention  of  the  LSA  towards  the  controller,  which  meanwhile  met  the  terms  of  the 
complainant’s claim. In such cases, providing that the complainant has been informed in the course of 
the procedure about the favourable result achieved, the LSA may decide to no longer take action in 
relation to the controller – i.e. none of the factors mentioned above in respect of dismissal/rejection 
vs. taking action is applicable.  

231. This is the case, in particular, with the amicable settlement situation - i.e. the situation where the case 
has been resolved to a satisfaction of a data subject, when the infringement alleged in the complaint 
has been identified by the  LSA and when the complainant agreed to an  amicable resolution of this 
complaint.  This situation  falls within  the remit of Article 60(7).  Indeed, as already pointed  out,  the 
decision does not adversely affect the complainant, who manifested his or her satisfaction with the 
proposed settlement, and as such is not to be adopted by the  complaint receiving SA under Article 
60(8) or (9) – there being no dismissal or rejection at play. It will be for the LSA to  adopt the final 
decision in such a case89, to take stock of the achieved settlement in its capacity as the sole interlocutor 
of the controller/processor under Article 56(6). 

232. This also applies to cases that do not fall within the amicable settlement constellation, as the LSA did 
not or could not attempt such a settlement, but, nevertheless, its intervention during the handling of 
the complaint led the controller to stop the infringement and fully satisfy the complainant’s claim. In 
view of this result and of the specific circumstances of the case, the LSA may consider that the most 
adequate decision for the complaint at hand is to terminate the handling of the case, taking note of 
the achieved solution, and without taking any action towards the controller90.  

233. However, since an infringement was indeed identified by the LSA, the decision not to take any action 
towards the controller would have to be based on the careful assessment of the circumstances of the 
complaint as a whole, in order to keep the same level of guarantees afforded to the data subjects.  

234. On the other hand, within this context the final decision will not be issued by the complaint receiving 
SA but instead by the LSA, as per paragraph (7), even though no action is to be taken in relation to the 
controller through such final decision – in recognition of the LSA’s role as the sole interlocutor of the 
controller targeted by the complaint at issue and the fact that a finding of an infringement can have 
an adverse effect on the controller. This would render it impossible for the complainant to challenge 
the decision in the MS where the complaint was lodged, regardless of whether the complainant still 
has or has not cause of action to seek judicial remedy against a SA. That is a matter for the courts to 
determine in the concrete case. Therefore, whenever this scenario may happen, it should be ensured 
by  the  LSA  via  the  complaint  receiving  SA  that  the  complainant  is  duly  informed  on  the  positive 
achievement and on the envisaged outcome of the complaint and expresses no disagreement.   

235. Lastly, it should be recalled that also the decision not to take action towards the controller, even when 
an infringement took place, has to have been agreed by the LSA and other CSAs, which entails that all 

                                                             
89  As  this  is  the  general  rule,  see  also  ECJ  Case  C‑645/19  para.  56 :  ″In  accordance  with  Article  60(7)  of  that 
regulation, it is the responsibility of the lead supervisory authority, as a general rule, to adopt a decision with 
respect to the cross-border processing concerned,…″ 
90 This is without prejudice to the assessment on what is “the extent appropriate” to which the complaint is to 
be investigated pursuant to Article 57(1)(f), for which discretion lies with the SAs.

the circumstances of the case were duly taken into account, including the guarantee of the rights and 
freedoms of the complainant. 

Example  10:  Unhappy  customer submits a complaint to its local SA in  MS  A. The  SA  performs the 
preliminary vetting and forwards the complaint to the LSA. After receiving the complaint, and, upon 
investigating the issue, the LSA cannot find evidence to support the complaint. Therefore, the LSA is 
unable to determine the infringement and concludes that the complaint is to be rejected/dismissed, 
as no action is taken on the controller. The LSA shares a draft decision to that effect and as no objection 
is raised, pursuant to Article 60(8) the complaint receiving SA will adopt the final national decision 
rejecting/dismissing the complaint and notify it to the complainant. 

Example 11:  A complainant indicates he sent a request to a controller and did not receive any answer. 
The DPA does not receive any response to its preliminary vetting actions. The complaint receiving SA 
sends the case to the LSA. The LSA notes that the request was sent to a wrong/non-existent address 
by comparison to what is indicated on the website of the controller (the complainant seems to have 
tried a contact@XXX.com address without checking the contact addresses mentioned on the website). 
The LSA shares a draft decision whereby the complaint is to be dismissed/rejected since there was only 
a mistake made by the complainant. As no objection is raised, the complaint receiving SA adopts the 
final dismissal/rejection decision under Article 60(8) and notifies it to the complainant. 

Example 12: Unhappy customer submits a complaint to its local SA in MS A, arguing that the website 
HappyCompany  is  infringing  its  rights.  After  performing  the  preliminary  vetting  the  complaint  is 
transferred  to  the  LSA  in  MS  B.  The  LSA  starts  an  investigation  but  cannot  access  the  website  in 
question. After some further research, it finds that in the meantime the controller has been dissolved. 
Therefore,  the  investigation  cannot  be  continued  and  the  LSA  cannot  find  sufficient  evidence  to 
support the claims of the complainant. The LSA shares a draft decision that the complaint should be 
dismissed  as  the  cause  of  the complaint has disappeared. As no objection  is  raised, the  complaint 
receiving SA adopts the final national decision dismissing/rejecting the complaint under Article 60(8), 
and notifies it to the complainant. 

Example 13: Unhappy customer submits a complaint to its local SA, arguing that her data are kept and 
processed  unlawfully  by  HappyCompany,  which  is  infringing  her  rights.  After  performing  the 
preliminary  vetting  the  complaint  is  transferred  to  the  LSA.  The  LSA  starts  an  investigation  and  is 
informed by controller that indeed the complainant’s data are kept in their files on account of a failure 
in their customer resource management that did not erase the information in due time (preferences, 
purchase history, etc.); however, they immediately erased the information following the letter sent by 
the LSA, and proof of this is provided to the LSA. Therefore, the LSA shares a draft decision where it 
finds an infringement by the controller and it represents the situation as remedied following the LSA’s 
intervention,  without  proposing  any  corrective  measures  in  respect  of  the  controller  in  particular 
because this was the first time such an infringement was committed. Accordingly, the LSA proposes to 
go for the option of adopting the final decision itself under Article 60(7). As no objection is raised, the 
LSA  adopts a final  national  decision  along the said  lines and notifies it to  the controller,  whilst the 
complaint-receiving SA will inform the complainant of such decision.  

  Adoption of the decision 

236. The SA that is required to adopt the decision is the SA, which received the complaint(s). This could 
apply to multiple SAs. It should do so in the way required under its national legislation. Even in the 
case where the complaint receiving SA is the LSA, its decision needs to be adopted under the procedure 
of paragraph 8 as derogation from paragraph 7 (lex specialis rule). Therefore, the complaint receiving 

Adopted 

 

44 

 

SA adopting the decision may be either the LSA, another CSA, or both (or all), depending on the number 
and nature of complaint(s). 

237. When  the  complaint  is  lodged  with  one,  or  more  CSAs,  the  LSA  shall  prepare  the  draft  decision 
dismissing/rejecting the complaint(s), and the CSAs shall issue a final decision in the EDPB Information 
System, adopting it also at national level and introducing the necessary national legal provisions.  

238. The CSA, when issuing a decision, must give full effect to the draft decision, which is binding on LSA 

and other CSAs under Article 60(6) and/or the EDPB binding decision following Article 65(1)(a)91.  

  Inform and notify 

239. Once the decision has been adopted, the complaint receiving SA(s) shall notify the complainant and 
inform the controller/processor92. This is to be done by each complaint receiving SA(s) according to 
their  own  national  laws  and  practices  and  in  the  language  provided  by  these  provisions.  For  this 
purpose,  the  complaint  receiving  SA(s)  may  rely  on  the  assistance  of  the  LSA  to  inform  the 
controller/processor on its behalf. In any case, the complaint receiving SA(s) needs to inform both the 
complainant and the controller about their possibility to seek judicial remedy in its MS. 

240. The complaint receiving SA should then inform the other CSAs and the Board, including a summary of 
the relevant facts and grounds, as explained in section  9.4. This is grounded in the rationale of the 
information obligation mentioned in Article 60(7) regarding the decision adopted by the LSA, which is 
to  ensure  consistency  by  informing  the  other  CSAs  and  the  Board  as  a  whole.  The  exchange  of 
information on the actual decision finally adopted at national level – regardless of the SA that adopts 
such final national decision - is meant to ensure mutual knowledge of national decisions and avoid the 
arising of inconsistencies in the implementation of EU law. Thus, it would appear that although Article 
60(8) does not explicitly require the CSA to provide a summary of the relevant facts and grounds, this 
is an overarching requirement that is intended to ensure consistent enforcement of the GDPR.  

  ARTICLE 60(9) – PARTIAL DISMISSAL/REJECTION 

241. Article 60(9) is mainly a procedural step of the Article 60 procedure, which applies once the involved 
SAs have agreed on, and are bound by, a draft decision that contains both parts that were acted upon, 
and parts that were rejected/dismissed93.  

242. In practice, this means that, at this point of the procedure, the decision on partial dismissal/rejection 
will have already been taken, and the parts in the draft decision that relate to the dismissal/rejection 
and those that refer to further action by the LSA have been clearly marked in the draft decision. SAs 
now only need to formalise it through the necessary adoption procedures described in Article 60(9). 
This gives rise to final national decisions, which must give full effect to  the draft decision, which is 
binding on all CSAs under Article 60(6) and/or the EDPB binding decision following Article 65(1)(a). 

243. Accordingly, the related notification/information duties are split between the LSA and the complaint 
receiving SAs. The LSA adopts a decision for the parts of the complaint that were neither dismissed nor 

                                                             
91 The scope of possible changes is outlined in para. 207. 
92 See section 10.4 on the difference between notifying and informing. 
93 See section 10.2 The meaning of these concepts is the same for both para. 

Adopted 

 

45 

 

rejected  in  line  with  what  has  been  set  forth  in  section  10.2.  The  LSA  notifies  its  decision  to  the 
controller and informs the complainant about it; in this regard, the EDPB considers that the LSA may 
rely on the complaint receiving SA(s) to convey such information to the complainant(s) for the sake of 
administrative  efficiency.  Each  complaint  receiving  SA(s)  adopts  a  decision  for  the  parts  that  were 
rejected/dismissed concerning the complaint that was submitted to it, following the approach laid out 
in the previous section (see, in particular, paragraph 239). 

Example 14: Unhappy customer submits a complaint to its local SA, arguing that her data are kept and 
processed  unlawfully  by  HappyCompany,  which  is  infringing  her  rights.  After  performing  the 
preliminary  vetting  the  complaint  is  transferred  to  the  LSA.  The  LSA  starts  an  investigation  and  is 
informed by controller that indeed the complainant’s data are kept in their files on account of a failure 
in their customer resource management that did not erase the unnecessary information in due time 
(preferences, purchase history, etc.). However, certain complainant’s data have to be stored for longer 
because of financial and taxation requirements; proof of this is provided to the LSA. Therefore, the LSA 
shares a draft decision where it acts on parts of the complaint ordering the controller to finally erase 
the  unnecessary  information,  and  imposing  a  reprimand  on  the  controller,  but  acknowledging  the 
controller’s  right  to  keep  the  remaining  personal  data  as  required  by  law  and  the  need  for  the 
complaint receiving SA to reject that part of the complaint. As no objection is raised, the LSA adopts a 
final national decision ordering the controller to comply with the complainant’s request as for erasing 
the unnecessary information, notifies it to the controller and informs the complainant thereof; the 
complaint receiving SA adopts a final national decision rejecting the complaint as for the request to 
erase the necessary information and notifies it to the complainant, informing the controller thereof. 
The LSA and CSA will provide a summary of the relevant facts and grounds to the other SAs and the 
Board via the EDPB Information System, each of them for the respective final national decisions.  

  ARTICLE 60(10) – NOTIFICATION OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY 

THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR TO THE LSA/CSA(S) 

244. Paragraph (10) addresses the situation that occurs within the OSS mechanism and after a notification 
to  the  controller  or  processor  of  a  decision  adopted  against  it  is  made  by  the  LSA  requiring  the 
controller or processor to act on the complaint.  

245. This  decision  is  notified  as  per  either  Article  60(7)  or  (9),  when  the  LSA  acts  only  on  some  of  the 

grievances included in the complaint against the controller or processor. 

246. The first sentence of Article 60(10) includes the obligation on the controller or processor to adopt the 
necessary measures to guarantee compliance with the decision, which applies the corrective powers 
granted in Article 58(2).  

247. The controller or  processor  is obliged  to  ensure that these  measures  are implemented  by  all  of its 

establishments in the EEA, where the processing at issue takes place. 

248. The Article 60(10)(2) includes a second obligation for the controller or processor, i.e. to notify the LSA 
of  any  measures  it  has  adopted  to  comply  with  the  decision,  where  the  latter  entailed  corrective 

Adopted 

 

46 

 

measures. This obligation ensures the effectiveness of the enforcement. It is also the basis of possible 
necessary follow-up actions to be commenced by the LSA, also in cooperation with the other CSAs94. 

249. The second sentence of Article 60(10) also includes an obligation for the LSA to inform the other CSAs 
of the measures adopted by the controller or processor to comply with the decision taken against it. 
Although there  is  no  set deadline  for  the LSA  to  provide such information  to the  other  CSAs, such 
information should be disclosed as soon as the LSA receives the information from the controller or 
processor. 

When informing the other CSAs, the LSA should consider providing as well its assessment if it concludes 
that the measures taken are insufficient, in particular in order to decide whether further actions are 
necessary.   

  ARTICLE 60(11) – URGENCY PROCEDURE 

250. Article 60(11) addresses the “exceptional circumstances” under which a SA may rely on the urgency 

procedure of Article 66 in the course of an Article 60 procedure.  

251. For the purposes of these Guidelines, the focus will accordingly be mainly on the wording of  Article 
60(11), i.e. on the conditions for invoking Article 66 in the course of an OSS procedure, and on the 
consequences, this has on the ongoing OSS procedure. 

  The conditions for invoking Article 66 

252. The following cumulative conditions must be fulfilled for a SA to invoke the urgency procedure under 

Article 66 pursuant to Article 60(11): 

  The SA is a supervisory authority concerned; 

  There are exceptional circumstances; 

  The CSA considers that there is an urgent need to act; and  

  Such urgency aims at protecting the interests of data subjects. 

Explanations on each condition are provided below. 

253. Article 60(11) refers to the CSA as part of an Article 60 procedure, i.e. to a CSA that participates in an 
OSS procedure95. Such a CSA may invoke Article 66 if all the applicable conditions are fulfilled. Since 
the LSA is also a CSA according to the definition in Article 4(22), in principle an LSA may also invoke 
Article 60(11) if all the other conditions are fulfilled. 

254. On the concept of “exceptional circumstances”, they could exist in situations where the urgency of the 
situation  at  hand  is  such  as  not  to  enable  the  use  of  the  ‘standard’  cooperation  or  consistency 
procedures  in  a  timeframe  that  is  fitting.  The  exceptional  nature  of  such  circumstances  dictates  a 
restrictive interpretation. This applies in particular if, in spite of an ongoing Article 60 procedure, the 
CSA intends to request the EDPB, in accordance with Article 60(11), to adopt an urgent opinion or an 

                                                             
94 See section 4. 
95 See para. 22 et seq. 

Adopted 

 

47 

 

urgent binding decision under the terms of Article 66(3) – i.e. when it is considered that a competent 
SA (most likely the LSA as such) “has not taken an appropriate measure”. All attempts  by an  SA to 
informally  obtain  an  intervention  from  the  competent  SA  should  be  made  beforehand,  and  this  is 
clearly also in line with the consensus objective underlying the whole Article 60 procedure. 

255. On  the “urgent need to act  and   the criteria to be applied by the CSA to assess urgency under the 
specific circumstances, reference can be made to Recital 137, which states that this is in particular the 
case “when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably 
impeded”. According to European case law, it is not necessary for the imminence of the harm to be 
demonstrated with absolute certainty: it is sufficient to show that the damage is foreseeable with a 
sufficient degree of probability96.  

256. On the fourth condition, it should be pointed out that Article 60(11) does not refer to “the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects”, contrary  to  Article  66, but more broadly  to  their “interests”.  However, 
since the procedure to be applied is the one “referred to in Article 66”, the EDPB considers that such 
interests do coincide with the rights and freedoms of data subjects as per Article 66.  

257. As mentioned above, these conditions are cumulative and it is the responsibility of the CSA to provide 
“reasons” for each of them, regardless of whether it intends to take urgent measures under Article 
66(1) or request an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision from the EDPB under Article 66(2) or 
(3).  

258. Furthermore,  a CSA should consider several additional factors on  top of the conditions set forth in 

Article 60(11) prior to taking such a step e.g.: 

 

 

 

 

the elements gathered from the OSS procedure,  
exchanges with the other CSAs (including the LSA),  
exchanges with the controller/processor and, where applicable, the complainant regarding the 
cross-border processing at issue, 
the stage reached within the Article 60 procedure (in particular, how close the procedure is to 
its  finalization,  and  therefore  to  the  taking  of  enforcement  action  regarding  the 
controller/processor). 

259. Concerning the “urgent need to act”, the CSA should in particular take account of the last point. 

  The interaction with an ongoing Article 60 cooperation procedure 

260. The urgency procedure under Article 66 derogates from the Article 60 procedure due to its exceptional 
nature; however, it leaves it unprejudiced. Thus, if a CSA relies on an urgency procedure in accordance 
with  Article  60(11),  and  all  the  relevant  conditions  are  fulfilled,  it  does  not  have  the  effect  of 
terminating the existing OSS procedure. Therefore, the consequences resulting from the adoption of 
provisional measures by the CSA under Article 66(1)), and/or of an urgent opinion or binding decision 
requested  by  the  EDPB  under  Article  66(2)  or  (3),  will  have  to  be  factored  in  that  OSS  procedure 
accordingly.

Adopted 

 

48 

 

261. From a general standpoint, a distinction can be drawn depending on the nature of the urgent measures 

sought: 

 

 

the  CSA adopted  measures  that  are provisional and limited  in  time and  to  its  national  territory 
pursuant to Article 66(1) and does not intend to request final measures to the EDPB;  

the CSA adopted provisional measures under Article 66(1) and intends to obtain final measures via 
the  application  of  Article  66(2),  or  the  CSA  intends  to  directly  obtain  final  measures  via  the 
application of Article 66(3); 

262. In the case of application of Article 66(1), the OSS procedure can continue towards the adoption of 
final measures under the LSA’s direction, without the CSA’s provisional measures having any particular 
consequences on the OSS procedure. In the scenario where Article 66(2) or (3) is applied, the urgent 
measures requested to the EDPB by the CSA are final in nature. Hence, in such scenario, the urgent 
binding  decision  or  urgent  opinion  adopted  by  the  EDPB  is  bound  to  impact  the  ongoing  OSS 
procedure, in particular on account of the need for the LSA to implement it without delay. Accordingly, 
the LSA and other CSAs will have to suspend the handling of the case pending the issuance of such 
urgent binding decision or urgent opinion.  

263. Once  the  EDPB  issues  its  urgent  opinion  or  urgent  binding  decision,  the  OSS  procedure  can 
recommence and the effects produced by the urgency procedure will have to be factored in the OSS 
procedure.  However,  it should  be  considered  that the LSA is required  to adopt its  final  decision  in 
pursuance of such EDPB urgent opinion or urgent binding decision within a very limited timeframe set 
by the EDPB on case-by-case basis (e.g. two weeks or one month), exactly on account of the urgency 
of the matter as endorsed by the EDPB.  

264. The LSA and the other CSAs are in the best position to establish whether the issues addressed by the 
ongoing OSS procedure have been fully covered by the LSA’s final decision adopted on the basis of the 
EDPB’s urgent binding decision or urgent opinion, or if there are outstanding issues.  

265. In the former case, the OSS procedure will come to its conclusion following the adoption of the final 
decision by the LSA, which will be followed by the procedural steps regulated under the terms of Article 
60(7-9) as the case may be. This may mean that, since the matter is closed, no draft decision will be 
shared  by  the  LSA  in  accordance  with  Article  60(3)97.  If  there  are  further  issues  that  need  to  be 
addressed on top of those that have been the subject of the urgent opinion or urgent binding decision, 
the LSA will have to clearly identify which issues part of its draft decision remain to be addressed within 
the current OSS procedure and which ones were resolved via the urgent binding decision or urgent 
opinion adopted by the EDPB. In such a case, the current Article 60 procedure will resume after the 
LSA adopted and notified its final decision, from the stage at which it was suspended because of the 
urgency procedure. 

 

                                                             
97 In any case, the views of the  other CSAs were already expressed via the  urgent binding decision  or urgent 
opinion adopted by the EDPB.

QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE  

 

 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

This annex is based on the GDPR and the Article 60 guidelines of the EDPB and should be read with the relevant sections of them for any question of legal 
interpretation. 

This document is meant to provide quick reference information on the procedures relating to the Cooperation between the lead Supervisory Authority (LSA) 
and the other Supervisory Authorities concerned (CSA) in case of cross border processing. Accordingly, the document is structured in accordance with the 
sequence of the steps to be performed in an Article 60 procedure by highlighting both legal obligations and shared best practices as set out in the said GDL.  

As for the phase prior to the starting of an Art. 60 procedure, in particular regarding determination of the LSA and preliminary vetting of cases, reference 
should be made to WP244 rev.01 and to the other relevant guidance. 

The main phases in an OSS procedure are outlined below:

The draft decision should also 
contain a description of relevant 
facts, sound reasoning and a proper 
legal assessment, so CSAs fully 
understand its conclusions (104,

The DD should set out clearly 
whether an issuing under Art 60(7),

60(9) it should be clear what will be 
issued by the LSA and what by the 
complaint receiving SA(s) (227); 
The four-week period starts running 
upon submission of the DD 
(103,135);  
The LSA should ensure that only 
triggers the workflow in working 
days and that the deadline does not 
expire on an EU holiday (138).

Such additional cooperation can 
take different forms, including 
organization of meetings or use of 
informal consultation procedures 
(146, 159); 
Following the LSA’s explanations 
and if the conflicting views are only 
marginal, the CSA(s) may consider 
withdrawing the RRO. In such 
situation, the CSA should explicitly 
declare that it withdraws its RRO 
(147-149);

The LSA is barred from submitting a 
revised draft decision solely on 
account of comments or other 
remarks (162-163 and EDPB 
Guidelines 9/2020); 
Following the assessment of the 
RRO, the LSA should clearly state to 
all CSA(s) its intention to submit a 
revised draft decision (RDD) (169-
170); 
The lapse of time between the RRO 
and the submission of a RDD should 
be as small as possible and 
appropriate to the OSS procedure 
(167-168);  

-  Prior to the formal submission, the 
LSA may share a preliminary RDD, 
via informal consultation, to ensure 
that there is agreement on the 
amendments introduced and 
consensus can be achieved (170); 
The RDD should completely address 
the risks posed by the initial DD
