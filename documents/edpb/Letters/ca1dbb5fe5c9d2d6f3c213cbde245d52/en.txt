Dear Ms Callander,

I refer to your letter dated 30 May 2019.

Many thanks for bringing Privacy Internationalâ€™s case study on the TrueCaller app to our attention.
The relevant expert subgroups have now reviewed both the case study and your correspondence with
TrueCaller. Information about your interest in the TrueCaller app has been forwarded to national
supervisory authorities.

The role of the European Data Protection Board is to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR,
whereas the competence to handle complaints and launch enforcements actions lies with the national
supervisory authorities. Therefore, the European Data Protection Board lacks the competence to take
an enforcement action or initiate an investigation regarding a specific company.

When complaints are lodged at national supervisory authorities, the various national authorities may
consult and coordinate on the matter under the one-stop-shop mechanism provided for by the GDPR.

Please note that the European Data Protection Board will not be in a position to discuss or comment
on pending procedures.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
