Dear Commissioner Denham,  

Dear Liz! 

Brussels, 20 October 2020 

 

In response to your letter dated 14 September 2020, ICO/O/ED/L/RTL/0177, first I would like to thank 
you for ensuring that the ICO representatives participated in the EDPB Cooperation Expert Subgroup 
meeting on 22 September.  

I also appreciate your readiness  to discuss recent developments in EU data protection law, while I 
have at the same time to ensure that such dialogue is carried out by the EDPB, as for any other EU 
institution, agency or body, in compliance with the provisions of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. 
This applies to cooperation between now and the end of the transitional period regarding, inter alia, 
remaining  transnational  cases  or  other  issues  that  have  an  impact  on  the  application  of  EU  data 
protection rules in the U.K 

In that context, I would like to inform you that the Cooperation expert subgroup will continue to work 
on the issue of cooperation procedures and will develop a framework of legal and practical criteria 
that will serve the smooth handling of ongoing cases. Special attention will be devoted to those cases 
where the ICO has been the lead authority so far. Whenever necessary and in compliance with the 
requirements of the Withdrawal Agreement, the EDPB will invite you to continue this exchange to 
anticipate as good as we can the potential impact of the Brexit on ongoing one-stop-shop cases. 

Finally,  I  have  no  doubt  that  all  EDPB  members  are  willing  to  establish  a  constructive  and  fruitful 
relation with the ICO after the end of the transition period to the benefit of the protection of personal 
data. 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
