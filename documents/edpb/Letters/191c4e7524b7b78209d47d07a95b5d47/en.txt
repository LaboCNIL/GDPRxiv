Dear Ms. Pachl, 

Thank you for your letter of 30 June 2022 with which you are bringing to my attention the complaints 
that BEUC and its members have submitted against Google. In your letter you are urging the EDPB to 
consider these complaints as a strategic case. 

As  you  have  correctly  indicated,  during  their  meeting  in  Vienna  of  last  April  the  EDPB  members 
committed themselves to identifying cross border cases of strategic importance where cooperation 
among the EDPB members would be prioritized and supported by the EDPB. As a result, on 12 July 
2022 the EDPB members adopted the relevant document on the criteria and process to apply for the 
selection of such cases of strategic importance1.  

The aforementioned adopted procedure provides that the suggestion for a case to be considered as 
strategic must be made by a supervisory authority and the EDPB members must agree on this. 

That being said, please allow me to stress that the EDPB has already communicated your letter to its 
members, who will reflect on the opportunity of suggesting the complaints in question as a strategic 
case. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
