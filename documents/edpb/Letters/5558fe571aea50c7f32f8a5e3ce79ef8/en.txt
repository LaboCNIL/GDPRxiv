EDPB  Response  to  the  European  Ombudsman’s  recommendation  regarding  joined  cases 
509/2022/JK and 1698/2022/JK 

 
 
Dear Ms O’Reilly, 

The EDPB is grateful for your letter of 29 March 2023 enclosing your recommendation on joined cases 
509/2022/JK and 1698/2022/JK (the “Recommendation”), including the confidential annex providing 
a more detailed assessment on  the nature and content of the preparatory documents. The EDPB 
thanks you for your Recommendation.  

As we have noted in our previous correspondence, the EDPB values transparency and is committed to 
open decision-making and good administration. The EDPB takes a finding of maladministration very 
seriously and has used this opportunity to review this complaint. Your Recommendation was discussed 
during the Plenary meetings of the 24-25 May and 20 June 2023.  

The  EDPB  fully  supports  providing  the  broadest  possible  access  to  the  documents  at  issue,  in 
compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and agrees with your Recommendation. The Court of 
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has yet to deliberate and confirm in case law some of the matters 
in scope of this complaint. In the meantime and in the spirit of transparency and cooperation, the 
EDPB has endeavoured to achieve your proposed balanced solution. The EDPB agrees to disclose draft

versions of documents in scope of the complaint, including with tracked changes, and agrees with your 
proposal to anonymise such documents so that they are unable to attribute views to a specific author. 

The EDPB is pleased to provide you with our opinion in response to your  Recommendation. In this 
opinion, the EDPB has presented the decision taken by the Plenary regarding the different categories 
of documents, before providing a detailed response to your assessment. We of course remain at your 
disposal should you wish to engage on these matters bilaterally.  

 

1.  The EDPB’s position regarding the disclosure for each category of documents, following 

the Ombudsman’s Recommendation 

Following a reassessment of all the documents in scope of your Recommendation, the EDPB members 
have discussed this matter during its recent Plenaries of 24 May and 20 June 2023. Consequently, the 
EDPB has decided to revise its confirmatory decision regarding the disclosure of these documents, in 
order to grant the widest possible access to them, and fully comply with your Recommendation. The 
revised  EDPB  position 
is  set  out  below,  for  each  category  of  documents  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. 

2.1.  Draft versions of EDPB Statement 04/20211 

Case 509/2022 

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB  has  denied  access  to  8  draft  versions2  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After a  re-assessment  of  these documents  and  taking into  consideration  your 
Recommendation, the EDPB has decided to: 

Fully disclose 7 of these drafts 3.  

• 
•  Partially disclose the remaining draft4. This document will be disclosed in an anonymised 
form. The internal comments will not be disclosed, because the EDPB considers that redacting 
the  reference  to  the  supervisory  authorities  (“SAs”)  which  made  the  comments  is  not 
sufficient to ensure the document is anonymised. The EDPB has therefore decided that the 
contents of  these  internal comments  shall remain confidential, and that the exception of 
Article 4(3) 2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is applicable in this case. The EDPB 
is committed to ensuring transparency of its decision-making process, and considers that this 
is achieved by granting access to the track changes in the document. The EDPB has provided 
its detailed reasoning on this matter below under Section 2.

Case 1698/2022 

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB  has  denied  access  to  7  draft  versions5  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After a re-assessment of  these documents,  and taking into  consideration  your 
Recommendation, the EDPB has decided to fully disclose all 7 of these drafts.  

The remaining two categories of documents only concern case 509/2022. 

2.1.  Minutes and draft minutes of expert subgroup meetings 

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB  has  denied  access  to  4  draft  versions6  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After a re-assessment, and taking into consideration your Recommendation, the 
EDPB has decided to fully disclose the draft minutes to the extent that they fall within the scope of 
the request. Therefore, the EDPB will provide the draft minutes to the applicant fully disclosing section 
7 thereof.  

2.1.  E-mail exchanges between the European Commission and the EDPB, as well as EDPB members 

and the EDPB Secretariat 

In its initial decision, the EDPB has granted partial access to 3 documents  which contain e-mails7 
subject  to  your  Recommendation.  After  a  re-assessment  of  these  documents,  and  taking  into 
consideration your Recommendation, the EDPB has decided to confirm its position with respect to the 
parts which were not disclosed,  and maintains that the exception of  Article 4(3)2nd paragraph of 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is applicable in this case8, and that it has granted the broadest possible 
access without undermining the decision-making process of the EDPB. As regards document 8, the 
EDPB maintains its position with regard to one sentence, concerning a matter on which the EDPB has 
not yet decided, and considers that the exception of Article 4(3)1st paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
1049/2001 is applicable in this case. The EDPB has provided its detailed reasoning on this matter below 
under Section 2. 

The EDPB notes that your Recommendation seems to identify issues with two e-mails, hence the EDPB 
would like to take the opportunity to provide some clarifications in this respect. 

                                                             
5 Documents 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 
6 Documents 1, 2, 3, 4. Please note that the parts in-scope of the request concerning documents 10, 13, 15 that 
were fully disclosed to the applicant; and documents 9 and 14 only contain redactions to prevent attributing 
the views expressed to specific parties, which is aligned with the EO’s proposal for solution (see para 9 of the 
Recommendation). This was explained in our letter dated 3 June 2022. 
7 Documents 8, 12, 17. Please note that documents 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, 18 only contain redactions to prevent 
attributing the views expressed to specific parties, which is aligned with your proposal for solution (see 
paragraph 9 of the Recommendation), as well as to prevent the disclosure of personal data (which is not 
challenged by the applicant). This was explained in our letter dated 3 June 2022. 
8 Documents 12 and 17. The application of Article 4(3)2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 to 
document 8 only concerns redactions to prevent attributing the views expressed by specific parties, which is 
aligned with your proposal for solution (see paragraph 9 of the Recommendation).

For the first e-mail, while your Recommendation does not identify the specific document concerned, 
it maintains that the e-mail was not redacted on the basis of Article 4 Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, 
but rather “to protect [the EDPB’s] internal process”. The EDPB Secretariat has identified one email 
that it believes could meet this description. In document 12, the EDPB Secretariat’s functional mailbox 
was redacted to avoid possible  disruptions  to its working methods, whereby this e-mail address is 
strictly  used  for  communications  between the EDPB members  and  its  Secretariat. If that e-mail 
address became public, it would lead to very significant disruptions  of the working methods of the 
EDPB, as this functional mailbox would likely become flooded with spam and e-mails from external 
parties. This would also likely lead to numerous duplicate e-mails being received, given that the EDPB 
already has a separate functional mailbox for correspondence with external senders.  

Disclosing  this  internal  functional  mailbox  address,  which  was  created  to  be  dedicated  to 
correspondence with EDPB members, as well as the European Commission, would therefore mean the 
EDPB Secretariat would need more time to process incoming e-mails, leading to delayed responses to 
the EDPB members. Therefore, the EDPB considers that the redaction of this e-mail address is justified 
on  the basis  of  Article 4(3)  2nd paragraph of  Regulation (EC)  No 1049/2001, as  disclosure  would 
severely hinder the EDPB Secretariat from performing its tasks in accordance with Article 75(6)(b) 
GDPR. The EDPB considers that there is no overriding public interest that could be relevant to disclose 
this internal e-mail address, as the EDPB has  another functional mailbox specifically  dedicated to 
exchanges with external parties, the address of the latter being public9. 

For the second e-mail, your Recommendation provides an exact reference (“email of 09 February 2021 
(18:59)”), which enabled the EDPB Secretariat to identify this as an e-mail in part of the e-mail chains 
in document 11. It was exchanged between two EDPB Secretariat staff members, hence falling outside 
of the scope of this access to documents request. The reasoning for this redaction was included in the 
replies  to the initial10 and  confirmatory requests11 in case 2021-37-C, and in  the correspondence 
between the EDPB or its Secretariat and your Office12. 

 

2.  EDPB Response to the Ombudsman’s assessment 
2.1.  EDPB reliance on Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 

2.1.1.  The risks to the independence of the EDPB and its members 

With regard to the documents partially disclosed, the EDPB considers that the exception under Article 
4(3) 2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 applies. In the following lines, the EDPB provides 
detailed arguments in order to explain, in the most precise way possible, its reliance on that exception 
and the specific and actual risks that disclosure would cause to its decision-making process.

The EDPB fully agrees with and is committed to ensuring transparency of its decision-making process, 
in line with Articles 1 and 10 TEU and Article 15 TFEU. The EDPB concurs with the Ombudsman in that 
the principle of transparency applies to all documents held by EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as 
it “guarantees  that  the  administration  enjoys  greater legitimacy  and  is  more  effective and  more 
accountable to the citizen”13. The EDPB also acknowledges that such principle applies regardless of 
whether the documents form part of the EU’s legislative process14.  

The EDPB underlines  that, in cases where documents  are part of the EU’s legislative process, the 
principle of transparency requires a wider access to the documents, which “should be made directly 
accessible to the greatest possible  extent”15. The CJEU has emphasised this in consistent case law, 
where it recognised the importance of involving citizens in the decision-making process in the context 
of  the  legislative  process  by  providing  them  with  timely  access  to  the information16.  The EDPB 
highlights that the case law referred to in paragraph 24 of your Recommendation becomes relevant 
in the context of the legislative process. Indeed, both judgements quoted refer to final versions  of 
internal documents used in the context of a legislative decision-making process17. On the contrary, 
the  EDPB is  a  body  with  no  legislative  powers  and  the  documents  within  the  scope  of  your 
Recommendation are not final, but rather drafts containing track changes and internal comments 
made at staff level. Therefore, the findings  made by  the CJEU in  T-144/05 and T-540/15  are not 
applicable mutatis mutandis to the case at hand. The EDPB had already provided partial access to the 
e-mails within the scope of the request, only redacting some parts whose disclosure would undermine 
its decision-making process18. In addition, and keeping in mind the Recommendation and the EDPB’s 
pursue of transparency, the EDPB decided to revisit its approach and disclose all the draft versions of 
Statement 04/2021, only redacting some of the internal comments made at staff level, in line with 
your proposal to anonymise the documents. By disclosing these documents, the EDPB believes that it 
provides the applicant with a clear overview of its decision-making process regarding the specific files, 
without it being necessary to disclose internal comments made by staff members in a draft document 
or an e-mail to achieve this goal. 

In this respect, the EDPB wishes to reiterate that disclosure of internal comments containing views 
and opinions of staff members is not afforded since it could lead to the re-identification of the authors 
or, at the very least, the party(ies). This risk is not purely hypothetical but real, foreseeable and in fact, 
based  on  a  previous  recent  experience:  in  the  context  of  the  Ombudsman  Decision  in  case 
386/2021/AMF, disclosure  of internal comments where only the authors were anonymised did not

prevent the attribution of  views  to specific  parties19. This  will affect the EDPB’s decision-making 
process as it can be used in an attempt to discredit the EDPB and/or some of its members and/or exert 
pressure over them. This is especially the case if we take into account the role of the EDPB members 
at national level as the competent supervisory authorities (“SAs”) to ensure compliance with national 
and EU data protection rules, including the supervision  of the Member States’ compliance with their 
obligations. Given the fact that the redacted comments (including the ones made in the e-mails) 
portray  opinions  and  views  of  national  authorities  -  at  staff  level  -  with  regard to  documents 
addressing data protection compliance in the field of international agreements and administrative 
arrangements between public bodies, it is particularly important to ensure that SAs are able to fulfil 
their tasks in an independent manner and without being subject to any external pressure20, including 
from Member States’ governments. Should  the internal comments at issue  be disclosed, the EDPB 
considers that there is a reasonably foreseeable risk that Member States’ governments attempt to 
exercise pressure  on  their competent  SA, especially  considering  that Statement 04/2021  invited 
Member States to assess and review their international agreements involving international transfers 
in light of the EU data protection framework, and the SAs’ role in supervising compliance with data 
protection rules.     

 

2.1.2.  The risks to the EDPB’s mission and the decision-making process 

The EDPB also wishes to underline its task of ensuring the consistent application of the GDPR and the 
LED 21. In  order  to  achieve such  mission,  it  is  essential  that the  EDPB speaks  with  one  voice  in 
accordance with its guiding principles of collegiality, inclusiveness and cooperation22. In this respect, 
the EDPB understands the added value of the draft documents for stakeholders in order to understand 
the process leading to the adoption of the final documents. The different draft versions are a result of 
the  discussions,  cooperation and  agreements of  the  EDPB members  during  the  decision-making 
process  and  reflect  the  different  stages  which  the  documents  underwent.  In  this  respect, the 
documents that the EDPB proposes to disclose already provide the public with a clear understanding 
of the decision-making process in the given case23, without jeopardising the EDPB’s mission to speak 
with one voice.

By contrast, the  EDPB is  of  the view  that its  role  will  be undermined  in the  event that internal 
deliberations are made public. Indeed, the redacted comments contain opinions  for internal use as 
part  of  deliberations  and  preliminary  consultations  within  the  EDPB  whose  disclosure  would 
undermine the decision-making process of the EDPB 24. Firstly, the EDPB underlines that the internal 
comments at hand were made during the drafting stage at staff level and do not necessarily reflect 
the official position of the concerned EDPB members. If staff members fear that internal comments 
expressed during deliberations may be made public, this could lead to the censoring of their own views 
and opinions25. In this regard, even if the internal comments were anonymised by redacting only the 
name of the individuals  and/or of their SA, there is still  a risk of re-identifying the SA of the staff 
member and, therefore, the concrete author of the comment could also be identified26.  Likewise, the 
redaction of some parts of the e-mails at stake aims at addressing the risk of re-identification and 
attribution of a concrete view or opinion to the specific author or SA. This is a real, foreseeable and 
tangible risk which some EDPB members have already shared concerns about. This will undoubtedly 
have  a  very  significant  negative  impact  on  the  EDPB’s deliberations  during  its  decision-making 
processes. In this respect, the EDPB wishes to emphasise once again its working methods, whereby 
the EDPB members play an essential role in feeding the work of the EDPB. This is particularly the case 
in relation to guidelines, statements and other guidance, where the rapporteurs are usually SAs. In 
addition, in the context of the discussions in the dedicated expert subgroups, the EDPB members have 
a  prominent  role  in  providing  written  and  oral  comments,  discussing  options  and  reaching 
compromises. This is clearly reflected by the several draft versions of the statement within the scope 
of this case. Therefore, should some EDPB members censor sharing their views in preparatory work 
that is essential in the proper running of the EDPB, the risk that the EDPB is not able to fully achieve 
its  tasks  in  the future, at least  when  it comes  to  drafting and adopting  guidance, is  reasonably 
foreseeable and not merely hypothetical27. This reasoning applies both with regard to documents 12, 
17 and 23 of the present case, where the redactions aim at protecting the decision-making process 
when a decision has already been taken, as well as to document 8, where the redacted view concerns 
an issue for which a decision has not been taken yet by the EDPB.   

Considering the above, and with the aim of fully complying with your Recommendation of providing 
the broadest possible access to the documents in an anonymised format, the EDPB decided to disclose 
all the drafts of Statement 04/2021 at issue, including those with track changes, and only redact the

25 Judgment of 15 September 2016, Philip Morris v Commission, T-18/15, EU:T:2016:487, paragraph 87: “[...] 
The possibility of expressing views independently within an institution helps to encourage internal discussions 
with a view to improving the functioning of that institution and contributing to the smooth running of the 
decision-making process” (emphasis added). 
26 For example, the use of specific language or formulations can give an indication of the geographical location 
or mother tongue of the author of the comment, which could be an element to identify either the SA, or the 
author or both.

information whose disclosure was essential to protect the fulfilment of its mission  and its decision-
making process.  

Finally, the EDPB wishes to clarify its previous references to the need to preserve its independence28. 
The independence of the EDPB and its members is an essential element to enable the EDPB’s task of 
ensuring the consistent application of the GDPR 29 and encouraging the consistent application of the 
LED 30, as well as the SAs’ task of monitoring the application of the GDPR 31 and of  the provisions 
adopted pursuant to the LED 32. In line with this, the EDPB Rules of Procedure establish the rules on 
confidentiality of the discussions  in several situations, including when the EDPB decides so given the 
nature of the topic33. The EDPB fully agrees with the Ombudsman in that internal rules of procedure 
do not take legal precedence over a Regulation, and reassures that this was never the understanding 
nor intention of the EDPB. On the contrary, the EDPB fully abides by the obligation stemming from 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and the case law to demonstrate that the risks posed by the disclosure 
of the internal comments at hand are real, foreseeable and not purely hypothetical, in addition to 
demonstrating that there is no overriding public interest 34. The independence of the EDPB and its 
confidentiality rules are mere elements stemming from the GDPR and the EDPB’s Rules of Procedure 
which substantiate the EDPB’s views that its decision-making process may be undermined by the 
disclosure of these internal comments, given the negative effect that it may have in the independence 
of  the  EDPB  and  its  members.  Thus,  as  explained  above,  the  EDPB  took  these  aspects  into 
consideration when determining whether disclosure should be rejected on the basis of Article 4(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.   

 

3.  Concluding remarks 
In light of the above, we consider that the EDPB has sufficiently demonstrated a specific and actual 
risk to its decision-making, and the absence of an overriding public interest in disclosure of the internal 
comments. 

To conclude,  we would  like to reiterate our  intention to proactively apply  the same approach as 
presented above, for  future requests  concerning revised  versions  of  documents,  where relevant, 
taking always into account the specificities of the request(s) assessed. We stand ready to review these 
arrangements regularly to ensure they remain fit for purpose.
