Subject:  Your  request  to  the  EDPB  for  a  legal  assessment  on  the  Commission  proposals  for 
Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the conditions for accessing 
the other EU information systems and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 and Regulation (EU) 
yyyylxxx  {ECRIS-TCN]  -  2019/000l(COD)  -  COM(2019)0003;  and  Regulation  of  the  European 
Parliament  and  of  the  Council  establishing  the  conditions/or  accessing  other  EU  information 
systems  for  ETIAS  purposes  and  amending  Regulation  (EU)  2018/1240,  Regulation  (EC)  No 
76712008,  Regulation  (EU)  2017/2226  and  Regulation  (EU)  2018/1861  -  2019/0002(COD)  - 
COM(2019)0004 

Dear Mr López Aguilar, 

we would like to thank you for the LIBE Committee’s request of 4 April 2019, by which the EDPB was 
asked for a legal assessment on the implications of the aforementioned Commission proposals on the 
right to the protection of personal data in the framework of the envisaged automated processing. 

The recent Commission proposals have to be seen as part of a bigger picture. At a first glance, they 
seem to contain only necessary follow-up amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 establishing a 
European  Travel  Information  and  Authorisation  System  (ETIAS  Regulation)1.  Those  amendments 
concern  the  ETIAS  Regulation  itself  as  well  as  the  legal  bases  for  four  other  European  information 
systems, namely the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), the Entry 
Exit System (EES)2 and the European Criminal Record Information System on Third Country Nationals 

 

and 

                                                           
1 Regulation  (EU)  2018/1240  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  12  September   
2018   establishing   a   European   Travel   Information   and   Authorisation   System   (ETIAS)   and    
amending    Regulations    (EU)    No    1077/2011,    (EU)    No    515/2014,    (EU)    2016/399,    (EU)

2 REGULATION (EU) 2017/2226 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 30 November 2017 
establishing an Entry/Exit System (EES) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third-country 
nationals crossing the external borders of the Member States and determining the conditions for access to the 
EES for law enforcement purposes, and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and 
Regulations

(ECRIS-TCN)3. Three of those systems are not yet established. Nevertheless the establishing legislation 
is already being amended in these Commission proposals.  

The EDPB wishes to stress that such a regulatory approach – amending provisions for databases that 
are not yet in place – does neither align with the principle of transparency nor with the principle that 
data processing has to be based on clear, precise and accessible rules. 

It is necessary to look at this from a holistic point of view where the core items of these proposals 
should be considered as implementing parts of the new Interoperability Framework4.  The ETIAS is 
one of six systems (the five systems already mentioned and Eurodac) that are going to be incorporated 
in the Interoperability Framework,  interconnected by a common search portal, a common identity 
repository, a common biometric matching service and a common tool for multiple identity detection. 
The  setting  up  of  a  common  repository  for  identity data  from  the  EES  and  the  ETIAS  will  serve  as 
technical  basis  for  the  future  Common  Identity  Repository  of  the  Interoperability  Framework.  The 
setting up of an instrument for the automated comparisons made by the ETIAS central system in SIS, 
VIS, EES and ECRIS-TCN will serve as the technical basis for the future European Search Portal (ESP) in 
the Interoperability Framework. Furthermore, the widened access rights to VIS for law enforcement 
authorities for identification purposes that are part of the Interoperability Framework marks the final 
discard of the thresholds put up by Council Decision (EU) 2008/6335 for law enforcement agencies’ 
access to VIS. 

The Interoperability Framework poses enormous risks to the rights for privacy and data protection. By 
interconnecting  IT  systems  enabling  cross  access  processes  that  are  difficult  to  account  for  the 
legislator is disregarding its own encoded principle of Data Protection by Design and by Default. The 
EDPB  wishes  to  recall  that  the  European  data  protection  authorities  have  already  analyzed  the 
implications  of  the  Interoperability  Framework  and  commented  on  them  in  detail  in  the  former 
Working Party 29’s Opinion on Commission proposals on establishing a framework for interoperability

between  EU  information  systems  in  the  field  of  borders  and  visa  as  well  as  police  and  judicial 
cooperation, asylum and migration (WP 266) adopted on 11 April 20186.  

The concerns expressed by the WP 29 are still valid. Thus, the recent proposals are only one further 
step  in  the  big  project  once  tabled  in  the  Communication  from  the  Commission  to  the  European 
Parliament and the Council “Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security”7. 
Since then there has been a steady flow of new regulatory initiatives with the purpose of extending 
existing information systems, establishing new information systems and incorporating all of them into 
the  Interoperability  Framework that  was  finally  adopted  in  May  2019  and  came  into  force  shortly 
thereafter. 

The new architecture for information systems in the field of border management, asylum, migration, 
police and judicial cooperation has been negotiated with tremendous speed and with a continuous 
flow of complex legislative proposals, all interconnected with one another. This way of processing has 
been a clear challenge for the data protection assessments requested. Since the underlying legislation 
that is the cause for the amendments in these proposals is already in force, the EDPB can only recall 
all its previously expressed concerns. 

The  EDPB  wishes  to  express  its  deep  concern  with  regards  to  the  challenges  the  Interoperability 
Framework poses for compliance with the principle of purpose limitation, data subjects’ rights and 
additionally the fulfillment of supervisory tasks of the data protection authorities. 

We remain at your disposal for any questions or clarifications you may require on these subjects. 

Yours sincerely, 

For the EDPB 

 

Andrea Jelinek
