Dear Mr Körner,

10 September 2020

Ref: OUT2020-0102

I refer to your letter dated 24 January 2020 outlining your concerns in relation to the practice of
applications sharing personal data with advertising networks and third party providers.

Thank you very much for bringing this study to our attention. The EDPB is aware of the importance of
this topic and has recently issued Guidelines on the targeting of social media users, now open for
public consultation.

Additionally, the topic of privacy in the adtech industry is examined within the relevant EDPB Expert
Subgroups.  The  EDPB  and  its  Expert  Subgroups also  serve  as  a  useful  forum  for  the  national
supervisory authorities to coordinate, cooperate and exchange experiences in ongoing cases.

Please note that the role of the EDPB is to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR, whereas the
competence to handle complaints and launch enforcements actions lies with the national supervisory
authorities.  Therefore,  the EDPB lacks  the  competence  to  initiate  an  investigation regarding  any
specific company.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
