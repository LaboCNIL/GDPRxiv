Dear Ms. Pachl, 

Brussels, 3 March 2022 
Ref: OUT2022-0011 

With respect to your letter dated 21 December 2021, first let me express our appreciation for BEUC’s 
efforts aimed at protecting consumer rights and ensuring that the ad-tech industry respects the EU 
data protection laws. I would also like to thank you for your attention dedicated to our recent work 
on EU digital files, including Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act.  

I would like to underline that the European Data Protection Board is committed to ensuring consistent 
application of the General Data Protection Regulation, including in the ad-tech sector. As indicated in 
my letter to BEUC dated 18 June 20201, while the EDPB lacks the required competence to launch 
investigations, as this competence lies with the relevant national supervisory authorities, the topic of 
privacy in the ad-tech industry is assigned to the relevant EDPB Expert Subgroups. Thanks to the work 
we have conducted in this context, we have adopted documents such as the Guidelines 8/2020 on the 
targeting of social media users2 and the updated Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 
2016/6793 that are relevant to building a uniform approach to this matter. We are also monitoring 
relevant legislative procedures and actively collaborating with the Consumer Protection Cooperation 
Network.  

The EDPB’s actions to support the enforcement of the GDPR, at the core of the second pillar of our 
Strategy for 2021-20234, is also demonstrated by the creation of projects like the Support Pool of 
Experts and the Coordinated Enforcement Framework5. In parallel, EDPB Expert Subgroups also serve

as  a  useful  forum  for  the  national supervisory authorities  to  coordinate,  cooperate  and  exchange 
experiences.  

I would like to reassure you that your letter has been circulated within all the EDPB members. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
