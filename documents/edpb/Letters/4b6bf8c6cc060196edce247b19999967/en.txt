Subject: Your letter to the EDPB of 17 April 2019 

Dear Ms ln 't Veld, 

Thank you very much for your letter dated 17 April 2019 on the important topic of connected vehicles. 
Automated and connected vehicles may offer significant benefits for users by providing enhanced 
levels of usability or convenience, as well as for the general public by improving traffic efficiency and 
safety of vehicle drivers and their passengers, other road users and pedestrians. ln many cases, this 
will include the processing of personal data due to the wide variety of sensors installed in them, thus 
raising new challenges to the rights to the protection of personal data and privacy of users. 

ln this context, the Members of the EDPB and their international colleagues have already adopted a 
resolution of the ICDPPC, in 2017, on Data Protection in Automated and Connected Vehicles1
. The 
former WP29 has as well adopted an opinion on the processing personal data  in the context of 
Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) - Opinion 3/20172 

I  have asked for your letter to be transmitted to the relevant EDPB Expert Subgroup dealing with this 
matter and I  can inform you that the work on this topic according to our EDPB work plan 2019/2020 
has already started. 

We thank you for your continued interest on the work of the EDPB and its forthcoming guidance on 
this topic. 

Yours sincerely,
