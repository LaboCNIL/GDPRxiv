Dear Ms Asimakopoulou,  

Brussels, 25 January 2021 

Ref: OUT2021-0002 

Thank  you  for  your  letter of  19  October  2020  regarding the  developments  in  relation  to  ICANN/ 
WHOIS. The EDPB is aware of the importance of this matter and has considered the issues  related to 
the development of a GDPR-compliant WHOIS model on previous  occasions, including  in its letter of 
5 July 20181.  

In this context, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR provides for the so-called ‘One-Stop-Shop’ mechanism, 
which stipulates that for any cross-border  processing of personal data the data protection authority 
of  the main or of  the single  establishment of  the data controller in  the EEA  acts as  the competent 
authority, which supervises the processing activities of that controller. 

Therefore, the EDPB underlines that the Belgian data protection authority is the competent authority 
to supervise ICANN’s processing activities in relation to their compliance with the GDPR 2. 

The EDPB is confident that the Belgian data protection authority is fulfilling its tasks and exercising its 
powers  in  accordance  with  the  GDPR.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanism as provided in the GDPR enables the national supervisory authorities to work together in 
order to contribute to the consistent application of the GDPR. 

The role of the EDPB is to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR, whereas the competence to 
monitor processing activities of data controllers and to advise them regarding their obligations under 
the GDPR lies with national supervisory  authorities. In accordance with Article 64 (2) GDPR, the EDPB 
may be requested to examine any matter of general application or producing effects in more than one 
Member  State,  however  only  supervisory  authorities,  the  Chair  of  the  Board  or  the  European 
Commission  can submit such a request to the EDPB on the basis of Article 64 (2) GDPR.  

Please note that the general guidance by the EDPB on allocation of the processing roles in accordance 
with the GDPR has been provided  in the EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and
