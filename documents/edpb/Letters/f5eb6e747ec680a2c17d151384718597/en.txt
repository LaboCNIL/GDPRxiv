Dear Mr. de Serpa Soares,  

Thank you  for your  letter of 15 July  2021, by  which you  refer to the ongoing dialogue between the 
European  Data  Protection  Board  (“the  Board”  or  the  “EDPB”)  and  the  United  Nations  on  data 
protection. 

I would first of all like to thank you and the representatives of the United Nations System Organisations 
for the active participation in the Task Force on transfers to international organisations established by 
the European Data Protection Supervisor (the ‘Task Force’).  

I understand that the work of  this  Task Force has indeed  been very useful  to allow its members to 
informally  provide  comments on  various  issues  relating to transfers to  international organisations, 
including  on  possible  provisions  for  agreements  or  administrative  arrangements. I  am  therefore 
pleased  to read that representatives of  several United  Nations System  Organisations  will  continue 
attending the Task Force. 

As a consequence, and as I already indicated in my previous letter from 19 May 2021, the work carried 
out in this Task Force will not in any way replace any formal procedure set out in the GDPR. 

Furthermore, I take the utmost account of your suggestion that the EDPB should  consider addressing 
the situation of all transfers to United Nations System Organisations in a specific set of guidelines.  

Lastly, I  would  like  to renew  the Board’s  commitment to  engage further  with  the United  Nations 
System Organisations on the shared mission of protecting human rights, including the right to privacy. 

 

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
