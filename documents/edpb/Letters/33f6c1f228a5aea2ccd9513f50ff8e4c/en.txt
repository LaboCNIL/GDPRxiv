Brussels, 23 January 2019 

Ref: SH-464-2018 

Subject: Letter dated 23 November 2018 on Spanish electoral law 

Dear Mrs In 't Veld, 

Thank you very much for your letter dated 23  November 2018 concerning the recently approved 
Spanish electoral law. 

The processing of sensitive personal data, such as political opinions, in particular in an electoral context, 
is of great relevance to the European Data Protection Board and to all its members. Elections are a pillar 
of the democratic process and, given recent events,  it is imperative to ensure a lawful processing of 
personal data in this context. 

The GDPR,  in its recital 56, determines that the processing of political opinions of data subjects by 
political parties is permitted for reasons of public interest where - and I underline the importance of this 
part - "appropriate safeguards are established". 

For your information, the Spanish SA has adopted an opinion on this matter on the 19th December 
2018.1 

Separately, given the importance of the processing of personal data in an electoral context, I am in a 
position to inform you that the Board intends to produce a general statement on this subject. 

Yorssi 

y, 

Andrea Jelinek
