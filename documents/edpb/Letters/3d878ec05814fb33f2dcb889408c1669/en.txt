EDPB Response to the European Ombudsman’s recommendation regarding case 201/2022/JK 
 
 

Brussels, 28 June 2023 

Dear Ms O’Reilly, 

The EDPB is  grateful for  your  letter of  29  March 2023 enclosing  your  recommendation on  case 
201/2022/JK (the “Recommendation”), including the confidential annex providing a more detailed 
assessment on the nature and content of the preparatory documents. The EDPB thanks you for your 
Recommendation.  

As we have noted in our previous correspondence, the EDPB values transparency and is committed to 
open decision-making and good administration. The EDPB takes a finding of maladministration very 
seriously and has used this opportunity to review this complaint. Your Recommendation was discussed 
during the Plenary meetings of the 24-25 May and 20 June 2023.  

The  EDPB  fully  supports  providing  the  broadest  possible  access  to  the  documents  at  issue,  in 
compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and agrees with your Recommendation. The Court of 
Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has yet to deliberate and confirm in case law some of the matters 
in scope of this complaint. In the meantime and in the spirit of transparency and cooperation, the 
EDPB has endeavoured to achieve your proposed balanced solution. The EDPB agrees to disclose draft 
versions of documents in scope of the complaint, including with tracked changes, and agrees with your 
proposal to anonymise such documents so that they are unable to attribute views to a specific author. 

The EDPB is pleased to provide you with our opinion in response to your Recommendation. In this 
opinion, the EDPB has presented the decision taken by the Plenary regarding the different categories 
of documents, before providing a detailed response to your assessment. We of course remain at your 
disposal should you wish to engage on these matters bilaterally.

1.  The EDPB’s position regarding the disclosure for each category of documents, following the 

Ombudsman’s Recommendation 

Following a reassessment of all the documents in scope of your Recommendation, the EDPB members 
have discussed this matter during its recent Plenaries of 24 May and 20 June 2023. Consequently, the 
EDPB has decided to revise its confirmatory decision regarding the disclosure of these documents, in 
order to grant the widest possible access to them, and fully comply with your Recommendation. The 
revised  EDPB  position 
is  set  out  below,  for  each  category  of  documents  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. 

1.1.  Draft versions of EDPB Statement 04/20211 

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB has  denied  access  to  19  draft versions2  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After a re-assessment of  these documents,  and taking into  consideration  your 
Recommendation, the EDPB has decided to:  

•  Fully disclose 18 of these drafts 3.  

•  Partially disclose the remaining draft4. This document will be disclosed in an anonymised 
form. The internal comments will not be disclosed because the EDPB considers that redacting 
the  reference  to  the  supervisory  authorities  (“SAs”)  which  made  the  comments  is  not 
sufficient to ensure the document is anonymised. The EDPB has therefore decided that the 
contents of  these internal comments shall  remain confidential, and that the exception of 
Article 4(3) 2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is applicable in this case. The EDPB 
is committed to ensuring transparency of its decision-making process, and considers that this 
is achieved by granting access to the track changes in the document. The EDPB has provided 
its detailed reasoning on this matter below under Section 2. 

1.2.  Draft versions of the EDPB response to MEP in’t Veld5  

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB  has  denied  access  to  8  draft  versions6  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After a re-assessment of  these documents,  and taking into  consideration  your 
Recommendation, the EDPB has decided to:

•  Fully disclose 4 of these drafts 7.  

•  Partially  disclose  the  4  remaining  drafts 8.  These  document will  be  disclosed  in  an 
anonymised form. The internal comments will not be disclosed because the EDPB considers 
that redacting the reference to the supervisory  authority which made the comment is not 
sufficient to ensure the documents are anonymised. The EDPB has therefore decided that the 
contents of  these internal comments shall  remain confidential, and that the exception of 
Article 4(3) 2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is applicable in this case. The EDPB 
is committed to ensuring transparency of its decision-making process, and considers that this 
is achieved by granting access to the track changes in the documents. The EDPB has provided 
its detailed reasoning on this matter below under Section 2. 

1.3.  Draft versions of EDPB Guidelines 2/20209  

In  its  confirmatory  decision,  the  EDPB has  denied  access  to  41 draft  versions10  subject  to  your 
Recommendation. After  re-assessment  of  these  documents,  and  taking  into  consideration  your 
Recommendation, the EDPB decided to: 

•  Fully disclose 9 of these drafts 11.  

•  Partially  disclose  the  32  remaining  drafts 12. The  documents will  be  disclosed  in  an 
anonymised form. The EDPB has decided that some comments in one of the documents13 
may be disclosed, as their contents would not allow the author to be identified, given their 
general nature. The other internal comments in that document, as well as in the remaining 
documents, will not be disclosed because the EDPB considers that redacting the reference to 
the supervisory authority which made the comment is not sufficient to ensure the documents 
are  anonymised.  The  EDPB  has  therefore  decided  that  the  contents  of  these  internal 
comments shall remain confidential, and that the exception of Article 4(3)2nd paragraph of 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is applicable in this case. The EDPB is committed to ensuring 
transparency of its decision-making process, and considers that this is achieved by granting 
access to the track changes in the documents. The EDPB has provided its detailed reasoning 
on this matter below under Section 2.

2.  EDPB Response to the Ombudsman’s assessment 

2.1.  EDPB reliance on Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 

2.1.1 The risks to the independence of the EDPB and its members 

With regard to the documents partially disclosed, the EDPB considers that the exception under Article 
4(3) 2nd paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 applies. In the following lines, the EDPB provides 
detailed arguments in order to explain, in the most precise way possible, its reliance on that exception 
and the specific and actual risks that disclosure would cause to its decision-making process.  

The EDPB fully agrees with and is committed to ensuring transparency of its decision-making process, 
in line with Articles 1 and 10 TEU and Article 15 TFEU. The EDPB concurs with the Ombudsman in that 
the principle of transparency applies to all documents held by EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as 
it “guarantees  that  the  administration  enjoys  greater legitimacy  and  is  more  effective and  more 
accountable to the citizen”14. The EDPB also acknowledges that such principle applies regardless of 
whether the documents form part of the EU’s legislative process15.  

The EDPB underlines  that, in cases where documents  are part of the EU’s legislative process, the 
principle of transparency requires a wider access to the documents, which “should be made directly 
accessible to the greatest possible  extent”16. The CJEU has emphasised this in consistent case law, 
where it recognised the importance of involving citizens in the decision-making process in the context 
of  the  legislative  process  by  providing  them  with  timely  access  to  the information17.  The EDPB 
highlights that the case law referred to in paragraph 24 of your Recommendation becomes relevant 
in the context of the legislative process. Indeed, both judgements quoted refer to final versions  of 
internal documents used in the context of a legislative decision-making process18. On the contrary, 
the  EDPB is  a  body  with  no  legislative  powers  and  the  documents  within  the  scope  of  your 
Recommendation are not final, but rather drafts containing track changes and internal comments 
made at staff level. Therefore, the findings  made by  the CJEU in  T-144/05 and T-540/15  are not 
applicable  mutatis  mutandis  to  the  case  at  hand.  This  being  said,  and  keeping  in  mind  the 
Recommendation and the EDPB’s pursue of transparency, the EDPB decided to revisit its approach 
and disclose all the draft versions of Statement 04/2021, Guidelines 2/2020 and the reply to an MEP, 
only  redacting some  of  the internal comments made at staff level, in line  with your  proposal  to 
anonymise  the documents. By disclosing  these documents, the EDPB believes that it provides the

applicant with a clear overview of its decision-making process regarding the specific files, without it 
being necessary to disclose internal comments made by staff members to achieve this goal. 

In this respect, the EDPB wishes to reiterate that disclosure of internal comments containing views 
and opinions of staff members is not afforded since it could lead to the re-identification of the authors 
or, at the very least, the party(ies). This risk is not purely hypothetical but real, foreseeable and in fact, 
based  on  a  previous  recent  experience:  in  the  context  of  the  Ombudsman  Decision  in  case 
386/2021/AMF, disclosure  of internal comments where only the authors were anonymised did not 
prevent the attribution of  views  to specific  parties19. This  will affect the EDPB’s decision-making 
process as it can be used in an attempt to discredit the EDPB and/or some of its members and/or exert 
pressure over them. This is especially the case if we take into account the role of the EDPB members 
at national level as the competent supervisory authorities (“SAs”) to ensure compliance with national 
and EU data protection rules, including the supervision  of the Member States’ compliance with their 
obligations.  Given  the  fact that the  redacted  comments  portray  opinions  and  views  of  national 
authorities - at staff level - with regard to documents addressing data protection compliance in the 
field  of  international agreements and  administrative arrangements between  public  bodies,  it  is 
particularly important to ensure that SAs are able to fulfil their tasks in an independent manner and 
without being subject to any external pressure20, including from Member States’ governments. Should 
the internal comments at issue be disclosed, the EDPB considers that there is a reasonably foreseeable 
risk that Member States’ governments attempt to exercise pressure on their competent SA, especially 
considering that Statement 04/2021 invited Member States to assess and review their international 
agreements involving international transfers in light of the EU data protection framework, and the 
SAs’ role in supervising compliance with data protection rules.     

2.1.2 The risks to the EDPB’s mission and the decision-making process 

Irish  DPC  tried  to 

The EDPB also wishes to underline its task of ensuring the consistent application of the GDPR and the 
LED 21. In  order  to  achieve such  mission,  it  is  essential  that the  EDPB speaks  with  one  voice  in 
accordance with its guiding principles of collegiality, inclusiveness and cooperation22. In this respect, 
the EDPB understands the added value of the draft documents for stakeholders in order to understand 
the process leading to the adoption of the final documents. The different draft versions are a result of 
the  discussions,  cooperation and  agreements of  the  EDPB members  during  the  decision-making 
process  and  reflect  the  different  stages  which  the  documents  underwent.  In  this  respect, the

documents that the EDPB proposes to disclose already provide the public with a clear understanding 
of how the EDPB interpreted the GDPR in the given cases23, without jeopardising the EDPB’s mission 
to speak with one voice.  

By contrast, the  EDPB is  of  the view  that its  role  will  be undermined  in the  event that internal 
deliberations are made public. Indeed, the redacted comments contain opinions  for internal use as 
part  of  deliberations  and  preliminary  consultations  within  the  EDPB  whose  disclosure  would 
undermine the decision-making process of the EDPB 24. Firstly, the EDPB underlines that the internal 
comments at hand were made during the drafting stage at staff level and do not necessarily reflect 
the official position of the concerned EDPB members. If staff members fear that internal comments 
expressed during deliberations may be made public, this could lead to the censoring of their own views 
and opinions25. In this regard, even if the internal comments were anonymised by redacting only the 
name of the individuals  and/or of their SA, there is still  a risk of re-identifying the SA of the staff 
member and, therefore, the concrete author of the comment could also be identified26.  This is a real, 
foreseeable and tangible risk which some EDPB members have already shared concerns about. This 
will  undoubtedly  have  a very  significant  negative impact  on  the  EDPB’s deliberations  during  its 
decision-making  processes. In this  respect, the EDPB wishes  to emphasise  once again its working 
methods, whereby the EDPB members play an essential role in feeding the work of the EDPB. This is 
particularly the case in relation to guidelines, statements and other guidance, where the rapporteurs 
are usually SAs. In addition, in the context of the discussions  in the dedicated expert subgroups, the 
EDPB members have a prominent role in providing written and oral comments, discussing options and 
reaching compromises.  This  is  clearly  reflected  by  the  several  draft  versions  of  the  statement, 
guidelines and letter within the scope of this case. Therefore, should  some EDPB members censor 
sharing their views in preparatory work that is essential in the proper running of the EDPB, the risk 
that the EDPB is not able to fully achieve its tasks in the future, at least when it comes to drafting and 
adopting guidance, is reasonably foreseeable and not merely hypothetical27.  

Considering the above, and with the aim of fully complying with your Recommendation of providing 
the broadest possible access to the documents in an anonymised format, the EDPB decided to disclose 
all the drafts at issue,  including those with track changes, and only redact the information whose 
disclosure was essential to protect the fulfilment of its mission and its decision-making process.

possibility of expressing views independently within an institution helps to encourage internal discussions with 
a view to improving the functioning of that institution and contributing to the smooth running of the decision-
making process” (emphasis added). 
26 For example, the use of specific language or formulations can give an indication of the geographical location 
or mother tongue of the author of the comment, which could be an element to identify either the SA, or the 
author or both. See section 2.1.3 below.

Finally, the EDPB wishes to clarify its previous references to the need to preserve its independence28. 
The independence of the EDPB and its members is an essential element to enable the EDPB’s task of 
ensuring the consistent application of the GDPR 29 and encouraging the consistent application of the 
LED 30, as well as the SAs’ task of monitoring the application of the GDPR 31 and of  the provisions 
adopted pursuant to the LED 32. In line with this, the EDPB Rules of Procedure establish the rules on 
confidentiality of the discussions  in several situations, including when the EDPB decides so given the 
nature of the topic33. The EDPB fully agrees with the Ombudsman in that internal rules of procedure 
do not take legal precedence over a Regulation, and reassures that this was never the understanding 
nor intention of the EDPB. On the contrary, the EDPB fully abides by the obligation stemming from 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and the case law to demonstrate that the risks posed by the disclosure 
of the internal comments at hand are real, foreseeable and not purely hypothetical, in addition to 
demonstrating that there is no overriding public interest 34. The independence of the EDPB and its 
confidentiality rules are mere elements stemming from the GDPR and the EDPB’s Rules of Procedure 
which substantiate the EDPB’s views that its decision-making process may be undermined by the 
disclosure of these internal comments, given the negative effect that it may have in the independence 
of  the  EDPB  and  its  members.  Thus,  as  explained  above,  the  EDPB  took  these  aspects  into 
consideration when determining whether disclosure should be rejected on the basis of Article 4(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.   

2.1.3 The lack of an overriding public interest in disclosure of the comments 

As required by Article 4(3) Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, the assessment of the applicability of an 
exception consists of balancing the opposing interests in a given situation, which outcome shall favour 
the interest prevailing in the particular case35.  

We note that your comments on this aspect are focussing on the draft versions of Guidelines 2/2020, 
hence we  understand them as  not questioning  the EDPB’s assessment  of  whether an overriding 
interest was prevailing for the application of exceptions to the draft versions of Statement 04/2021 
and the reply to MEP in’t Veld. 

Regarding Guidelines  2/2020, the EDPB wishes  to reassure the Ombudsman36  that this  balancing 
exercise has been duly performed in this particular case. Whilst the CJEU keeps exclusive jurisdiction 
over the authoritative interpretation of EU law37, we thank you for the consideration you attach to

guidelines  adopted  by  the  EDPB. They  are indeed  a  valuable  tool  contributing  to  ensuring  the 
consistent application of the GDPR - the EDPB’s main task38. 

Concerning  the  drafts  of  Guidelines  2/2020  that  do  not  contain  any  track  changes  or  internal 
comments made by staff, the EDPB acknowledges that the interest of stakeholders in understanding 
how the EDPB’s decision-making process relating to these Guidelines 2/2020 worked, prevails. The 
same applies  to the draft versions  of these Guidelines  that contain tack changes (without internal 
comments). This is why we agree to fully disclose these documents with the complainant.  

As per the draft versions of Guidelines 2/2020 that contain track changes and internal comments made 
by staff, we also acknowledge the overriding public interest in accessing such documents with their 
track changes, for the same reasons as explained above. The EDPB considers that such disclosure is 
sufficient to enable people understanding how the EDPB’s decision-making process worked, without 
any need to access the internal comments made by  staff, which are redacted to anonymise  their 
authors, as recommended by the Ombudsman.  

On that aspect, we underline that, like the Ombudsman39, the EDPB has no knowledge of publicly 
known  dissenting  views  on  the  subject-matter addressed  by  Guidelines  2/2020, contrary  to the 
situation  arisen  for  Guidelines  2/201940. This  could  however  change  in  the  future.  Besides,  as 
explained above, simply hiding the name of the authors who made internal comments in a document 
is not an efficient method to anonymise such comments. It is true that they could appear anonymous 
at first sight 41, but the application of one or more factors specific to some members of the EDPB could 
re-identify the authors of these internal comments. 

Furthermore, the EDPB can only agree with the Ombudsman42 that personal data are important for 
citizens and businesses.  This  is precisely  why the decision-making  process  of the EDPB should  be 
protected, where  necessary,  to  ensure  consistent  application  of  the  data  protection  legislation 
throughout  the  EEA. Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  public  interest of  data protection 
overrides, in these specific  circumstances, the public  interest in disclosing  the internal comments 
made by staff. 

For the sake of clarity, the EDPB indicates that its position above also applies to the internal comments 
made by staff in the draft versions of Statement 04/2021 and of the reply to MEP in’t Veld. 

3.  Concluding remarks 

In light of the above, we consider that the EDPB has sufficiently demonstrated a specific and actual 
risk to its decision-making, and the absence of an overriding public interest in disclosure of the internal 
comments.

To conclude, we would  like to reiterate our  intention to proactively apply  the same approach as 
presented above, for  future requests  concerning revised  versions  of  documents,  where relevant, 
taking always into account the specificities of the request(s) assessed. We stand ready to review these 
arrangements regularly to ensure they remain fit for purpose. 

As requested, we are enclosing a translation into French of this reply. Please note that in order to 
provide this reply within the deadline, only a machine translation could be provided. We trust that 
you will appreciate this sincere effort and the action, under our existing constraints. Considering that 
the language of  the complaint in  case 201/2022  was English, please let us know  should  a formal 
translation be required. 

We would like to conclude by reassuring you again that the EDPB takes transparency matters very 
seriously, and will continue to do so in the future. 

 

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

 

Anu Talus
