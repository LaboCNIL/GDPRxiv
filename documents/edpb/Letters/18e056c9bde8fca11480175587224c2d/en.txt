Dear Mr. Körner,  

Brussels, 9 June 2020 

Ref: OUT2020-0053 

Thank you very much for your letter dated 6th of December 2019 in which you raise questions  on the 
TikTok application, as a follow up to media reports regarding TikTok processing of personal data. 

The EDPB is  aware of the concerns that you have  mentioned in  your letter, and has already issued 
guidelines  and  recommendations  that are to  be  taken  into  account  by  all  data  controllers  whose 
processing are subject to the GDPR, in particular when it comes to transfer of personal data to third 
countries, substantive and procedural conditions  for access to personal data by public  authorities or 
the application of the GDPR territorial scope1. On this last point, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR applies 
to the processing of personal data by a controller, even if it is not established in the Union, where the 
processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the Union. 

While the EDPB cannot comment on possible  ongoing investigations by its members, I would like to 
inform you that the EDPB has decided to establish a taskforce in order to better coordinate potential 
actions and to acquire a more comprehensive  overview of  TikTok’s processing and  practices across 
the EU. 

We thank you for your continued interest on the work of the EDPB and assure you this matter will be 
considered with the greatest attention, in particular when it comes to processing of minors’ personal 
data.  

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
