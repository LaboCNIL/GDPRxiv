Dear Ms in’t Veld,

Thank you very much for your letter dated 12 July 2019, in which you ask if the EDPB intends to publish
the full and unredacted minutes of the EDPB plenary sessions.

I am pleased to inform you that on 14 September 2020, the EDPB adopted internal guidance1, and
consequently, the minutes of that plenary meeting have been published on the EDPB website. The
minutes of future and previous plenary meetings will be published in due course.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
