Dear Mr Körner,

28 August 2020

Ref: OUT2020-0101

I refer to your letter dated 23 January 2020 outlining your concerns in relation to the use of Microsoft
365, Facebook and Instagram on school computers.

Many thanks for bringing this important topic to our attention. Information on this matter has been
forwarded to the national supervisory authorities for their consideration.

However, the EDPB is not able to comment on the activities of specific controllers and processors. The
role of the EDPB is to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR, whereas the competence to
handle complaints and launch enforcements actions lies with the national supervisory authorities. We
are confident that the GDPR and EDPB cooperation mechanisms will enable the national supervisory
authorities to work together and ensure the uniform application of the GDPR in the EEA.

We encourage controllers in the public and private sector to carefully assess the risks arising from
their processing activities and ensure compliance with the principles and obligations set out by the
GDPR, including in terms of legal basis for processing and international transfers, especially when the
processing of personal data relating to vulnerable data subjects is at stake.

Please note that the EDPB is not in a position to discuss or comment on pending procedures.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
