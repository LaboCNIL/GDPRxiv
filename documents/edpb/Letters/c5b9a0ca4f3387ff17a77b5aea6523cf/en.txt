Dear Mr. Breyer 

Brussels, 31 March 2020 

Ref: OUT2020-0024  

I would like to thank you for your email dated 22 January 2020 on the data retention case within the 
Danish national police. The Danish Data Protection Agency has informed the EDPB that it has opened 
a case investigating the matter. EDPB members will take due account of the conclusion of the Danish 
Data Protection Agency investigation. 

As regards the question on the necessity for further investigations of other Member States’ IT systems 
used in processing communications data, the EDPB notes that the false communication data in this 
case  related  to  deficiencies  in  an  internally  developed  IT  system  of  the  Danish  National  Police. 
However, the content of the case highlights the importance and the need for software to adhere to 
the principles of data protection and the obligation of Data Protection by Design and by Default. I 
would like to recall the EDPB adopted guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and 
by  Default  on  13  November  2019.  The  guideline  specifies  the  requirement  for  controllers  to 
“implement appropriate technical and organisational measures and necessary safeguards, designed 
to implement data protection principles in an effective manner and to protect the rights and freedoms 
of data subjects.” The interpretations provided in this guideline on Article 25 of the GDPR equally apply 
to Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. 

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
