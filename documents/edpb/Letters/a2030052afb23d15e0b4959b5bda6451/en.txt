Dear Mr Dănescu,

Brussels, 6 April 2021
Ref: OUT2021-00066

Let me first of all thank you for your letter of 2 December 2020 to the European Data Protection Board
(EDPB) and for the several inputs you have provided.

letter, you  raise  the importance  of

In  your 
interplay  between  the Anti- Money
Laundering/Combating  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (AML/CFT) framework  and  the General  Data
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), particularly in the context of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures
provided for by law.

the 

As you may be aware, the EDPB has recently issued a statement on the protection of personal data
processed  in  relation  with  the  prevention  of  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing1. In this
statement we acknowledge the challenging nature of the issue, (also raised in the past by the Article
29  Working  Party),  in  particular  in  respect  of  the  far-reaching  obligations  on  financial  services
providers and other obliged entities to identify and know their customers, to monitor transactions
undertaken using their services, and to report any suspicious transactions.

The EDPB realises the relevance of the points raised by the Romanian Association of Banks and is
grateful for the provided analysis. However, the concrete question raised in your letter appears to
refer to a specific cooperation procedure to be developed and applied in Romania only. As this can
relate  to  Romanian  national  law  we suggest you  to  contact  the  Romanian  Supervisory  Authority
competent  for  data  protection  (Autoritatea  Naţională de  Supraveghere  a  Prelucrării  Datelor  cu
Caracter Personal), which will be in the best position to advise you on this matter.

1 The Statement has been adopted by the Board on the 17th of December 2020 and is available at the following
link: https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_statement_20201215_aml_actionplan_en.pdf

At  the  same  time,  I  would  like  to  assure  you  that  the  Board  shall  remain  concerned  about  the
importance of ensuring the balance between the protection of personal data and the prevention of
money laundering and terrorist financing.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
