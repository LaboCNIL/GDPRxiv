RE: Concerns raised with the European Data Protection Board in relation to Airbnb

Dear Mr Körner

I refer to your letter dated 24 January 2020 outlining your concerns in relation to reports that the
Airbnb used software to screen personal data of individuals to analyse the online “personality” of
users and whether this screening was compatible with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Thank you very much for bringing this important topic to our attention. It is likely that any complaints
raised in relation to this processing will be cross-border in nature, and therefore the One-Stop-Shop
mechanism  of  the  GDPR  will  apply.  This  mechanism  ensures  that  the  lead  supervisory  authority
responsible for investigating the complaints against Airbnb cooperates and considers the input of any
concerned supervisory authorities.

The Irish Data Protection Commission is the lead supervisory authority for Airbnb. I understand that it
has already been in contact with you regarding the concerns you raised in your letter, and provided
you with additional information in relation to its engagement with Airbnb in relation to this issue.

The EDPB is not able to comment on the activities of national supervisory authorities. In addition, we
do not have the competence to launch investigations, as this competence lies exclusively with national
supervisory authorities. However, we are confident that the GDPR and EDPB cooperation mechanisms
will enable the national supervisory authorities to work together regarding these cases and ensure the
uniform application of the GDPR in the EEA.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
