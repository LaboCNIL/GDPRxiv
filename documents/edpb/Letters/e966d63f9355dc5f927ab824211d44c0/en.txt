Dear Mr Bose,  

I am writing to you  further to your e-mail addressed to the EDPB on 4 May 2020 regarding the topic 
of  administrative  arrangements for  transfers  of  data  being  negotiated between  the  EU  national 
auditor oversight bodies, members of the Committee of European Auditor Oversight Bodies (CEAOB), 
and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in the United States. 

The  EDPB  welcomes  the  CEAOB’s  efforts  to  address  this  matter in  a  coordinated  manner  by  its 
members,  with  the  setting up  of  a  dedicated  Taskforce  in  this  respect  and  also  appreciates  your 
proposal to exchange with the CEAOB on this topic.  

Regarding the two draft administrative arrangements for the two Member States you refer to in your 
e-mail, I would  like to clarify that the EDPB has been following  up informally on these two files. The 
competent Supervisory  Authorities have not yet submitted the draft administrative arrangements to 
the consistency  mechanism, pending  their finalization and  the steps  that need to  be taken first  at 
national level. Apart from these two draft administrative arrangements, auditor oversight authorities 
of  other Member States will  also have to  align their own  arrangements with the PCAOB under the 
GDPR or  should  consider  the need  to enter  into  relevant arrangements with the  PCAOB.  For  this 
reason, the intervention of the CEAOB as coordinator throughout this process will be needed in order 
to ensure the consistency of these arrangements. 

The  EDPB’s International Transfers  Subgroup  (ITS)  is  available  to  hold  an  exchange  to  clarify  any 
questions that you or your members may have regarding the EU data protection requirements related 
to  the  setting up  of  such  administrative  arrangements in  light of  the  EDPB Guidelines  2/2020  on 
articles 46.2 (a) and 46.3 (b)  relating to transfers of personal data between EEA and non-EEA public 
authorities. If the CEAOB and its members deem so appropriate and that it would be beneficial for its 
work ahead you  could invite the PCAOB to such an exchange between the CEOB and the EDPB’s ITS 
subgroup.  

I suggest that your team liaises  with the ITS subgroup  coordinators regarding the organization and 
practical
