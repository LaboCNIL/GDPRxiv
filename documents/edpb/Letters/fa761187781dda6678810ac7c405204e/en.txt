Dear Mr. Libby,  

24 April 2020 

Ref: OUT2020-0029 

Thank you for your letter dated 9 April 2020 raising a question on the transfer of personal data for the 
purpose of scientific research and the development of vaccines and treatments to combat COVID-19 
on the basis of the “important public interest” derogation in Article 49 (1) (d) of the GDPR.  

I  am  pleased  to  inform  you  that  the  European  Data  Protection  Board  adopted  guidelines  on  the 
processing of data concerning health for the purpose of scientific research in the context of the COVID-
19 outbreak on 21 April 2020, which address the question raised in your letter.  

Therefore, I kindly invite you to read our Guidelines 03/2020, in particular Section 7 on international 
data  transfers,  available  via  the  following 
link:  https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-
documents/guidelines/guidelines-032020-processing-data-concerning-health-purpose_en. 

As expressed in these guidelines, the GDPR does allow for meaningful collaboration between EEA and 
non-EEA public health authorities and research institutions in the search for vaccines and treatments 
against COVID-19, while simultaneously protecting the fundamental right to data protection in the 
EEA.  

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
