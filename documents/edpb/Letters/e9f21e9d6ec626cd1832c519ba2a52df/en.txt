To whom it may concern 

On July 23rd 2021, you addressed a letter to the EDPB calling for a consistent interpretation of cookie 
consent requirement by the EDPB to which the EDPB acknowledged receipt. On October 27th, 2021, 
you addressed a follow-up letter renewing your concerns. 

First and foremost, I thank you for these two letters that I reviewed with great attention.  

Please rest assured that the EDPBâ€˜s aim is to ensure the harmonised application of data protection 
rules throughout the European Union. To this end, the Board promotes the consistent interpretation 
of consent requirements in the context of cookies among the data protection authorities. I also take 
the opportunity to assure you that neither the EDPB nor its members have any interest or intention 
to deviate from the text, spirit or intent of the e-privacy legal framework and the GDPR.  

In this respect, and as you mentioned in your latest letter, the EDPB established a taskforce on cookie 
banners.  Lastly,  and  as  you  are  aware  of,  the  EDPB  guidelines  on  consent  have  been  updated  (by 
Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 2016/679) in order to ensure a harmonized approach 
on to the conditionality of consent and on the unambiguous indication of wishes.  

 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
