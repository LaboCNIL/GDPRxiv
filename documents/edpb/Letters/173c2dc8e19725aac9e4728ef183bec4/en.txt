Dear Mr Lehagre and Mr Wellens, 

 Brussels, 4 November 2022 

Ref: OUT2022-0074 

Thank you for your letter of 13 April 2022 regarding  the processing of personal data based on the 
obligations stemming from the intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) implementing the US Foreign 
Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and your subsequent analysis on the interplay of the IGAs with 
the GDPR. 

In  your  letter,  you  call  upon  the  EDPB  and  EU  supervisory  authorities  to take  immediate  action  in 
respect of possible inconsistencies of IGAs with data protection principles set forth in the GDPR. 

As already highlighted by the EDPB on other occasions, assessing the compatibility of the different 
IGAs implementing FATCA with the GDPR is not in the competence of the EDPB. 

According to Article 70, paragraph 1 a) of the GDPR, the EDPB shall monitor and ensure the correct 
application of the GDPR in the cases provided for in Articles 64 and 65, without prejudice to the tasks 
of the EU supervisory authorities. The EDPB, as an independent European body, does not constitute a 
supranational institution, monitoring the work of the EU supervisory authorities in individual cases, 
which are subject to their territorial powers, and the EDPB has no competence to take decisions in 
their place.  

Hence, it is up to the competent supervisory authorities to monitor and enforce, where necessary, the 
relevant GDPR provisions and to provide information upon request on their ongoing proceedings to 
the extent possible according to their national procedural law.  

Further,  the  EDPB  (preceded  by  its  precursor  the  Article  29  Working  Party)  took  position  on  the 
automatic exchanges of personal data for tax purposes including FATCA, on several occasions.  

More recently, in the light of the task of ensuring a consistent application of the GDPR as provided for 
by Article 70 GDPR and considering the existence of data protection aspects common to the different 
Member States, the supervisory authorities engaged in a common effort to identify questions which 
could be addressed  to their respective competent national authorities  concerning the consistency of 
IGAs with GDPR principles (including accountability, purpose limitation, proportionality and rules on 
data transfers that you specifically mentioned in your letter).  

 

 

 

 

In the hope of having reassured you on the continuous attention paid by the EDPB and the supervisory 
authorities on the interplay between the processing based on the obligations stemming from the IGAs 
implementing  FATCA  and  the  GDPR,  I  thank  you  again  for  your  consideration  regarding  the  data 
protection implications of the automatic exchanges of personal data for tax purposes and the activity 
of the EDPB on that matter. 

Yours sincerely, 

 

Andrea Jelinek
