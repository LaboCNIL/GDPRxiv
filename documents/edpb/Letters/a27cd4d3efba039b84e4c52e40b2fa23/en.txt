Dear Ms in ‘t Veld,

Brussels, 07 July 2021
Ref: OUT2021-0119

I would like to thank you for your letter of 28 May 2021 regarding the EDPB’s statement 04/2021 on
international agreements including transfers and for the questions raised.

As highlighted in the abovementioned statement, the EDPB deems that, in order to ensure that the
level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) is not undermined when personal data is transferred outside
the Union, consideration should be given to the aim of bringing international agreements involving
the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations (also those related to
FATCA) in line with the GDPR and LED requirements for data transfers where this is not yet the case.

Indeed,  based  on  Article  96  of  the  GDPR  and  Article  61  of  the  Law  Enforcement  Directive,  such
agreements concluded prior to 24 May 2016 or 6 May 2016 and which comply with Union law as
applicable prior to that date, shall remain in force until amended, replaced or revoked. Therefore, the
EDPB considered such a statement as a useful reminder and invitation for Member States to review
such agreements, where needed, and align them with the current European data protection legal
framework.

Beforehand, the EDPB has adopted Guidelines 2/2020 on articles 46 (2) (a) and 46 (3) (b) of Regulation
2016/679 for transfers of personal data between EEA and non-EEA public authorities and bodies in
December 2020. These Guidelines set forth the standard regarding safeguards to be included in legally
binding instruments or administrative arrangements between public bodies and are aimed at ensuring
a consistent application of the GDPR in all Member States in line with the competences of the EDPB.

Against  this  background,  I  would  like  to  stress  again  that  the  EDPB  does  not  have  the  same
competences, tasks and powers as national supervisory authorities (SAs) and, therefore, it is up to the
latter to monitor and enforce, where necessary, the protection of personal data of data subjects within
their jurisdiction. Also to this aim, the above mentioned statement clarifies that national SAs, are
available to assist Member States in this exercise, keeping in mind however that Article 46(2).(a) GDPR
does not refer to the need for the competent SA to authorise such kind of agreements.

In  fact, one  SA  has  received  a  complaint  regarding  the 
law  applicable  to  the  national
intergovernmental agreement transposing FATCA and some SAs have already started discussions with
their relevant Ministries regarding the review of such international agreements and the safeguards to
be included in the new ones they are planning to conclude which is a long process. These bilateral
discussions will take into consideration the abovementioned EDPB Guidelines 2/2020 on articles 46
(2) (a) and 46 (3) (b) of Regulation 2016/679 so as to ensure that consistent safeguards will be inserted
in the reviewed agreements and the new ones that will be adopted.

Yours sincerely,

Andrea Jelinek
