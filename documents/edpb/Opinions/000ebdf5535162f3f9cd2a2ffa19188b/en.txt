The European Data Protection Board

Having  regard  to Article 63, Article 64(1)(f)  and Article 47 of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the
European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”),

Having regard to the European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) Agreement and in particular to
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  joint  Committee  No
154/2018 of 6 July 20181,

Having regard to Articles 10 and 22 of its Rules of Procedure.

Whereas:

(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “EDPB”) is to ensure the
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it follows from Article 64(1)(f)
GDPR that the EDPB shall issue an opinion where a supervisory authority (hereinafter “SA”) aims to
approve binding corporate rules (hereinafter “BCRs”) within the meaning of Article 47 GDPR.

(2) The EDPB  welcomes  and  acknowledges  the  efforts  the  companies  make  to  uphold  the  GDPR
standards in a global environment. Building on the experience under Directive 95/46/EC, the EDPB
affirms the important role of BCRs to frame international transfers and its commitment to support the
companies in setting-up their BCRs. This opinion aims towards this objective and takes into account
that the GDPR strengthened the level of protection, as reflected in the requirements of Article 47
GDPR, and conferred to the EDPB the task to issue an opinion on the competent SA’s (BCRs Lead) draft
decision aiming to approve BCRs. This task of the EDPB aims to ensure the consistent application of
the GDPR, including by the SAs, controllers, and processors.

(3) Pursuant to Article 46(1) GDPR, in the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) GDPR, a
controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation only
if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable
data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. A group of undertakings
or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity may provide such safeguards by the use
of legally binding BCRs, which expressly confer enforceable rights on data subjects and fulfil a series of
requirements (Article 46 GDPR). The specific requirements listed in the GDPR are the minimum items
BCRs shall specify (Article 47(2) GDPR). The BCRs are subject to approval from the competent SA, in
accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63 and Article 64(1)(f) GDPR, provided
that the BCRs meet the conditions set out in Article 47 GDPR, together with the requirements set out
in the relevant working documents of the Article 29 Working Party2, endorsed by the EDPB.

1 References to “Member States” made throughout this opinion should be understood as references to “EEA
Member States”.
2 The Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data instituted
by Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC.

(4) This opinion only covers EDPB’s consideration that the BCRs submitted for the required opinion
afford appropriate safeguards in that they meet all requirements of Article 47 GDPR and WP256 rev01
of the Article 29 Working Party, as endorsed by the EDPB3. Accordingly, this opinion and the SAs’ review
do not address elements and obligations of the GDPR mentioned in the BCRs at issue other than those
related to Article 47 GDPR.

(5) WP256 rev.01 of the Article 29 Working Party, as endorsed by the EDPB, provides for the required
elements  for  BCRs  for  controllers (hereinafter  “BCR-C”), including  the  Intra-Company  Agreement
where applicable, and the application form. WP264 of the Article 29 Working Party, as endorsed by
the EDPB, provides for recommendations to the applicants to help them demonstrate how to meet
the requirements of Article 47 GDPR and WP256 rev01. Additionally, WP264 informs the applicants
that any documentation submitted is subject to access to documents requests in accordance with the
SAs’ national laws. The EDPB is subject to Regulation 1049/20014 pursuant to Article 76(2) GDPR.

(6) Taking into account the specific characteristics of BCRs provided for by Article 47(1) and (2) GDPR,
each application should be addressed individually and is without prejudice to the assessment of any
other BCRs. The EDPB recalls that BCRs should be customised to take account of the structure of the
group of companies that they apply to, the processing they undertake, and the policies and procedures
that they have in place to protect personal data5.

(7) The opinion of the EDPB shall be adopted, pursuant to Article 64(3) GDPR in conjunction with
Article 10(2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure, within eight weeks after the Chair has decided that the
file is complete. Upon decision of the EDPB Chair, this period may be extended by a further six weeks,
taking into account the complexity of the subject matter.

The draft BCR-C of Novelis Group applies to the transfers and processing of personal data from EU to
third countries carried out by Novelis Group companies.6

Concerned data subjects include current and former employees, job applicants, customers, suppliers,
contractors and contact persons.

The draft BCR-C of Novelis Group have been scrutinised according to the procedures set up by the
EDPB. The SAs assembled within the EDPB have concluded that the Novelis Group draft BCRs-C contain
all elements required under Article 47 GDPR and WP256 rev01, in concordance with the draft decision
of the BCR Lead SA submitted to the EDPB for an opinion. Therefore, the EDPB does not have any
concerns that need to be addressed.

3 CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS

Taking into account the above and the commitments that the group members will undertake by signing
the Binding Corporate Rules for Novelis Group, the EDPB considers that the draft decision of the BCR
Lead SA may be adopted as it is, since the draft BCR-C of Novelis contain appropriate safeguards to
ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined when
personal data will be transferred to and processed by the group members based in third countries.
Finally, the EDPB also recalls the provisions contained within Article 47(2)(k) GDPR and WP256 rev.01
providing the conditions under which the applicant may modify or update the BCRs, including updates
to the list of BCRs group members.

4 FINAL REMARKS

This opinion is addressed to the BCR Lead SA and will be made public pursuant to Article 64(5)(b) GDPR.

According to Article 64(7) and (8) GDPR, the BCR Lead SA shall communicate its response to this opinion
to the Chair within two weeks after receiving the opinion.

Pursuant to Article 70(1)(y) GDPR, the BCR Lead SA shall communicate the final decision to the EDPB
for inclusion in the register of decisions which have been subject to the consistency mechanism.

In accordance with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union C-311/187, it is the
responsibility of the data exporter in a Member State, if needed with the help of the data importer, to
assess whether the level of protection required by EU law is respected in the third country concerned,
in order to determine if the guarantees provided by BCRs can be complied with in practice, taking into
consideration the possible interference created by the third country legislation with the fundamental
rights. If this is not the case, the data exporter in a Member State, if needed with the help of the data
importer, should assess whether they can provide supplementary measures to ensure an essentially
equivalent level of protection as provided in the EU.
