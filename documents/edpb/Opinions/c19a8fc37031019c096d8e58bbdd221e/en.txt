The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 70(1)(s) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter 
“GDPR”),  

Having regard to the European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) Agreement and in particular to 
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  joint  Committee  No 
154/2018 of 6 July 20181,  

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure,  

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION:  

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The European Commission endorsed its draft implementing decision (hereinafter “draft decision”) 
on the adequate protection of personal data by the United Kingdom (hereinafter “UK”) pursuant to 
the GDPR on 19 February 20212. Following this, the European Commission initiated the procedure 
for its formal adoption.  

On the same date, the European Commission asked for the opinion of the European Data Protection 
Board  (hereinafter  “EDPB”)3.  The  EDPB’s  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the  level  of  protection 
afforded in the UK has been made on the basis of the examination of the draft decision itself, as well 
as on the basis of an analysis of the documentation made available by the European Commission.  

The EDPB focused on the assessment of both the general GDPR aspects of the draft decision and on 
the access by public authorities to personal data transferred from the EEA for the purposes of law 
enforcement and national security, including the legal remedies available to individuals in the EEA. 
The EDPB also assessed whether the safeguards provided under the UK legal framework are in place 
and effective.  

The  EDPB  has  used  as  main  reference  for  this  work  its  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential4  adopted  in 
February 2018 and the EPDB Recommendations 02/2020 on the European Essential Guarantees for 
surveillance measures5.

1.1. Areas of convergence  

5. 

6. 

The EDPB’s key objective is to give an opinion to the European Commission on the adequacy of the 
level of protection afforded to individuals in the UK. It is important to recognise that the EDPB does 
not expect the UK legal framework to replicate European data protection law.  

However, the EDPB recalls that, to be considered as providing an adequate level of protection, Article 
45 GDPR and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter “CJEU”) require 
the third country’s legislation to be aligned with the essence of the fundamental principles enshrined 
in the GDPR. The UK data protection framework is largely based on the EU data protection framework 
(in particular the GDPR and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council, 
hereinafter “EU Law Enforcement Directive” or “LED”) which derives from the fact that the UK was a 
Member State of the EU up until 31 January 2020. Moreover, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, which 
came into force on 23 May 2018 and repealed the UK Data Protection Act 1998, further specifies the 
application of the GDPR in UK law, in addition to transposing the EU Law Enforcement Directive, as 
well as granting powers and imposing duties on the national data protection supervisory authority, 
the UK Information Commissioner's Office (hereinafter “ICO”). Therefore the EDPB recognises that 
the UK has mirrored, for the most part, the GDPR in its data protection framework. 

7.  When analysing the law and practice of a third country which has been a Member State of the EU 
until recently, it is evident that the EDPB has identified many aspects to be essentially equivalent. 

8. 

9. 

In the area of data protection, the EDPB notes that there is a strong alignment between the GDPR 
framework and the UK legal framework on certain core provisions such as, for example, concepts 
(e.g., “personal data”; “processing of personal data”; “data controller”); grounds for lawful and fair 
processing  for  legitimate  purposes;  purpose  limitation;  data  quality  and  proportionality;  data 
retention, security and  confidentiality;  transparency;  special  categories  of  data;  direct  marketing; 
automated decision making and profiling.  

1.2. Challenges  

The United Kingdom was until recently a Member State of the EU; therefore, when analysing its law 
and practice, the EDPB has identified many aspects to be essentially equivalent. At the same time, in 
view of its role in the process of adopting an adequacy finding but also the time constraints, the EDPB 
has decided to focus its attention to those aspects where it considers that there is a need for closer 
look and more detailed scrutiny. 

10.  Nonetheless,  challenges  remain  and  the  EDPB  considers  the  following  items  should  be  further 
assessed to ensure that the essentially equivalent level of protection is met, and should be closely 
monitored in the UK by the European Commission.  

1.2.1. General  

11. 

The first challenge, a general one, relates to the monitoring of the evolution of the UK legal system 
on data protection as a whole. Indeed, the UK Government has indicated its intention to develop 
separate and independent policies in data protection with a possible will to diverge from EU data 
protection  law.  Such  political  declarations  have  not  materialised  yet  in  the  UK  legal  framework. 
However,  this  possible  future  divergence  might create  risks  for  the  maintenance  of  the  level  of 
protection  provided  to  personal  data  transferred  from  the  EU.  Therefore,  the  European 
Commission is invited to closely monitor such evolutions from the entry into force of its adequacy 

Adopted

decision  and  take  necessary  actions  including  by  amending  and/or  suspending  the  decision  if 
necessary.  

1.2.2. General data protection aspects 

12. 

13. 

14. 

15. 

First, the so-called ‘immigration exemption’, laid down under Schedule 2 to the Data Protection Act 
2018, Part 1, paragraph 4, is ‘broadly’ formulated. In particular, it also applies in case personal data 
are not collected for the purpose of immigration control by a controller, but are made available by 
the latter to another controller who processes such personal data for the purpose of immigration 
control. 

The EDPB invites the European Commission to verify the state of play of the proceedings Open Rights 
Group & Anor, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2019] 
EWHC  2562  (Admin)  and,  since  this  judgment  is  not  final  (res  judicata),  to  verify  whether  it  is 
confirmed or reviewed by the appeal judgment, taking any update in this regard into account, and 
specifying it in the  decision.  The EDPB calls also on the European Commission to provide in the 
adequacy decision further information on the immigration exemption6, in particular in relation to 
the necessity and proportionality of such broad exemption in UK law, notably having regard to the 
broad  scope  of  application  ratione  personae.  At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  invites  the  European 
Commission  to  further  explore  whether additional  safeguards  exist  in  the UK  legal  framework or 
could be envisaged, for instance through legally binding instruments that would complement the 
immigration exemption by enhancing its foreseeability and the safeguards for the data subjects, also 
allowing for a better and prompt assessment and monitoring of the necessity and proportionality 
requirements.  

Second, although the EDPB recognises that the UK has mirrored, for the most part, Chapter V GDPR 
in its data protection framework, the EDPB has identified certain aspects of the UK legal framework 
with  regard  to  onward  transfers  that  might  undermine  the  level  of  protection  of  personal  data 
transferred from the EEA. 

Indeed, Article 44 GDPR7 provides that transfers and onward transfers of personal data shall only 
take place if the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined. 
This means that not only the UK legislation shall be “essentially equivalent” to the EU legislation 
with regard to the processing of personal data transferred to the UK under the future adequacy 
decision, but also that the rules applicable in the UK with regard to the onward transfer of those 
data to third countries shall ensure that an essentially equivalent level of protection will continue 
to be provided.  

                                                      
6 Also as outcome of the ongoing review of the use of the immigration exemption referred to at p. 5 of the UK 
Government’s Explanatory Framework for Adequacy Discussions, Section E3: Schedule 2 Restrictions, 13 March 
2020,  
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/872232
/E_-_Narrative_on_Restrictions.pdf. 
7 “Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer 
to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of 
this Regulation, the conditions  laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the Controller and processor, 
including  for  onward  transfers  of  personal  data  from  the  third  country  or  an  international  organisation  to 
another third country or to another international organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in 
order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.”

16.  Although the EDPB notes the capacity of the UK, under its legal framework, to recognise territories 
as providing an adequate level of data protection in light of the UK data protection framework, the 
EDPB wishes to highlight that these territories might not benefit, to date, from an adequacy decision 
issued by the European Commission and ensure a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to that 
guaranteed in the EEA. This might lead to possible risks in the protection provided to personal data 
transferred from the EEA especially if, in the future, the UK data protection framework deviates from 
the EU acquis. In addition, the UK has already recognised as adequate the third countries that enjoy 
an adequacy finding by the European Commission under Directive 95/46/EC8, while the European 
Commission will soon review these findings, and the conclusions of this review are not yet known.  

17. 

For the above situations, the European Commission should fulfil its monitoring role, and in case 
the  essentially  equivalent  level  of  protection  of  personal  data  transferred  from  the  EEA  is  not 
maintained,  the  European  Commission  should  consider  amending  the  adequacy  decision  to 
introduce specific safeguards for data transferred from the EEA and/or to suspend the adequacy 
decision.  

18.  Regarding international agreements concluded between the UK and third countries, the European 
Commission is invited to examine the interplay between the UK data protection framework and its 
international commitments, beyond the Agreement on access to electronic data for the purpose of 
countering  serious  crime  concluded  between  UK  and  the  United  States  of  America  (hereinafter 
“US”)9 (hereinafter ʺUK-US CLOUD Act Agreementʺ), in particular to ensure the continuity of the level 
of protection where  personal data  are transferred from the EU to the  UK on the  basis of the UK 
adequacy  decision,  and  then  onward  transferred  to  other  third  countries;  and  to  continuously 
monitor  and  take  action,  where  necessary,  in  the  event  that  the  conclusion  of  international 
agreements  between  the  UK  and  third  countries  risks  to  undermine  the  level  of  protection  of 
personal data provided for in the EU. 

19. 

Furthermore,  the  European  Commission  is  invited  to  monitor  whether  the  UK-US  CLOUD  Act 
Agreement ensures appropriate additional safeguards, taking into account the level of sensitivity of 
the categories of data concerned and the sole requirements of the transfer of electronic evidence 
directly  by  service  providers  rather  than  between  authorities,  also  assessing  under  which 
circumstances safeguards may be provided by an appropriate implementation of the adaptation of 
the EU-US Umbrella Agreement10.  

20. 

Further,  the  EDPB  notes  that  onward  transfers  can  also  take  place  from  the  UK  to  another  third 
country  based  on  transfer  tools  pursuant  to  the  UK  applicable  data  protection  legislation11. 
Following Schrems II12, the EDPB invites the European Commission to provide reassurances in the 

                                                      
8 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of 
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 
23.11.1995, p. 31).

adequacy decision that necessary safeguards will be effectively put in place taking also into account 
the legislation of the receiving third country.   

21.  Concerning the absence of protections provided under Article 48 GDPR in the UK legislation, the 
EDPB invites the European Commission to provide further assurances and specific references to the 
UK legislation that ensure that the level of protection under the UK legal framework is essentially 
equivalent to the level of protection guaranteed in the EEA. 

22.  With regard to procedural and enforcement mechanisms, the EDPB notes that the existence and 
effective functioning of an independent supervisory authority; the existence of a system ensuring a 
good  level  of  compliance;  and  a  system  of  access  to  appropriate  redress  mechanisms  equipping 
individuals in the EEA with the means to exercise their rights and seek redress without encountering 
cumbersome  barriers  to  administrative  and  judicial  redress  are  key  elements  a  data  protection 
framework consistent with the European one must be characterized by. 

23. 

The EDPB acknowledges that the UK has mirrored in most parts the relevant provisions of the GDPR 
in  the  UK  GDPR  and  in  the  Data  Protection  Act  2018;  nevertheless,  the  European  Commission  is 
invited to continuously monitor any developments in the UK legal framework and practice, which 
might lead to detrimental impacts on those areas. 

1.2.3. On the access by public authorities to data transferred to the UK  

24. 

25. 

26. 

The  EDPB  notes  the  significant  changes  in  the  UK  legal  framework  applicable  to  security  and 
intelligence agencies, especially regarding the interception and acquisition of communication data. 
The EDPB understands that  these  changes  are,  inter alia, a response  to the proceedings initiated 
before the CJEU and the European Court on Human Rights (hereinafter “ECtHR”) and their recent 
judgments in this context. 

In  particular,  the  EDPB  welcomes  the  fact  that  the  UK  has  established  the  Investigatory  Powers 
Tribunal (hereinafter “IPT”). The IPT is not only competent to hear cases on the use of investigatory 
powers  by  law  enforcement  authorities,  but  also  by  intelligence  services.  It  is  therefore  the 
understanding  of  the  EDPB  that  the  IPT  functions  as  a  proper  court  in  the meaning  of  Article  47 
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (hereinafter “EU Charter”).  

Furthermore,  the  EDPB  positively  notes  the  introduction  of  “Judicial  Commissioners”  in  the 
Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (hereinafter “IPA 2016”) as a significant improvement. It understands 
that an important function of the Judicial Commissioners is to approve ex ante in individual cases 
different  surveillance  measures, 
interception  and  bulk  acquisition  of 
communication data (so-called “double lock” procedure).  

including  targeted 

27.  However, in order to assess the effectiveness of this additional level of oversight, the EDPB sees the 
need to further clarification of the scenarios for which a lawful interception without approval by the 
Investigatory Powers Commissioner (hereinafter “IPC”) or the Judicial Commissioners is possible, and 
invites the European Commission to further assess and demonstrate that, even in cases where the 
double-lock procedure does not apply, the UK legal framework provides for appropriate safeguards, 
including  through  effective  ex  post  oversight  and  redress  possibilities  offered  to  individuals,  thus 
ensuring a level of protection which is essentially equivalent to the one provided within the EU. 

28. 

Furthermore,  the  EDPB  invites  the  European  Commission  to  further  assess  the  conditions  under 
which urgency can be invoked, and provide clarifications concerning the possible avenues for the 
exercise of rights for the data subjects concerned and possible redress avenues offered to them in

32. 

the  context  of  equipment  interference  operations,  especially  in  the  case  of  a  derogation  to  the 
double-lock procedure. 

In addition, the EDPB considers that there is a need for further clarification and assessment of bulk 
interceptions, in particular on the selection and application of the selectors, in order to clarify the 
extent to which access to personal data meets the threshold set by the CJEU, and which safeguards 
are  in  place  to  protect  the  fundamental  rights  of  individuals  whose  data  are  intercepted  in  this 
context,  including  concerning  the  retention  periods  of  data.  An  independent  assessment  from 
competent UK oversight authorities would be particularly useful. The EDPB also underlines that it 
seems all the more critical that “overseas-related communications” which are within the scope of 
bulk interception practices appear to imply that data could be directly intercepted and collected in 
bulk within the EU by the UK, including for data in transit between the EU and the UK, which would 
fall within the scope of the draft decision. Given the importance of this aspect, the EDPB calls on the 
European Commission to closely monitor developments in this regard. 

Still in relation to bulk interception, the EDPB stresses the consistent assessment by the ECtHR and 
the CJEU,  and recalls the  concerns expressed in relation to secondary  data, which should benefit 
from  specific  safeguards  due  to  their  sensitivity.  The  EDPB  therefore  calls  on  the  European 
Commission to carefully assess whether the safeguards provided under UK law for such category of 
personal data ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection to the one guaranteed in the EEA. 

In this context, the EDPB is aware of the fact that the 2016 Intelligence and Security Committee’s 
public  report  concerning  the  use  of  bulk  powers13  concerns  practices  under  the  previous  legal 
framework,  which  was  subsequently  replaced  by  the  IPA  2016.  Nevertheless,  it  sees  a  need  for 
further  independent  assessment  and  oversight  of  the  use  of  automated  processing  tools  by  the 
competent UK oversight authorities, and calls on the European Commission to further assess this 
issue and the safeguards that would and/or could be afforded to EEA data subjects in this context. 

The EDPB shares the view expressed by the IPC that further review and monitoring are needed to 
ensure  that  the  safeguards,  applied  in  practice  by  competent  authorities  in  the  field  of  national 
security and intelligence to remedy incompliances with the application of the relevant legislation, 
are  maintained  and  will  continue  to  be  improved.  The  EDPB  also  welcomes  the  fact  that 
consequently, the IPC conducted a review of its approach to inspecting bulk interception in 2019, 
“which included a careful review of the technically complex ways in which bulk interception is actually 
implemented” and committed to include “a detailed examination of the selectors and search criteria 
alluded to above by the ECtHR” in the inspections of bulk interception from 2020 onwards. Given the 
importance of  this  aspect,  the  EDPB  is  concerned  that  detailed  examination of  the  selectors  and 
search criteria has not been carried out yet by the IPC, and calls on the European Commission to 
closely monitor developments in this regard, especially since the concrete format of such oversight 
remains to be clarified. 

33. 

The EDPB underlines that, when it comes to overseas disclosures, the application of national security 
exemption provided under UK law may lead to the absence of safeguards ensuring that the principles 
of  purpose  limitation,  necessity  and  proportionality  would  also  be  respected  or  foreseeing  that 
sufficient rights of the individuals, oversight and redress would also be provided or respected in the 
third country of destination. The EDPB therefore recommends the European Commission to further

examine  the  overall  safeguards  provided  under  UK  law  when  it  comes  to  overseas  disclosure,  in 
particular in light of the application of national security exemptions. 

34. 

Finally, the EDPB is concerned about other forms of information sharing and disclosures, on the basis 
of other instruments, in particular the various international agreements concluded by the UK with 
other third countries, especially where these instruments remain inaccessible to the public, such as 
the UK-US Communication Intelligence  Agreement. The  effect of such agreement  could lead to a 
circumvention  of  the  safeguards  identified  in  relation  to  the  access  and  use  of  personal  data  for 
national  security  purposes.  The  EDPB  considers  that  the  conclusion  of  bilateral  or  multilateral 
agreements with third countries for the purpose of intelligence cooperation, providing a legal basis 
for  direct  interception  and  acquisition  of  personal  data  or  the  transfer of  personal  data  to  these 
countries may also significantly affect the conditions for further use of the information collected, 
since such agreements are likely to affect the UK data protection legal framework as assessed. 

1.3. Conclusion  

35. 

The EDPB considers that the UK adequacy assessment is unique because of the previous status of 
the  UK  as  an  EU  Member  State.  Besides,  it  would  also  be  the  first  adequacy  decision  including  a 
sunset clause. 

36.  Accordingly,  the  EDPB  recognises  many  areas  of  convergence  between  the  UK  and  the  EU  data 
protection frameworks. At the same time, however, and following a careful analysis of the European 
Commission’s draft decision and the UK data protection legislation, the EDPB has identified a number 
of challenges, which are examined extensively in this opinion. In this context, the EDPB wishes to 
emphasise  the  paramount  role  of  the  European  Commission  on  the  monitoring  of  all  relevant 
developments in the UK.  

37. 

In light of the above, the EDPB recommends the European Commission to address the challenges 
raised in this opinion. The EDPB also invites the European Commission to monitor closely all relevant 
developments  in  the  UK  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  essential  equivalence  of  the  level  of 
protection of personal data, and to take swiftly appropriate actions, where necessary.  

2. INTRODUCTION 

2.1. UK data protection framework  

38. 

The  UK  data  protection  framework  is  largely  based  on  the  EU  data  protection  framework  (in 
particular the GDPR and the LED), which derives from the fact that the UK was a Member State of 
the EU up until 31 January 2020. Moreover, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, which came into force 
on 23 May 2018 and repealed the UK Data Protection Act 1998, further specifies the application of 
the GDPR in UK law, in addition to transposing the EU Law Enforcement Directive, as well as granting 
powers and imposing duties on the national data protection supervisory authority, the UK ICO.  

39.  As mentioned in recital 12 of the European Commission’s draft decision, the UK Government enacted 
the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which incorporates directly applicable EU legislation into 
the law of the UK. Under this Act, the ministers of the UK have the power to introduce secondary 
legislation,  via  statutory  instruments,  to  make  the  necessary  modifications  to  retained  EU  law 
following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU to fit the domestic context.  

Adopted

40.  Consequently,  the  relevant  legal  framework  applicable  in  the  UK  after  the  end  of  the  transition 

period14 consists of: 

- 

- 

the  United  Kingdom  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (hereinafter  “UK  GDPR”),  as 
incorporated  into  the  law  of  the  UK  under  the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018,  as 
amended by the DPPEC (Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendment 
Etc.) (EU Exit)) Regulations 2019;  

the Data Protection Act 2018 (hereinafter “DPA 2018”), as amended by the DPPEC Regulations 
2019, and the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU 
Exit) Regulations 2020; and 

- 

the IPA 2016. 

(together “the UK Data Protection Framework”). 

2.2. Scope of the EDPB’s assessment  

41. 

The  draft  decision  of  the  European  Commission  is  the  result  of  an  assessment  of  the  UK  Data 
Protection Framework, followed by discussions with the UK Government. In accordance with Article 
70(1)(s)  GDPR,  the  EDPB  is  expected  to  provide  an  independent  opinion  on  the  European 
Commission’s findings, identify insufficiencies in the adequacy framework, if any, and endeavour to 
make proposals to address these.  

42.  As  mentioned  in  the  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential:  “the  information  provided  by  the  European 
Commission  should  be  exhaustive  and  put  the  EDPB  in  a  position  to  make  an  own  assessment 
regarding the level of data protection in the third country”15.  

43. 

In  this  regard,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  the EDPB  only  partially  received  documents  relevant  for  the 
examination of the UK legal framework on time. The EDPB received most part of the UK legislation 
referred to in the draft decision through links referenced in the latter. The European Commission 
was not in a position to provide the EDPB with written explanations and commitments from the UK 
in relation to the exchanges between the UK authorities and the European Commission relevant to 
this exercise16.  

                                                      
14 The transition period is set for 31 December 2020, after which date EU law no longer applies in the UK. The 
“bridge  period”  is  set  for  30  June  2021  at  the  latest,  and  refers  to  the  additional  period  during  which 
transmission of personal data from the EEA to the UK is not deemed a transfer.  
15 See WP254 rev.01, p. 3. 
16  With  regard  to:  Article  48  GDPR  (footnote  78  of  the  draft  decision);  enhanced  safeguards  and  security 
measures applied by controllers  when processing in the national security context  (footnote 64 of the draft 
decision); to the requirement for the controller to consider whether there is a need to rely on the exemption 
on a case-by-case basis even where a national security certificate has been issued (recital 126 and footnote 
172 of the draft  decision); the fact that the protections of the EU-US  Umbrella Agreement  will apply to all 
personal  information  produced  or  preserved  under  the  UK-US  CLOUD  Act  Agreement,  irrespective  of  the 
nature or type of body making the request, with regard to the details of the concrete implementation of the 
data protection safeguards which are still subject to discussions between the UK and the US, the confirmation 
that UK authorities will only let this Agreement enter into force once they are satisfied that its implementation 
complies with the legal obligations provided therein, including clarity with respect to compliance with the data 
protection standards for any data requested under this Agreement (recital 153 of the draft decision); situations 
where data are transferred from the EU to the UK within the scope of this draft decision, and the fact that 
there would always be a “British Islands connection” and any equipment interference covering such data would

44. 

Taking into account the above, and due to the limited timeframe (2 months) afforded to the EDPB to 
adopt  this opinion,  the  EDPB  has chosen  to  focus on  some  specific  points  presented  in  the  draft 
decision and provide its analysis and opinion on them.  

45.  When analysing the law and practice of a third country which has been a Member State of the EU 
until recently, it is evident that the EDPB has identified many aspects to be essentially equivalent. In 
view of its role in the process of adopting an adequacy finding and the amount of law and practice 
to be analysed, the EDPB has decided to focus its attention to those aspects where it saw the greatest 
need to look closer. In addition, in line with the jurisprudence of the CJEU, a very important part of 
the analysis covers the legal regime of national security access to the personal data transferred to 
the UK, and the practice of the national security apparatus in the UK. However, it has to be borne in 
mind that national security is evidently an area of law and practice where the legislation of Member 
States is not harmonised at EU level and therefore may differ. 

46. 

The EDPB took into account the applicable European data protection framework, including Articles 
7,  8  and  47    EU  Charter,  respectively  protecting  the  right  to  private  and  family  life,  the  right  to 
protection of personal data, and the right to an effective remedy and fair trial; and Article 8 of the 
European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  (hereinafter  “ECHR”),  protecting  the  right  to  private  and 
family life. In addition to the above, the EDPB considered the requirements of the GDPR, as well as 
the relevant case-law.  

47.  The  objective  of  this  exercise  is  to  provide  the  European  Commission  with  an  opinion  on  the 
assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection in the UK. The concept of “adequate level of 
protection”,  which  already  existed  under  Directive  95/46/EC,  has  been  further  developed  by  the 
CJEU. It is important to recall the standard set by the CJEU in Schrems I, namely that – while the “level 
of protection” in the third country must be “essentially equivalent” to that guaranteed in the EU – 
“the means to which that third country has recourse, in this connection, for the purpose of such a 
level of protection may differ from those employed within the EU”17. Therefore, the objective is not 
to  mirror  point  by  point  the  European  legislation,  but  to  establish  the  essential  and  core 
requirements  of  the  legislation  under  examination.  Adequacy  can  be  achieved  through  a 
combination  of  rights  for  the  data  subjects  and  obligations  on  those  who  process  data,  or  who 
exercise  control  over  such  processing,  and  supervision  by  independent  bodies.  However,  data 
protection rules are only effective if they are enforceable and followed in practice. It is therefore 
necessary to consider not only the content of the rules applicable to personal data transferred to a 
third  country  or  an  international  organisation,  but  also  the  system  in  place  to  ensure  the 
effectiveness of such rules. Efficient enforcement mechanisms are of paramount importance to the 
effectiveness of data protection rules18.   

2.3. General comments and concerns  

                                                      
therefore be subject to the mandatory warrant requirement of section 13(1) of the IPA 2016 (recital 206 of the 
draft decision); and the examples of operational purposes provided (recital 216 and footnote 369 of the draft 
decision).

2.3.1. International commitments entered into by the UK 

48.  According  to  Article  45(2)(c)  GDPR  and  the  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential19,  when  assessing  the 
adequacy  of  the  level  of  protection  of  a  third  country,  the  European  Commission  shall  take  into 
account, among others, the international commitments the third country has entered into, or other 
obligations  arising  from  the  third  country's  participation  in  multilateral  or  regional  systems,  in 
particular  in  relation  to  the  protection  of  personal  data,  as  well  as  the  implementation  of  such 
obligations. Furthermore, the third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 
January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal 
Data (hereinafter “Convention 108”),20 and its Additional Protocol21, should be taken into account.  
In  this  regard,  the  EDPB  welcomes  that  the  UK  has  adhered  to  the  ECHR  and  is  under  the 
jurisdiction of the ECtHR. In addition, the UK has also adhered to Convention 108 and its Additional 
Protocol, has signed Convention 108+22 in 2018, and is currently working on its ratification.  

49. 

2.3.2. Possible future divergence of the UK Data Protection Framework  

50.  As mentioned in recital 281 of the draft decision, the European Commission must take into account 
that,  with  the  end  of  the  transition  period  provided  by  the  Withdrawal  Agreement23,  the  UK 
administers, applies and enforces its own data protection regime, and as soon as the bridge provision 
under Article FINPROV.10A of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement24 ceases to apply, this 
may notably involve amendments or changes to the data protection framework assessed in the draft 
decision, as well as other relevant developments. 

51. 

52. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to include a sunset clause in its draft decision25, 
setting the expiration date of four years after its entry into force. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  possibility  of  the  UK  ministers  and  the  UK  Secretary  of  State  to 
introduce  secondary  legislation  following  the  end  of  the  bridge  period  may  lead  to  a  significant 
divergence of the UK Data Protection Framework from the EU’s in the future. 

53. 

Indeed, the UK Government has indicated its intention to develop separate and independent policies 
in data protection, which may then lead to a divergence from EU data protection law26. This intention

encompasses the inclusion of personal data aspects in trade agreements27, a practice that entails the 
risk of lowering the level of protection of personal data provided for by the UK28.  

54. 

Finally, not only since the end of the transition period, the UK is no longer bound by CJEU case-law 
but also, the already adopted judgments of the CJEU, considered as retained case law in the UK legal 
framework, might not bind the UK any more as, in particular, the UK has the possibility to modify 
retained EU law after the end of the bridge period and its Supreme Court is not bound by any retained 
EU case-law29.   

55.  Considering the risks related to the possible deviation of the UK Data Protection Framework from 
the  EU  acquis  following  the  end  of  the  bridge  period,  the  EDPB  welcomes  the  European 
Commission’s decision to introduce a sunset clause of four years for the draft decision. However, 
the EDPB would like to highlight here the importance of the European Commission’s monitoring 
role30. Indeed, the European Commission should monitor all relevant developments in the UK that 
may  have  an  impact  on  the  essential  equivalence  of  the  level  of  protection  of  personal  data 
transferred under the UK adequacy decision on an ongoing and permanent basis from its entry 
into force. In addition, the European Commission should take appropriate action by suspending, 
amending or repealing the adequacy decision, based on the circumstances at hand,  if after the 
adequacy decision is adopted, the European Commission has indications that an adequate level of 
protection is no longer ensured in the UK. 

56.  On its side, the EDPB will use its best efforts to inform the European Commission about any relevant 
action  undertaken  by Member  State’s  data  protection  supervisory  authorities  (hereinafter  “SAs”) 
either  in  the  commercial  or  public  sector,  and  in  particular  regarding  complaints  made  by  data 
subjects in the EEA concerning the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the UK. 

                                                      
can  aid  vital  scientific  research  into  diseases  while  uniting  countries  in  their  response  to  global  health 
emergencies. Having left the European Union, the UK will champion the benefits that data can deliver. We 
will promote domestic best practice and work with international partners to ensure data is not inappropriately 
constrained by national borders and fragmented regulatory regimes so that it can be used to its full potential.” 
(emphasis added). 
27  Ibid:  “Facilitate  cross-border  data  flows:  We  will  work  globally  to  remove  unnecessary  barriers  to 
international data flows. We will agree ambitious data provisions in our trade negotiations and use our newly 
independent  seat  in  the  World  Trade  Organisation  to  influence  trade  rules  for  data  for  the  better.  We  will 
remove  obstacles  to  international  data  transfers  which  support  growth  and  innovation,  including  by 
developing a new UK capability that delivers new and innovative mechanisms for international data transfers. 
We will also work with partners in the G20 to create interoperability between national data regimes to minimise 
friction when transferring data between different countries”. (emphasis added).

3. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION ASPECTS  

3.1. Content principles  

57.  Chapter  3  of  the  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential  is  dedicated  to  the  “Content  Principles”.  A  third 
country’s  system  must  contain  them  in  order  for  its  level  of  data  protection  to  be  considered 
essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed within the EU. The EDPB acknowledges the fact that the 
UK does not have a codified constitution in that there is no one single document  that sets out its 
governing fundamental rules. However, the right to respect for private and family life (and the right 
to data protection as part of that right) and the right to a fair trial31 are included in the Human Rights 
Act 1998, and the constitutional value of this statute has been recognised by UK courts. Indeed, the 
Human  Rights  Act  1998  incorporates  the  rights  contained  in  the  ECHR32.  In  addition,  the  Human 
Rights Act 1998 states very importantly that any action of public authorities must be compatible with 
the ECHR33.  

58.  Aside from structural and formalistic differences between the UK and EU legislation, the EDPB notes, 
as one can expect, that the UK’s approach to data protection is similar to the one in the EU resulting 
from the fact that the UK was a Member State of the EU up until 31 January 2020. As a result, many 
content principles are aligned with the GDPR’s; therefore provide a level of protection essentially 
equivalent to the one provided by the EU. The EDPB has decided not to develop further the analysis 
as  to  those  content  principles  that  are  in  alignment  with  EU  legislation,  and  is  satisfied  with  the 
analysis provided by the European Commission in its draft decision. Such content principles are for 
example  the  following:  concepts  (e.g.,  “personal  data”;  “processing  of  personal  data”;  “data 
controller”); grounds for lawful and fair processing for legitimate purposes; purpose limitation; data 
quality  and  proportionality;  data  retention,  security  and  confidentiality;  transparency;  special 
categories of  data;  direct marketing;  automated  decision  making  and  profiling.  The  EDPB  further 
notes that the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 include content principles that go further than what is 
required by the GDPR Adequacy Referential and mirror the principles included in the GDPR; therefore 
elevating the level of protection provided for in the UK. Such content principles are for example the 
ones  related  to  personal  data  breach  notifications,  the  data  protection  officer,  data  protection 
impact assessments and data protection by design and by default.  

59.  However, as mentioned in the Introduction, the EDPB wishes to specifically address in this opinion 
certain  points  on  which  the  EDPB  has  concerns  and  would  like  to  request  clarifications  from  the 
European Commission.  

60. 

3.1.1. Rights of access, rectification, erasure and objection  
The  so-called  ‘immigration  exemption’,  laid  down  under  Schedule  2  to  the  DPA  2018,  Part  1, 
paragraph 4 allows controllers involved in “immigration control” to not apply certain data subjects’ 
rights provided by the DPA 2018 if this would be likely to “prejudice the maintenance of effective 
immigration  control”  or  “the  investigation  or  detection  of  activities  that  would  undermine  the 
maintenance of effective immigration control”. 

                                                      
31 See Articles 6 and 8 ECHR (Schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998).

61.  As acknowledged by the European Commission in its draft decision34, and referred to in the Opinion 
of the LIBE Committee of the European Parliament, on the conclusion, on behalf of the EU, of the 
Trade  and  Cooperation  Agreement  between  the  EU  and  the  UK35,  this  exemption  is  ‘broadly’ 
formulated. It applies to the following rights: right to be informed; right of access; right to erasure; 
right to restrict processing; and right to object. 

62.  Besides,  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  exemption  also  applies  in  case  personal  data  are  not 
collected for the purpose of immigration control by a controller (“controller 1”), but  are however 
made available by the latter to another controller (“controller 2”) who processes such personal data 
for the purpose of immigration control (e.g., the UK Home Office)36. 

63. 

In Open Rights Group & Anor, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department 
& Anor [2019] EWHC 2562 (Admin) (03 October 2019), the applicants challenged the lawfulness of 
the immigration exemption on the ground that it was contrary to Article 23 GDPR and incompatible 
with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 EU Charter relating to privacy and the protection of 
personal data. The High Court of England and Wales (hereinafter “High Court”) considered whether 
the immigration exemption in paragraph 4 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the DPA 2018 is lawful, and 
concluded in favour of its lawfulness.

the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part, and of the Agreement between

Parliament’s  February  and  June  2020  resolutions,  pointing  out  the  general  and  broad  exemption  for  the 
processing of personal data for immigration purposes of the UK Data Protection Act”, and para. 11: “considers 
that the general and broad exemption for the processing of personal data for immigration purposes of the UK 
Data  Protection  Act  [...]  need  to  be  amended  before  a  valid  adequacy  decision  can  be  granted;”(emphasis 
added). 
36 See example provided in the ICO “Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)”, v 01 January 
2021, p. 307 (emphasis added): “A private organisation (controller 1) alerts the Home Office (controller 2) to 
an employee who is believed to have submitted false documents to evidence their identity and qualifications to 
obtain a job. The employer provides the Home Office with the relevant information. The right of the individual 
to be informed that their personal data has been passed to the Home Office is restricted in so far as giving effect 
to it would be likely to prejudice the investigation. 
The employer is therefore under no obligation to inform the individual that their information has been passed 
to the Home Office, and in turn the Home Office is under no obligation to provide the individual with a privacy 
notice informing them that it is now processing their personal data. The exemption applies to both controllers 
to the same extent. 
However, the employee requests a copy of their personal data from the Home Office which is now investigating 
them. The Home Office may rely on the exemption to withhold part of their data if the disclosure would be 
likely to prejudice the investigation. Should the employee make a similar request to their employer, they would 
also be able to apply the exemption to the same extent.” 
In other words, as clarified on p. 300:  “In the majority of cases the Home Office, or one of its agencies and 
contractors, will be the controller applying this exemption. However, it is important to note that the application 
of this exemption is not just limited to the Home Office. It may also be relevant to other controllers such as 
employers, universities and the police, who liaise with the Home Office on immigration matters.”

risk falls far short of being more probable than not […].”, para. 39 (emphasis added). 

65. 

It should be noted that this judgment is, to the EDPB’s knowledge, not final and has been appealed.  

66.  As  specified  in  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on  restrictions  under  Article  23  GDPR  (“the  Article  23  GDPR 
Guidelines”)37  “[...] in a GDPR  context, restrictions shall be  provided for in a  legislative measure, 
concern a limited number of rights of data subjects and/or controller’s obligations which are listed 
in Article 23 of the GDPR, respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms at issue, be a 
necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society and safeguard one of the grounds set 
out in Article 23(1) of the GDPR [...]”.38 

67. 

The EDPB also recalls that recital 41 GDPR states that “[w]here this Regulation refers to a legal basis 
or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament, 
without  prejudice  to  requirements  pursuant  to  the  constitutional  order  of  the  Member  State 
concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be  clear and precise and its 
application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the 
Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  [...]  and  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights”  (emphasis 
added).  

68.  Although the ECtHR specified that “[f]urther, as regards the words “in accordance with the law” and 
“prescribed by law” which appear in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention, the [ECHR] observes that it 
has always understood the term “law” in its “substantive” sense, not its “formal” one; it has included 
both “written law”, encompassing enactments of lower ranking statutes and regulatory measures 
taken by professional regulatory bodies under independent rule-making powers delegated to them 
by  Parliament,  and  unwritten  law.  “Law”  must  be  understood  to  include  both  statutory  law  and 
judge-made “law””39, the Article 23 GDPR Guidelines recall that “[a]ccording to the CJEU case law, 
any  legislative  measure  adopted  on  the  basis  of  Article  23(1)  [of  the]  GDPR  must,  in  particular, 
comply with the specific requirements set out in  Article 23(2) of the GDPR. Article 23(2) [of the] 
GDPR states that the legislative measures imposing restrictions to the rights of data subjects and the 
controllers’  obligations  shall  contain,  where  relevant,  specific  provisions  about  several  criteria

outlined below. As a rule, all the requirements detailed below should be included in the legislative 
measure imposing restrictions under Article 23 [of the] GDPR.”40 

69. 

It  can  be  observed  in  this  regard  that  the  immigration  exemption  itself  does  not  specify  the 
following elements referred to under Article 23(2) GDPR: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

“the safeguards to prevent abuse or the unlawful access or transfer” (d); 

“the controller or categories of controllers” (e)41; 

“the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects” (g); 

“the right of data subjects to be informed about the restriction, unless that may be prejudicial 
to the purpose of the restriction” (h). 

70. 

The ICO’s “Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)”42, including a Chapter on the 
“immigration exemption”, does provide clarifications on the immigration exemption, but cannot per 
se provide binding rules complementing it. Moreover, the issue of ‘quality of the law’ is particularly 
relevant given the importance of the restricted rights and the extension of the exemption43. 

                                                      
40 See Article 23 GDPR Guidelines, paras. 45 and 46, p. 11. Under Article 52(3) EU Charter, “[i]n so far as this 
Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down 
by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection”. On the 
notion of ‘provided for by law’ under Article 52(1) EU Charter, the criteria developed by the ECtHR should be 
used as suggested in several CJEU Advocate General’s Opinions, see for example the Opinions in joined cases 
C-203/15 and C-698/15,  Tele2 Sverige AB, ECLI:EU:C:2016:572, paras. 137-154, and in case C-70/10,  Scarlet 
Extended,  ECLI:EU:C:2011:255,  paras.  88-114.  Hence,  reference  can  be  made,  among  others,  to  the  ECtHR 
ruling in Weber and Saravia v Germany, para. 84: “The Court reiterates that the expression “in accordance with 
the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 [of the ECHR] requires, firstly, that the impugned measure should 
have some basis in domestic law; it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be 
accessible  to  the  person  concerned,  who  must,  moreover, be  able  to  foresee  its  consequences  for  him,  and 
compatible with the rule of law.”(emphasis added).  
See  also  recital  41  GDPR:  “Such  [a  legal  basis  or]  legislative  measure  should  be  clear  and  precise  and  its 
application should  be  foreseeable  to persons subject  to it, in  accordance with the case-law of the Court of 
Justice of the European Union (...) and the European Court of Human Rights” (emphasis supplied). 
41  See  the  aforementioned  High  Court  case,  para.  54:  “In  my  view  there  is  nothing  unlawful  about  the 
Immigration Exemption being available to all data controllers processing data for the specified purposes. As 
the defendants point out, without paras 4(3)–(4) the Immigration Exemption would be rendered ineffective in 
cases where data is obtained from third parties (such as a local authority or HM Revenue and Customs) for the 
purposes of maintaining effective immigration control.” (emphasis added), hence confirming the generalised 
application of the restrictions. 
42 ICO’s “Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)”, v 01 January 2021, p. 299-307. 
43 See para. 57 of the aforesaid High Court case: “Mr Knight informs me that the  Commissioner is finalising 
guidance on the Exemption, but it will have “statutory” status only in the sense of being issued by virtue of the 
Commissioner’s powers under art.57(1) of the GDPR. It will have no legal status under DPA 2018.” 
The rationale for the introduction of legally binding guidance supported by ICO is referred to in particular at 
paras. 56-60 of the judgment: 
“56. Finally, I turn to the Commissioner’s submission that without accompanying statutory guidance to provide 
safeguards as to the meaning and application of the Immigration Exemption, the exemption would not be a 
proportionate implementation of art.23(1) of the GDPR. Mr Knight says that supplemented by such guidance, 
the provision is proportionate. 
57.  Mr  Knight  informs  me  that  the  Commissioner  is  finalising  guidance  on  the  Exemption,  but  it  will  have 
“statutory” status only in the sense of being issued by virtue of the Commissioner’s powers under art.57(1) of 

Adopted

71.  A fortiori, the “prejudice test” does not set out the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access 

or transfer, and to be implemented for instance by the Home Office. 

72. 

73. 

In the light of all of the above, the EDPB remarks that further clarifications on the application of the 
immigration exemption are needed.  

Furthermore, the EDPB remarks the lack of a legally binding instrument that clarifies the immigration 
exemption  in  view  of  considering  whether  it  is  essentially  equivalent  with  Article  23  GDPR  and 
Articles  7  and  8  EU  Charter.  At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  necessity  and 
proportionality  of  the  broad  scope  ratione  personae  of  the  immigration  exemption  needs  to  be 
further demonstrated by the European Commission, supported by evidence.  

74.  As  a  conclusion,  the  EDPB  invites  the  European  Commission  to  verify  the  state  of  play  of  the 
proceedings Open Rights Group & Anor, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the Home 
Department & Anor [2019] EWHC 2562 (Admin) referred to above and, since this judgment is not 
final (res judicata), to verify whether it is confirmed or reviewed by the appeal judgment, to take 
any update in this regard into account, and to specify it in the adequacy decision. The EDPB also 
calls  on  the  European  Commission  to  provide  further  information  on  the  necessity  and 

                                                      
the GDPR. It will have no legal status under DPA 2018. I understand also that the Home Office has produced 
draft internal staff guidance on the Immigration Exemption (see [22] above). In practice guidance issued by the 
Commissioner is influential regardless of its legal basis. However, there is no power for the Commissioner to 
issue “binding” guidance of the sort that the Supreme Court had in mind in the Christian Institute case (at [101] 
and [107]). It appears that primary legislation would be required if it were considered necessary for there to be 
guidance on the Immigration Exemption of the same status as the codes of practice currently provided for in 
ss.121–124 of DPA 2018. 
58.  In  his  argument  for  statutory  guidance  Mr  Knight  contends  that  the  context  in  which  the  use  of  the 
Immigration Exemption will arise necessarily frames the concerns about the necessity and proportionality of its 
existence and use. He draws attention to two matters in particular in the legal context. First, personal data to 
which  the  Immigration  Exemption  is  applied  is  inherently  likely  to  involve  special  category  data  within  the 
meaning of art.9(1) of the GDPR (i.e. data “revealing racial or ethnic origin”). Such data is identified in the GDPR 
because it requires a higher measure of protection ( Opinion 1/15 [2019] 3 C.M.L.R. 25 at [141]). Secondly, it is 
a basic proposition of data protection law that the right of subject access in particular is of great importance 
as  the  gateway  to being  able  to exercise  the  other  rights provided  to data  subjects  (see  YS  v  Minister  voor 
Immigratie, Integratie en Asiel (C-141/12) EU:C:2014:2081; [2015] 1 C.M.L.R. 18 at [44]). 
59. Mr Knight identifies four points of a practical nature. First, when controllers do not explain to data subjects 
that they have relied upon a statutory exemption, nor provide a broad summary of the reasons why, the data 
subject will be unaware that the exemption has been applied, and unable to challenge it effectively as a result. 
Secondly, data subjects will be especially reliant on controllers to apply the exemption with care and only so far 
as necessary. Although any data subject is entitled to complain to the Commissioner about the application of 
the exemption, or to bring legal proceedings before the courts, it is likely that the data subject will be unaware 
of their rights and lack the funds to take legal steps, in circumstances where there is a need for prompt and 
accurate compliance with data protection rights. Thirdly, as an immigrant the data subject is likely to be in a 
vulnerable position. Fourthly, this is not an abstract issue in the light of the defendants’ evidence as to the use 
of the Immigration Exemption (see [4] above).  
60.  Mr  Knight  suggests  that  there  is  a  close  parallel  between  the  present  challenge  to  the  Immigration 
Exemption and the reasoning of the Court in Christian Institute [2016] UKSC 51 . As in Christian Institute , he 
contends,  the  Immigration  Exemption  is  wide,  uses  undefined  terms,  applies  a  low  threshold,  is  subject  to 
controls not apparent on the face of the provision and applies to a very broad array of contexts and rights. 
Unlike Christian Institute there is no publicly available guidance, still less of a statutory status even to which 
regard must be had, on the Immigration Exemption.”

proportionality of the immigration exemption, in particular having regard to the broad scope of 
application ratione personae.  

75.  At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  invites  the  European  Commission  to  further  explore  whether 
additional safeguards exist in the UK legal framework or could be envisaged, for instance through 
legally  binding  instruments  that  would  complement  the  immigration  exemption  enhancing  its 
foreseeability  by  and  the  safeguards  for  data  subjects,  also  allowing  for  a  better  and  prompt 
assessment and monitoring of the necessity and proportionality requirements. 

3.1.2. Restrictions on onward transfers  

76.  Article 44 GDPR provides that transfers and onward transfers of personal data shall only take place 
if the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by the GDPR is not undermined. Therefore, 
personal data transferred from the EEA to the UK based on the adequacy decision shall enjoy an 
essentially  equivalent  level  of  protection  to  the  one  provided  under  the  EU  data  protection 
framework. This means that not only the UK legislation shall be “essentially equivalent” to the EU 
legislation with regard to the processing of personal data transferred to the UK under the draft 
decision, but also that the rules applicable in the UK with regard to the onward transfer of those 
data to third countries shall ensure that an essentially equivalent level of protection will continue 
to be provided.  

77.  As a result, it is important that any onward transfer from the UK to another third country of personal 
data from the EEA is properly protected with safeguards, or is carried out in accordance with the 
rules on derogations44 to ensure the continuity of protection afforded by the EU legislation. Indeed, 
if no such protection can be provided, onward transfers of EEA personal data should not take place.  

78. 

79. 

The EDPB recognises that the UK has mirrored, for the most part, Chapter V GDPR in the UK GDPR 
(Articles 44-49) and in the DPA 201845. However, the EDPB has identified certain aspects of the UK 
legislative  framework  with  regard  to  onward  transfers  that  might  undermine  the  level  of 
protection of personal data transferred from the EEA.  

The  first  challenge  the  EDPB  has  identified  relates  to  the  recognition  by  the  UK,  following  the 
procedure  as  elaborated  in  the  DPA  2018,  of  third  countries,  international  organisations  or 
territories46 as adequate recipients. Indeed, onward transfers of EEA personal data may occur from 
the UK to other third countries, on the basis of a future possible UK adequacy regulation47. 

80.  More specifically, as explained in recital 77 of the draft decision, the UK Secretary of State has the 
power to recognise a third country (or a territory or a sector within a third country), an international 
organisation,  or  a  description  of  such  a  country,  territory,  sector,  or  organisation  as  ensuring  an 
adequate level of protection of personal data, following consultation of the ICO48. When assessing 
the adequacy of the level of protection, the UK Secretary of State must consider the same elements 
that  the  European  Commission  is  required  to  assess  under  Article  45(2)(a)-(c)  GDPR,  interpreted 
together with recital 104 GDPR and the retained EU case-law. This means that, when assessing the

adequate  level  of  protection  of  a  third  country,  the  relevant  standard  will  be  whether  that  third 
country in question ensures a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to that guaranteed within 
the UK. Although the EDPB notes the capacity of the UK, under the UK GDPR, to recognise territories 
as providing an adequate level of protection in light of the UK Data Protection Framework, the EDPB 
wishes to highlight that these latter territories might not benefit, to date, from an adequacy decision 
issued by the European Commission recognising a level of protection “essentially equivalent” to that 
guaranteed in the EU. This might lead to possible risks in the protection provided to personal data 
transferred from the EEA, especially if the UK Data Protection Framework were to deviate from the 
EU  acquis  in  the  future.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  in  July  2020,  the  Schrems  II  CJEU  landmark  case49 
resulted in the invalidation of the US Privacy Shield Decision as, according to the CJEU, the US legal 
framework  could  not  be  considered  as  providing  an  essentially  equivalent  level  of  protection 
compared to the one of the EU. However, the already adopted judgments of the CJEU, considered as 
retained case-law in the UK legal framework, might not bind the UK anymore as, in particular, the 
UK has the possibility to modify retained EU law after the end of the bridge period, and its Supreme 
Court is not bound by any retained EU case law50.  

The EDPB invites the European Commission to closely monitor the adequacy assessment process 
and criteria by UK authorities with regard to other third countries, in particular with respect to 
third  countries  not  recognised  as  adequate  under  the  GDPR  by  the  EU.  Where  the  European 
Commission finds that no essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed within the 
EU  is  ensured  by  a  third  country  found  adequate  by  the  UK,  the  EDPB  invites  the  European 
Commission to take any and all necessary steps such as, for example, amending the UK adequacy 
decision  to  introduce specific safeguards  for  personal  data  originating  from  the  EEA,  and/or  to 
consider the suspension of the UK adequacy decision, where personal data transferred from the 
EEA to the UK are subject to onward transfers to the third country in question on the basis of a UK 
adequacy regulation. 

The  second  challenge  relates  to  the  upcoming  review  of  the  already  existing adequacy  decisions 
rendered  by  the  European  Commission  under  Directive  95/46/EC.  Following  this  review,  the 
European  Commission  might  decide  that  certain  countries  that  benefited  until  now  from  an 
adequacy  decision  no  longer  provide  for  an  essentially  equivalent  level  of  protection  taking  into 
account the current EU legislation and recent case-law. However, as provided for in paragraph 4, 
Schedule 21 DPA 2018, the UK has already recognised those countries as providing for an adequate 
level of protection. Even though the UK Secretary of State must conduct a review of these adequacy 
findings within a period of four years, the European Commission notes in its draft decision that these 
adequacy  findings  will  not  automatically  cease  to  exist  should  the  UK  Secretary  of  State  not 
undertake the required review within the stipulated four-year time limit51. 

The EDPB invites the European Commission to monitor whether, once the EU review of the already 
existing adequacy decisions is finalised, a country, deemed to no longer provide for an adequate 
level of protection, is still considered as such by the UK. If this is the case, the EDPB invites the 
European Commission, based on recitals 277 – 280 of the draft decision to take any appropriate 
measures to remedy the situation, for example by amending the adequacy decision in order to add 
specific  requirements  for  personal  data  originating  from  the  EEA  and/or  by  suspending  the 
adequacy  decision,  if  personal  data  transferred  from  the  EEA  to  the  UK  are  subject  to  onward

transfers to the third country in question. The EDPB invites the European Commission to continue 
this monitoring exercise for the duration of the UK adequacy decision.   

The third challenge concerns the onward transfer of personal data from the EEA to non-adequate 
countries based on the transfer tools provided for in Articles 46 and 47 UK GDPR. Although the UK 
GDPR provides for the same transfer tools as the ones provided by the GDPR, the EDPB highlights 
the need to ensure that the safeguards they contain provide for an effective protection in the third 
country, especially in the light of the Schrems II judgment.  

Following the Schrems II ruling, in which the CJEU reminds that the protection granted to personal 
data  in  the  EU  must  travel  with  the  data  wherever  it  goes,  the  EDPB  has  already  adopted  initial 
recommendations on  supplementary  measures52  to  assist  exporters,  where  required,  in  ensuring 
that data subjects are afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within 
the EU. 

86.  According  to  the  CJEU,  data  exporters  are  responsible  for  verifying,  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and, 
where appropriate, in collaboration with the data importer in the third country, if the law or practice 
of the third country impinges on the effectiveness of the appropriate safeguards contained in the 
Article  46  GDPR  transfer  tools53.  Where  this  is  the  case,  data  exporters  should  implement 
supplementary measures that fill these gaps in the protection and bring it up to the level required 
by EU law. 

87. 

88. 

The  EDPB  invites  the  European  Commission,  in  order  to  ensure  continuity  of  protection,  to 
introduce in the draft decision reassurances that when the transfer tools provided in Articles 46 
and 47 UK GPDR are used by data exporters in the UK for onward transfers to other third countries 
of EEA transferred data, these data exporters assess on a case-by-case basis, the data protection 
framework  of  the  third  country;  and  if  necessary,  take  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  the 
effective respect of the safeguards contained in the chosen transfer tool to ensure an essentially 
equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed within the EU. Without these reassurances, the 
EDPB stresses that that there is a risk that the essentially equivalent level of protection to the one 
guaranteed within the EU, will be watered down through onward transfers taking place from the 
UK.  

The fourth challenge relating to onward transfers concerns the international agreements concluded, 
or to be concluded in the future by the UK and the possible direct access, by authorities from third 
country(ies) party(ies)  to such agreements,  to personal data from the  EEA. Indeed, the EDPB has 
strong concerns in relation to the already concluded UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement and the European 
Commission acknowledges this challenge, stressing that “a possible entry into force of the Agreement 
may impact the level of protection assessed in this Decision”54. Indeed, based on this agreement, 
once it enters into force, personal data transferred from the EEA to the UK under the draft decision 
would then be subject to the provisions of this agreement laying down conditions for direct access 
by US authorities, impacting the UK Data Protection Framework, including the provisions on onward 
transfers. As a result, the level of protection provided to the data transferred from the EEA may be

substantially affected by the provisions of the agreement concluded with the US, and impact on the 
level of protection for such data. The EDPB notes in this context that the European Commission refers 
to  explanations  given  by  UK  authorities  in  recital  153  of  its  draft  decision,  without  quoting  or 
providing any concrete written assurance or commitment, nor pointing out specific legal provisions 
under UK law that would give effect to such explanations. 

The  EDPB  has  previously  raised  these  concerns  in  a  letter  addressed to  the  European Parliament 
dated 15 June 202055. The EDPB had highlighted that based on the “EU acquis in the field of data 
protection,  and  in  particular  with  the  GDPR  and  the  law  enforcement  directive”  the  EDPB  has 
reservations as to whether the safeguards in the agreement for access to personal data in the UK 
would apply in certain circumstances requiring disclosure obligations to the US, as well as whether 
these  safeguards  are  sufficient  in  light  of  the  EU  standards  so  as  to  not  undermine  the  level  of 
protection provided in the EU.  

Furthermore,  the  provisions  of  the  UK–US  CLOUD  Act  Agreement  may  significantly  affect  the 
substantive and procedural conditions under which personal data held by controllers or processors 
in  the  UK  can  be  directly  accessed  by  US  authorities,  thus  impacting  on  the  level  of  protection 
guaranteed  under  UK  law.  To  provide  for  a  level  of  protection  essentially  equivalent  to  the  one 
guaranteed under EU law, it is for example “essential that the safeguards as per such agreement 
include a mandatory prior judicial authorisation, as an essential guarantee for access to metadata 
and  content  data.  On  the  basis  of  its  preliminary  assessment,  the  EDPB,  while  noting  that  the 
agreement refers to the application of domestic law, could not identify such a clear provision in the 
agreement concluded between the UK and the US”56.  

91.  While the European Commission highlights that data obtained under this agreement would benefit 
from equivalent protections to the specific safeguards provided by the so-called “EU-US Umbrella 
Agreement”, the EDPB has concerns as to whether the incorporation of these safeguards into the 
UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement by a mere reference applying on a mutatis mutandis basis would meet 
the criteria of clear, precise and accessible rules when it comes to access to personal data, or would 
sufficiently enshrine such safeguards to be effective and actionable under UK law. 

92. 

93. 

The EDPB therefore recommends that the European Commission clarifies how and based on which 
legal instrument equivalent protections to the specific safeguards provided by the EU-US Umbrella 
Agreement would be given effect and have binding character under UK law. 

The EDPB also notes that the provisions of the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement, read in conjunction 
with section 3 US CLOUD Act57, raises questions as to the actual application of the safeguards offered 
by  the  agreement  for the  access,  by  US  law  enforcement authorities,  to  personal  data  in  the  UK 
processed  by  providers  of  electronic  communication  service  or  remote  computing  service 
(hereinafter “CSPs”) falling under the jurisdiction of the US. Indeed, should a CSP located in the UK 
be subject to US law (e.g., because it is the subsidiary of a US company), it remains to be ascertained 
whether US authorities would be bound to rely on the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement to obtain that 
data.  As  the  European  Commission  points  out  that  “[p]articular  attention  will  be  given  to  the 
application and adaptation of the Umbrella Agreement’s protections to the specific type of transfers 
covered by the UK-US Agreement”, the EDPB stresses that on the basis of its preliminary assessment,

it is unclear whether the safeguards enshrined in the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement, and therefore 
the one provided by the EU-US Umbrella Agreement, would apply to all, if any, requests for access 
to data in the UK made by US authorities under the US CLOUD Act. 

There may be other future international agreements or commitments with third countries the UK 
might be entering into in the future, and that would apply to personal data transferred from the EEA 
to  the  UK  under  the  draft  decision58.  Depending  on  the  provisions  of  these  agreements  and  the 
application of specific safeguard clauses, these international agreements, by affecting the UK Data 
Protection Framework may also significantly impact on the substantive and procedural conditions 
for access to personal data in the UK by third country authorities. This is in particular the case for the 
draft  second additional protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (hereinafter 
“Budapest  Convention”)  currently  being  negotiated  among  the  parties  to  this  Convention,  which 
include  several  non-EU  countries.  Indeed,  the  draft  protocol  includes  clauses  which  can  be 
discretionally activated by the parties, for instance concerning the authorisation to grant access to 
content data or not. While all EU Member States would activate the clauses in compliance with EU 
data protection rules, no guarantee has been provided concerning the UK, which could substantially 
deviate from the level of protection that would then be offered within the EU. Another example of 
the  issues  presented  above,  is  the  Agreement  between  the  UK  and  Japan  for  a  Comprehensive 
Economic Partnership59 (“CEPA”), the UK’s first post-Brexit trade deal that entered into force on 1 
January 202160 and that includes provisions on personal data61. The EDPB furthermore notes that the 
UK  has  also  formally  announced  on  1  February  2021  its  request  to  join  the  Comprehensive  and 
Progressive  Trans-Pacific  Partnership  (“CPTPP”)  which  incorporates  the  Trans-Pacific  Partnership 
Agreement (“TPP”)62. 

95. 

The EDPB notes that, apart from the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement, the international agreements 
mentioned above are not addressed in the draft decision.  

96. 

The EDPB invites the European Commission to:  

- 

Examine  the  interplay  between  the  UK  Data  Protection  Framework  and  its  international 
commitments, beyond the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement, in particular to ensure the continuity 
of the level of protection in case of onward transfers to other third countries of personal data 
transferred  from  the  EEA  to  the  UK  on  the  basis  of  a  UK  adequacy  decision;  and  to 
continuously monitor and take action, where needed, with regard to the conclusion of other 
international agreements between the UK and third countries that risk to undermine the level 
of protection of personal data provided for in the EU.

98. 

The fifth challenge identified relates to the application of derogations for the transfers of personal 
data to a third country. Although the available derogations under the UK GDPR are the same as the 
ones provided under the GDPR, it is important that the ICO applies and will continue to apply an 
interpretation in relation to the use of these derogations aligned with the one of the EDPB. If this is 
not the case, or if the UK diverges from this interpretation in the future, there would be a risk that 
the  level  of  protection  of  data  transferred  from  the  EEA  to  third  countries  via  the  UK  could  be 
undermined.  

The EDPB invites the European Commission, as part of its monitoring task, to specifically check that 
the  UK  interpretation  on  the  use  of  derogations  remains  aligned  to  the  EU’s  interpretation.  If 
however,  a  different  interpretation  of  the  use  of  derogations  were  followed  by  the  UK 
undermining the level of protection, it is essential that the European Commission takes necessary 
steps by amending the adequacy decision to make sure that the level of protection provided to 
EEA personal data transferred to the UK will not then be undermined when these data are onward 
transferred from the UK to third countries on the basis of a different interpretation of derogations.  

99. 

The sixth challenge, final one for this section, refers to the absence of protections provided under 
Article 48 GDPR in the UK Data Protection Framework.  

100.  The  European  Commission  indeed  clarifies  in  its  draft  decision  that  in  the  absence  of  adequacy 
regulations or appropriate safeguards, a transfer can only take place based on derogations set out in 
Article 49 UK GDPR, “with the exception of Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that the United 
Kingdom  has  chosen  not  to  include  in  the  UK  GDPR.”63  The  absence  of  an  essentially  equivalent 
provision to Article 48 GDPR enshrined in the UK Data Protection Framework, in relation to transfers 
or disclosures, following a judgment of a court or tribunal or a decision of an administrative authority 
from another third country, may give rise to legal uncertainty as to whether the level of protection 
for personal data transferred from the EEA to the UK under the draft decision would be substantially 
affected.  

101.  In  its  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential, the  EDPB  points  out  that,  when  it comes  to onward  transfers, 
“further transfers of the personal data by the initial recipient of the original data transfer should be 
permitted  only  where  the  further  recipient  is  also  subject  to  rules  affording  an  adequate  level  of 
protection and following the relevant instructions when processing data on the behalf of the data 

                                                      
63 See footnote 78 of the draft decision.

controller”64. Furthermore, the EDPB stresses that “the initial recipient of the data transferred from 
the EU shall be liable to ensure that appropriate safeguards are provided for onward transfers of data 
in the absence of an adequacy decision. Such onward transfers of data should  only take place for 
limited and specified purposes and as long as there is a legal ground for that processing”65. As part 
of Chapter V GDPR, Article 48 has to be taken fully into account in assessing whether the UK legal 
framework ensures an essentially equivalent level of protection in this regard66.  

102.  The EDPB emphasises in this context the CJEU case-law in relation to the risk of abuse or unlawful 
access and use of data, stating in particular that “as regards the level of protection of fundamental 
rights  and  freedoms  that  is  guaranteed  within  the  European  Union,  EU  legislation  involving 
interference  with  the  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  by  Articles  7  and  8  of  the  Charter  must, 
according to the Court’s settled case-law, lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and 
application of a measure and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal 
data is concerned have sufficient guarantees enabling their data to be effectively protected against 
the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data. The need for such safeguards 
is  all  the  greater  where  personal  data  is  subjected  to  automatic  processing  and  where  there  is  a 
significant risk of unlawful access to that data”67. 

103.  The EDPB notes in this regard that, based on the information available in the draft decision, the UK 
Data Protection Framework does not clearly provide that any judgment of a court or tribunal and 
any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to 
transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on 
an international agreement  in force  between the  requesting third country and the UK. Article 48 
GDPR is an essential provision under Chapter V GDPR as it requires that a transfer or disclosure of 
personal data following a judgment or decision from a third country court/tribunal or administrative 
authority may only be  recognised or enforceable if  based on an  international agreement in force 
between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other 
grounds for transfers pursuant to Chapter V GDPR. Indeed, the EDPB recalls that “a request from a 
foreign  authority  does  not  in  itself  constitute  a  legal  ground  for  transfer.  The  order  can  only  be 
recognised ʿif based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force 
between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member Stateʾ”68. It is therefore key that 
essentially equivalent provisions can be identified under UK law.  

104.  In  the  draft  decision,  the  European  Commission  reports  explanations  from  the  UK  authorities 
according  to  which  under  common  law  or  statutes,  a  foreign  judgment  requesting  data  is 
unenforceable in the UK without an international agreement and any transfer of data upon request 
from  a  foreign  court  or  administrative  authority  requires  a  transfer  tool  such  as  an  adequacy 
regulation  or  appropriate  safeguards,  unless  a  derogation  under  Article  49  UK  GDPR  applies. 
However, the EDPB has not been provided with the exchanges between the European Commission 
and the UK authorities69 in this regard, and is therefore not able to analyse and independently assess

whether  the  guarantees  provided  by  the  UK  authorities  are  sufficient  to  ensure  an  essentially 
equivalent level of protection in relation to the safeguards contained in Article 48 GDPR.  

105.  The EDPB invites the European Commission to provide further assurances and specific references 
to  UK  legislation  that  ensure  that  the  level  of  protection  under  the  UK  legal  framework  is 
essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EEA. Therefore, the EDPB invites the European 
Commission  to  provide  written  explanations  and  commitments  from  the  UK  authorities  with 
regard to the implementation of protections essentially equivalent to those provided by Article 48 
GDPR.  

106.  The  EDPB  considers  that  the  identification  of  provisions  under  UK  law  ensuring  an  essentially 
equivalent level of protection in relation to the safeguards contained in Article 48 GDPR is all the 
more important in light of the concerns previously raised concerning requests for access to data in 
the UK made by US or other third countries’ authorities, and considering that as per the adequacy 
decision, personal data could be transferred from the EEA to the UK without any further guarantee 
or binding commitment from the recipient in relation to requests for access to data by other third 
countries’ authorities. 

3.2. Procedural and Enforcement Mechanisms 

107.  Based  on  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  GDPR  Adequacy  Referential,  the  EDPB  has  analysed  the 
following  aspects  of  the  UK  Data  Protection  Framework  as covered  under  the draft  decision:  the 
existence  and  effective  functioning  of  an  independent  supervisory  authority;  the  existence  of  a 
system  ensuring  a  good  level  of  compliance;  and  a  system  of  access  to  appropriate  redress 
mechanisms equipping individuals in the EU with the means to exercise their rights and seek redress 
without encountering cumbersome barriers to administrative and judicial redress. 

3.2.1 Competent Independent Supervisory Authority 

108.  The  EDPB  welcomes  the  efforts  of  the  European  Commission  to  examine  comprehensively  the 
establishment, functioning and powers of the UK supervisory authority in Chapter 2.6. of the draft 
decision. In the UK, the Information Commissioner (hereinafter “IC”) is tasked with the oversight and 
enforcement of the compliance with the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018. According to Schedule 12 DPA 
2018,  the  IC  is  a  “Corporation  Sole”,  i.e.  a  separate  legal  entity  constituted  in  a  single  person, 
supported by an office, the ICO. 

109.  With regard to the independence of the IC, the EDPB underlines that Article 51 UK GDPR does not 
contain the express clarification that the IC is an independent public authority as it is stated in Article 
51 GDPR with regard to SAs. The EDPB nevertheless acknowledges, that the UK GDPR mirrors in its 
Article 52 in a similar manner the corresponding rules with regard to the independence as set forth 
in Article 52(1) to (3) GDPR.  

110.  Furthermore, the EDPB points out that Article 52 UK GDPR does not hold obligations corresponding 
to Article 52(4) to (6) GDPR that expressly ensure that the respective SA is provided with resources 
necessary for the effective performance of its tasks and exercise of its powers. The EDPB however 
recognises that the DPA 2018 contains provisions which aim to secure an appropriate funding of the 
ICO70, as well as the circumstance that the ICO is currently one of the largest SA compared to SAs 
within the EU/EEA. Since an ongoing allocation of appropriate resources, especially with regard to 
staff  and  budget71,  is  imperative  so  as  to  ensure the proper  functioning  of  a  SA  to  fulfil  all of  its

assigned  tasks  and  it  has  also  been  recently  flagged  by  the  European  Parliament  to  be  of  major 
importance72, the EDPB deems it essential to pay particular attention to future developments in this 
area. 

111.  Therefore, the EDPB invites the European Commission to observe any developments with regard 
to the allocation of resources to the ICO, which would be detrimental to the proper fulfilment of 
the ICO’s tasks. 

3.2.2. Existence of a data protection system ensuring a good level of compliance 

112.  The draft decision undertakes a comprehensive examination of the powers that the ICO is equipped 
with under Article 58 UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 in order to ensure the monitoring and enforcement 
of the legislation. The EDPB acknowledges that Article 58 UK GDPR mirrors in a close manner the 
corresponding  rules  with  regard  to  powers  of  SAs  as  set  forth  in  Article  58  GDPR.  Regarding  the 
power to impose administrative fines depending on the circumstances of each individual case, Article 
83  UK  GDPR  contains  similar  provisions  and  maximum  amounts  as  set  forth  in  Article  83  GDPR. 
Hence,  the  EDPB  considers  the  UK  legal  framework  in  this  field  currently  to  be  in  line  with  the 
standards as set forth in the relevant law of the EU. In that respect, the EDPB nevertheless highlights 
that the existence of effective sanctions plays an important role in ensuring respect for rules.73  

113.  In the light of the above, the EDPB invites the European Commission to monitor the effectiveness 

of sanctions and relevant remedies in the UK Data Protection Framework. 

3.2.3.  The  data  protection  system  must  provide  support  and  help  to  data  subjects  in  the 
exercise of their rights and appropriate redress mechanisms 

114.  An  effective  supervision  mechanism,  allowing  independent  investigation  of  complaints  so  as  to 
identify  and  punish  infringements  of  data  subject  rights  in  practice,  as  well  as  an  effective 
administrative and judicial redress (including compensation for damages as a result of the unlawful 
processing of data subject’s personal data), are key elements for the assessment of whether a data 
protection system provides an adequate level of protection. 

115.  The EDPB welcomes that the ICO provides comprehensive information and guidelines on its website, 
which aim to raise awareness among controllers and processors in relation to their obligations and 
duties, as well as to support data subjects in order to be informed about their personal data rights 
and to assert their individual rights under the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018.  

116.  Notwithstanding  the  current  state,  the  EDPB invites  the  European  Commission  to  continuously 
observe the level of support the ICO provides specifically to individuals, whose personal data have 
been transferred to the UK under the adequacy decision, to help them exercise their rights under 
the UK data protection regime.

4. ACCESS AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA TRANSFERRED FROM THE EU 
BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THE UK 

4.1. Access and use by UK public authorities for criminal law enforcement purposes 

4.1.1. Legal bases and applicable limitations/safeguards 

117.  Regarding the assessment performed by the European Commission and documented in recitals 132 
and  following  of  the  draft  decision  on  access  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  the  European 
Commission  provides  nuanced  and  detailed  information,  and  generally  reaches  comprehensible 
conclusions.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  refrains  from  reproducing  most  of  the  factual  finding  and 
assessments in this opinion. There are, however, certain instances where the depiction of the facts 
or the explanation of the conclusions do not suffice in order for the EDPB to espouse them. 

4.1.1.1. The use of consent 

118.  The EDPB takes note that the European Commission asserts in footnote 184 of the draft decision74 
that the use of consent is not relevant in an adequacy scenario, as in transfer situations the data are 
not directly collected from a data subject by a UK law enforcement authority on the basis of consent. 
Consequently,  the  use  of  consent  as  a  legal  basis  in  policing  is  not  assessed  by  the  European 
Commission. 

119.  In  this  regard,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  Article  45(2)(a)  GDPR  requires  assessing  a  broad  array  of 
elements not limited to the transfer situation, including “the rule of law, respect for human rights 
and  fundamental  freedoms,  relevant  legislation,  both  general  and  sectoral,  including  [...]  criminal 
law”.  

120.  The EDPB notes, based also on the information provided by the European Commission in recital 38 
of its draft implementing decision pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data by the UK (hereinafter “draft LED 
adequacy  decision”),  that  the  use  of  consent,  as  framed  in  the  UK  regime  in  the  context  of  law 
enforcement, would always require a legal basis to be relied upon. This means that even if the police 
have  statutory powers to process the data for the purpose of an investigation, in certain specific 
circumstances (for example to collect a DNA sample), the police may consider appropriate to ask for 
the consent of the data subject. 

121.  The EDPB invites the European Commission to introduce in the adequacy decision its analysis on 
the possible use of consent in a law enforcement context, provided for in the draft LED adequacy 
decision. 

4.1.1.2. Search warrants and production orders  

122.  While the EDPB has no comments on the retrieval of evidence by the police through search warrants 
and production orders in general, it stems from recital 136 of the draft decision that the European 
Commission has centred its law enforcement access considerations around the police, and that the 
processing of personal data by other law enforcement agencies was less examined.  

                                                      
74 See p. 37 of the draft decision.

123.  For  example,  the  UK  Explanatory  Framework  for  Adequacy  Discussions,  Section  F:  Law 
Enforcement75, suggests on p.11 that the National Crime Agency (hereinafter “NCA”) could be a law 
enforcement agency of particular interest, which inter alia has a wider criminal intelligence function. 
The NCA describes its mission as bringing together intelligence from a range of sources in order to 
maximise analysis, assessment and tactical opportunities, including from technical interception of 
communications,  law  enforcement  partners  in  the  UK  and  overseas,  security  and  intelligence 
agencies76.  The  NCA  is  also  one  of  the  main  interlocutors  for  the  international  law  enforcement 
partners, and plays a key role in the exchange of criminal intelligence77. 

124.  The  EDPB  further  takes  note  of  the  fact  that  the  Government  Communications  Headquarters 
(hereinafter “GCHQ”), whose activities typically fall under the scope of Part 4 DPA 2018, i.e. national 
security, assumes as well an active role in reducing the societal and financial harm which serious and 
organised  crime  causes  to  the  UK,  working  closely with  the  Home  Office,  NCA,  HM Revenue  and 
Customs (“HMRC”),  and other  government  departments78.  Its  activities  relate  to countering child 
sexual  abuse;  fraud;  other  types  of  economic  crime,  including  money  laundering;  criminal  use  of 
technology;  cybercrime;  organised  immigration  crime,  including  people  trafficking;  and  drugs, 
firearms and other illicit smuggling activity.  

125.  The EDPB calls on the European Commission to complement its analysis with an analysis of the 
agencies active in the field of law enforcement that seem to have made collecting and analysing 
data,  including  personal  data,  a  focus  of  their  day-to-day  operations,  in  particular  the  NCA.  In 
addition, the EDPB invites the European Commission to have a closer look into the agencies like 
the GCHQ, whose activities fall both within the scope of law enforcement and national security, 
and the legal framework applicable to them for the processing of personal data.  

4.1.1.3. Investigatory powers for law enforcement purposes  

126.  Under Chapter 4 the GDPR Adequacy Referential ‘Essential guarantees in third countries for law 
enforcement  and national security  access to limit interferences  to fundamental rights’, the EDPB 
recalls that "[i]n this context, the court also noted critically that the previous Safe Harbor decision did

picture-of-serious-organised-crime-affecting-the-uk. 
77 While not all intelligence processed by the NCA is personal data, a  substantial portion might be personal 
information and the activities here described differ from those of classic policing, so that an assessment of 
access to personal data by law enforcement in the UK would be incomplete without thoroughly assessing the 
activities of the NCA. It seems reasonable to make sure that data protection principles are awarded the same 
meaning across all relevant law enforcement agencies, therefore shedding light on an especially data-driven 
agency such as the NCA. In addition, in “looking to the future”, the explanation continues, “[w]e continuously 
look for new opportunities to collect, develop and enhance traditional capabilities to increase the quantity and 
quality of intelligence available to exploit both in the UK and abroad.” “As part of this we are developing the 
new National Data Exploitation Capability, using the powers vested in the agency by the Crime and Courts Act, 
to link together, access and exploit data held across government.” [...] “All of this will increase our agility and 
flexibility to respond to new threats and operate in a proactive way, to gather and analyse information and 
intelligence on emerging threats so that we can take action before threats are realised.”

that country would be authorized to engage in when they pursue legitimate objectives, such as 
national  security.””79.  In  this  Referential,  the  EDPB  states  that  the  four  European  Essential 
guarantees80 need to be respected for access to data, whether for national security purposes or for 
law enforcement purposes, by all third countries in order to be considered adequate, in particular 
the  necessity  and  proportionality  with  regard  to  legitimate  objectives  pursued  need  to  be 
demonstrated. 

127.  Under  this  section of  the draft  decision,  the  European  Commission  concludes  (recital 139)  “since 
investigatory powers provided by the IPA 2016 are the same as those available to national security 
agencies, the conditions, limitations and safeguards applicable to such powers are addressed in detail 
in  the  Section  on  access  and  use  of  personal  data  by  UK  public  authorities  for  national  security 
purposes”.  However  it  stems  from  the  case-law  of  the  CJEU,  when  applying  the  necessity  and 
proportionality test to Member States’ legislation allowing for retention and access to personal data 
by public authorities, that legitimate objectives, such as national security or fighting serious crimes, 
are different and,  therefore, one might be able to justify a certain type of interference while  the 
other might not81.  

128.  The EDPB would therefore welcome a specific assessment within the decision of the necessity and 
proportionality  of  the  conditions,  limitations  and  safeguards  described  under  recitals  174  and 
following - which is a section devoted to measures pursuing national security objectives - when it 
comes  to  applying  these  conditions,  limitations  and  safeguards  in  the  context  of  a  measure 
pursuing a law enforcement objective. It thus invites the European Commission to further clarify 
whether the described retention of personal data and access to it for law enforcement purposes 
are  sufficiently  limited,  so  as  to  ensure  an  essentially  equivalent  level  of  protection  to  that 
guaranteed within the EU.  

4.1.2. Further use of the information collected for law enforcement purposes (recitals 140-
154) 

129.  The  EDPB  notes  that  the  UK  Data  Protection  Framework  provides  for  similar  safeguards  and 
limitations than the ones provided under EU law in relation to the further use of the information 
collected for law enforcement purposes.  

4.1.2.1. Further use for other law enforcement purposes 

130.  The  DPA  2018  indeed  provides  that  personal  data  collected  by  a  competent  authority  for  a  law 
enforcement purpose may be further processed (whether by the original controller or by another 
controller) for any other law enforcement purpose, provided that the controller is authorised by law 
to process data for the other purpose, and the processing is necessary and proportionate to that 
purpose. The European Commission notes that all the safeguards provided by Part 3 DPA 2018 apply 
to the processing carried out by the receiving authority. The EDPB highlights however that, under 
Part 3 DPA 2018, sections 44(4), 45(4), 48(3) and 68(7) provide for the possibility to restrict the rights 
of  data  subject,  and  section  79  provides  for  the  possibility  of  issuing  certificates  attesting  that  a

restriction  is  a  necessary  and  proportionate  measure  to  protect  national  security.  The  EDPB 
therefore recommends that the European Commission further assess the possible impact of such 
restrictions  to  the  level  of  protection  of  personal  data  in  relation  to  the  further  use  of  the 
information collected. Similarly, further clarification should also be provided in relation to the UK 
legal framework allowing for such onward sharing, in particular the Digital Economy Act 2017, as 
well as the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that allows for the sharing of information with the NCA. 

4.1.2.2. Further use for other purposes than law enforcement within the UK 

131.  The DPA 2018 also provides that personal data collected for any law enforcement purpose may be 
processed for a purpose that is not a law enforcement one when the processing is authorised by law. 
In this case, the legal basis authorising such sharing is section 19 Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. In this 
regard, the EDPB notes that the scope and provisions of section 19 Counter-Terrorism Act is not fully 
addressed in the European Commission’s assessment, and may imply further use of a broader nature, 
in  particular  as  regards  section  19(2)  which  provides  that  “[i]nformation  obtained  by  any  of  the 
intelligence services in connection with the exercise of any of its functions may be used by that service 
in connection with the exercise of any of its other functions.”  

132.  The  EDPB  also  notes  that  the  European  Commission’s  reference  to  the  fact  that  competent 
authorities are public authorities that must act in compliance with ECHR, including Article 8 thereof, 
thus  ensuring  that  all  data  sharing  between  the  law  enforcement  agencies  and  the  intelligence 
services complies with data protection legislation, and with the ECHR, could be further substantiated 
by identifying the relevant acts and laws under the UK legal order laying down clearly and precisely 
such limits. 

4.1.2.3. Further use in the context of onward transfers outside the UK 

133.  While the European Commission has referred to the fact that the UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement may 
affect onward transfers to the US from CSPs in the UK, the EDPB also highlights that the entry into 
force of this agreement may also affect the further use of the information collected through onward 
transfers from law enforcement authorities in the UK, in particular in relation to the issuance and 
transmission of orders as per Article 5 UK-US CLOUD Act Agreement. 

134.  More  broadly,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  conclusion  of  future  bilateral  agreements  with  third 
countries for the purpose of law enforcement cooperation, providing a legal basis for the transfer of 
personal data to these countries, may also significantly affect the conditions for further use of the 
information  collected,  since  such  agreements  may  affect  the  UK  Data  Protection  Framework  as 
assessed. The EDPB therefore recommends that the European Commission further assess this point, 
identifying the existence of international agreements, and clarifies whether the provisions of these 
agreements may affect the application of UK data protection law and provide for further limitation 
or exemption in relation to the further use and disclosure overseas of information collected for law 
enforcement purposes. The EDPB considers that such information and assessment are essential in 
order to allow a comprehensive assessment of the level of protection afforded by the UK legislative 
framework and practices in relation to overseas disclosure and further use. 

4.1.3. Oversight 

135.  The EDPB notes that the oversight of criminal law enforcement agencies is ensured by a combination 
of different Commissioners, in addition to the ICO. The draft adequacy findings mention the IPC, the 
Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material, as well as the Surveillance Camera 
Commissioner. In this context, it is to be noted that the CJEU has repeatedly stressed the need for 
independent oversight. Of particular importance on questions of access to personal data transferred 

Adopted 

 

32 

 

to  the  UK  is  the  IPC.  The  understanding  of  the  EDPB  is  that  the  IPC  is  a  so-called  “judicial 
commissioner”,  as  other  judicial  commissioners,  to  be  referred  to  in  the  context  of  the  national 
security chapter, and that those judicial commissioners enjoy the independence of judges, also when 
serving as commissioners. As to the office of the IPC, the European Commission explains in recital 
245 of the draft decision that it functions independently as a so-called “arm’s length body”, while 
being funded by the Home Office.  

136.  The EDPB has not found in the draft decision further indication to assess the independence of the 
Commissioner for the Retention and Use of Biometric Material, as well as of the Surveillance Camera 
Commissioner.   

137.  The  European  Commission  is  invited  to  further  assess  the  independence  of  the  judicial 
commissioners, also in cases where the Commissioner is not (anymore) serving as a judge, as well 
as  to  assess  the  independence  of  the  Commissioner  for  the  Retention  and  Use  of  Biometric 
Material, and of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner.    

4.2. General legal framework on data protection in the field of national security 

4.2.1. National security certificates 

138.  According to section 111 DPA 2018, controllers may apply for national security certificates issued by 
a  Minister,  member  of  the  Cabinet,  the  Attorney  general  or  the  Advocate  General  for  Scotland, 
certifying  that  exemptions  from  obligations  and  rights  enshrined  in  Parts  4  to  6  DPA  2018  are  a 
necessary and proportionate measure for the protection of national security. These certificates are 
meant  to  give  controllers greater  legal  certainty,  and  will  be  conclusive  evidence  of the  fact  that 
national security is applicable when processing personal data. However, it should be mentioned that 
these certificates are not required in order to rely on national security exemptions, but instead are a 
measure of transparency82. 

139.  The  EPDB  understands  from  Schedule  20  DPA  2018,  sections  17  and  18  that  a  national  security 
certificate issued under the Data Protection Act 1998 (hereinafter “old certificate”) had an extended 
effect for the processing of personal data under the DPA 2018 until 25 May 2019. Until this date, 
unless replaced or revoked, the old certificates were treated as if they were issued under the DPA 
2018.  

140.  However, where there is no express expiry date on a national security certificate issued under the 
Data Protection Act 1998, the EDPB understands that such a certificate will continue to have effect 
in  relation  to  processing  under  the  Data Protection Act 1998,  unless  the  certificate  is  revoked or 
quashed83. Even though the protection provided by these old certificates is limited to the processing 
of personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998, the EDPB takes note that new national security 
certificates can be issued under the Data Protection Act 1998 for personal data that was processed 
under the Data Protection Act 1998.84

141.  For the sake of comprehensiveness,  the EDPB invites the European Commission to clarify in its 
draft decision that national security certificates can still be issued under the Data Protection Act 
1998. Moreover, the EDPB invites the European Commission to describe in its draft decision the 
redress and oversight mechanisms with regard to certificates issued under the Data Protection Act 
1998. Finally, the EDPB invites the European Commission to include in its draft decision the number 
of existing certificates issued under the Data Protection Act 1998, and to attentively monitor this 
aspect.  

4.2.2. Right to rectification and erasure 

142.  With regard to the right to rectification and erasure, the EDPB takes note that, in accordance with 
section 100 and section 149 DPA 2018, data subjects have the possibility to rely on the High Court 
(in Scotland, the Court of Session) to order a controller to rectify or delete their data without undue 
delay.  

143.  The  EDPB  stresses  that  the  exercise  of  data  subjects’  rights  needs  to  be  effectively  ensured; 
therefore invites the European Commission to describe in its draft decision how section 100 DPA 
2018 works in practice, and to closely monitor the application of this section. 

4.2.3. Exemptions for National Security 

144.  The EDPB wants to draw attention to section 110 DPA 2018, and in particular to Schedule 11, which 
sets out the specific purposes for which intelligence services can deviate from certain data protection 
principles, including in relation to data subjects’ rights, and are not obliged to communicate personal 
data breaches to the ICO.85  

145.  The  EDPB  calls  the  European  Commission  to  clarify  further  the  scope  of  the  exemptions  as  it 
wonders whether all of the exemptions provided under Schedule 11 DPA 2018 are relevant for the 
work  of intelligence services,  and  whether  they  ensure  the  equivalence  with  the  necessity  and 
proportionality principle. In particular, the EDPB invites the European Commission to provide more 
clarification under which circumstances an intelligence service could rely on section 10 of Schedule 
11 DPA 2018, which states that “[t]he listed provisions do not apply to personal data that consists 
of records of the intentions of the controller in relation to any negotiations with the data subject 
to  the  extent  that  the  application  of  the  listed  provisions  would  be  likely  to  prejudice  the 
negotiations.” 

4.3. Access and use by UK public authorities for national security purposes 

146.  As a general remark, the EDPB acknowledges that States are granted a broad margin of appreciation 
in matters of national security, which is also recognised by the ECtHR. The EDPB also recalls that, as 
underlined in its updated recommendations on the European essential guarantees for surveillances 
measures86, Article 6(3) Treaty on European Union establishes that the fundamental rights enshrined 
in the ECHR constitute general principles of EU law. However, as the CJEU recalls in its jurisprudence, 

                                                      
85 These purposes are the prevention and detection of “Crime”, “Information required to be disclosed by law 
etc or in connection with legal proceedings”, “Parliamentary privilege”, “Judicial proceedings”, “Crown honours 
and  dignities”,  “Armed  forces”,  “Economic  well-being”,  “Legal  professional  privilege”,  “Negotiations”, 
“Confidential  references  given  by  the  controller”,  “Exam  scripts  and  marks”,  “Research  and  statistics”  and 
“Archiving in the public interest”.  
86 See EDPB Recommendations 02/2020 on the European Essential Guarantees for surveillance measures.

the latter does not constitute, as long as the EU has not acceded to it, a legal instrument which has 
been  formally  incorporated  into  EU  law87.  Thus,  the  level  of  protection  of  fundamental  rights 
required by Article 45 GDPR must be determined on the basis of the provisions of that regulation, 
read in the light of the fundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter. This being said, according to 
Article 52(3) EU Charter, the rights contained therein that correspond to rights guaranteed by the 
ECHR are to have the same meaning and scope as those laid down by the ECHR. Consequently, as 
recalled by the CJEU, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR concerning rights that are also foreseen in the 
EU  Charter  must  be  taken  into  account,  as  a  minimum  threshold  of  protection  to  interpret 
corresponding rights in the EU Charter88. According to the last sentence of Article 52(3) EU Charter, 
however, “[t]his provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.”  

147.  Therefore, in the following assessment, the EDPB has taken into account the jurisprudence of the 
ECtHR, to the extent that the EU Charter, as interpreted by the CJEU, does not provide for a higher 
level of protection which prescribes other requirements than the ECtHR case-law.  

4.3.1. Legal bases, limitations and safeguards - Investigatory powers exercised in the context 

of national security  

4.3.1.1. General remarks 

148.  The EDPB recalls that the IPA 2016 is a recent law that amended several provisions of the Intelligence 
Services  Act  1994.  It  sets  out  the  extent  to  which  certain  investigatory  powers  may  be  used  to 
interfere with privacy89. Despite two reports of the IPC that provide useful information concerning 
the application of this new legal framework, there is still no review of certain aspects, in particular 
concerning the selectors and search criteria used.  

149.  Also, as a general remark concerning the IPA 2016 and its scope of application, the EDPB highlights 

the following four points of attention: 

150.  In relation to the first point of attention, with regard to the features of the law, the EDPB would like 

to underline two aspects: 

151.  First, the EDPB notes that the legislation refers to broad purposes for the use of procedures provided 
for in the IPA 2016 and not to the categories of individuals who may be concerned by the collection 
of data on the basis of Parts 2 to 7 IPA 2016. In this regard, the EDPB recalls that there should be a 
link between the categories of individuals who may be the subject of surveillance measures and the 
purposes pursued by the legislation to define the personal scope of the law. 

152.  Furthermore,  the  EDPB  also  stresses  that  the  definition  of  “telecommunications  operators”, 
“telecommunications service” and “telecommunications system”, which define the scope of the law, 
are also very broad and unclear to some extent. Indeed, the EDPB highlights that these notions, in 
the  field  of  the  IPA  2016,  have  to  be  understood  in  a  much  broader  manner  than  under  the 
telecommunications legislations, as defined for instance in the European Electronic Communications 
Code90.  The  EDPB  notes 
the  definitions  of  “telecommunications  service”  and 

that

89 See section 1 IPA 2016. 
90  See  Article  2  (5)  of  the  European  Electronic  Communications  Code  which  defines,  for  instance, 
‘interpersonal communications service’ as “a service normally provided for remuneration that enables direct

35 

 

“telecommunication system” in the Act are said to be intentionally broad so that they will remain 
relevant for new technologies. Likewise, the definition of a telecommunications operator is also very 
broad, and could for instance include online videogames with a chat feature included, or other online 
websites merely including such chat windows91.  

153.  In  addition,  whereas  procedures  and  oversight  concerning  the  assessment  of  the  necessity  and 
proportionality of collection and access to data are generally provided, the criteria to proceed to 
such  an  assessment  are  not  defined  in  the  law  itself.  Additional  elements  can  be  found  in  other 
documents, such as Codes of practice. 

154.  However, as recalled in the EDPB Recommendations 02/2020 on the European Essential Guarantees 
for surveillance measures, the CJEU has indicated that “the requirement that any limitation on the 
exercise of fundamental rights must be provided for by law implies that the legal basis which permits 
the interference with those rights must itself define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the 
right concerned”92. More precisely, the CJEU clarified that “[i]n order to satisfy the requirement of 
proportionality,  the  legislation  must  lay  down  clear  and  precise  rules  governing  the  scope  and 
application of the measure in question and imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose 
personal data is affected have sufficient guarantees that data will be effectively protected against 
the risk of abuse. That legislation must be legally binding under domestic law and, in particular, must 
indicate in what circumstances and under which conditions a measure providing for the processing 
of  such  data  may  be  adopted,  thereby  ensuring  that  the  interference  is  limited  to  what  is strictly 
necessary.”93 

155.  The ECtHR also stressed the importance of the clarity of the law to give individuals “an adequate 
indication  as  to  the  circumstances  in  which  and  the  conditions  on  which  public  authorities  are 
empowered to resort to any such measures”94.   

156.  The EDPB therefore calls on the European Commission to further assess these aspects concerning 
the preciseness, clarity and exhaustiveness of the relevant law, and to provide further elements to 
demonstrate it provides a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the 
EU with regard to the features of the law. The EDPB also stresses that broad definitions should also 
be assessed in relation to the proportionality of the interception measures. 

157.  In  addition,  although  several  internal  codes  of  the  competent  intelligence  community  authorities 
partly develop some of these elements, for instance concerning the assessment of the necessity and 
proportionality of collection of data, the EDPB stresses that the requirements of the CJEU in relation 
to the nature of the law imply that the core elements, including for individuals to be able to rely on 

                                                      
interpersonal and interactive exchange of information via electronic communications networks between a finite 
number  of  persons,  whereby  the  persons  initiating  or  participating  in  the  communication  determine  its 
recipient(s) and does not include services which enable interpersonal and interactive communication merely as 
a minor ancillary feature that is intrinsically linked to another service”.

them  in  the  context  of  redress,  must  be  provided  in  legislation  providing  for  actionable  rights95. 
Indeed, Schedule 7, paragraph 6 IPA 2016 mentions the fact that courts (and supervisory authorities) 
“take into account a failure by a person to have regard to a code in determining a question in any 
such  proceedings”  without  clarifying  whether  individuals  can  claim  a  breach  of  the  codes  before 
courts  (or  supervisory  authorities).  Moreover,  the  elements  provided  so  far  in  the  draft  decision 
either refer to the recognition by the ECtHR of the foreseeability of the rules provided96  in those 
codes, rather than to their “actionability” in court, as required by the CJEU, or to the fact that UK 
Courts  have  in  some  cases  referred  to  codes,  while  none  of  the  cases  mentioned  illustrate  the 
possibility for individuals to action rights derived from the codes. If it is concluded that UK law does 
not indicate sufficiently the circumstances and conditions under which a measure may be adopted 
and  that  these  elements  are  in  fact  provided  by  internal  codes  of  the  intelligence  community 
authorities, the EDPB would thus call on the European Commission to further assess whether the 
limitations and safeguards provided in the different internal codes of the intelligence community 
authorities may be actioned by individuals before a court and enforced.   

158.  The second point of attention concerns the fact that the provisions relating to, on the one hand, 
targeted  acquisition  and  retention  of  communications  data  and,  on  the  other  hand,  to  bulk 
collection, either in the IPA 2016 or in other legislations such as the Intelligence Services Act 1994, 
or the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, will also apply to data transferred from the EU 
to the UK. Concerning bulk collection, the EDPB underlines that the relevant provisions of UK law 
allow for the collection of data outside the UK; thus could include data in transit transferred from 
the  EEA  to  the  UK on  the basis  of  the  adequacy  decision97.  Moreover,  the  EDPB notices  that  the 
European  Commission  indicates  that  “[i]t  should  be  noted  that  the  retention  and  acquisition  of 
communications data normally does not concern personal data of EU data subjects transferred under 
this Decision to the UK. The obligation to retain or disclose communications data pursuant to Part 3 
and 4 of the IPA 2016 covers data that is collected by telecommunication operators in the UK directly 
from the users of a telecommunication service.”98 Nevertheless, the EDPB highlights the lack of clarity 
concerning  the  fact  that  only  establishments  of  these  operators  situated  in  the  UK  can  receive 
requests from the competent  UK authorities since the  definition of telecommunications operator 
provided in section 261(10) IPA 2016 requires that “a telecommunications operator is a person who 
offers or provides a telecommunications service to persons in the UK or who controls or provides a 
telecommunication system which is (wholly or partly) in or controlled from the UK”. Consequently, 
personal  data  of  EEA  data  subjects  could  actually  be  concerned,  for  instance  in  the  case  of  data 
collected or generated by an establishment of a UK telecommunications operator located within the 
EEA, transferred to an establishment of this same operator situated in the UK on the basis of the 
adequacy decision (for commercial purposes), and then collected, within the UK, by the competent 
public authorities.  

                                                      
95 In this regard, the CJEU considered for instance that PPD 28 in the US, did not qualify, although it provided 
also some limitations with regard to bulk collection, see Schrems II, para 181. 
96  See  ECtHR,  Big  Brother  Watch  and  others  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  13  September  2018, 
ECLI:CE:ECHR:2018:0913JUD005817013  (hereinafter  “Big  Brother  Watch”),  para.  325:  “As  the  IC  Code  is  a 
public document, subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament, and has to be taken into account both 
by those exercising interception duties and by courts and tribunals, the Court has expressly accepted that its 
provisions could be taken into consideration in assessing the foreseeability of the RIPA regime.” 
97 See para 183 and following of Schrems II on the assessment of a legislation providing for access to data in 
transit between the EU and a third country in the context of an adequacy decision. 
98 See recital 196 of the draft decision. 

Adopted 

 

37 

 

159.  The EDPB is therefore of the view that the assessment of these provisions are also relevant for the 
assessment  of  the  level  of  adequacy  of  the  UK  legal  framework  and  calls  on  the  European 
Commission to clarify this aspect, and further assess to what extent this is the case. In particular, 
the  EDPB  calls  on  the  European  Commission  to  clarify  its  understanding  of  the  scope  of  this 
legislation,  including  of what  the  notion  of  “users of  telecommunications  services”  covers,  and 
whether data from establishments of telecommunications operators outside the UK, to the extent 
that data of EEA data subjects are concerned, could be requested, given the very broad definition 
of telecommunications operators.  

160.  The  third  point  of  attention  concerns  the  “double-lock”  procedure.  The  EDPB  notes  that  a  new 
“double-lock”  procedure  has  been  introduced  in  the  IPA  2016.  Nonetheless,  the  EDPB  also 
understands that even if, in principle, collection or access to data for national security or intelligence 
purposes  can only  take  place  with  a warrant  approved  by  a  Judicial  Commissioner,  the  IPA  2016 
provides that “in specific limited cases lawful interception without a warrant is possible and only prior 
authorisation by the competent IC authorities themselves is required [see infra section on Oversight], 
including  for  interceptions  in  accordance  with  overseas  requests  (section 52  of the  IPA  2016)”.  As 
underlined hereafter, this also concurs to the concerns of the EDPB with regard, notably, to overseas 
disclosures. In addition, the EDPB also notes that for equipment interference, be it targeted or in 
bulk, a derogation to the double-lock procedure is also possible, and that the Judicial Commissioner 
is entitled to approve only the renewal of bulk warrants, after a maximum initial period of 6 months. 
The EDPB calls on the European Commission to further assess and demonstrate that even in cases 
where the double-lock procedure does not apply, the UK legal framework provides for appropriate 
safeguards, including through the effective ex post oversight and redress possibilities offered to 
the individuals, to ensure that the level of protection provided is essentially equivalent to the one 
provided within the EU (see also infra section 4.3.3 on Oversight). 

161.  Moreover,  although  the  IPA  2016  has  indeed  introduced  the  “double-lock”  procedure,  the  EDPB 
remains concerned with regard to certain features of the new legislation. Following the presentation 
of the corresponding sections of the draft decision, the EDPB has analysed the following types of 
collection and access to data in the same order as presented by the European Commission. The order 
of the elements assessed hereafter therefore does not reflect a hierarchy in terms of level of concern 
of the EDPB. 

4.3.1.2. Targeted acquisition and retention of communications data  

162.  The  EDPB  notes  that  there  are  two  officials  who  can  grant  targeted  authorisations  for  obtaining 
communications data: the authorising officer in the Office for Communications Data Authorisations 
(hereinafter “the IPC”), a designated senior officer (a person holding a prescribed office or rank in a 
relevant public authority), in addition to the approval by a Judicial Commissioner in certain cases. 
However, it remains unclear for the EDPB, under the law and the relevant code, exactly which official 
authorises  which  type  of  targeted  acquisition  of  communications  data,  and  to  what  extent  a 
designated officer would be sufficiently independent99. 

163.  The EDPB consequently calls on the European Commission to further assess this aspect and provide 

clearer explanations on these elements. 

164.  Concerning the notice requiring the retention of communication data, the EDPB also notes that such 
notices can be addressed to a “description of operators”. This notion appears to mean that several 
                                                      
99 See also infra concerning the assessment of the double-lock procedure and the independence of the Judicial 
Commissioner.

operators can be requested at the same time to all retain data. Indeed, the targeted nature of the 
acquisition does not relate to the number of operators, but to the name or description of persons, 
organisations, location or group of persons that constitute the “target”, a description of the nature 
of the investigation and a description of the activities for which the equipment is used. The EDPB 
therefore highlights that, depending on the number of operators concerned by such “description of 
operators”, the notice may be broader than what the procedure for targeted retention may seem to 
imply. The EDPB invites the  European Commission to further assess this aspect,  and to provide 
further  assurances  that,  even  when  notices  are  addressed  to  several  operators,  they  remain 
limited to what is strictly necessary and proportionate.   

4.3.1.3. Equipment interference  

165.  The EDPB notes that “equipment interference” can derogate from the double-lock procedure in case 
of  urgency100.  The  EDPB  is  therefore  concerned  that  the  purposes  for  which  such  equipment 
interference can be required are broad, and that the criteria for urgency (in which case the Judicial 
Commissioner is not required to provide an ex ante authorisation following an assessment of the 
necessity  and  proportionality  of  the  equipment  interference)  remain  unclear.  Since  in  the  latter 
situation “the warrant ceases to have affect and may not be renewed” in case where the Judicial 
Commissioner does not approve the equipment interference ex post, the EDPB understands that the 
data collected meanwhile remain lawfully collected. For these data to be deleted, a specific order of 
the Judicial Commissioner may be issued101. 

166.  The EDPB calls on the European Commission to further assess the conditions under which urgency 
can be invoked, and to provide clarifications concerning the possible avenues for the exercise of 
rights for the data subjects concerned, and possible redress avenues offered to them in the context 
of equipment interference operations, especially when they take place in the context of urgency 
leading to a derogation to the double-lock procedure. 

4.3.1.4. Bulk interception of data from bearers  

167.  As  described  in the  report  of  the  bulk  powers review102  “[b]ulk  interception  typically  involves  the 
collecting of communications as they transit particular bearers (communication links).” The official 
IPA 2016 factsheet  describes “bulk interception” as “the process for the collection of a volume of 
communications followed by the selection of specific communications to be read, looked at or listened 
to where it is necessary and proportionate.” The EDPB notes that “bulk interception” of data actually 
implies the collection of data even before any filtering by selectors (either simple in the context of 
the  monitoring  of  individuals  already  known  to  pose  a  threat,  or  complex,  in  the  context  of  the 
identification of new threats and of previously unknown persons of interest).  

168.  The acquisition of bulk communications data was also one of the issues examined by the CJEU in the 
Privacy International case, which resulted in a judgment of the Grand Chamber issued on 6 October 
2020 (in addition to whether such collection of data was performed in the context of EU law, even 
for national security purposes). The IPA 2016 has replaced the legislation that was the subject of this 
judgment.  

169.  The EDPB notes that, with the introduction of the IPA 2016 in UK law, a warrant is now required also 
to intercept data in bulk. The process to issue this warrant relies on the determination of “operational 
purposes”. The list of these operational purposes is established by heads of intelligence services, and 
                                                      
100 See section 109 IPA 2016.

102 See Report of the bulk powers review, by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, August 2016.  

Adopted 

 

39 

 

then approved by the Secretary of State. This decision is itself approved by an independent Judicial 
Commissioner  who  must  review  whether  the  warrant  is  necessary  and  proportionate  to  the 
operational  purposes.  The  EDPB  understands  that  the  Judicial  Commissioner  does  not  have  the 
power to assess the operational purposes  themselves, but  whether the warrant  is necessary and 
proportionate to the operational purposes listed in the warrant. The Parliamentary Intelligence and 
Security Committee is provided with a copy of the list every three months, and the Prime Minister 
reviews the list of these operational purposes at least once a year.  

170.  However, on the basis of the elements provided by the European Commission in the draft decision, 
it appears difficult to assess the scope of these operational purposes provided in the list and whether 
the collection of data they allow meets the threshold set by the CJEU (for instance circumscribing the 
collection of data to a geographical area could be as narrow as a few streets, as well as collecting 
data from the EEA as a whole).  

171.  In addition, the EDPB underlines that data collected in bulk may be retained for long periods (to be 
available for further access for examination). Indeed, the EDPB notes that section 150, paragraphs 5 
and 6 IPA 2016 provide only for the destruction of the copies of the data collected, and only if their 
retention is not necessary, or not likely to become necessary, in the interests of national security or 
any  other  grounds  falling  under  the  scope  of  section  138(2)  IPA  2016,  or  if  the  retention  is  not 
necessary for several other purposes103. The EDPB stresses that these grounds appear very broad, 
and in any case only copies of the data obtained are mentioned. 

172.  Furthermore, the EDPB also notes that in urgent cases, the IPA 2016 also allows for the modification 
of  warrants  without  the  prior-approval  of  a  Judicial  Commissioner,  and  that  in  such  case,  if  the 
Judicial Commissioner consulted ex post within three working days after the modification refuses to 
approve the modification, the warrant should have effect as if the modification had not been made, 
but  the  data  collected  in-between  remain  collected  lawfully104.  For  these  data  to  be  deleted,  a 
specific order of the Judicial Commissioner may be issued105. 

173.  The EDPB therefore calls on the European Commission for further clarifications and assessment of 
bulk interceptions, in particular on the selection and application of selectors in the context of these 
bulk  interception  procedures  to  clarify  the  extent  to  which  access  to  personal  data  meets  the 
threshold set by the CJEU (see also below section 4.3.1.7., in particular on the oversight on the 
selectors),  and  which  safeguards  are  in  place  to  protect  the  fundamental  rights  of  individuals 
whose data are intercepted in this context, including concerning the retention periods of data. An 
independent assessment from UK competent oversight authorities would be particularly useful.  

174.  The  EDPB  also  underlines  that 

it  seems  all  the  more  critical  that  “overseas-related 
communications” which are within the scope of bulk interception practices appear to imply that 
data could be directly intercepted and collected in bulk within the EEA by the UK, including for 
data in transit between the EEA and the UK that would fall within the scope of the draft decision 
(see below section 4.3.2. on further use of the information collected for national security purposes 
and overseas disclosure).

4.3.1.5. Protection and safeguards for secondary data 

175.  In addition, the EDPB is concerned that the UK relevant legislation related to bulk interception does 
not provide for the same level of protection to all communications data. “Secondary data”, which 
can be obtained with a bulk warrant are, according to section 137 IPA 2016, both “systems data”, 
“which  is  comprised  in,  included  as  part  of,  attached  to  or  logically  associated  with  the 
communication (whether by the sender or otherwise)”, and “identifying data”, “which is comprised 
in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with the communication (whether by the 
sender  or  otherwise),  is  capable  of  being  logically  separated  from  the  remainder  of  the 
communication, and if it were so separated, would not reveal anything of what might reasonably be 
considered to be the meaning (if any) of the communication, disregarding any meaning arising from 
the  fact  of  the  communication  or  from  any  data  relating  to  the  transmission  of  the 
communication”106.  

176.  The EDPB notes that these “secondary data”, also known as “metadata”107, collected in bulk, seem 
not  to  benefit  from  the  same  safeguards  as  data  collected  with  a  targeted  warrant,  but  also  as 
content data collected in bulk. Indeed, the EDPB notices that the selection of any of the intercepted 
content benefits from more safeguards108 than the selection of secondary data109.  

177.  Furthermore, the EDPB stresses that both the ECtHR110 and the CJEU111 have questioned the fact that 
such data are less sensitive than others, and in particular than content data. Indeed, the Code of 
Practice concerning interceptions presents as examples of “secondary data” (both “systems data” 
such as router configurations, email addresses or users ID; but also alternative account identifiers, 
as well as “identifying data”, such as the location of a meeting in a calendar appointment, photograph 
information, such as the time, date and location when it was taken).  The EDPB thus stresses the 
consistent assessment by the ECtHR and the CJEU, and recalls the concerns expressed in relation 
to secondary data that should benefit from specific safeguards due to their sensitivity. The EDPB 

                                                      
106 “Systems data” and “identifying data” are defined in section 263 IPA 2016. 
107 See Report of the bulk powers review, by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, August 2016. 
 
108 See section 152, subsection 1, point c) and subsections 3 and following IPA 2016. 
109 See section 152, subsection 1, points a) and b) IPA 2016. 
110 See ECtHR, Big Brother Watch, para. 357, under referral to the Grand Chamber: “Consequently, while the 
Court does not doubt that related communications data is an essential tool for the intelligence services in the 
fight against terrorism and serious crime, it does not consider that the authorities have struck a fair balance 
between  the  competing  public  and  private  interests  by  exempting  it  in  its  entirety  from  the  safeguards 
applicable  to  the  searching  and  examining  of  content.  While  the  Court  does  not  suggest  that  related 
communications data should only be accessible for the purposes of determining whether or not an individual is 
in  the  British  Islands,  since  to  do  so  would  be  to  require  the  application  of  stricter  standards  to  related 
communications  data  than  apply  to  content,  there  should  nevertheless  be  sufficient  safeguards  in  place  to 
ensure  that  the  exemption  of  related  communications  data  from  the  requirements  of  section  16  of  RIPA  is 
limited to the extent necessary to determine whether an individual is, for the time being, in the British Islands..”  
111 See CJEU, Privacy International, para. 71: “The interference with the right enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter 
entailed by the transmission of traffic data and location data to the security and intelligence agencies must be 
regarded as being particularly serious, bearing in mind inter alia the sensitive nature of the information which 
that data may provide and, in particular, the possibility of establishing a profile of the persons concerned on 
the basis of that data, such information being no less sensitive than the actual content of communications. In 
addition, it is likely to generate in the minds of the persons concerned the feeling that their private lives are the 
subject of constant surveillance (see, by analogy, judgments of 8 April 2014, Digital Rights Ireland and Others, 
C-293/12 and C-594/12, EU:C:2014:238, paragraphs 27 and 37, and of 21 December 2016, Tele2, C-203/15 and 
C-698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraphs 99 and 100).” 

Adopted

therefore calls on the European Commission to carefully assess whether the safeguards provided 
under  UK  law  for  such  category  of  personal  data  ensure  an  essentially  equivalent  level  of 
protection to the one guaranteed in the EU. 

4.3.1.6. Automated processing of communications data 

178.  The EDPB notes that intelligence community authorities do not only use simple or complex selectors 
to filter the data acquired in bulk, but that they may also rely on other automated processing tools 
to analyse “large volumes of information, which enables the Agencies also to find linkages, patterns, 
associations  or  behaviours  which  might  demonstrate  a  serious  threat  requiring  investigation”, 
according to the Intelligence and Security Committee report 2015112. The EDPB is aware of the fact 
that  this  public  report  concerns  practices  under  the  previous  legal  framework,  which  was 
subsequently  replaced  by  the  IPA  2016.  Nevertheless,  it  sees  a  need  for  further  independent 
assessment and oversight of the use of automated processing tools by the competent UK oversight 
authorities, and calls on the European Commission to further assess this issue and the safeguards 
that would and/or could be afforded to EEA data subjects in this context. 

4.3.1.7. Compliance risks and incompliant practices of competent Intelligence Community authorities 

179.  The EDPB takes note that detailed oversight reports are available. They provide for valuable elements 
as  to  what  they  assess  as  positive  compliance  practices,  as  well  as  to  the  compliance  risks  and 
incompliant practices identified. 

180.  In this regard, according to the IPC in its report for 2019, several elements concerning the application 
of  the  legal  framework  by  the  different  competent  authorities  have  revealed  some  (risks  of) 
incompliances by the competent authorities. 

181.  First,  the  EDPB  has  noticed  that  the  criteria  to  classify  a  dataset  as  bulk  personal  dataset  or  as 
targeted data do not seem to be always clear for the MI5 and SIS themselves, in particular for the 
MI5, which can lead to the absence of appropriate safeguards applied to the data113. In its report on 
2019, the IPC suggested that “this question should be resolved as a priority”114. Also in relation to 
bulk personal datasets, the EDPB notes that for the GCHQ, although the classification of bulk personal 
datasets seems to be satisfying (but yet remains to be audited by the IPC), in March 2019, the internal 
compliance  review  of  warrants  by  the  dedicated  team  raised  serious  concerns,  with  50%  of  the 
justifications for bulk acquisition warrants that were reviewed by the GCHQ compliance team that 
did not meet the required standard. According to the IPC, the compliance team had begun work to

its impact in managing internal compliance. We continue to seek greater clarity regarding the process MI5 uses

for  example,  as  targeted  data.  We  were  concerned  by  one  unresolved  action  on  the  BOP  minutes  around 
resolving discrepancies between allocations of BPD between MI5 and SIS. It is possible, because of the different 
uses of the data and the different cuts of data being held, that both agencies could hold the same dataset, or 
versions of it, and that it could lawfully be categorised as bulk by one and targeted data by the other. There is 
a risk that, if one of the agencies has incorrectly categorised the data holding as targeted then that data would 
be held without appropriate warrant and might not be subject to appropriate safeguards.”

investigate the problem and retrain staff to improve this standard. The refreshed training on the IPA 
2016 provisions and the additional training provided by policy and compliance networks (hereinafter 
“PCNs”) have improved GCHQ’s compliance in this area. The IPC does not expect to see a slip in this 
standard at future inspections, but will continue to review this area closely115. The EDPB therefore 
shares  the  view  that  further  review  and  monitoring  of  the  said  elements  by  the  European 
Commission  is  needed  as  part  of  the  assessment  of  the  level  of  protection  to  ensure  that  this 
standard  is  improved,  as  underlined  in  the  IPC’s  report,  and  recalls  that  implementation  and 
concrete application of the legal framework shall also be taken into account as provided under 
Article 45 GDPR when assessing the essential equivalence of a third country. 

182.  More broadly, the EDPB stresses the points of attention shared by the IPC concerning the “task-based 
searches” led by the MI5 officers – which allows an investigator to conduct more than one search of 
the  bulk  personal  data  sets  available  to  them,  and  the  “serious  compliance  risks  associated  with 
certain  technology  environments  in  use  by  MI5”,  concerning  where  data  were  stored  in  the 
environment, who had access to them, the extent to which they were being copied or shared, the 
deletion processes which applied to them, as well as concerning retention periods. Although the IPC 
indicates that measures have been taken and safeguards introduced, some of them remain manual 
and  led  on  an  individual,  human-basis,  it  highlights  that  it  is  critical  that  the  “MI5  continues  to 
maintain these new processes and to provide sufficient resources for them to function effectively. If 
MI5 identifies an increase in non-compliant behaviours”116. The IPC expects they would be brought 
to its attention as soon as possible. The EDPB therefore calls on the European Commission to closely 
monitor these aspects in the future. 

183.  Concerning the GCHQ, the EDPB also understands from the report of the IPC that, for operations 
conducted under the bulk warrants, “the quality of applications for internal approval was variable 
and we observed that there was room for improvement in the way that such applications were set 
out”117,  and  that  for  targeted  equipment  interference,  the  explanations  for  the  use  of  general 
descriptors were sometimes too general and imprecise118. The EDPB also noticed that in the context 
of  bulk  equipment  interference,  the  IPC  recommends  that  “applications  should  consistently  and 
explicitly  record  the 
intelligence 
requirements”119, that “all applications should clearly address the potential for collateral intrusion 
and relevant mitigations when assessing proportionality“120, and that the IPC stressed that despite 
progress, “there is still room for improvement”121 and further attention will be needed as well in the 
future.

184.  In relation to the bulk interception regime under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 
(hereinafter “RIPA 2000”) which has since been replaced by provisions in the IPA 2016, the EDPB 
recalls that the insufficient oversight, both of the selection of Internet bearers for interception and 
the filtering, search and selection of intercepted communications for examination, was one of the 
core aspects that the ECtHR deemed incompliant with Article 8 ECHR with regard to the previous 
legislation on the investigatory powers of UK authorities in the context of national security in the Big 
Brother  Watch  case,  now  referred  to  the  Grand  Chamber.  The  EDPB  invites  the  European

Commission to verify the state of play of the proceedings, to take these elements into account, 
and to specify them in the adequacy decision should the European Commission adopt it.  

185.  In this case, the ECtHR was: “not persuaded that the safeguards governing the selection of bearers 
for interception and the selection of intercepted material for examination are sufficiently robust to 
provide adequate guarantees against abuse. Of greatest concern, however, is the absence of robust 
independent  oversight  of  the  selectors  and  search  criteria  used  to 
intercepted 
communications.”122 As highlighted by the IPC, “this finding echoed a similar recommendation in the 
Intelligence  and  Security  Committee’s  Privacy  and  Security:  A  modern  and  transparent  legal 
framework  report  of  March  2015”123.  The  EDPB  welcomes  the  fact  that  consequently,  the  IPC 
conducted  a  review  of  its  approach  to  inspecting  bulk  interception  in  2019,  “which  included  a 
careful  review  of  the  technically  complex  ways  in  which  bulk  interception  is  actually 
implemented”124 and committed to include “a detailed examination of the selectors and search 
criteria  alluded  to  above  by  the  ECtHR”125  in  the  inspections  of  bulk  interception  from  2020 
onwards. Given the importance of this aspect, the EDPB is concerned that a detailed examination 
of  the  selectors  and  search  criteria  by  the  IPC  has  not  been  carried  out  yet,  and  calls  on  the 
European  Commission  to  closely  monitor  developments  in  this  regard,  especially  since  the 
concrete format of such oversight remains to be clarified126.

4.3.2. Further use of the information collected for national security purposes and overseas 

disclosure 

186.  When it comes to the further use of the information collected for national security purposes, the 
European Commission refers in its assessment to section 87(1) DPA 2018, which indeed provides that 
“personal data so collected must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purpose 
for which it is collected”. The EDPB however points out that this provision may be subject to national 
security exemptions as per section 110 DPA 2018. The EDPB furthermore notes that, whether for 
targeted interception and examination, for targeted acquisition and retention of communications 
data, for targeted equipment interference or for bulk interception and bulk equipment interference, 
the legislation provides for the possibility of “overseas disclosure”.  

4.3.2.1. Further use, overseas disclosure and the applicable legal framework in the UK 

187.  The European Commission has identified Part 4 DPA 2018, and in particular its section 109 as relevant 
provisions  setting out  specific  requirements  for  the  further  use of the  information  collected,  and 
notably  the  international  transfer  of  personal  data  by  intelligence  services  to  third  countries  or 
international  organisations.  However,  the  EDPB  notes  that  section 110  DPA  2018  provides  for  a 
national  security  exemption  specifying  that  certain  provisions  of  the  DPA  2018  do  not  apply  if 
exemption from these provisions is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. The 
concerned provisions that may not apply include chapter 2 of Part 4 DPA 2018 in relation to the data 
protection principles, including purpose limitation, as well as chapter 3 of Part 4 DPA 2018 in relation 
to data subject rights. Section 109 DPA 2018, read in conjunction with section 110 DPA 2018 and the 
conditions under which it applies may lead to cases where an international transfer of personal data

by intelligence services to third countries takes place without applying provisions related to the data 
protection principles and data subject rights. 

188.  As identified by the European Commission, such exemption must be assessed case-by-case, and can 
be invoked only as far as the application of a particular provision would have negative consequences 
for national security. Indeed, the issuance of a national certificate for the UK intelligence services 
aims  at  certifying  that  an  exemption  is  required  in  respect  of  specified  personal  data  that  are 
processed  for  the  purpose  of  safeguarding  national  security. The  EDPB  however  notes  that  in  its 
guidance for national security certificate under the DPA 2018, the UK Home Office clarifies that “[i]t 
is important to note from the outset that a certificate is not required in order to rely on the national 
security  exemption;  in  fact,  in  most  cases,  controllers  will  determine  for  themselves  whether  the 
national security exemption is applicable.” 127 Furthermore, the UK Home Office guidance notes that 
“national security certificates may apply to personal data which can be specifically identified or cover 
a broader category of personal data. They may be pre-emptive as well as retrospective.” 128 National 
security exemption may therefore apply in relation to an international transfer of personal data by 
intelligence services to third countries in the absence of a national security certificate. 

189.  The EDPB furthermore notes that, for example, the national security certificate DPA/S27/Security 
Service129 provides that until 24 July 2024, personal data processed “for, on behalf of, at the request 
of or with the aid or assistance of the Security Service or” and “where such processing is necessary to 
facilitate the proper discharge of the functions of the Security Service described in section 1 of the 
Security Service Act 1989” are exempted from the corresponding provisions in UK law to Chapter V 
GDPR in relation to transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations. While 
the other national security certificates publicly available do not provide for an exemption from the 
provisions of  section  109 DPA  2018,  it  is  to  be  recalled  that  some  or  all of the  text of  a  national 
security  certificate  may  be  withheld  if  its  publication  would  be  against  the  interests  of  national 
security, would be contrary to the public interest, or might jeopardise the safety of any person. 

190.  In general, while assessing the draft decision in relation to these provisions, the EDPB observes that 
the safeguards for these disclosures solely comprise the requirement that the recipient of the data 
respects requirements concerning the security of data, the extent of the disclosure limited to what 
is  necessary,  the  retention  of  data  and  the  restriction  of  access  to  data  to  a  limited  number  of 
persons. Thus, the EDPB underlines that when it comes to overseas disclosures, the application of 
the national security exemption provided under UK law may lead to situations where safeguards 
ensuring  that  the  principles  of  purpose  limitation, necessity  and  proportionality,  as  well  as  the 
rights for the individuals, oversight and redress would  not be fully provided or respected in the 
third  country  of  destination.  The  EDPB  therefore  recommends  the  European  Commission  to 
further  examine  the  overall  safeguards  provided  under  UK  law  when  it  comes  to  overseas 
disclosure, in particular in light of the application of national security exemptions. 

4.3.2.2. Overseas disclosure and intelligence sharing in the context of international cooperation 

191.  The  EDPB  also  notes  that  the  European  Commission  did  not  consider,  as  part  of  its  adequacy 
assessment,  existing  international  agreements  concluded  between  the  UK  and  third  countries  or

international organisations that may provide for specific provisions for the international transfer of 
personal data by intelligence services to third countries.  

192.  The EDPB also stresses that the European Commission’s assessment mainly relies on the assessment 
of Part 4 DPA 2018, and is notably concerned that the IPA 2016 focuses on ‘requests’ to exchange 
intelligence with foreign partners, but does not address other forms of intelligence sharing. The EDPB 
notes  in  this  regard  that  the  European  Commission  draft  decision  does  not  refer  or  assess  the 
articulation  between  the  UK  legislative  framework  with  the  “UK-US  Communication  Intelligence 
Agreement”  (“UK-US  CI  Agreement”).  In  a  recent  statement  marking  the  75th  Anniversary  of  this 
agreement, the  US National Security Agency  (hereinafter “NSA”) mentioned that this partnership 
allows  “to  share  information  between  the  two  agencies  as  much  as  possible,  with  minimal 
restrictions” and  that “this ground-breaking document  created the policies  and procedures for UK 
and US intelligence professionals for sharing communication, translation, analysis, and code breaking 
information.”130 This agreement also became the foundation for other intelligence partnership with 
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. 

193.  The secret nature of this agreement and its specific provisions raise a serious challenge in terms of 
clarity  and  foreseeability  of  the  law  in  relation  to  the  further  use  and  overseas  disclosure  of 
information  collected  by  UK  authorities  for  national  security  purposes.  In  this  context,  the  EDPB 
recalls that when it comes to the level of protection guaranteed within the EU, the CJEU has stressed 
that legislation involving interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data 
must  “lay  down  clear  and  precise  rules  governing  the  scope  and  application  of  a  measure  and 
imposing minimum safeguards, so that the persons whose personal data is concerned have sufficient 
guarantees enabling their data to be effectively protected against the risk of abuse and against any 
unlawful access and use of that data. The need for such safeguards is all the greater where personal 
data is subjected to automatic processing and where there is a significant risk of unlawful access to 
that  data”131.  The  EDPB  therefore  considers  that  the  European  Commission  should  consider  the 
impact of the UK-US CI Agreement as part of its adequacy assessment.  

194.  The ECtHR, in its first section judgment of 13 September 2018, in the Big Brother Watch case, has 
assessed the  UK intelligence  sharing regime and in particular the UK-US  CIAgreement. The ECtHR 
indeed  stated  that  “[t]he  statutory  framework  which  permits  the  United  Kingdom  intelligence 
services to request intercepted material from foreign intelligence agencies is not contained in RIPA. 
The  British-US  Communication  Intelligence  Agreement  of  5  March  1946  specifically  permits  the 
exchange of material between the United States and the United Kingdom”132 and considered that 
there is “a basis in law for the requesting of intelligence from foreign intelligence agencies, and that 
that law is sufficiently accessible.”133 While the ECtHR has concluded that there has been no violation 
of Article 8134 ECHR in relation to the intelligence sharing regime, the EDPB notes that this judgment 
has now been referred to the Grand Chamber which decision is still pending. The EDPB also notes 
that in a partly concurring, partly dissenting opinion to this judgment, Judge Koskelo, joined by Judge

Turković135, has concluded that there is a violation of Article 8 ECHR in relation to the intelligence 
sharing regime, stating that “[i]t is easy to agree with the principle that any arrangement under which 
intelligence from intercepted communications is obtained via foreign intelligence services, whether 
on the basis of requests to carry out such interception or to convey its results, should not be allowed 
to entail a circumvention of the safeguards which must be in place for any surveillance by domestic 
authorities (see paragraphs 216, 423 and 447). Indeed, any other approach would be implausible”. 

195.  As highlighted by several reports from the media and non-governmental organisations136137, the most 
recent version of the UK-US CI Agreement to have been made public dates back from 1956 and since 
then, communication technology and the nature of signals intelligence have changed significantly. 
Media reports have for example revealed that data transiting through undersea cables that land in 
the UK are intercepted by the GCHQ and made accessible to the NSA138.  

196.  For the EDPB, a key question in relation to intelligence sharing is whether section 109 DPA 2018 and 
the provisions of the IPA 2016 remain applicable when UK intelligence services act in accordance 
with  the  UK-US  CI  Agreement.  Another  key  element  to  be  assessed  is  whether  the  provisions  or 
effective application of this agreement impact on the level of protection of personal data in transit 
from the EEA to the UK, or allows for a direct access and acquisition of personal data by other third 
countries intelligence services. 

197.  Consequently, in addition to reservations expressed as to “overseas disclosures” on the basis of Part 
4 DPA 2018 and its related national security exemption, as well as of requests in the framework of 
the IPA 2016, the EDPB is concerned about other forms of information-sharing and disclosures, on 
the basis of other instruments, in particular the various international agreements concluded by 
the UK with other third countries, especially where these instruments remain inaccessible to the 
public,  such  as  the  UK-US  CI  Agreement.  The  effect  of  such  agreement  could  lead  to  a 
circumvention of the safeguards identified in relation to the access and use of personal data for 
national security purposes. 

198.  Indeed,  the  EDPB  shares  the  view  expressed  by  Special  Rapporteur  to  the  United  Nations,  Joe 
Cannatacci, that “[i]ntelligence sharing must not result in a backdoor to obtain or facilitate for others 
the obtaining of intelligence free from domestic safeguards, nor a loophole for foreign Governments 
with lower standards on the protection of privacy (or other human rights) to obtain intelligence from 
UK intelligence that could give rise to human rights violations”139. 

199.  Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements with 
third  countries  for  the  purpose  of  intelligence  cooperation,  providing  a  legal  basis  for  direct 
interception and acquisition of personal data or the transfer of personal data to these countries

may also significantly affect the conditions for further use of the information collected, since such 
agreements are likely to affect the UK data protection legal framework as assessed. 

4.3.3. Oversight 

200.  The  EDPB  emphasises  the  importance  of  comprehensive  supervision  by  independent  supervisory 
authorities  for  an  adequate  level  of  data  protection.  The  guarantee  of  independence  within  the 
meaning of Article 8(3) EU Charter of the supervisory authorities is intended to ensure effective and 
reliable monitoring of compliance with the rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the 
processing of personal data.  

201.  When personal data are accessed and used for national security purposes, the oversight function is 
mainly fulfilled by the IPC and the Judicial Commissioners (hereinafter the “Judicial Commissioners”).  

202.  The  EDPB generally  recognises  the  introduction  of  Judicial  Commissioners  in  the  IPA  2016  as  a 
significant improvement. In line with a request above, the European Commission is invited to assess 
the independence of the Judicial Commissioners in more detail, and in particular to what extent 
the independence of the IPC and the IPC’s office (hereinafter “IPCO”) is legally secured, as such is 
not  found  in  the  IPA  2016.  This  is  even  more  important  as  the  IPC  decides  on  appeals  by  the 
government,  in  case  an  application  for  a  surveillance  measure  has  been  denied  by  a  judicial 
commissioner. 

203.  The IPC has ex-ante, as well as ex-post oversight functions. As regards ex-ante oversight, the EDPB 
understands  that  the  function  of  the  Judicial  Commissioners  is  to  approve,  in  individual  cases, 
different  surveillance  measures, 
interception  and  bulk  acquisition  of 
communication data. The EDPB further notes that prior-approval of surveillance measures cannot be 
derived from the jurisprudence of the CJEU as an absolute requirement for the proportionality of 
surveillance measures.140  

including  targeted 

204.  In order to assess the effectiveness of this level of oversight, the EDPB nevertheless sees the need to 
further clarify the scenarios for which a lawful interception without a prior-approval of the Judicial 
Commissioners is possible.  

205.  In its draft decision, the European Commission mentions in footnotes 201 and 266 "specific limited 
cases" provided by the IPA 2016 in its sections 44 to 52 with regard to targeted interceptions. The 
EDPB notes that sections 45 - 51 IPA 2016 are exemptions that are claimed not to be regularly used 
by intelligence services. Furthermore, the EDPB understands that in the cases where the exemptions 
apply (e.g. telecommunications and postal providers), the prior-approval carried out by the Judicial 
Commissioners  is  to  be  conducted  in  the  event  that  law  enforcement  authorities  or  intelligence 
services  request  access  to  these  data,  and  invites  the  European  Commission  to  confirm  in  its 
decision that this is correct.  

206.  The EDPB recognises that section 44(2) IPA 2016 permits interception of communications if one of 
the parties (sender or recipient) has consented and there is an authorisation under the RIPA 2000 or 
the  Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  (Scotland)  Act  2000  (2000  asp  11),  i.e.  the  former  legal 
situation before the establishment of the Judicial Commissioners. The EDPB  invites the European 

                                                      
140 It also notes, however, that the CJEU, when invalidating the Privacy Shield in Schrems II, has taken note of 
the  fact  that,  under  US  law,  the  so  called  FISA  Court  "does  not  authorise  individual  surveillance  measures; 
rather,  it  authorises  surveillance  programs  (like  PRISM,  UPSTREAM)  on  the  basis  of  annual  certifications”.” 
(para. 179).

Commission to clarify whether this means that in cases where a unilateral consent exists, the prior-
approval procedure would not apply at all. 

207.  As  regards  ex-post  oversight,  it  is  also  important  to  verify  that  efficient  independent  oversight  is 

ensured without gaps, in particular where it is not foreseen ex-ante.  

208.  The  EDPB  notes  that  for  the  sections  48  -  52  IPA  2016,  an  ex-post  review  by  the  Judicial 
Commissioners  takes  place,  and  invites  the  European  Commission  to  clarify  under  which 
requirements and on whose initiative such an ex-post review is to be conducted. 

209.  According to section 229(4) IPA 2016, the IPC is not to keep under review the exercise of certain 
functions.  In  this  regard  the  EDPB  invites  the  European  Commission  to  clarify  the  provisions  of 
section 229(4)(d) and (e) IPA 2016 regarding its practical impact on the review competence of the 
IPC. It is the understanding of the EDPB that the ICO is the competent oversight authority where 
the exemptions of section 229(4) IPA 2016 apply, and the EDPB invites the European Commission 
to confirm in its decision that this is correct.  

210.  It  appears  that,  when  conducting  ex-post  oversight,  the  IPC’s  role 

is  limited  to  make 
recommendations in cases of non-compliance, and to give notice to the data subject, if the error is 
serious and it is in the public interest for the person to be informed. The EDPB invites the European 
Commission to clarify how the IPCO can effectively ensure compliance with the law. 

211.  Finally, the EDPB understands that affected individuals cannot directly address the IPCO, but must 
lodge a complaint with the ICO, which, however, has limited competences in the area of national 
security. The EDPB therefore invites the European Commission to further clarify how it is legally 
ensured that the IPCO addresses complaints in these cases.  

4.3.4. Redress  

212.  In the light of the Schrems I and Schrems II judgments by the CJEU, it is clear that effective judicial 
protection in the meaning of Article 47 EU Charter is of fundamental importance for the assumption 
of adequacy of the law of a third country. The rulings have also shown that particular attention, in 
this regard, has to be paid to effective judicial protection in the area of national security access to 
personal data.  

213.  The EDPB recognises that the UK has established the IPT. The IPT is not only competent to hear 
cases on the use of investigatory powers by law enforcement authorities, but also by intelligence 
services. It is the understanding of the EDPB that the IPT functions as a proper court in the meaning 
of Article 47 EU Charter. As to its powers, the European Commission is invited to confirm that the 
IPT has all those powers mentioned in recital 262 of the draft decision, regardless of the legal basis 
under which the complaint is brought.  

214.  Discreet surveillance by intelligence agencies will often mean that the object of the surveillance, the 
data subject, is and will not be aware of the surveillance. In this context, when it had to analyse US 
law,  the  EDPB  has  many  times  expressed  its  concern  with  the  requirement  of  “standing”,  as 
interpreted  in  US  law,  in  surveillance  cases.  Against  this  background,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the 
complaint with the IPT only requires a “belief” test, according to which the complainant has to show 
she or he is potentially at risk of being subjected to a measure.   

215.  When analysing the IPT, the EDPB also pays particular attention to the fact that the functioning of 
the IPT has been repeatedly found to be in compliance with the ECHR, as interpreted by the ECtHR.
