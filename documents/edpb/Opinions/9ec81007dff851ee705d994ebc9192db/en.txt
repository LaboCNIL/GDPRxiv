The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 63, Article 64 (1a), (3) - (8) and Article 35 (1), (3), (4), (6) of the Regulation 
2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such 
data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereafter “GDPR”), 

Having regard to Article 51 (1b) of Directive 2016/680 EU  on the protection of natural persons with 
regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, 
investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and 
on  the  free  movement  of  such  data,  and  repealing  Council  Framework  Decision  2008/977/JHA 
(hereafter “Law Enforcement Directive”).  

Having  regard  to  the  EEA  Agreement  and  in  particular  to  Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as 
amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018, 

Having regard to Article 10 and 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018, as revised on 23 November 
2018, 

 

Whereas: 

(1)  The main  role  of  the  Board  is to  ensure  the consistent  application of the  Regulation 2016/679 
(hereafter GDPR) throughout the European Economic Area. In compliance with article 64.1 GDPR, the 
Board shall issue an opinion where a supervisory authority (SA) intends to adopt a list of processing 
operations  subject  to  the  requirement  for  a  data  protection  impact  assessment  pursuant  to 
article 35.4 GDPR. The aim of this opinion is therefore to create a harmonised approach with regard 
to processing that is cross border or that can affect the free flow of personal data or natural person 
across  the  European  Union.  Even  though  the  GDPR  doesn’t  impose  a  single  list,  it  does  promote 
consistency.    The  Board  seeks  to  achieve  this  objective  in  its  opinions  firstly  by  requesting  SAs  to 
include some types of processing in their lists, secondly by requesting them to remove some criteria 
which the Board doesn’t consider as necessarily creating high risks for data subjects, and finally by 
requesting them to use some criteria in a harmonized manner. 

(2) With reference to Article 35 (4) and (6) GDPR, the competent supervisory authorities shall establish 
lists of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection 
impact assessment (hereinafter “DPIA”). They shall, however, apply the consistency mechanism where 
such lists involve processing operations, which are related to the offering of goods or services to data 
subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect 
the free movement of personal data within the Union.  

 (3)  While  the  draft  lists  of  the  competent  supervisory  authorities  are  subject  to  the  consistency 
mechanism,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  lists  should  be  identical.  The  competent  supervisory 
authorities have a margin of discretion with regard to the national or regional context and should take 
into account their local legislation. The aim of the EDPB assessment/opinion is not to reach a single 
EU list but rather to avoid significant inconsistencies that may affect the equivalent protection of the 
data subjects.

(4) The carrying out of a DPIA is only mandatory for the controller pursuant to Article 35 (1) GDPR 
where  processing  is  “likely  to  result  in  a  high  risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  natural  persons”. 
Article 35 (3) GDPR illustrates what is likely to result in a high risk. This is a non-exhaustive list. The 
Working Party 29 in the Guidelines on data protection impact assessment1, as endorsed by the EDPB2, 
has  clarified  criteria  that  can  help  to  identify  when  processing  operations  are  subject  to  the 
requirement  for  a  DPIA.  The  Working  Party  29  Guidelines  WP248  state  that  in  most  cases,  a  data 
controller can consider that a processing meeting two criteria would require a DPIA to be carried out, 
however, in some cases a data controller can consider that a processing meeting only one of these 
criteria requires a DPIA.  

 (5) The lists produced by the competent supervisory authorities support the same objective to identify 
processing operations likely to result in a high risk and processing operations, which therefore require 
a DPIA. As such, the criteria developed in the Working Party 29 Guidelines should be applied when 
assessing  whether  the  draft  lists  of  the  competent  supervisory  authorities  does  not  affect  the 
consistent application of the GDPR.   

(6) Twenty-two competent supervisory authorities received an opinion on their draft lists from the 
EDPB on 5 September 2018. A further four SAs received an opinion on their draft lists on 4 December 
2018 and two further received an opinion on their list on 23 January 2019. 

(7)  The  opinion of  the  EDPB  shall  be  adopted  pursuant  to  Article  64  (3)  GDPR  in  conjunction  with 
Article 10 (2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure within eight weeks from the first working day after the 
Chair and the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file is complete. Upon decision 
of the Chair, this period may be extended by a further six weeks taking into account the complexity of 
the subject matter.  

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION: 

1  SUMMARY OF THE FACTS  

1.  The  competent  supervisory  authority  of  Iceland  has  submitted  its  draft  list  to  the  EDPB.  The 

decision on the completeness of the file was taken on 4 February 2019.  

2.  The period until which the opinion has to be adopted has been set until 2 April 2019.

2.1  General reasoning of the EDPB regarding the submitted list 

Any list submitted to the EDPB has been interpreted as further specifying Art 35.1, which will prevail 
in any case. Thus, no list can be exhaustive.  

In compliance with article 35.10 GDPR, the Board is of the opinion that if a DPIA has already been 
carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of the legal basis the 
obligation to carry out a DPIA in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 7 of article 35 GDPR does not apply, 
unless the Member State deems it necessary. 

Further, if the Board requests a DPIA for a certain category of processing and an equivalent measure 
is already required by national law, the Persónuvernd (hereafter Icelandic Supervisory Authority) shall 
add a reference to this measure. 

This opinion does not reflect upon items submitted by the Icelandic Supervisory Authority, which were 
deemed outside the scope of Article 35.6 GDPR. This refers to items that neither relate “to the offering 
of goods or services to data subjects” in several Member States nor to the monitoring of the behaviour 
of data subjects in several Member States. Additionally, they are not likely to “substantially affect the 
free movement of personal data within the Union”. This is especially the case for items relating to 
national legislation and in particular where the obligation to carry out a DPIA is stipulated in national 
legislation. Further, any processing operations that relate to law enforcement were deemed out of 
scope, as they are not in scope of the GDPR.  

The Board has noted that several supervisory authorities have included in their lists some types of 
processing  which  are  necessarily  local  processing.  Given  that  only  cross  border  processing  and 
processing that may affect the free flow of personal data and data subjects are concerned by Article 
35.6, the Board will not comment on those local processing. 

The opinion aims at defining a consistent core of processing operations that are recurrent in the lists 
provided by the SAs.  

This  means  that,  for  a  limited  number  of  types  of  processing  operations  that  will  be  defined  in  a 
harmonised way, all the Supervisory Authorities will require a DPIA to be carried out and the Board 
will recommend the SAs to amend their lists accordingly in order to ensure consistency.  

10.  When this opinion remains silent on DPIA list entries submitted, it means that the Board is not asking 

the Icelandic Supervisory Authority to take further action. 

11. 

Finally, the Board recalls that transparency is key for data controllers and data processors. In order to 
clarify the entries in the list, the Board is of the opinion that making an explicit reference in the lists, 
for each type of processing, to the criteria set out in the guidelines could improve this transparency. 

2.2  Application of the consistency mechanism to the draft list 

12. 

The  draft  list  submitted  by  the  Icelandic  Supervisory  Authority  relates  to  the  offering  of  goods  or 
services to data subjects, relates to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States and/or 
may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union mainly because the 
processing operations in the submitted draft list are not limited to data subjects in this country.

2.3  Analysis of the draft list 

13. 

Taking into account that: 

a.  Article 35 (1) GDPR requires a DPIA when the processing activity is likely to result in a high risk 

to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; and  

b.  Article 35 (3) GDPR provides a non-exhaustive list of types of processing that require a DPIA,  

the Board is of the opinion that: 

14. 

15. 

SCOPE OF THE DRAFT DECISION 
The Icelandic SA states in some cases that its list includes processing activities that the Icelandic DPA 
considers to be of high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. However, the Board recalls 
that the GDPR states that the list that have to be published by the supervisory authorities are the lists 
of processing that are likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The 
Board therefore  requests  the  Icelandic  Authority  to  amend  its  list  by  aligning  its  wording  with  the 
wording of Article 35.1 of the GDPR. 

EMPLOYEE MONITORING 
The  Board  takes  note  of  the  inclusion  of  “processing  of  personal  data  involving  measures  for 
systematic monitoring of employee activities” in the Icelandic DPIA list. The Board recalls that in its 
view  WP249 of the Article 29 working party remain valid when defining the concept of  systematic 
processing of employee data. 

3  CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS 

16. 

The  draft  list  of  the  Icelandic  Supervisory  Authority  may  lead  to  an  inconsistent  application of  the 
requirement for a DPIA and the following changes need to made: 

  Regarding  the  scope  of  the  list:  the  Board  requests  the  Icelandic  Supervisory  Authority  to 
amend its list by stating that the types of processing listed are the one that are likely to present 
high risks for the rights and freedom of data subjects. 

4  FINAL REMARKS 

17. 

This opinion is addressed to the Icelandic Supervisory Authority and will be made public pursuant to 
Article 64 (5b) GDPR. 

18.  According to Article 64 (7) and (8) GDPR, the supervisory authority shall communicate to the Chair by 
electronic means within two weeks after receiving the opinion, whether it will amend or maintain its 
draft list. The supervisory authority shall communicate the final decision to the Board for inclusion in 
the register of decisions which have been subject to the consistency mechanism, in accordance with 
article 70 (1) (y) GDPR.
