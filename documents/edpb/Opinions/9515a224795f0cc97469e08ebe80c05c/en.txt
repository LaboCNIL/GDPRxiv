The European Data Protection Board 
 
Having regard  to  Article  63,  Article  64(1)(b)  and  Article  40  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the 
European Parliament and  of the Council  of 27 April  2016 on  the protection of natural persons  with 
regard to the  processing  of  personal  data and  on  the  free  movement of  such  data, and  repealing 
Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”), 
 
Having regard to the  European  Economic  Area (hereinafter “EEA”) Agreement and  in  particular to 
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  joint  Committee  No 
154/2018 of 6 July 20181, 
 
Having regard to Articles 10 and 22 of its Rules of Procedure. 
 
Whereas: 
 
(1)  Member States, Supervisory  Authorities, the European Data Protection Board and the European 
Commission  shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct (hereinafter “code”) to contribute 
to the proper application of the GDPR2. 

(2)  The main  role of  the European  Data Protection Board (hereinafter “the EDPB”) is  to  ensure  the 
consistent  application  of  the  GDPR when  a  supervisory  authority  (hereinafter “SA”)  intends  to 
approve  a  code  of  conduct  that  related  to  processing  activities  in  several  Member  States 
(hereinafter “transnational code”)  pursuant to  article 40.7 GDPR and  to the Board’s “Guidelines 
1/2019 on Codes of Conduct and Monitoring bodies  under Regulation 2016/679” (hereinafter the 
“Guidelines”). 

(3)  The EDPB welcomes  and acknowledges  the efforts  made  by  the  associations  and  others  bodies 
representing  categories  of  controllers  or  processors  to  elaborate codes  of  conduct  which  are 
practical and  potentially  cost-effective  tools  to  ensure  greater consistency  among  a  sector and 
foster the right to privacy and data protection of data subjects by increasing transparency.  

(4)  This opinion aims to ensure the consistent application of the GDPR, including by the SAs, controllers 

and processors and to highlight the core elements which each code of conduct has to develop. 

(5)  Taking  into  account  the  specific  characteristics of  the  sector  concerned, each  code  of  conduct 
should  be addressed individually  and is without prejudice of the assessment  of any other code of 
conduct. The EDPB recalls that Codes  represent an opportunity  to establish  a set of  rules  which 
contribute to the proper application of  the GDPR in a practical, transparent and potentially cost -
effective manner that takes on board the specificities for a particular sector and/or its processing 
activities. 

(6)  The  EDPB  underlines  that  codes  of  conduct  are  voluntary  accountability  tools,  and  that  the 
adherence  to  a  code  does  not  prevent  DPAs  from  exercising  their  enforcement  power  and 
prerogatives.

Adopted 

(7)   The present  code is  not  a code of  conduct  according to article 46(2)(e) meant for  international 
transfers  of  personal  data  and  therefore  does  not  provide  appropriate  safeguards  within  the 
framework of transfers of personal data to third countries or international organisations under the 
terms referred to  in  point  (e )  of  article 46 (2).  Indeed, any  transfer of  personal  data to a third 
country or to an international organisation shall take place only if the provisions  of chapter V of the 
GDPR are respected.  

(8)  The  opinion  of  the  EDPB shall  be  adopted, pursuant  to  Article 64(3)  GDPR in  conjunction  with 
Article 10(2)  of the EDPB Rules of Procedure, within eight weeks after the Chair has decided that 
the file is complete.

In accordance with the cooperation procedure as set out in the guidelines on codes of  conduct3, the 
code of conduct of CISPE (“CISPE Code” or “Code”) was reviewed by the French Supervisory  Authority 
as the Competent Supervisory Authority (hereinafter the “CompSA”).  

The CISPE Code has been reviewed according to the procedures set up by the EDPB. 

The FR SA has submitted its draft decision regarding the draft CISPE Code, requesting an opinion of the 
EDPB pursuant to Article 64(1)(b) GDPR on 29 February 2021. The decision on the completeness of the 
file was taken on 31 March 2021. 

2  ASSESSMENT 

2.1  The Code of conduct  meets the needs of the sector 

2.1.1  Presentation of the sector 
Cloud computing consists of a set of technologies and service models that focus on the Internet-based 
use and delivery of IT applications, processing capability, storage and memory space.  

 The CISPE  Code  aims to  contribute to the proper  application of  the GDPR, taking into account the 
specific features of the cloud computing sector. 

The term "cloud computing" covers a variety of very distinct service provision  models such  as Cloud 
Infrastructure as a Service Cloud  (“IaaS”), Cloud Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and Cloud  Platform as 
a Service (“PaaS”). The term “IaaS” describes  a situation in  which  a provider  leases a technological 
infrastructure, i.e. virtual remote servers the end-user  can rely upon  in accordance with mechanisms 
and arrangements such as to make it simple, effective as well as beneficial to replace the corporate IT 
systems  at  the  company’s  premises  and/or  use  the  leased  infrastructure  alongside  the  corporate 
systems.   When  providing  “SaaS”, a provider  delivers, via the web, various  application services  and 
makes  them  available  to  end-users.  These  services  are  often  meant  to  replace  conventional 
applications to be installed by users on their local systems; accordingly, users are ultimately meant to 
outsource their data to the individual  provider. When providing “PaaS”, a provider offers solutions  for

EDPB on 4 June 2019.

the advanced development and hosting of applications. These services are usually addressed to market 
players that use them to develop  and host proprietary application-based solutions  to meet in-house 
requirements and/or to provide services to third parties.

2.1.2  The code owner as a representative  organisation  
Codes of conduct must be submitted for approval to the supervisory  authority which is competent in 
accordance  with  article  55  of  the  GDPR.    In  case  of  transnational  codes,  when  identifying  the 
competent SA,  some  factors  could  be  taken  into  account, for  example, the location  of  the largest 
density of the processing activity or the location of the code owner’s headquarters. 4  

The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers (CISPE) is a non-profit  association established in Belgium.   

The  code  owner  has  identified  the  French  supervisory  authority  as  the  competent  supervisory 
authority for  the purposes  of  seeking  approval of  the CISPE Code. The  code owner has  justified  his 
choice  in  the code  of  conduct based  on  several  criteria such  as  the establishment  of  several CISPE 
members in France or the establishment of officers of CISPE including the treasurer and the chairman’s 
companies in France.  

In accordance with Article 40 (2) GDPR, a code of conduct has to be prepared by associations or others 
bodies  representing categories of controllers or processors  (code  owners). Because the code owner 
has a major role in ensuring consistency  and harmonization of practices within the sector concerned 
by the code, it has to demonstrate to the CompSA  that it is an effective representative organization.  
As such, as stated in the Guidelines, the code owner should be capable of understanding the needs of 
their members and define the processing activity or sector to which the code is intended to apply. 5 

11.  Recital 99 GDPR advises  to consult during the process of drawing up a Code  of Conduct with relevant 
stakeholders. The CISPE Code has been prepared through a collaborative process  between the CISPE 
members, all of whom are cloud infrastructure service providers (hereinafter “CISPs”) providing cloud 
infrastructure  services  to  European  customers.  CISPE  is  intended  to  represent CISPs  and  includes 
representatives  from  market  leading  CISPs  offering  services  throughout  Europe,  across  many  EU 
member states. All relevant stakeholders have been consulted and asked to approve the CISPE code 
of conduct. In this way, the Code provides a summary of stakeholder’s consultations. 

12. 

The code owner has demonstrated in the draft Code that it is an effective representative body, capable 
of understanding the needs of their members.   

13. 

2.1.3  Processing Scope  
The CISPE Code applies to the specific features of processing by IaaS providers. It seeks to bring clarity 
as to what GDPR means in practice when applied to IaaS providers, and what are the actual measures 
which  CISPs  will  take to  ensure  compliance  with  GDPR. The  Code  requirements  set  out  the GDPR 
principles  which CISPs, as data processors, must respect. It therefore does not apply to “business to 
consumer”  (B2C)  services  or  for  any  processing  activities  for  which  the  CISP  may  act  as  a  data 
controller. However, the code  is  also  relevant for consumers  who  will get additional guarantees of 
compliance when entrusting with their personal data a company which uses a processor which adheres 
to the Code.6  

                                                             
4 See Appendix 2 to the Guidelines. 
5 See para. 22 Guidelines. 
6 It shall be noted, that the  adherence of a processor to the Code of Conduct does not entail an automatic 
recognition of compliance of the processing carried out by such processor nor waives the responsibility of the

2.1.4  Territorial  scope  
The scope of the CISPE Code is transnational and is intended to apply across the EEA, as per article 40 
(7) GDPR. The CISPE Code has identified all European Union and European Economic Area supervisory 
authorities as concerned SAs.  

2.2  The code of conduct facilitates the effective application of the GDPR 
 The  Guidelines  precise  that  Codes  will  need  to  specify  the practical application  of  the  GDPR and 
accurately reflect the nature of the processing activity or sector. They should  be able to provide clear 
industry specific improvements in terms of compliance with data protection law. A code shall not just 
re-state the GDPR. Instead, it  should  aim to  codify  how  compliance to  GDPR can  be  achieved in  a 
specific, practical and precise manner.7 Furthermore, the code has to provide sufficient  appropriate 
safeguards to mitigate the risk around data processing and the right and freedoms of individuals. 8    

The CISPE Code contains both strict requirements particularizing the provisions of the GDPR mentioned 
in the “Processing Scope” section of the present Opinion and good practices currently followed by the 
sector. The CISPE Code helps  CISPs to understand clearly what their obligations are under the GDPR, 
facilitates best practice compliance by IaaS providers and improves upon the state of the art for data 
protection in the Cloud sector 

2.2.1  The code as a practical  tool  
The Code seeks to bring clarity as to what GDPR means in practice when applied to IaaS providers, and 
what are the actual measures which CISPs will take to ensure compliance with GDPR.  The CISPE Code 
describes the rights and obligations of  adhering CISPs on  the basis  of key principles  of GDPR such as 
purpose limitations, data subject rights, transfers, security, auditing, liability, etc.   

2.2.2  Matrix of requirements 
The Code consists of a set of requirements that CISPs have to implement to comply with the Code. 

The Codes  develops requirements which are unambiguous, concrete, attainable and enforceable.  All 
the requirements are consolidated in a control framework, which ensures transparency for all Code’s 
members and data subjects and facilitates its application and interpretation, enabling implementation, 
monitoring and where required auditing. The EDPB welcomes the use of this kind of tool.  

2.2.3  Binding nature of the Code 

20.  All  provisions  of  the  Code  are binding,  wherever the provisions  make use  of  “shall”, “must”. Some 
provisions  should be regarded as guidance, setting examples of good practices and are denoted by the 
use of the terms “should” or “may”.  

21. 

2.2.4  The Code provides sufficient  safeguards 
  In  line  with  the  Guidelines,9  a  code  of  conduct  must  provide  sufficient  safeguards  while  being 
adequately focused  on  particular data protection areas and  issues  in the specific  sector to  which it 
applies (“added value”). The CISPE Code provides  sufficient  safeguards by, for instance adopting the 

                                                             
controller to ensure compliance for all the processing operations carried out on its behalf. In this particular case, 
the EDPB recalls that the Code of Conduct won’t apply to all the processing operations carried out on behalf of 
the controller, but only to the elements of Article 28 GDPR and related relevant articles. In addition, it shall be 
recalled that, in this case, the monitoring of the CISPE Code of Conduct is based on a service-level approach. 
Thus, members of the Code might not adhere to the Code with regard to all the elements of all their processing 
activities, but they can declare which of their services are to be considered compliant with the Code.

Adopted 

same terminology as the one used in the GDPR and providing complaint mechanism to data subjects. 
In terms of added value, the code provides guidance adapted to the sector on, among others, security 
measures, auditing requirements, data subject rights and transparency requirement.  

22. 

 The Code as an accountability tool  

2.2.5 
The objective of the CISPE Code is to help CISPs to demonstrate compliance with article 28 GDPR and 
make it easier and more transparent for customers to analyze whether cloud services are appropriate 
for their use case in line with article 28.1 GDPR which provides that controllers shall use only processors 
providing  sufficient  guarantees to implement  appropriate technical and  organizational measures  in 
such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR and ensure the protection of 
the rights of the data subject and article 28.5 GDPR which states that the adherence of a processor to 
an  approved  code  of  conduct  may  be  used  as  an  element  by  which  to  demonstrate  sufficient 
guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of article 28 GDPR.  

2.3  The  code  of  conduct  provides  effective  mechanisms  for monitoring  compliance 

with a code 

23.  As per Article 40(4) of the GDPR and the Guidelines,10 a code requires the implementation of suitable 
mechanisms  to ensure  that its  rules are appropriately monitored and  that efficient  and meaningful 
enforcement measures are put in place to ensure full compliance. A code specifically needs to identify 
and propose  structures and  procedures which  provide  for effective monitoring and  enforcement of 
infringements.   

2.3.1  Adherence  to the Code 
The code has to detail an adhesion mechanism.  

24. 

25.  An effective adhesion  mechanism  has to develop  a process  divided  on  three phases  which coincide 
with the code of conduct “lifetime”. During the first phase, the mechanism must precise that the code 
members must comply  with all the Code requirements and that the monitoring body  will assess  the 
eligibility  of  candidate  to  the  code.  In  a  second  phase,  the  mechanism  shall  describe  how  that 
monitoring is carried out on an ongoing basis and in a third phase on ad hoc basis.11  The CISPE Code 
develops an adhesion mechanism which fulfills  the three phases of monitoring. 

26. 

2.3.2  The monitoring of the Code 
The Guidelines  indicate that a code  will  also  need to  identify  an appropriate body  which has  at its 
disposal  mechanisms to enable that body to provide for the effective monitoring of compliance with 
the code.12  As per Article 41 (1) GDPR, the monitoring body identified by the Code has to be accredited 
by the CompSA13 Consequently, the CompSA will act as a single point of contact with the code owner 
and the monitoring body.  

27. 

The CISPE Code has appointed several external monitoring bodies in accordance with article 41 of the 
GDPR. These monitoring bodies will be in charge of ensuring compliance of the members of the Code 
with the provisions  of the CISPE Code and taking actions including sanctions in case of infringement to 

                                                             
10 See para 40 of the Guidelines. 
11 Para 70 of the Guidelines. 
12 Para 40 of the Guidelines. 
13 In accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 of the GDPR, the EDPB adopted an 
Opinion 3/2020 on the France data protection supervisory authority draft accreditation requirements for a code 
of conduct monitoring body pursuant to article 41 GDPR on 28 January 2020. The monitoring bodies designated 
by the code owner of the CISPE code of conduct will have to be accredited by the French SA and therefore will 
have to demonstrate that they fulfil the requirements imposed by article 41 of the GDPR.

the  provisions  of  the  CISPE  Code.  Decisions  taken  by  these  monitoring  bodies  relating  to  their 
monitoring  functions  (for  instance  regarding the  interpretation  of  the  Code’s  rules)  shall  not  be 
submitted to another entity for approval. Indeed, these monitoring bodies have to be independent in 
their mission.  

The EDPB acknowledges that the  CISPE Code  contains  a  mechanism  which  enables the  monitoring 
bodies to carry out their  monitoring functions, as per article 40 (4) of the GDPR. 

Finally,  the  EDPB recalls  that the  code  of  conduct  will  not  be  operational  before  the  designated 
monitoring body is accredited.14 

2.3.3  Sanctions 
In accordance with article 40 (4) of the GDPR and the Guidelines, without prejudice to the tasks and 
powers of the competent supervisory  authority, the monitoring body  designated by  the code owner 
shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of  infringement of the code 
by  a  controller  or  processor.    Those  sanctions  range  from  non-public  but  formal  reprimand  to 
temporary  or  permanent revocation  from  the  Code.  The  monitoring  body  commits  to  inform  the 
competent supervisory authority about any related actions taken.  

31. 

To ensure transparency to code members, the code shall include a  list of corrective measures which 
must be applied by the monitoring body.  For this purpose, the CISPE Code  develops an enforcement 
framework which determines the appropriate sanction to be followed by the monitoring bodies.  

32. 

2.3.4  The review  of the code 
 As  per  article  40  (2)  of  the  GDPR  and  the  Guidelines,  the  code  sets  out  an  appropriate  review 
mechanism  to ensure  that the code  remains relevant to legal and technical standard. In  particular, 
section 7.3 of the CISPE Code provides that a regular review of the Code to reflect legal, technological 
or operational changes and best practices shall take place when appropriate.    

3  CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS 

33.  By way of conclusion, the EDPB considers that the draft code complies with the GDPR, since the CISPE 

code of conduct fulfills  the requirements imposed by Article 40 and 41 GDPR.  

34. 

Finally, the EDPB also recalls the provisions contained within Article 40 (5) GDPR, in case of amendment 
or extension of the CISPE code of conduct, the CompSA will have to submit the modified version to the 
EDPB in accordance with the procedures outlines in the guidelines approved by the EDPB.
