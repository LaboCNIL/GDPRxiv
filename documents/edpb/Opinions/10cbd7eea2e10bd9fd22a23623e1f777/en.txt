The European Data Protection Board

Having  regard  to  Article  63,  Article 64  (1a),  (3) - (8)  and  Article  35  (1), (3),  (4),  (6)  of  the
Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on
the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”),

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as
amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,

Having regard to Article 10 and 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,

Whereas:

(1) The  main  role  of  the  Board  is  to  ensure  the  consistent  application  of  the  Regulation
2016/679 (here after GDPR) throughout the European Economic Area. In compliance with
article 64.1 GDPR, the Board has to issue an opinion where a supervisory authority intends to
adopt a list of processing operations subject to the requirement for a data protection impact
assessment pursuant to article 35.4 GDPR. The aim of this opinion is therefore to create a
harmonized approach with regard to processing that is cross border or that can affect the free
flow of personal data or natural person across the European Union. Even though the GDPR
doesn’t impose a single list, it does promote consistency.  The Board seeks to achieve this
objective in its opinions firstly by requesting SAs to include some types of processing in their
lists, secondly by requesting them to remove some criteria which the Board doesn’t consider
as necessarily creating high risks for data subjects, and finally by requesting them to use some
criteria in a harmonized manner.

(2) With reference to Article 35 (4) and (6) GDPR, the competent supervisory authorities shall
establish lists of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a
data  protection  impact assessment  (hereinafter  “DPIA”). They  shall,  however,  apply the
consistency mechanism where such lists involve processing operations, which are related to
the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in
several  Member  States,  or  may  substantially  affect  the  free  movement  of  personal  data
within the Union.

(3)  While  the  draft  lists  of  the  competent  supervisory  authorities  are  subject  to  the
consistency mechanism, this does not mean that the lists should be identical. The competent
supervisory authorities have a margin of discretion with regard to the national or regional
context and  should  take  into  account  their  local  legislation. The  aim  of  the  EDPB
assessment/opinion  is  not  to  reach  a  single  EU  list  but  rather  to  avoid  significant
inconsistencies that may affect the equivalent protection of the data subjects.

(4) The carrying out of a DPIA is only mandatory for the controller pursuant to Article 35 (1)
GDPR where processing is “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
3

persons”. Article 35 (3) GDPR illustrates what is likely to result in a high risk. This is a non-
exhaustive  list.  The  Working  Party  29  in  the  Guidelines  on  data  protection  impact
assessment1, as endorsed by the EDPB2, has clarified criteria that can help to identify when
processing  operations  are  subject  to  the  requirement  for  a  DPIA. The  Working  Party  29
Guidelines WP248 state that in most cases, a data controller can consider that a processing
meeting two criteria would require a DPIA to be carried out, however, in some cases, a data
controller can consider that a processing meeting only one of these criteria requires a DPIA.

(5) The lists produced by the competent supervisory authorities support the same objective
to  identify  processing  operations  likely  to  result  in  a  high  risk  and  processing operations,
which therefore require a  DPIA. As  such, the  criteria  developed  in  the  Working  Party  29
Guidelines  should  be  applied  when  assessing  whether  the  draft  lists  of  the  competent
supervisory authorities does not affect the consistent application of the GDPR.

(6) Twenty-two  competent  supervisory  authorities have  submitted their  draft  lists  to  the
EDPB. A  global  assessment  of these draft  lists  supports  the objective  of  a  consistent
application of the GDPR even though the complexity of the subject matter increases.

(7) The opinion of the EDPB shall be adopted pursuant to Article 64 (3) GDPR in conjunction
with Article 10 (2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure within eight weeks from the first working
day after the Chair and the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file is
complete. Upon decision of the Chair, this period may be extended by a further six weeks
taking into account the complexity of the subject matter.

HAS ADOPTED THE OPINION:

Summary of the Facts

1.
The Urząd Ochrony  Danych  Osobowych  (hereafter Polish  Supervisory  Authority) has
submitted its draft list to the EDPB. The decision on the completeness of the file was taken
on 20th of June 2018. This period until which the opinion to be adopted has been extended
until  the  25th  of  September taking  into  account  the  complexity  of  the  subject  matter
considering that at the same time twenty-two competent supervisory authorities submitted
the draft lists and thus the need for a global assessment arose.

result in a high risk” for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (WP 248 rev. 01).

Assessment

2.
2.1 General reasoning of the EDPB regarding the submitted list

Any list submitted to the EDPB has been interpreted as further specifying Art 35.1, which will
prevail in any case. Thus, no list can be exhaustive. As the list provided by Polish Supervisory
Authority does not explicitly state this, the Board requests this explanation to be added to the
document containing the list.

In compliance with article 35.10 GDPR, the Board is of the opinion that if a DPIA has already
been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of the
legal basis the obligation to carry out a DPIA in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 7 of article
35 GDPR does not apply, unless the Member State deems it necessary.

Further, if the Board requests a DPIA for a certain category of processing and an equivalent
measure  is  already  required  by  national  law,  the Polish  Supervisory Authority shall  add  a
reference to this measure.

This opinion does not reflect upon items submitted by the Polish Supervisory Authority, which
were deemed outside the scope of Article 35.6 GDPR. This refers to items that neither relate
“to the offering of goods or services to data subjects” in several Member States nor to the
monitoring of the behaviour of data subjects in several Member States. Additionally, they are
not likely to “substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union”. This
is especially the case for items relating to national legislation and in particular where the
obligation to carry out a DPIA is stipulated in national legislation. Further, any processing
operations that relate to law enforcement were deemed out of scope, as they are not in scope
of the GDPR.

The Board has noted that several supervisory authorities have included in their lists some
types  of  processing  which  are  necessarily  local  processing.  Given  that  only  cross  border
processing and processing that may affect the free flow of personal data and data subjects
are concerned by Article 35.6, the Board will not comment on those local processing.

The opinion aims at defining a consistent core of processing operations that are recurrent in
the lists provided by the SAs.

This means that, for a limited number of types of processing operations, that will be defined
in a harmonised way, all the Supervisory Authorities will require a DPIA to be carried out and
the  Board  will  recommend  the  SAs  to  amend  their  lists accordingly  in  order  to  ensure
consistency.

When this opinion remains silent on DPIA list entries submitted, it means that the Board is
not asking the Polish Supervisory Authority to take further action.

Finally, the Board recalls that transparency is key for data controllers and data processors. In
order to  clarify  the entries  in the  list, the  Board  is  of  the opinion  that  making  an explicit

5

reference in the lists, for each type of processing, to the criteria set out in the guidelines could
improve  this transparency.  Therefore,  the  Board  considers  that  an  explanation  on  which
criteria have been taken into account by the Polish Supervisory Authority to create its list
could be added.

2.2 Application of the consistency mechanism to the draft list

The submitted draft list by the Polish Supervisory Authority relates to the offering of goods or
services to data subjects, relates to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member
States and/or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union
mainly because the processing operations in the submitted draft list are not limited to data
subjects in this country.

2.3

Analysis of the draft list

Taking into account that:

a. Article 35 (1) GDPR requires a DPIA when the processing activity is likely to result in a

high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons; and

b. Article 35 (3) GDPR provides a non-exhaustive list of types of processing that require

a DPIA,

the Board is of the opinion that:

INDICATIVE NATURE OF THE LIST
As the list provided by Polish Supervisory Authority does not explicitly state that its list is not
exhaustive, the Board requests this explanation to be added to the document containing the
list.

REFERENCE TO THE GUIDELINES
The board is of the opinion that the analysis done in the Working Party 29 Guidelines WP248
are a core element for ensuring consistency across the Union. Thus, it requests the different
Supervisor Authorities to add a statement to the document containing their list that clarifies
that their list is based on these guidelines and that it complements and further specifies the
guidelines.

As the document of the Polish Supervisory Authority does not contain such a statement, the
Board recommends the Polish Supervisory Authority to amend its document accordingly.

BIOMETRIC DATA
The list submitted by the Polish Supervisory Authority for an opinion of the Board does not
currently require a DPIA to be done for the processing of biometric data for the purpose of
uniquely  identifying  a  natural  person.  As  such,  the  Board  requests  the Polish  Supervisory
Authority to amend its list accordingly, by adding explicitly the processing of biometric data
for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person in conjunction with at least one other
criterion to its list, to be applied without prejudice to article 35(3) GDPR.

6

GENETIC DATA
The list submitted by the Polish Supervisory Authority for an opinion of the Board does not
currently require a DPIA to be done for the processing of genetic data. . The Board is of the
opinion that the processing of genetic data on its own is not necessarily likely to represent a
high  risk.  However,  the processing  of  genetic  data  in  conjunction  with  at  least  one  other
criterion requires a DPIA to be carried out. As such, the Board requests the Polish Supervisory
Authority to amend its list accordingly, by adding explicitly the processing of genetic data in
conjunction with at least one other criterion to its list, to be applied without prejudice to
article 35(3) GDPR.

LOCATION DATA
The Board is of the opinion that consistency is one of the basic principle of the GDPR. The
Board  notes  that  a  majority  of  the  lists  submitted  explicitly  contain  a  reference  to  the
processing of location data. As the list submitted by the Polish Supervisory Authority for an
opinion  do  not  contain  such  a  reference,  the  Board  encourages  the Polish  Supervisory
Authority to include the processing of location data in its list, together with another criterion.

EMPLOYEE MONITORING
The  Board  is  of  the  opinion  that,  due  to  its  specific  nature,  the employee  monitoring
processing, meeting the criterion of vulnerable data subjects and of systematic monitoring in
the guidelines, – could require a DPIA. Given that the list submitted by the Polish Supervisory
Authority for an opinion of the Board already envisages this type of processing as requiring a
data  protection  impact  assessment,  the  Board  solely  recommends  making  explicit  the
reference to the two criteria in the guidelines WP29 Guidelines WP248. In addition, the Board
is of the opinion that the WP249 of the Article 29 working party remains valid when defining
the concept of the systematic processing of employee data.

INCONSISTENCY WITH THE GUIDELINES
The Board noticed that the Polish Supervisory Authority repeats the criteria of the Working
Party 29 Guidelines in its items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9. However, the Guidelines state that in most
cases a data controller can consider that a processing meeting two criteria would require a
DPIA to be carried out. As such, the Board is of the opinion that the list submitted by the
Polish Supervisory Authority is not in line with the guidelines. Therefore the Board requests
the Polish Supervisory Authority to bring its list in compliance with the guidelines by adding
the fact that, in most cases, for the aforementioned points, only a processing meeting two
criteria would require a DPIA, and that the more criteria are met by the processing, the more
likely it is to present a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, and therefore to
require a DPIA, regardless of the measures which the controller envisages to adopt.

PROCESSING USING NEW/INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY
The list submitted by the Polish Supervisory Authority for an opinion of the Board envisages
that the processing of personal data using innovative technology in conjunction with at least
one other criterion, requires a DPIA. The Board takes note of the inclusion of this criterion in
the list.

Conclusions / Recommendations

3.
The draft list of the Polish Supervisory Authority may lead to an inconsistent application of
the requirement for a DPIA and the following changes need to made:

Regarding the indicative nature of the list: the Board requests an explanation to be
added to the document containing the list, stating its non-exhaustive nature.
Regarding the reference to the guidelines: the Board requests the Polish Supervisory
Authority to amend its document accordingly.
Regarding  biometric  data: the  Board  requests  the Polish  Supervisory  Authority to
amend its list accordingly, by adding explicitly the processing of biometric data for the
purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person in conjunction with at least one other
criterion to its list.
Regarding genetic data: the Board requests the Polish Supervisory Authority to amend
its list by adding explicitly the processing of genetic data in conjunction with at least
one other criterion to its list.
Regarding location data: the Board encourages the Polish Supervisory Authority to
include the processing of location data in its list, together with another criterion.
Regarding employment monitoring: the Board solely recommends making explicit the
reference to the two criteria in the guidelines WP29 Guidelines WP248.
Regarding  the inconsistency  with  the  Guidelines: the  Board  requests  the Polish
Supervisory Authority to bring its list in compliance with the guidelines by adding the
fact that, in most cases, for the aforementioned points, only a processing meeting two
criteria would require a DPIA.

Final Remarks

4.
This  opinion  is  addressed  to  the Urząd  Ochrony  Danych  Osobowych  (Polish  Supervisory
Authority) and will be made public pursuant to Article 64 (5b) GDPR.

According to Article 64 (7) and (8) GDPR, the supervisory authority shall communicate to the
Chair by electronic means within two weeks after receiving the opinion, whether it will amend
