The European Data Protection Board 
 
Having  regard  to  Article  63,  Article  64  (1)(f)  and  Article  47  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with 
regard  to  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data,  and  repealing 
Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter “GDPR”), 
 
Having  regard  to  the  European  Economic  Area  (EEA)  Agreement  and  in  particular  to  Annex  XI  and 
Protocol 37 thereof, as amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 
20181, 
 
Having regard to Article 10 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018, as last amended 
on 2 December 2019, 
 
 
Whereas: 
 
(1)  The  main  role  of  the  European  Data  Protection  Board  (hereinafter  the  EDPB)  is  to  ensure  the 
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the European Economic Area. To this effect, it follows 
from article 64(1)(f) GDPR that the EDPB shall issue an opinion where a supervisory authority (SA) aims 
to approve binding corporate rules (BCRs) within the meaning of article 47 GDPR. 
 
(2)  The  EDPB  welcomes  and  acknowledges  the  efforts  the  companies  make  to  uphold  the  GDPR 
standards in a global environment. Building on the experience under the Directive 95/46/EC the EDPB 
affirms the important role of BCRs to frame international transfers and its commitment to support the 
companies in setting-up their BCRs. This opinion aims towards this objective and takes into account 
that the GDPR strengthened the level of protection, as reflected in the requirements of article 47 GDPR 
and, in addition, conferred to the EDPB the task to issue an opinion on the competent supervisory 
authority’s (BCR Lead) draft decision aiming to approve BCRs. This task of EDPB aims to ensure the 
consistent  application  of  the  GDPR,  including  by  the  supervisory  authorities,  controllers  and 
processors. 
 
(3) Pursuant to Article 46(1) GDPR, in the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller 
or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation only if the 
controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data 
subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.  A group of undertakings or 
group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity may provide such safeguards by the use of 
legally binding BCRs, which expressly confer enforceable rights on data subjects and fulfil a series of 
requirements (article 46 GDPR). The specific requirements listed in the GDPR are the minimum items 
BCRs  shall  specify  (article 47(2) GDPR).  The  BCRs  are  subject  to  approval  from  the  competent 
supervisory  authority  (“competent  SA”),  in  accordance  with  the  consistency  mechanism  set  out  in 
article 63 and 64(1)(f) GDPR, provided that the BCRs meet the conditions set out in Article 47 GDPR,

Member States”.

together  with  the  requirements  set  out  in  the  relevant  working  documents  of  the  Article 
29 Working Party2, endorsed by the EDPB. 
 
(4) WP256 rev.01 of the Article 29 Working Party,3 as endorsed by the EDPB, provides for the required 
elements for BCRs for controllers, including the Intra-Company Agreement where applicable, and the 
application  form.  WP264  of  the  Article 29 Working Party,  as  endorsed  by  the EDPB,  provides  for 
recommendations  to  the  applicants  to  help  them  demonstrate  how  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
article 47 GDPR  and  WP256 rev01.  Additionally,  WP264 
informs  the  applicants  that  any 
documentation submitted is subject to access to documents requests in accordance to the supervisory 
authorities’ national laws. The EDPB is subject to Regulation 1049/2001 pursuant to article 76(2) GDPR.  
 
(5) Taking into account the specific characteristics of BCRs provided for by Article 47(1) and (2), each 
application should be addressed individually and is without prejudice to the assessment of any other 
Binding  Corporate  Rules.  The EDPB  recalls  that  BCRs  should  be  customised  to  take  account  of  the 
structure of the group of companies that they apply to, the processing they undertake and the policies 
and procedures that they have in place to protect personal data.4  
 
(6) The opinion of the EDPB shall be adopted, pursuant to Article 64(3) GDPR in conjunction with article 
10(2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure, within eight weeks after the Chair has decided that the file is 
complete. Upon decision of the EDPB Chair, this period may be extended by a further six weeks, taking 
into account the complexity of the subject matter. 
 
 
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION: 

1  SUMMARY OF THE FACTS 

1. 

2. 

In accordance with the cooperation procedure as set out in WP263 rev.01, the draft Controller BCRs 
of  Fujikura  Automotive  Europe  Group  were  reviewed  by  the  Spanish  Data  Protection  Authority 
(hereinafter Spanish Supervisory Authority) as the BCRs Lead SA.  

The Spanish Supervisory Authority has submitted its draft decision regarding the draft Controller BCRs 
of  Fujikura  Automotive  Europe  Group,  requesting  an  opinion  of  the  EDPB  pursuant  to  article 
64(1)(f) GDPR on 10/01/2020. The decision on the completeness of the file was taken on 14/01/2020. 

2  ASSESSMENT 

3. 

The Fujikura Automotive Europe Group (FAE Group, i.e. Fujikura Automotive Europe, S.A.U. and each 
of its subsidiaries) draft Controller BCRs will apply to intra-group data processing and transfers and

specifically protect any personal data processed by FAE Group within and transferred outside of the 
EEA. Concerned data subjects include current and past employees, job applicants,  clients, suppliers 
and contact persons.  

The FAE Group draft Controller BCRs have been scrutinised according to the procedures set up by the 
EDPB. The SAs assembled within the EDPB have concluded that the FAE Group draft Controller BCRs 
contain all elements required under article 47 GDPR and WP256 rev01, in concordance with the draft 
decision of the Spanish Supervisory Authority submitted to the EDPB for an opinion. Therefore, the 
EDPB does not have any concerns which need to be addressed. 

3  CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS 

Taking into account the above and the commitments that the group members will undertake by signing 
FAE  Group  Intra-Group  Agreement  on  Binding  Corporate  Rules,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  draft 
decision  of  the  Spanish  Supervisory  Authority  may  be  adopted  as  it  is,  since  those  Rules  contain  
appropriate safeguards to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this 
Regulation is not undermined when personal data will be transferred to and processed by the group 
members based in third countries. Finally, the EDPB also recalls the provisions contained within article 
47(2)(k) GDPR and WP 256 rev.01 providing the conditions under which the applicant may modify or 
update the BCRs, including updates to the list of BCRs group members. 

4  FINAL REMARKS 

This opinion is addressed to the Spanish Supervisory Authority and will be made public pursuant to 
article 64(5)(b) GDPR. 

According  to  Article  64(7)  and  (8)  GDPR,  the  Spanish  Supervisory  Authority  shall  communicate  its 
response to this opinion to the Chair within two weeks after receiving the opinion. 

Pursuant  to  article  70(1)(y)  GDPR,  the  Spanish  Supervisory  Authority  shall  communicate  the  final 
decision  to  the  EDPB  for  inclusion  in  the  register  of  decisions  which  have  been  subject  to  the 
consistency mechanism.
