The European Data Protection Board

Having regard to Article 63, Article 64 (1c), (3) - (8) and Article 43 (3) of the Regulation 2016/679/EU
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons
with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC (hereafter “GDPR”),

Having  regard  to  the EEA  Agreement  and  in  particular  to  Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as
amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,1

Having regard to Article 10 and 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,

Whereas:

(1) The main role of the Board is to ensure the consistent application of the Regulation 2016/679
(hereafter GDPR) throughout the European Economic Area. In compliance with Article 64.1 GDPR, the
Board shall issue an opinion where a supervisory authority (SA) intends to approve the requirements
for the accreditation of certification bodies pursuant to Article 43. The aim of this opinion is therefore
to create a harmonised approach with regard to the requirements that a data protection supervisory
authority or the National Accreditation Body will apply for the accreditation of a certification body.
Even though the GDPR does not impose a single set of requirements for accreditation, it does promote
consistency. The Board seeks to achieve this objective in its opinions firstly by encouraging SAs to
draft their requirements for accreditation following the structure set out in the Annex to the EDPB
Guidelines on accreditation of certification bodies, and, secondly by analysing them using a template
provided by EDPB allowing the benchmarking of the requirements (guided by ISO 17065 and the EDPB
guidelines on accreditation of certification bodies).

(2)  With  reference to  Article 43 GDPR,  the  competent  supervisory  authorities  shall adopt
accreditation requirements. They shall, however, apply the consistency mechanism in order to allow
generation of trust in the certification mechanism, in particular by setting a high level of requirements.

(3) While requirements for accreditation are subject to the consistency mechanism, this does not
mean that the requirements should be identical. The competent supervisory authorities have a margin
of discretion with regard to the national or regional context and should take into account their local
legislation. The aim of the EDPB opinion is not to reach a single EU set of requirements but rather to
avoid significant inconsistencies that may affect, for instance trust in the independence or expertise
of accredited certification bodies.

(4) The “Guidelines 4/2018 on the accreditation of certification bodies under Article 43 of the General
Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)” (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), and “Guidelines 1/2018 on
certification and identifying certification criteria in accordance with article 42 and 43 of the Regulation
2016/679” will serve as a guiding thread in the context of the consistency mechanism.

(5) If a Member State stipulates that the certification bodies are to be accredited by the supervisory
authority, the supervisory authority should establish accreditation requirements including, but not

1 References to the “Union” made throughout this opinion should be understood as references to “EEA”.

Adopted

limited to, the requirements detailed in Article 43(2). In comparison to the obligations relating to the
accreditation of certification bodies by national accreditation bodies, Article 43 provides fewer details
about the requirements for accreditation when the supervisory authority conducts the accreditation
itself. In the interests of contributing to a harmonised approach to accreditation, the accreditation
requirements used by the supervisory authority should be guided by ISO/IEC 17065 and should be
complemented by the additional requirements a supervisory authority establishes pursuant to Article
43(1)(b). The EDPB notes that Article 43(2)(a)-(e) reflect and specify requirements of ISO 17065 which
will contribute to consistency.2

(6) The opinion of the EDPB shall be adopted pursuant to Article 64 (1)(c), (3) & (8) GDPR in conjunction
with Article 10 (2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure within eight weeks from the first working day after
the  Chair  and  the  competent  supervisory  authority  have  decided  that  the  file  is  complete.  Upon
decision of the Chair, this period may be extended by a further six weeks taking into account the
complexity of the subject matter.

HAS ADOPTED THE OPINION:

1 SUMMARY OF THE FACTS

1.

2.

The Norwegian  supervisory  authority (hereinafter  “NO SA”) has  submitted  its  draft  accreditation
requirements under Article 43 (1)(b) to the EDPB. The file was deemed complete on 5 October 2021.
The Norwegian national accreditation body (NAB) will perform accreditation of certification bodies to
certify using GDPR certification criteria. This means that the NAB will use ISO 17065 and the additional
requirements set up by the NO SA, once they are approved by the NO SA, following an opinion from
the  Board  on  the  draft  requirements,  to  accredit  certification  bodies. The NO SA will  perform
accreditation of certification bodies to certify using GDPR certification criteria.

2 ASSESSMENT

2.1 General reasoning of the EDPB regarding the submitted draft decision
The purpose of this opinion is to assess the accreditation requirements developed by a SA, either in
relation to ISO 17065 or a full set of requirements, for the purposes of allowing a national accreditation
body or a SA, as per article 43(1) GDPR, to accredit a certification body responsible for issuing and
renewing certification in accordance with article 42 GDPR. This is without prejudice to the tasks and
powers of the competent SA. [In this specific case, the Board notes that the NO SA has decided to
resort to its national accreditation body (NAB) for the issuance of accreditation, having put together
additional requirements in accordance with the Guidelines, which should be used by its NAB when
issuing accreditation.

2 Guidelines 4/2018 on the accreditation of certification bodies under Article 43 of the General Data Protection
Regulation,

This assessment of NO SA’s additional accreditation requirements is aimed at examining on variations
(additions  or  deletions)  from  the  Guidelines  and  notably  their Annex 1. Furthermore,  the EDPB’s
Opinion  is  also  focused  on  all  aspects  that  may  impact on a  consistent  approach  regarding  the
accreditation of certification bodies.

It should be noted that the aim of the Guidelines on accreditation of certification bodies is to assist
the SAs while defining their accreditation requirements. The Guidelines’ Annex does not constitute
accreditation requirements as such. Therefore, the accreditation requirements for certification bodies
need  to  be  defined  by  the  SA  in  a  way  that  enables  their  practical  and  consistent  application  as
required by the SA’s context.

The Board acknowledges the fact that, given their expertise, freedom of manoeuvre should be given
to NABs when defining certain specific provisions within the applicable accreditation requirements.
However, the Board considers  it  necessary  to  stress  that,  where  any  additional  requirements  are
established, they should be defined in a way that enables their practical, consistent application and
review as required.

The Board notes that ISO standards, in particular ISO 17065, are subject to intellectual property rights,
and therefore it will not make reference to the text of the related document in this Opinion. As a
result, the Board decided to, where relevant, point towards specific sections of the ISO Standard,
without, however, reproducing the text.

Finally, the Board has conducted its assessment in line with the structure foreseen in Annex 1 to the
Guidelines (hereinafter “Annex”). Where this Opinion remains silent on a specific section of the NO
SA’s draft accreditation requirements, it should be read as the Board not having any comments and
not asking the NO SA to take further action.

This opinion does not reflect upon items submitted by the NO SA, which are outside the scope of
article  43  (2)  GDPR,  such as  references  to  national  legislation.  The  Board  nevertheless  notes that
national legislation should be in line with the GDPR, where required.
2.2 Main points of focus for the assessment (art. 43.2 GDPR and Annex 1 to the EDPB
Guidelines) that the accreditation requirements provide for the following to be
assessed consistently:

a. addressing all the key areas as highlighted in the Guidelines Annex and considering

any deviation from the Annex.

b.

c.

independence of the certification body

conflicts of interests of the certification body

d. expertise of the certification body

e. appropriate safeguards to ensure GDPR certification criteria is appropriately applied

by the certification body

f.

g.

procedures for issuing, periodic review and withdrawal of GDPR certification; and

transparent handling of complaints about infringements of the certification.

9.

Taking into account that:
Adopted

a. Article 43 (2) GDPR provides a list of accreditation areas that a certification body need to

address in order to be accredited;

b. Article 43 (3) GDPR provides that the requirements for accreditation of certification bodies

shall be approved by the competent Supervisory Authority;

c. Article 57 (1) (p) & (q) GDPR provides that a competent supervisory authority must draft and
publish the accreditation requirements for certification bodies and may decide to conduct the
accreditation of certification bodies itself;

d. Article 64 (1) (c) GDPR provides that the Board shall issue an opinion where a supervisory
authority intends to approve the accreditation requirements for a certification body pursuant
to Article 43(3);

e.

If accreditation is carried out by the national accreditation body in accordance with ISO/IEC
17065/2012, the additional requirements established by the competent supervisory authority
must also be applied;

f. Annex 1 of the Guidelines on Accreditation of Certification foresees suggested requirements
that a data protection supervisory authority shall draft and that apply during the accreditation
of a certification body by the National Accreditation Body;

the Board is of the opinion that:

2.2.1 PREFIX

10.

11.

The Board acknowledges the fact that terms of cooperation regulating the relationship between a
National Accreditation Body and its data protection supervisory authority are not a requirement for
the  accreditation  of  certification  bodies per  se.  However,  for  reasons  of  completeness  and
transparency,  the  Board considers  that  such  terms of  cooperation,  where existing,  shall  be made
public in a format considered appropriate by the SA.

2.2.2 GENERAL REMARKS

Under  section  3  of  the  draft  accreditation  requirements,  for  completeness  purposes  the  Board
encourages  the  NO  SA  to indicate which  guidelines they  refer  to (i.e. EDPB Guidelines, 04/2018).
Likewise, the Board encourages the NO SA to, where referring to ISO standards, to ensure that the
relevant sections of the standards are mentioned (e.g. section 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 and 5.2 of the draft
requirements) as well as to ensure consistency of the terminology throughout the text (e.g. section
9.3.1 (2.b.ii) the term “competent supervisory authority” to be replaced by the term “Norwegian SA”).

2.2.3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCREDITATION

12.

Under section 4.1.2 (9) of the NO draft requirements, the Board takes note of the obligation to explain
the consequences of withdrawal or suspension of accreditation for the certification body and how this
impacts the client. The Board understands that the intention of the NO SA is to ensure that the client

Adopted

is aware of the consequences in those situations and of the potential options or actions that can be
taken.  However, the Board considers that, in order to ensure that certification agreements accurately
reflect not only the consequences and impacts on the client, but also the potential further actions, the
NO SA’s accreditation requirements should make clear that simply stating the consequences without
addressing the potential next steps will not be sufficient. Thus, the EDPB encourages the NO SA to
make clear in its accreditation requirements that the clients should be aware of the consequences,
the impact they have on them and the potential next steps that may be taken.

The  EDPB  takes  note  of  u section  4.2 of  the  NO  accreditation  requirements  that  lays  down  the
obligation to ensure that the tasks of the certification bodies do not lead to conflict of interest. The
Board  acknowledges  the  importance  to  have  requirements  that  ensure,  firstly  that  they  are  not
conflicts of interests and, secondly, that in case conflicts of interest are identified, that the certification
body manages them. Therefore, the Board encourages the NO SA to clarify that in addition to having
rules to preventing conflicts, there should be clear rules to manage identified conflicts of interest.

2.2.4 PROCESS REQUIREMENTS

The Board takes note of the general process requirements, as listed in section 7.1 (2) of the NO SA’s
draft accreditation criteria. However, the EDPB highlights that the obligation of the accreditation body
to notify the relevant CSAs before a certification body starts operating an approved EU Data Protection
Seal in a new Member State is missing. Therefore, the Board recommends that the NO SA modifies its
requirements accordingly so to bring section 7.1(2) of the latter in line with the section 7.1(2) of the
Guidelines.

3 CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS

15.

The  draft  accreditation  requirements  of  the Norwegian Supervisory Authority  may  lead  to  an
inconsistent application of the accreditation of certification bodies and the following changes need to
be made:

16.

Regarding ‘process requirements’, the Board recommends that the NO SA:

1) modify section 7.1(2) in order to include the obligation of the accreditation body to notify

not only the NO SA, but also the CSAs.
