HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING BINDING DECISION 

1  SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE 

1.  This  document  contains  a  binding  decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 

in  accordance  with 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. The decision concerns the dispute arisen following a draft decision (hereinafter 
“Draft Decision”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission", hereinafter 
the “IE SA”, also referred to in this document as the LSA) and the subsequent objections expressed by 
six CSAs, namely the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information 
(“Der Bundesbeauftragter für  den  Datenschutz und  die  Informationsfreiheit”) hereinafter the  “the 
German  Federal  SA”  or  the  “DE  SA”,  the  Finnish  supervisory  authority  (“Tietosuojavaltuutetun 
toimisto”), hereinafter  the  “FI SA”,  the French  supervisory  authority  (“Commission  Nationale  de 
l'Informatique et des Libertés”), hereinafter the “FR SA”, the Italian supervisory authority (“Garante 
per  la  protezione  dei  dati  personali”),  hereinafter  the  “IT SA”,  the  supervisory  authority  of  the 
Netherlands (“Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”), hereinafter the “NL SA” and the Norwegian supervisory 
authority (“Datatilsynet”), hereinafter the “NO SA”. 

2.  The  Draft Decision  relates to  a  “complaint-based  inquiry”,  which  was commenced  by  the IE SA, 
regarding a complaint originally submitted to the Hamburg supervisory authority (“Der Hamburgische 
Beauftragte für Datenschutz und  Informationsfreiheit”), hereinafter “the DE HH SA“. The case was 
subsequently  referred to the DE SA, being the  relevant supervisory  authority, to decide  whether 
WhatsApp  Ireland  Limited  (hereinafter,  “WhatsApp IE”), an  online  instant  messaging  platform, 
complies with its obligations under the GDPR.    

3.  The complaint was lodged on 25 May 2018 by a data subject who requested the non-profit noyb  – 
“European Center for Digital Rights” (hereinafter “NOYB”) to represent her under Article 80(1) GDPR 
(both hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant”). It concerned the lawfulness of WhatsApp IE’s 
processing of personal data (hereinafter “WhatsApp services”), specifically data processing on foot of 
the Complainant’s acceptance of its Terms of Service (and purportedly her acceptance of its Privacy 
Policy), and the transparency of information provided by WhatsApp IE to the Complainant about that 
processing.  The  Complainant  alleged a violation  of  the  right to  data protection and  especially  a 
violation of “Articles 4(11), Article 6(1)(a), Article 7 and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR”4, by arguing that 
the controller relied on a “forced consent”5. The complaint requested to investigate6 and to impose 
corrective measures7. “In the alternative, should the Supervisory Authority not interpret these elements 
as consent”, the Complainant takes the position that the controller has no legal basis for the processing 
operations “which are not a core element of the instant-messaging service and  /or in the interest of 
the  user  (such  as  advertisement,  sponsored  content,  sharing  of  information  within  a  group  of 

                                                             
4 Complaint, paragraph 2.2.5.  
5 Complaint, paragraphs 1.3 and 2.2.5. 
6 Within its request to investigate, the Complainant requested that a full investigation be made to determine 
“which processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the personal data of the data subject”, “for 
which purpose they are performed”, “on which legal basis for each specific processing operation the controller 
relies on”, and to acquire “a copy of any records of processing activities”. The Complainant also requested “that 
the results of this investigation [be] made available to [her]”. Complaint, paragraph 3.1.  
7 More specifically, the complaint requested in paragraph 3.2 that the competent SA “prohibits all processing 
operations that are based on an invalid consent of the data subject”, and in paragraph 3.3 that an “effective, 
proportionate and dissuasive fine” be imposed.

companies  analysis  and  improvement of  the controller’s products  etc.)”, “since these elements are 
clearly not a relevant contractual obligations and no other option under Article 6 of the GDPR seems to 
apply in this situation”8. 

4.  Upon receipt of the complaint on 31 May 2018, the IE SA qualified the activities falling within the scope 
of the aforementioned complaint as cross-border processing pursuant Article 4(23) GDPR. As the main 
establishment of WhatsApp IE (as defined in Article 4(16) GDPR) was found to be in Ireland, the IE SA 
was identified  as being  the LSA, within the meaning of  the GDPR, in respect of  the cross-border 
processing carried out by that company9.

submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism:

The complaint was lodged with the DE HH SA.  
The DE-HH SA passed the complaint, for reasons of competence, to 
the DE SA. On 31 May 2018, the complaint was passed by the DE SA 
to the IE SA.  
The IE SA  commenced  the inquiry  (hereinafter the “inquiry”) and 
requested information from WhatsApp IE. 
Its scope and legal basis were set out in the Notice of Commencement 
of  Inquiry that was sent to the  Complainant and WhatsApp IE by 
letters on 20 August 2018. 
On  11  March 2019,  WhatsApp  IE  provided  replies  to  preliminary 
queries by the IE SA. Procedural issues, including allegation of bias 
were raised by the Complainant by correspondence on 3 December 
2018, and subsequent letters from 29 February 2019, 19 April 2019 
and 24 February 2020, as well as a phone call on 1 April 2019, that 
were addressed by the IE SA. 
The  IE  SA  prepared  a  Draft  Inquiry Report against  WhatsApp  IE 
regarding its processing activities within the scope of the inquiry. The 
IE SA invited the Complainant and WhatsApp IE to make submissions 
in relation to such draft report. 
WhatsApp IE provided its submissions  in relation to the Draft Inquiry 
Report. 
The  Complainant’s  submissions  dated  4  September  2020  were 
provided to the IE SA by the DE SA. 

The Complainant and WhatsApp  IE, as well as the IE SA’s  decision 
maker, were furnished with a copy of the IE SA’s Final Inquiry Report, 
outlining  the  Investigator’s  views,  as  to  whether  WhatsApp  IE 
complied with its obligation under the GDPR.  
The IE SA commenced the decision-making stage.  

The  IE  SA  issued  a  preliminary  draft  decision  (hereinafter  “the 
Preliminary  Draft  Decision”)  against  WhatsApp  IE,  regarding  its 
processing activities within the scope of the inquiry.

It was communicated on the same day to the Complainant to enable 
them  to  make  observations.  The  IE  SA  further  attempted  to 
communicate the Preliminary Draft Decision to WhatsApp IE on this 
same  date, to enable  it  to  exercise  its  right to  be  heard. Having 
subsequently  discovered  that an IT systems’  failure prevented the 
Preliminary  Draft Decision  from  reaching WhatsApp  IE, the  IE  SA 
shared again the Preliminary Draft Decision with WhatsApp IE on 20 
January 2022.  
Further exchanges of correspondence took place between the IE SA 
and the Complainant, addressing translation issues, the scope of the 
complaint, as well as allegations that the complete documents had 
not been provided.  
WhatsApp IE provided submissions  on the Preliminary Draft Decision 
to the IE SA. 
The IE SA communicated with Complainant’s’ legal representatives, 
confirming that if no further correspondence was received by 1 March 
2022, the IE SA would proceed on the basis that the Complainant did 
not wish to make submissions. No submissions  were received.  
The IE SA shared its Draft Decision with the CSAs in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR.  
Several CSAs  (DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA, and NO SA) raised 
objections in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR. 
The IE SA issued a Composite Response setting out its replies to the 
objections  raised  and  shared 
(hereinafter, 
“Composite Response”).  
The  IE  SA  requested  that  the  CSAs  consider  the  responses  and 
proposals outlined in the Composite Response and confirm whether 
they addressed the concerns underlying the objections raised.  
In  light  of  the  proposals 
in  the  Composite  Response,  further 
exchanges took place between the IE SA and the CSAs.  During the 
exchanges, several CSAs (among which the NL SA10, the DE SA11, the 
FI SA12 and the NO SA13) confirmed to the IE SA that its compromise 
proposals  were not  sufficient  and they intended  to maintain their 
objections. 
On 8 July 2022, WhatsApp IE was informed of the upcoming triggering 
of the Article 65 GDPR procedure, and was invited to exercise its right 
to be heard in respect of all the material that the IE SA proposed to 

it  with  the  CSAs

refer to the EDPB 14 and on 17 August 2022 WhatsApp IE provided its 
submissions  (hereinafter the “WhatsApp IE Article 65 Submissions”).  
The IE SA referred the matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 
60(4) GDPR, thereby initiating the dispute resolution procedure under 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. 

6. 

 
Following the submission by the LSA of this matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR 
in  the  Internal  Market Information  system  (hereinafter, “IMI”)15 on  19  August  2022,  the  EDPB 
Secretariat assessed the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair in line with Article 11(2) of the 
EDPB RoP.  

7.  The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA on 23 September 2022, asking for clarifications in relation to 
some documents not provided  whilst mentioned in Article 11.7 of the EDPB RoP, but mentioned in 
other documents. On the same date, the IE SA provided the information requested and confirmed the 
completeness of the file. 

8.  A matter of particular importance that was scrutinized by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be 
heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (hereinafter the “EU 
Charter”). Further details on this are provided in Section 2 of this Binding Decision. 

9.  On  7 October 2022, after the Chair confirmed  the completeness  of the file, the EDPB Secretariat 

circulated the file to the EDPB members. 

10.  The Chair decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) of the EDPB 
RoP, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on account of the 
complexity of the subject-matter. 

2  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

11.  The EDPB is subject to EU Charter , in particular Article 41 (the right to good administration). This is 
also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB RoP. Further details were provided in the EDPB Guidelines on Article 
65(1)(a) GDPR 16. 

12.  The EDPB’s binding decision “shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all 
the supervisory  authorities concerned and binding  on them” (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is not aiming to 
address directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possible need 
for the EDPB to offer the right to be heard at the EDPB level to WhatsApp IE, the EDPB assessed if 
WhatsApp IE was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the procedure 
led by the LSA and the subject-matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB. In particular, the 
EDPB assessed if all the documents containing the matters of facts and law received and used by the 
EDPB to take its decision in this procedure have already been shared previously with WhatsApp IE.  

                                                             
14  The  objections, the Composite Response, including the IE SA’s assessment of the relevant and reasoned 
objections, as well as the replies of the CSAs. 
15 The Internal Market Information (IMI) is the information and communication system mentioned in Article 17 
EDPB RoP. 
16 See EDPB Guidelines 3/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, adopted on 13 April 2021 (version for 
public consultation) (hereinafter, “Guidelines on Article65(1)(a), paragraphs 94-108.

13.  The EDPB notes  that WhatsApp  IE has received the opportunity  to  exercise its right to be heard 
regarding all the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered by the EDPB in the 
context of this decision and provided its written observations17, which have been shared with the EDPB 
by the LSA18.  

14.  Considering that WhatsApp IE has been already heard by the IE SA on all matters of facts and of law 
addressed by the EDPB in its binding decision, the EDPB is satisfied that Article 41 of the EU Charter 
has been respected.  

15.  The EDPB considers that the Complainant is not likely to be adversely affected by this binding decision, 
and consequently does not meet the conditions to be granted a right to be heard by the EDPB in line 
with Article 41 of the EU Charter, applicable case law, and Article 11 of the EDPB RoP. This is without 
prejudice  to any  right to  be heard or  other related rights the Complainant  may have  before the 
competent national supervisory authority(/-ies). 

3  CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION 

16.  The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4) 

and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR 19. 

3.1  Objection(s) expressed by CSA(s) in relation to a draft decision 

17.  The EDPB notes that several CSAs raised objections to the Draft Decision via IMI. The objections were 

raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR. 

18.  More specifically, objections were raised by CSAs in relation to the following matters: 

•  whether the LSA should have found an infringement for lack of appropriate legal basis; 

• 

the potential additional infringement of the principles of fairness, purpose limitation and data 
minimisation; 

•  on possible further investigation; 

• 

• 

corrective measures other than fines; 

the imposition of an administrative fine. 

19.  Each of the objections was submitted within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR.

18 IN-18-5-6 Memo for Secretariat (Referral of objections to the EDPB pursuant to Article 60(4) and 65(1)(a) 
GDPR), 19 August 2022. 
19 According to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority has 
raised a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the objection 
or the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned. 

Adopted 

 

9 

3.2  The LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objections to the Draft Decision 

or is of the opinion that the objections are not relevant or reasoned 

20.  On 1 July 2022, the IE SA provided to the CSAs an analysis of the objections raised by the CSAs in the 

Composite Response.  

21.  The IE SA concluded that it would not follow the objections, and in addition, underlined that some of 
them are not in its view “relevant” and/or “reasoned”; within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR and, 
otherwise, for the reasons set out in the Composite Response and below 20.  

3.3  Admissibility of the case 

22.  The case at issue fulfils, prima facie, all the elements listed by Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, since several CSAs 
raised objections to a draft decision of the LSA within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, and 
the LSA has  not followed  objections  or  rejected them, for being  in its  views,   as  not relevant or 
reasoned. 

23.  The EDPB takes note of WhatsApp IE’s position that the EDPB should suspend the current Article 65 
GDPR dispute resolution due to pending preliminary ruling proceedings before the Court of Justice of 
the EU (hereinafter, “CJEU”)21. WhatsApp IE refers in particular to cases C-252/2122 and C-446/2123. 
Following its assessment, the EDPB decides to continue its proceedings on this Article 65 GDPR dispute 
resolution, as there is no explicit legal basis for a stay of the dispute resolution procedure in EU law, 
nor are existing CJEU rulings on the matter conclusive for the situation of the EDPB 24. Also, the EDPB 
takes into consideration the data subjects’ right to have their complaints handled within a ‘reasonable 
period’ (Article 57(1)(f) GDPR), and to have their case handled within a reasonable time by EU bodies 
(Article 41 of the EU Charter). Moreover, ultimately there are remedies available to the affected parties 
in case of a discrepancy between the EDPB binding decision and CJEU rulings in the aforementioned 
cases25. 

24.  Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the EDPB is 
competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of

23 Request for a preliminary ruling of 20 July 2021, Schrems, C-446/21. 
24 Judgment of the CJEU of 28 February 1991, Delimitis, C-234/89, EU:C:1991:91; Judgment of the CJEU of 14 
December 2000, Masterfoods, C-344/98, EU:C:2000:689. These cases concerned proceedings before the national 
courts, where the parties faced the risk of being confronted with a conflicting decision of the national judge that 
could be seen as de facto nullifying the Commission decision – a power which is retained by the CJEU. The current 
dispute resolution procedure concerns the adoption of an administrative decision, which can be subject to full 
judicial review. 
25 In case an action for annulment is brought against the EDPB decision(s) and found admissible, the General 
Court/CJEU has the opportunity to invalidate the decision of the EDPB. In addition, and if the General Court/CJEU 
were to  deliver any judgment in the time between the  adoption of the  EDPB’s Article 65 decision and the 
adoption of the IE SA’s final decision, the IE SA may ultimately decide to revise the final national decision it takes 
following the EDPB's binding decision - if the CJEU’s rulings gives cause to do so - in accordance with the principle 
of cooperation as elaborated by the CJEU  in its judgment of 12 January 2004, Kühne&Heitz NV, C-453/00,

the relevant and reasoned objection(s), (i.e. whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether 
the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR 26).  

25.  The EDPB recalls that its current binding decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB 
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the 
contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s).  

3.4  Structure of the binding decision 

26.  For each of the objections raised, the EDPB decides on their admissibility, by assessing first whether 
they can be considered as a “relevant and reasoned objection” within the meaning of Article 4(24) 
GDPR as clarified in the Guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection27.   

27.  Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the 
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this 
specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections it deems 
to be relevant and reasoned28.  

4  ON WHETHER THE LSA  SHOULD  HAVE  FOUND AN INFRINGEMENT 

FOR LACK OF APPROPRIATE LEGAL BASIS 

4.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

28.  The IE SA concludes that the GDPR, the case law and the EDPB Guidelines relevant for the case do not 
preclude WhatsApp IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing of users’ 
data necessary for the provision  of its service, including through the improvement of the existing 
service and the maintenance of security standards29. Finding 2 of the Draft Decision reads30 “I find the 
Complainant’s case is not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by WhatsApp on 6(1)(b) 
GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Service.” In addition, the IE SA considers the Guidelines 
of the EDPB on processing for online services based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 31 as being “not strictly 
binding, nonetheless instructive in considering this issue”32.  

29.  The IE SA understands the Complainant’s allegations as33: firstly, the Complainant was given a binary 
choice: i.e. to either accept the Terms of Service and the associated Privacy Policy  by selecting the 

                                                             
26 Article 65(1)(a) in fine GDPR. Some CSAs raised comments and not per se objections, which were, therefore, 
not taken into account by the EDPB. 
27 EDPB Guidelines 9/2020 on the concept of relevant and reasoned objection, version 2 adopted on 9 March 
2021 (hereinafter “Guidelines on RRO”). They were adopted on 9 March 2021, after the commencement of the 
inquiry by the IE SA relating to this particular case.

“accept” button, or cease using the service34; second that there was a lack of clarity on which specific 
legal basis WhatsApp IE relies on for each processing operation35; and the Complainant’s concern on 
WhatsApp IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to deliver its Terms of Service36.  

30.  While the IE SA acknowledges that the EDPB considers in its Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
that, as  a  general  rule,  processing  for  the  provision  of  new  services,  is  not  necessary  for  the 
performance of a contract for online service under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in this particular case, having 
regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by 
the parties, the IE SA concludes that WhatsApp IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal 
basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its service, including through the 
improvement of the existing service and the maintenance of security standards37. In addition, the IE 
SA considers that “issues of interpretation and validity of national contract law are not directly within” 
their competence 38. 

31.  The IE SA disagrees with what it describes as a “very restrictive view on when processing should  be 
deemed to be “necessary” for the performance of a contract” proposed by the Complainant and the 
EDPB 39. The IE SA concludes that “core functions” cannot, however, be considered in isolation from 
the meaning of “performance”, the meaning of “necessity” as set out in the Draft Decision, and the 
content of the specific contract in question40.  The IE SA considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be 
interpreted as requiring that it is  impossible  to perform the contract without the data processing 
operations in question41. 

32.  The IE SA finds it important to have regard not just to the concept of what is “necessary”, but also to 
the concept of “performance” of the contract. According to the IE SA, a contract is performed when 
each party discharges their contractual obligations as has been agreed by reference to the bargain 
struck between the parties. While the IE SA agrees that the mere inclusion of a term in a contract does 
not necessarily mean that it is necessary to perform the particular contract, it stresses out that regard 
must be had for what is necessary for the performance of the specific contract freely entered into by 
the parties42. 

33.  Therefore, the IE SA notes that, the inclusion of a term, which does not relate to the core function of 

the contract could not be considered necessary for its performance43. 

34.  For the purposes of identifying the “core” functions of the contract between WhatsApp IE and its users, 
the IE SA points out that the Complainant does not specify with any great precision the extent of the 
processing (or indeed the processing operation(s)) that the Complainant believes to not be necessary 
to perform the Terms of  Service). The Complainant has  however made some  specific submissions 
arguing processing for service improvement, security, “exchange of data with affiliated companies” 
and that the processing of special categories of personal data is not necessary in order to fulfil the

“core function” of a messaging and calling service such as the WhatsApp services. As a result, the Draft 
Decision focuses on these processing operations44. 

35.  Although according to Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 45, processing cannot be rendered 
lawful  by  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR “simply  because  processing  is  necessary  for  the  controller’s  wider 
business  model”, the IE SA considers that having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the 
nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, WhatsApp IE may in principle rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its 
service, including services for improvements and security features, insofar as this forms a core part of 
the service offered to and accepted by users46.  

36.  Moreover, as described by the IE SA, a distinguishing  feature of the WhatsApp IE’s service is that it 
regularly monitors its service in order to ensure it functions well (as distinct from the EDPB’s reluctance 
expressed in its Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR with using data to bring about new services) 
and maintains certain security and abuse standards. Therefore, the IE SA concludes that the provision 
of this form of service is part of the substance and fundamental object of the contract.  

37.  The IE SA considers that this information is both clearly set out and publicly available, hence it would 
be difficult  to argue that this is  not part of  the mutual expectations of a prospective user and of 
WhatsApp IE. Moreover, the IE SA states that the service is advertised as being one that has these 
features,  and  so  any  reasonable  user  would  expect  and  understand  that this  was  part  of  the 
agreement, even if users would prefer the market would offer them better alternative choices47. 

38.  Based on the foregoing, the IE SA reaches the conclusion that nothing in Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 
6(1)(b)  GDPR prevents  WhatsApp  IE, in  principle,  from  relying on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for  these 
purposes48. 

39.  The IE SA thus concludes that WhatsApp IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis 
of the processing of users’ data necessary on foot of the acceptance of the Terms of Service, including 
for regular improvements and maintaining standards of security49.   

40.  The  IE SA  clarifies  that, having  regard to the  scope  of  the complaint  and  its  inquiry,  the  above 
conclusion cannot be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on users’ 
personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 50. 

41.  The IE SA also notes that other provisions  of the GDPR, such as those on transparency, act to strictly 
regulate the manner in which the WhatsApp IE services are to be delivered and the information that 
should be given to users, and decides to address it separately in its Draft Decision51. 

42.  In a separate finding of its Draft Decision52, the IE SA reiterates that in a previous inquiry on WhatsApp 
IE, an infringement of the GDPR was found as to its compliance with Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c)

GDPR for  processing  on  foot  of  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR 53. The IE recalls the  general requirement of 
transparency under Article 5(a) GDPR 54, and its previous decision and the associated findings, including 
the imposition of a fine and an order to WhatsApp IE to bring its Privacy Policy into compliance55. 

4.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

43.  The DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA object to Finding 2 of the Draft Decision and the assessment 
leading up to it. They consider that  the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1) 
GDPR56, in line with the EDPB’s interpretation of this provision57. 

44.  In the DE SA’s view, contrary to the IE SA’s submissions  in the Draft Decision, WhatsApp IE cannot rely 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or any other legal bases of Article 6(1) GDPR for the processing of a user’s 
data. According to the DE SA, this constitutes a breach of the principle of lawfulness  under Article 
5(1)(a) and  Article 6(1) GDPR. The DE SA is of  the opinion  also that the IE SA  failed to impose an 
appropriate corrective measure in order to remedy these infringements. The DE SA puts forward the 
following arguments in support of the above allegations.  

45.  First, the DE SA does not share the understanding of the IE SA regarding the binding nature of the 
Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The DE SA agrees that guidelines are not legally binding in 
the same way as legal provisions  are. It recalls however that they are instrumental for establishing 
uniform application of EU law according to Article 70(1)(e) GDPR, as well as for ensuring a consistent 
and high level of protection for natural persons in the light of recital 10 GDPR. The DE SA claims that 
the relevant and binding nature of guidelines for all supervisory authorities as such cannot be disputed.  

46.  Second, the DE SA disputes the IE SA’s allegations that, on the one hand, the GDPR does not prohibit 
WhatsApp IE to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in connection with its offer of Terms of Service and, on 
the other hand, that the LSA is not competent to assess the validity of contracts, respectively the 
validity of the Terms of Service or individual clauses. In this regard, the DE SA notes that the IE SA has 
full competence according to Article 57(1)(a) GDPR to assess the validity of contracts.  

47.  Moreover, as stated in the Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, a valid contract is a prerequisite 
for controllers to base their processing operations on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. On that background, the 
DE SA points out that in order to monitor the application of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as required by Article 
57(1)(a) GDPR, the IEA must also verify the validity of the contract WhatsApp IE is relying upon. The 
DE SA adds that according to Article 5(2) GDPR, WhatsApp IE must also prove that such a contract has 
come into existence, meaning that an offer and corresponding acceptance of a contract is declared by 
the parties. In other words, it must be apparent to the contractual partner that they are not giving a 
(revocable) consent, but are concluding a contract. If this is  not the case, the DE SA considers, as 
opposed to the IE SA58, that WhatsApp IE cannot rely on the right to choose its own legal basis.  

                                                             
53  IE SA’s decision of 20 August 2021 in inquiry reference IN-18-12-2 (hereinafter “the IE  SA’s Decision on 
WhatsApp IE’s Transparency”), adopted following EDPB Binding decision 1/2021 on the dispute arisen on the 
draft decision of the  IE SA  regarding WhatsApp IE under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR (hereinafter “EDPB Binding

48.  Third, the DE SA objects to the IE SA’s finding 59 that the necessity of the processing is determined not 
by what is necessary to fulfil  the objectives  of  “a social network“ in a general sense, but  what is 
necessary to fulfil the core functions of the particular contract between WhatsApp IE and its users. 
Those core functions  do not encompass the improvements to an existing service and maintaining 
certain security and abuse standards. The DE SA stresses out that first WhatsApp IE is not a social 
network but a messaging service and that from the perspective of an average data subject, it is not a 
distinguishing  characteristic of  the  WhatsApp  IE  services  to  improve  their  service  constantly  or 
maintain certain security  standards. Therefore, according to  Guidelines  2/2019  on  Article  6(1)(b) 
GDPR 60, such  processing  cannot  be  rendered  lawful  by  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR simply  because  the 
processing is necessary for the controller’s wider business  model. Only the data processing that are 
actually necessary for the corresponding  contractual purpose  – the operation of  the WhatsApp  IE 
Services – can be justified on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. In addition, pursuant to Article 32 GDPR, 
WhatsApp IE has the obligation to implement data security measures regardless of the content of the 
contract, so those measures are not to be considered as an essential element of the contract.  

49.  The DE SA reiterates that Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR explicitly limit the controller’s 
possibility to expand the categories of personal data or types of processing operations that are 
necessary for  the  performance of  the  contract. Based  on  this,  the  DE  SA  concludes  that  the 
interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR given in the Draft Decision would allow for bypassing the data 
protection principles, in particular the requirements for a valid consent, using the Terms of Services.  
50.  Finally, with regard to the allegation in the Draft Decision that the Complainant did not specify “with 
any great precision” which processing operations she believes to be unlawful61, the DE SA argues, 
referring to Article 77 GDPR, that the Complainant has no obligation to do so. The DE SA takes into 
account also that the only  source of information about WhatsApp IE’s processing operations is the 
publicly  available  documents  that  are non-transparent 62. In  the  DE  SA’s  view,  it  is  the duty of 
WhatsApp IE to prove compliance in  accordance with Article 5(2)  GDPR. As a whole, the DE SA 
concludes that the processing described or indicated in the Terms of Service cannot be (fully) based 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Moreover, the DE SA considers that there is no other valid legal basis evident. 
51.  The FI SA objects to the IE SA’s finding 63 that WhatsApp IE can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all the 
processing operations set out in the Terms of Service, such as service improvements and security 
purposes. When it comes to the service improvements and security purposes of processing, the FI SA 
refers at the outset to Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 64 in order to justify its allegation that 
the processing  of data for those  purposes  is not necessary for performing the key aspects of the 
contract and for this reason it cannot be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  

52.  The FI SA contests the LSA’s statement that the legal concept of “core” processing falls out of the 
interpretation of GDPR65. In this respect the FI SA finds that the rationale behind Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
is that it provides a legal basis for situations where processing of personal data will logically need to 
take place only in the course of the provisions of a contractual service. Furthermore, in relation to the 
IE SA’s allegation that the necessity of processing is to be determined by reference to the particular

contract, the FI SA highlights that the controller cannot include in the contract everything they wish to 
be legitimized under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, without having for example to ensure that the data subject’s 
consent  was obtained  or  to carry out  balancing tests between their legitimate interests  and the 
interests of the data subjects.  

53.  In addition, referring to Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 66, the FI SA reaches the conclusion 
that neither WhatsApp IE, nor the IE SA in its Draft Decision have properly and objectively reasoned 
how the processing of personal data was necessary also from the user´s perspective and not only from 
the controller’s side. The FI SA contests the IE SA’s statements that, in general, a reasonable user would 
be well-informed about the processing covered by the contract 67, and that in the specific case the 
user  is  informed  about  the  processing  of  personal  data for  service  improvements  and  security 
purposes,  therefore this processing  is  part of the  mutual expectations of a prospective user  and 
WhatsApp IE68. In addition, while the FI SA admits that service improvements and security might be a 
valid part of the WhatsApp IE services, it is of the opinion  that processing for those purposes is not 
necessary for providing such services, as the WhatsApp IE services could be delivered in the absence 
of processing of such personal data. In addition, the FI SA maintains that the said processing activities 
are not necessary for the performance of the contract. 

54.  Next, while the FI SA agrees that there is no hierarchy between legal bases, it points out that it is the 
responsibility  of the controller to assess which legal basis is appropriate for the specific processing. 
When it comes to the IE SA’s argument that EDPB guidelines are not strictly binding69 the FI SA recalls 
that the GDPR itself refers to the EDPB guidelines in its Article 70(1)(e) and therefore stresses the 
importance of the common position of supervisory authorities. The FI SA also highlights that the EDPB 
shall ensure the consistent application of the GDPR as laid down in Article 70(1) GDPR and enshrined 
in recital 10 GDPR.  

55.  The FR SA objects to the conclusions in Part 4 of the Draft Decision, in particular points 4.47 and 4.49, 
that WhatsApp IE has not failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 6 GDPR, and, in addition, that 
WhatsApp IE is not required to rely on the legal basis of consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). At the outset, 
the FR SA finds questionable the position adopted by the IE SA on WhatsApp IE’s reliance on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR for processing operations related to service improvements. The FR SA notes in this regard 
that the Draft Decision does not define what service improvement processing covers and does not 
provide enough elements on the categories of data used for service improvement purpose, which does 
not allow to pronounce on the applicable legal basis for the processing in question. Therefore, the FR 
SA  requests that the  IE SA  completes its  Draft Decision on  this  point, by  providing  more specific 
information and evidence. According to the FR SA, the main reason of the users’ registration to the 
WhatsApp services is not the use of their data to improve the messaging service. In the FR SA’s view, 
the fact that WhatsApp IE's processing operations for service improvement purpose are based on the 
legal basis of the contract, and that it is accepted by a simple validation of the Terms of Service, is not 
compliant with the applicable provisions.  

56.  The FR SA considers that only the legal bases of legitimate interest and consent can be considered for 
processing operations related to service improvement purpose among those listed in Article 6 GDPR. 
Nevertheless, the FR SA submits  that at first analysis, neither the conditions  for the application of 
consent, nor the conditions for the application of legitimate interest seem to be met and WhatsApp IE

could  not  use  it for  the  implementation of  the processing  operations in  connection  with  service 
improvements. In conclusion, since the IE SA does not define what is covered by the processing of data 
for service improvement purpose and the conditions of implementation, it is not easy for the FR SA to 
have a firm position on this point and so, on the legal basis that applies for the processing. The FR SA 
suggests that the IE SA should provide more specific evidence in its Draft Decision regarding this issue, 
in order to assess if the processing can, or cannot, be based on the legal basis of the legitimate interest. 
The FR SA states that in reaching the conclusion for lack of breach of Article 6(1) GDPR the LSA erred 
in its assessment of the facts of the case. 

57.  The NL SA first observes that the IE SA failed to include sufficient analysis, evidence and research in its 
Draft Decision on what the purposes  of processing selected are, and how data are used, making it 
difficult  to apply  Article 6 GDPR 70. The NL SA  then questions  the validity of  the contract between 
WhatsApp IE and users, and the NL SA argues that, as a result, grounding the processing on Article 
6(1)(b)  would  be  impossible71.  The NL SA  presents the following  arguments. First, in  the NL SA’s 
opinion, the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy are lengthy and unclear72. Next, the NL SA notes 
that as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of a contract, in order to willingly 
enter  into  it,  and  considers  that  ”the  established  serious  lack  of  transparency  on  behalf  of  the 
controller, therefore leads to a reasonable doubt whether data subjects have indeed been able to enter 
into a contract with the controller both willingly and sufficiently informed”73. The NL SA compounds its 
doubts on the validity of the contract by arguing that WhatsApp IE presents a completely one-sided 
deal whereby an individual data subject has no influence on any of the terms74. The NL SA therefore 
considers  that WhatsApp  IE’s statement that it  relies on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for  the  WhatsApp 
services, in combination with documents with general descriptions of the services provided, and the 
IE SA’s reference to the controller’s right to choose its own legal basis to process data, are insufficient 
to accept that the performance of a contract can be used as a legal basis. Last, due to a lack of insight 
in the processing operations and the potential processing of children’s personal data or special 
categories of personal data, the NL SA has serious  doubts on the validity of such a contract when 
children are involved75.  

58.  Further to the foregoing, the NL SA also raises an objection with regard to the IE SA’s approach in its 
Draft Decision’s Finding 2. The NL SA deems the approach taken to be contradictory, given the fact the 
IEA does not wish to enter into analysis of contract law, while at the same time certain concepts from 
contract law  are presented, such  as “performance” of  a contract 76. The NL  SA argues there is  a 
contradiction in the idea that a clear contract is present, while there are significant transparency issues 
at the same time. The NL SA notes that without entering into the specifics of contract law, regard must 
be had to the general rule that both parties must be aware of the substance of a contract as well as 
the obligations of both parties to the contract, in order to willingly enter into such contract 77. In the 
NL SA’s view, the established serious lack of transparency on behalf  of the controller gives rise to 
reasonable doubt in this regard78.

59.  Adding to that, the NL SA also  notes that a relevant step  is to assess  whether the concrete data 
processing activities that are based on the contract, are actually necessary for performing the key 
aspects of the agreement 79.  The NL SA argues that the IE SA has not interpreted the term “necessary” 
in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in line with the EDPB guidance, such as Guideline 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR, on  this  provision80.  The  NL  SA  adds  that the  IE SA  also  did  not  include  any  substantive 
investigation into what data subjects have understood to be the core of the service they have signed 
up to and whether they meant to give their consent for the processing of personal data or whether 
they intended to conclude an agreement with the controller81. In the NL SA’s view, the IE SA did not 
conduct a proper assessment on whether all processing operations could be based on a contract and 
if not, what other legal basis could be applicable82. The NL SA disagrees with the IE SA´s finding that 
the criterion of necessity laid down in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is indirectly impacted by domestic contract 
law, since this criterion has an independent meaning in case law and in different EDPB guidelines83. 

60.  The NO SA contests in essence the IE SA’s finding that WhatsApp IE can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as 
a legal basis for processing in the context of service improvements and security features and proposes 
imposing respective corrective measures. The NO SA questions whether the processing of personal 
data for the purposes of service improvements and security features is genuinely necessary for the 
performance of  the contract in  question.  According  to  the  NO  SA,  the  Draft Decision  enables 
controllers to artificially expand what can fall under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. In support of the above 
objection, the NO SA advances the following arguments.  

61.  First, the NO SA disagrees with the IE SA’s position that any processing of personal data included in 
contractual terms would automatically be lawful if framed in a particular manner. In that context, in 
the NO SA’s view, it is not the legislation which sets the boundaries for lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR, but instead the individual  contract, which makes the IE SA’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR incompatible with Article 8 of the EU Charter. Second, the NO SA suggests that Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR should  be interpreted in light of its wording, purpose and context. The NO SA considers that 
there would always need to be an in concreto assessment of what is necessary for the performance of 
the particular contract overall, on a case-by-case basis. The NO SA is of the opinion that the rationale 
behind  the first  alternative of  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR is  to provide a legal basis for situations where 
processing  of  personal  data will  logically need  to  take place  in  the  course  of  the  provision  of  a 
contractual service. In this sense, the NO SA claims that processing of personal data for the purposes 
of service improvements and security features as described in the Draft Decision is not a logical 
precondition for the messaging service that WhatsApp IE entails. Third, the NO SA believes that the I 
E SA’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has the effect of undermining or circumventing the 
other legal bases of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

62.  With such interpretation, the NO SA finds it hard to foresee when consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR 
would be relied upon as a legal basis. The same applies to situations invoking Article 9 GDPR.  The NO 
SA suggests that there would be no use of the legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) and (f) GDPR, because 
for the controller is much more convenient to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Fourth, according to the 
NO SA,  Article 7(4)  GDPR entails that, if  processing of personal data is in fact necessary for the 
performance of a contract, then a consent can be considered freely given even if the data subject is 
excluded from a service should they decline to give consent. The NO SA considers that under the

interpretation put forward by the IE SA, generally almost all processing of personal data by non-public 
entities could be framed as being necessary for the performance of a contract, also in the context of 
Article 7(4) GDPR. The NO SA alleges that this would render Article  7(4)  GDPR meaningless and 
without effect in practice, as it would never be invoked. This would, in the NO SA’s view, render the 
take-it-or-leave-it consents permissible.  

63.  The NO SA submits that this lower standard for valid consent would in particular be problematic when 
consent serves as a basis for processing of special category of personal data pursuant to Article 9(2)(a) 
GDPR, or as a Chapter V GDPR exemption pursuant to Article 49(1)(a) GDPR.  

64.  Moreover, the NO SA  advances the argument that data subjects may be de facto  dependent on 
certain services and in lack of realistic alternatives to them, in particular due  to network effects, 
therefore they will generally have little opportunity to negotiate standardised terms of service. This 
creates a take-it-or-leave-it situation and an uneven playing field. The NO SA comes to the conclusion 
that if rejecting the contractual terms is necessary in order to protect oneself from harm, so that one 
is subsequently excluded from the service, participating in discussions, corresponding with others and 
receiving information becomes significantly more difficult. As a result, this interpretation could also 
adversely affect data subjects’ freedom of expression and information.  

4.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

65.  The IE SA considers that the objections above are not relevant and/or not reasoned for the purpose of 

Article 60(4) GDPR and decides not to follow them84. 

66.  With regard to the objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA concerning WhatsApp IE’s 
possible reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as the applicable basis for personal data processing, the IE SA 
is of the opinion that an assessment of the core functions of the contract in required.   

67.  The IE SA acknowledges that there are different views on how the “core” elements of the Terms of 
Service are assessed, however it considers that it does not adopt a merely formal approach with regard 
to  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR that relies only on the textual content of the Terms of Service. Moreover, it 
considers that an assessment of the core functions of the contract (not merely on the written terms) 
is required, pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and the requirement for the necessity test 85.  

68.  The IE SA considers that WhatsApp IE has not sought to make the WhatsApp services contingent on 
the Complainant’s consent to the Terms of Service. Moreover, it does not consider that the test for 
contractual necessity  under  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR would  be  reduced  to  an assessment  of  written 
contractual terms, without reference to the fundamental purpose of the contract. The Draft Decision 
does  not take the view that all written contractual terms are necessary for  the performance of a 
contract, thus the risks described in this regard are not relevant 86.  

69.  The IE SA notes that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR legitimises processing which is necessary for the performance 
of a contract (i.e. an agreement which serves the mutual interests of the parties). In addition, it is 
considered that a reasonable user would have had sufficient understanding that the service included 
the use of metrics for improvement. Accordingly, the IE SA disagrees with the interpretation of “core” 
contractual purposes, as suggested by  the CSAs, and  considers  that the Terms of Service properly

reflects the agreement entered into by the Complainant, nor does the restrictive interpretation reflect 
the purpose of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 87. 

70.  The IE SA states that the guidelines are not binding on supervisory authorities, however, they should 
be taken into account. However, the IE SA’s position is that the EDPB has not been provided with the 
legal power to  mandate that certain categories of  processing  must  be  based on  consent,  to the 
exclusion of any other legal bases for processing. The IE SA’s view is that such a power is properly 
exercised from  time to  time by  the EU legislator, in  the form  of  specific  legislative measures.  In 
particular, it is noted that Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR contain very general observations 
to the effect that personal data should not be used “generally” for service improvement pursuant to 
Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  under  these  guidelines,  processing  for  service 
improvement is not prohibited, pursuant to Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR, so long as it falls within the core or 
essential aspects of the service88.  

71.  The IE SA recalls in this regard that the Draft Decision also assesses the core functions of WhatsApp 
IE’s Terms of Service89. The Draft Decision notes that any application of the principle of necessity must 
be  specific  to  the  agreement entered  into  between  the  parties. The  Draft Decision  states  that 
processing should be regarded as necessary for the performance of a contract between the controller 
and the data subject if it is necessary to perform the clearly understood objectives of a contract. The 
Draft Decision also states that in order to understand the mutual understanding of a contract, it is 
necessary  to  have  regard to  the specific  content  of  the  agreement itself.  Having  conducted  an 
assessment of the core or fundamental aspects of WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service, the Draft Decision 
concludes that the nature of the service being offered on this occasion specifically included regular 
service improvement including dealing with abuse, as an aspect of the agreement between WhatsApp 
IE and its users. 

72.  The IE SA clarifies that in reaching the above conclusion, it had regard to the expectations of users 
based on the specific content of the Terms of Service. The IE  concludes on this basis that the processing 
should be regarded as necessary for the performance of WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service. Moreover, 
the IE SA adopts the position that the mutual expectations of the parties as to the performance of the 
contract should consider the expectations and interests of both parties, as reflected in the contract 
itself90. 

73.  The IE SA considers that the EU legislator did not limit the provision  of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR only to 
processing which is strictly necessary for the delivery of goods and services to a data subject, nor are 
the contractual interests of the controller disregarded by this provision. In this regard, the IE SA notes 
that contracts may include aspects of performance, which are optional or contingent. In the IE A’s view, 
Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  is  not  limited  to  aspects  of  contractual performance  which  are  expressly 
mandatory and unconditional obligations of the parties. Accordingly, the IE SA is not satisfied that the 
ability to opt-out of any particular processing must logically be construed as conclusive evidence that 
such processing is not necessary to perform a contract. The IE SA submits that the exercise of options 
by a data subject in the context of a contract does not necessarily undermine the agreement entered 
into, or the necessity of processing while such options are engaged. The IE SA refers to the CJEU case 
C-524/0691 in support of its  finding that necessity in the context of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR cannot be

assessed by reference to hypothetical alternative forms of the WhatsApp IE services, as the CJEU has 
held in that case that processing which exceeds the most minimal level of processing possible, may be 
regarded as necessary, where it renders a lawful objective “more effective”. The IE SA states that it is 
not the role of supervisory authorities to impose specific business models on controllers. 

74.  The IE SA, taking into account the specific facts of this case, considers that WhatsApp IE as a controller 
has not attempted to artificially include processing which is not necessary for the fundamental purpose 
of its services. The IE SA considers that Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR confirm the legal 
position,  which  is  that service  improvement  processing  pursuant  to  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR is  not 
prohibited per se, as long as it falls within the core or essential aspects of the service.  

4.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

4.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

 

75.  The objections  raised by the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and NO SA  concern  “whether there is  an 
infringement of the GDPR”92. Additionally, the DE SA and NO SA’s objections also concern “whether the 
action envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”93. 

76.  The EDPB takes note of WhatsApp IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets 
the threshold  of Article 4(24) GDPR 94. From a general standpoint, WhatsApp IE argues that “to the 
extent Objections relate to matters which are outside of the Defined Scope of Inquiry, as identified in 
the Draft  Decision, they fail  to  satisfy  the requirements of  Article 4(24)  GDPR  and  as  such  are not 
“relevant and reasoned”.” 95. Contrary to WhatsApp IE’s position on relevance96, objections can have 
bearing on the “specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision”, despite not aligning with the 
scope of the inquiry as defined by an IE SA. Furthermore, the EDPB does not accept WhatsApp IE’s 
narrowing the scope of the ”reasoned” criterion to arguments on issues that have been investigated or 
addressed in the inquiry  97, as no such limitation can be read in Article 4(24) GDPR 98. 

77.  Contrary to WhatsApp IE’s argument that CSAs may not object to the scope of the inquiry as decided 
by the IE SA, the EDPB does not share this reading of Article 65 GDPR. Furthermore, this possibility is 
explicitly stated in the RRO Guidelines, especially regarding complaint-based investigations99.

94 WhatsApp IE’s  Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 75-120. 
95 WhatsApp IE’s Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 3.3. 
96 WhatsApp IE cites the Guidelines on RRO, which state that “[a]n objection should only be considered relevant 
if it relates to the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision” (paragraph 14) to draw the conclusion 
that any objection raising matters outside the scope of the inquiry is not relevant. See WhatsApp's Article 65 
Submissions, paragraph 3.3. The EDPB notes that paragraph 14 of the Guidelines on RRO draws a distinction 
between  relevant objections and “abstract or  broad concerns  or  remarks”  on  the  one  hand and “minor 
disagreements” on the other. Moreover, this paragraph should be read in conjunction with paragraph 27 of the 
Guidelines on RRO.  
97 WhatsApp IE’s Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 3.3. 
98 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 16-19. 
99 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27: “For instance, if the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to 
cover some of the issues raised by the complainant or resulting from an infringement reported by a CSA, a relevant 
and reasoned objection may be raised based on the failure of the LSA to properly handle the complaint and to 
safeguard the rights of the data subject.” 

Adopted 

 

21 

78.  WhatsApp IE also states that “were the EDPB to expand the scope of the Inquiry as set by the DPC at 
this stage, in the manner proposed in the Objections, this could not be reconciled with the procedural 
requirements of  Irish  or  European  Union  (“EU”)  law,  and  would  infringe  WhatsApp  IE’s legitimate 
expectations, right to fair procedures and due process (including the right to be heard), and rights of the 
defence”100. Despite claiming it is  “clear”, WhatsApp IE does  not demonstrate in  which manner its 
procedural rights would  be breached, just  by the mere fact that the EDPB finds specific objections 
admissible. This is especially questionable, since admissibility determines the competence of the EDPB, 
but not the outcome of the dispute between the LSA and the CSAs. Likewise, WhatsApp IE does not 
explain how the mere act of considering the merits of admissible objections inevitably and irreparably 
breaches the procedural rights cited by WhatsApp IE101. Accepting WhatsApp IE’s interpretation would 
severely  limit  the  EDPB’s  possibility  to  resolve  disputes  arising  in  the  one-stop-shop,  and  thus 
undermine the consistent application of the GDPR. The objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and 
NO SA on the finding of an infringement all have a direct connection with the Draft Decision as they 
refer to a specific part of the latter, which is Finding 2. All of those objections concern “whether there 
is  an infringement of  the GDPR” as they argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of 
Article 6 GDPR 102 or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. As the IE SA considered that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was not 
breached, the objections entail a need for a change of the IESA’s Draft Decision leading to a different 
conclusion. Consequently, the EDPB finds that the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and NO SA’s objections 
relating to the infringement of Article 6 or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR relevant.  

79.  The part of the DE SA’s objection arguing that the IE SA should find an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR and impose the erasure of unlawfully processed personal data and the ban of the processing of 
data, and the part of the NO SA’s objection arguing that the IE SA should order WhatsApp IE to “delete 
personal data” and “impose an administrative fine” are linked to the IE SA’s Finding 2 of the Draft 
Decision with regard to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Therefore, they are directly connected with the substance 
of the Draft Decision and, if followed, would lead to a different conclusion, namely a change in this 
Finding.  Thus, the EDPB considers  that these  parts of  the DE SA  and NO  SA’s objections  are also 
relevant. 

80.  The objections  of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and NO SA all include arguments on legal/factual 
mistakes in the Draft Decision that require amending. More specifically, these CSAs provide arguments 
to challenge the Draft Decision’s consideration that WhatsApp IE can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a 
lawful basis for personal data processing as specified in the Terms of Service103. The IE SA held that the 
GDPR permits the reliance, by WhatsApp IE, on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of 
Terms of Service104 including of users’ data in relation to improvement of the existing service and the 
maintenance of security standards105. This view is challenged in broad terms as well as in detail. Some 
of the CSAs provide arguments challenging the validity of the contract on which the use of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR as a legal basis depends, and which the IE SA accepts106. Some of the CSAs express that of Article

6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis cannot be relied upon regarding the purpose of service improvements107 
and standards of security108. 

81.  Some CSAs109 recall, while referring to the terms of Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR110, that 
it is the fundamental and mutually understood – by the parties of the contract – contractual purpose, 
which justifies  that the processing  is  necessary. This  purpose  is not  only  based on the controller’s 
perspective but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract and 
thus on  “the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract”. The FR SA and the 
NO SA111 disagree with the Draft Decision in that the purposes of service improvement are described 
in  the Draft Decision  in very broad  and vague terms, are not a logical precondition  for the actual 
contractual service of WhatsApp IE and are not the main reason of a user’s registration to the WhatsApp 
services.  The  FI  SA  adds  that most  users,  including  the  Complainant,  are  likely  unaware  of  this 
processing of personal data in the context of the WhatsApp IE services112.  

82.  The DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and NO SA’s objections also identify risks posed by the Draft Decision as 
drafted in the current manner, in particular the interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR that could be 
invoked by any controller for any processing would undermine or bypass data protection principles113, 
would  lower the threshold  for  legality of  data processing 114 and thus  endanger the rights of  data 
subjects within the EEA115. As an example, the NO SA highlights that ”if it is possible  to frame almost 
any  processing  of  personal  data  in  contractual terms such  that it  automatically  becomes lawful,  as 
would be the result pursuant to the [Draft Decision], data subjects would in reality have no control of 
their  personal  data”116, while  “the FI  SA  stresses  that  this  would  create a  significant  risk  that  the 
principle of lawfulness and fairness is circumvented”117. 

83.  WhatsApp IE contends that in terms of risk, the objections must ”demonstrate the likelihood of a direct 
negative impact of  a  certain significance  of  the Draft Decision on  fundamental rights  and freedoms 
under the EU Charter and not just  any data subject rights”118. WhatsApp IE thus adds a condition to 
Article 4(24) GDPR, which is not supported by the GDPR 119.  

84.  Considering the objections of the CSAs and the arguments brought forward by WhatsApp IE, the EDPB 
finds the objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SAs on the finding of an infringement of 
Article 6 or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR reasoned.

and in particular their right to protection of personal data”, which directly stems from Article 8(1) of the EU 
Charter. Therefore, there is no reason to draw a distinction between the data subject rights protected by the 
GDPR and the fundamental rights protected under the EU Charter when interpreting Article 4(24) GDPR.

85.  As regards the parts of the DE SA and NO SA’s objections requesting the finding of an infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and specific corrective measures under Article 58 GDPR for the infringement of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that these parts of the objections do not sufficiently elaborate 
the legal or factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision leading to the finding 
of an infringement of  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR or to the imposition  of the specific  corrective measures 
mentioned above. Likewise, the significance of the risk for data subjects, which stems from the IE SA’s 
Draft Decision not to conclude on  the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and not  to impose the 
requested corrective measures, is not sufficiently demonstrated.  

86.  Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA 
on the finding  of an infringement of Article 6 or Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR are relevant and reasoned in 
accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR.  

87.  However, the parts of the DE SA and NO SA’s objections  concerning the additional infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the imposition of specific  corrective measures are not “reasoned” and do not 
meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

4.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

88.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure, the EDPB 
shall take a binding decision  concerning all the matters which are the subject of the  relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

89.  Based on the documents transmitted by the IE SA, the EDPB understands that the purposes of  the 
processing operations covered by these objections are the following: (i) service improvements, and (ii) 
“safety and security”. In its Terms of Service, WhatsApp IE refers to its own definition  of safety and 
security as follows: "We work to protect the safety and security of WhatsApp by appropriately dealing 
with  abusive  people and  activity  and  violations  of  our  Terms. We  prohibit  misuse  of  our  Services, 
harmful conduct towards others, and violations of our Terms and policies, and address situations where 
we may be able to help support or protect our community. We develop automated systems to improve 
our ability to detect and remove abusive  people and activity that may harm our community and  the 
safety and security of our Services. If we learn of people or activity like this, we will  take appropriate 
action by removing such people or activity or contacting law enforcement. We share information with 
other affiliated companies when we learn of misuse or harmful conduct by someone using our Services." 
90.  As a preliminary remark, the EDPB notes, as observed  by the NL SA, that the purposes  are vague, 
especially the one on “safety and security”, mentioned by WhatsApp IE in its Terms of Service. The 
EDPB understands from the short description provided under the relevant section of WhatsApp IE's 
Terms of Service that it refers to “misuse” of WhatsApp services, “harmful conduct”, and activities that 
would  violate WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA considered that the 
Complainant did not identify particular processing operations with any degree of specificity, and that 
complaints should in general have a reasonable degree of specificity, and, hence addressed the issue 
of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in principle. In doing so, the Draft Decision refers to various terms: “abusive 
activity” (which is referred to in WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service)120, “fraud”121 and “security” without 
further description122  (which is referred to in WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service), which do not bring 
clarity  and/or  more  specificity  on  this  purpose.  Based  on  these  elements,  and  considering  that 
WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service refer to another purpose of processing than the security carried out

and services or processing to which WhatsApp IE is entitled or obliged under other legal provisions 
(e.g. technical and organisational measures applied to protect personal data, for instance as required 
under  Article 32 GDPR 123), the EDPB is  excluding  “IT Security” from  its  assessment  of  the merits 
hereinafter. On a similar note, the EDPB highlights that when the purpose  of the processing is “IT 
Security”, for instance in the meaning of Article 32 GDPR, the purpose  of the processing has to be 
clearly and specifically identified by the controller124. 

91.  The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection125 require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  needs  to  be  changed  insofar  as  it  rejects  the 
Complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit WhatsApp IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for 
the processing operations set out in its Terms of Service. When assessing the merits of the objections 
raised, the EDPB also takes into account WhatsApp IE’s position on the objections and its submissions.  
92.  The CSAs seek in essence to establish whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could serve as a valid legal basis 
for the processing of personal data at issue, namely for service improvements and security features, 
in the specific case and to establish whether there is an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

93.  The CJEU has found that so far as concerns the principles relating to lawfulness of processing, Article 6 
GDPR sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of the cases in which processing of personal data can 
be regarded as lawful. Thus, in order to be considered lawful, processing must fall within one of the 
cases provided for in Article 6 GDPR 126 and it is the controller’s obligation to provide and to be able to 
prove that the correct legal basis is applied for the respective processing. 

94.  The EDPB considers that there is sufficient information in the file for it to decide whether the IE SA 
needs to change its Draft Decision insofar as it rejects the Complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not 
permit WhatsApp IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its 
offering of its Terms of Service. 

95.  As described  above, in  Section 4.3, the IE SA concludes  in Finding  2 of its Draft Decision that the 
Complainant’s case is not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by WhatsApp IE on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of the latter offering its Terms of Service. Neither Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR nor any other provision of the GDPR precludes WhatsApp IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
as  a  legal basis  to  deliver  a  service,  including  the improvement  of  the  existing  service  and  the 
maintenance of  security  standards insofar  as that forms  a core  part of  the service127. The IE SA 
considers  that, having  regard to the specific  terms of  the contract and the nature of  the service 
provided and agreed upon by the parties, WhatsApp IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as 
a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its WhatsApp services, on 
foot  of  the  Complainant’s  acceptance of  the  Terms  of  Service128. The  IE  SA  considers  that this 

                                                             
123 WhatsApp IE may also fall under legal duties to protect the security of its networks and services, as required 
by other laws. See for instance Article 40 of the European Electronic Communications Code established under 
Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018. 
124 See Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, paragraph 16. 
125  Objections concerning the  issue on  the  applicability of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  for  purposes of  service 
improvement and security features were raised by the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA, and NO SA.

information  is  clearly  set  out,  publicly  available  and  understandable  by  any  reasonable  user129. 
WhatsApp IE supports the IE SA’s conclusion130. 

96.  To assess the IE SA and WhatsApp IE’s claims, the EDPB considers it necessary to recall the general 
objectives that the GDPR pursues, which must guide its interpretation, together with the wording of 
its provisions and its normative context 131. 

97.  The GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of 
the EU Charter and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the  EU, which  constitute EU 
primary law132. As the CJEU clarified, ”an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way 
as not to affect its validity  and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the 
provisions  of  the Charter. Thus, if  the wording of  secondary EU legislation  is open to more than one 
interpretation, preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent 
with primary law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary 
law”133. In view of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and 
sharing, the GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the EU, backed 
by strong enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control over their 
own personal data 134. By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection 
throughout the EU, the GDPR seeks to ensure the free movement of personal data within the EU135. 
The  GDPR  acknowledges  that the  right to  data protection  needs  to  be  balanced  against other 
fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the freedom to conduct a business, in accordance with the 
principle of proportionality136 and has these considerations integrated into its provisions. The GDPR, 
pursuant to EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to data subjects and 
their dignity, and not as a commodity, they can trade away through a contract 137. The CJEU provided 
additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy 
and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests138. 

98.  The principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to 
the protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process 
the personal data of individuals  if it is able to rely on one of the basis found  in the exhaustive and 
restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR 139. 

99.  The principle of lawfulness goes hand in hand with the principles of fairness and transparency in Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of

data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences a processing may have on them, and having 
regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller140. 

100. The EDPB agrees with the IE SA and WhatsApp IE that there is no hierarchy between Article 6(1) legal 
bases141. However, this does  not mean that a controller, as WhatsApp  IE in the present case, has 
absolute discretion to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller 
may only rely on one of the legal bases established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the 
processing in question142. A specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet 
its requirements set by the GDPR 143 and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. 
A legal basis will not be appropriate if its application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect 
“effet utile” pursued by the GDPR and its Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR 144. These criteria stem from 
the content of the GDPR 145 and the interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given 
thereto described in paragraph 97 above. 

101. The GDPR makes WhatsApp IE, as the controller for the processing at stake, directly responsible for 
complying with the GDPR’s principles, including the processing of data in a lawful, fair and transparent 
manner, and any obligations derived therefrom146. This obligation applies even where the practical 
application of GDPR principles such as those of Article 5(1)(a) and Article (5)(2) GDPR are inconvenient 
or run counter to the commercial interests of WhatsApp IE. The controller is also obliged to be able to 
demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations derived therefrom, such as that it meets 
the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis147. More specifically, this condition to be able to 
rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process the data subject’s data implies that a controller, 
in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, has to be able to demonstrate that 
(a) a contract exists and (b) the contract is valid pursuant to applicable national contract laws148. 

102. The EDPB agrees that supervisory  authorities do not  have, under  the GDPR, a broad and general 
competence in contractual matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks, that the 
GDPR bestows on supervisory authorities, imply a limited competence to assess a contract’s general

142 As mentioned in Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, paragraph 18, the identification of the appropriate 
lawful basis is tied to the principles of fairness and purpose limitation. It will be difficult for controllers to comply 
with these principles if they have not first clearly identified the purposes of the processing, or if the processing 
of personal data goes beyond what is necessary for the specified purposes. See also Section 5 below on the 
potential additional infringement of the principles of fairness, purpose limitation and data minimisation.

decision 2/2022”), paragraph 84.

validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment of their tasks under the GDPR 149. Otherwise, the 
supervisory authorities s would see their monitoring and enforcement task under Article 57(1)(a) GDPR 
limited to actions, such as verifying whether the processing at stake is necessary for the performance 
of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a processor under Article 28(3) GDPR 
and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate safeguards pursuant to the GDPR. 

103. The DE SA and NL SA150 argue that the validity of the contract for the WhatsApp services between the 
latter and the Complainant is questionable given the serious transparency issues in relation to the legal 
basis relied on151. In contract law, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of 
the contract and of the obligations of both parties to the contract in order to willingly enter into such 
contract. 

104. Notwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB refers to its previous interpretative 
guidance on this matter152 to provide below its analysis on whether the processing for the purposes of 
service improvement and security features153 is objectively necessary for WhatsApp IE to provide its 
services to users based on its Terms of Service and the nature of the services. 

105. The EDPB recalls154 that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, ”[i]t is important 
to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is 
against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance”155. As 
the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of 
the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively 
necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject 156. 
106. Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing 
by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only 
on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into 
the contract 157. 

107. The IE SA accepts “that, as a general rule, the EPDB considers that processing for the provision of new 
services […] would not be necessary for the performance of a contract for online services”158. However, 
the IE SA considers that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and 
the nature of the services provided and agreed upon by the parties, WhatsApp IE may in principle rely 
on Article 6(1)b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of its service, including 
through the improvement of the existing service and the maintenance of security standards. 

108. In particular, the IE SA views service improvement to an existing service and “a commitment to uphold 
certain standards relating to abuse, etc.” as a “core” element of the contract between WhatsApp IE

and the users159. In support of this consideration, the IE SA refers to the information provided in the 
WhatsApp Terms of Service under the headings: “Ways To Improve Our Services.” and “Safety And 
Security.”160 The IE SA considers that it is clear that the WhatsApp services are advertised (and widely 
understood) as ones that requires updates and improvement and so,  that any reasonable user would 
“be  well-informed  that  this  is  precisely  the  nature  of  the  service  being  offered  by  WhatsApp  and 
contained within the contract”161.  

109. The EDPB is of the opinion that WhatsApp IE is under the legal duty to assess whether the processing 
of all its users data is necessary for the purpose of service improvements or if there are alternative, 
less intrusive ways to pursue this purpose (e.g. instead of relying on all users' data for the purpose of 
service improvements, rely on a pool of users, who voluntarily agreed, by providing consent, to the 
processing of their personal data for this purpose). 

110. On this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under 
EU  law. It must  be  interpreted in  a  manner  that fully  reflects  the  objective  pursued  by  an  EU 
instrument, in this case, the GDPR 162. Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision  and the GDPR’s general objective of 
protecting the right to the protection of personal data 163 or contradicts Article 8 of the EU Charter. On 
the  processing  of  data  in  the  WhatsApp  services,  Advocate  General  Rantos  supports  a  strict 
interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR among other legal basis, particularly to avoid any circumvention 
of the requirement for consent 164. 

111. The EDPB finds  that an average user  cannot  fully  grasp  what is  meant by  processing  for  service 
improvement and security features, be aware of its consequences and impact on their rights to privacy 
and  data protection,  and  reasonably  expect  it  solely  based  on  WhatsApp  IE’s Terms  of  Service. 
Advocate  General  Rantos  expresses  similar  doubts  where  he  states,  in  relation  to  Facebook 
behavioural advertising practices, “According to the case-law of  the Court of  Justice, the processing 
must be objectively necessary for the performance of the contract in the sense that there must be no 
realistic, less intrusive alternatives, taking into account the reasonable expectations of the data subject. 
It also concerns the fact that, where the contract consists of several separate services or elements of a 
service that can be performed independently of one another, the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) of the 
GDPR should be assessed in the context of each of those services separately”165 and adds in a footnote 
that “Moreover, although merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough 
to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, processing may be

162 See paragraphs 103-105 above on the principles guiding the interpretation of the GDPR and is provisions. The 
CJEU also stated in Huber that ”what is at issue is a concept [necessity] which has its own independent meaning 
in Community law and which must be interpreted in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that Directive, 
[Directive 95/46], as laid  down in Article 1(1) thereof”.  Judgment  of  18 December  2008, Heinz Huber  v

source of interpretation to underline the EDPB’s reasoning on the processing of data in the Facebook service, 
without prejudice to the case-law that the CJEU may create with its future judgments on Cases C-252/21 and C-
446/21.

objectively  necessary  even  if  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  contract, without  prejudice  to  the 
controller’s transparency obligations”166. 

112. The EDPB provides in its guidance167 assessing what is “necessary” involves  a combined, fact-based 
assessment of the processing “for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared 
to other options  for achieving the same goal”. If there are realistic, less  intrusive alternatives, the 
processing is not “necessary”. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not cover processing which is useful but not 
objectively  necessary for performing the contractual service or for  taking relevant pre-contractual 
steps at the request of the data subject, even if it is  necessary for the controller’s other business 
purposes. While the possibility of improvements of services may routinely be included in contractual 
terms, such processing usually cannot be regarded as being objectively necessary for the performance 
of the contract with the user168. 

113. When analysing the performance of a contract as a legal basis, the necessity requirement has to be 
interpreted strictly. As stated earlier by  the Article 29 Working  Party (hereinafter “WP29”)169, this 
“provision  must  be  interpreted strictly and  does  not  cover  situations  where the  processing  is  not 
genuinely necessary for  the performance of a  contract, but rather unilaterally imposed  on the data 
subject by the controller”170.  

114. Concerning the processing  of service improvement, the EDPB finds  that a reasonable user cannot 
expect that their personal data is being processed for service improvement simply because WhatsApp 
IE briefly  refers to this processing  in its Terms of Service (which  both WhatsApp  IE and the IE SA 
consider as constituting the entirety of the contract), or because of the argument that “on the basis of 
the  cont[r]act  and  wider  circumstances,  that  a  reasonable  user  would  have  had  sufficient 
understanding  that  the  service included  the  use  of  metrics for  improvement” to  which the  IE SA 
refers171. 

115. In addition, the IE SA already decided172 that WhatsApp IE infringed its transparency obligations under 
Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR by not clearly informing the Complainant and 
other users of the WhatsApp IE services’ specific processing operations, the personal data processed 
in  them, the  specific  purposes  they  serve, and  the  legal basis  on  which  each of  the processing 
operations  relies,  as  the  IE SA  concludes  in  its  Draft  Decision173. The  EDPB considers  that this 
fundamental failure of WhatsApp IE to comply with its transparency obligations contradicts the IE SA’s 
finding 174 that WhatsApp IE’s users could reasonably expect service improvement and security features 
as being necessary for the performance of their contract.

alia, to contribute to uniform application of national measures adopted under the Directive. Many of substantive 
principles and provisions of the GDPR already existed in the Directive 95/46/EC, such as the one at stake in this

116. As regards security, the lack of clarity of the Terms of Service makes it even hard to understand what 

are the different purposes pursued and processing carried out 175. 

117. The EDPB recalls that “controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion  as to what the applicable 
legal basis  is” and that this is “particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects”, because “[d]epending 
on  the circumstances, data subjects  may  erroneously  get the impression  that  they are giving  their 
consent in  line with  Article 6(1)(a)  GDPR when signing  a  contract or accepting terms of  service”176. 
Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR requires  the  existence  of  a  contract, its  validity,  and  the  processing  being 
necessary to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the parties (in this case a data 
subject)  is  not provided  with sufficient  information  to know  that they are signing a contract, the 
processing of personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes and on which legal basis, and 
how  this  processing  is  necessary  to perform  the services  delivered. For  the purposes  of  service 
improvement and security features, WhatsApp IE has not relied on any other legal basis to process 
personal data. These transparency requirements are not only an additional and separate obligation, 
but also an indispensable and constitutive part of the legal basis. 

118. Given that the main purpose  for which a user uses the WhatsApp services is to communicate with 
others, and that WhatsApp IE conditions their use to the user’s acceptance of a contract and the service 
improvement and security177 features they include, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the 
possibility of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract. Thus, WhatsApp IE is 
accountable to prove that the legal basis applied for the processing at hand is valid and the failure to 
demonstrate this proves that Article 6(1) GDPR is not the applicable legal basis. 

119. The EDPB agrees with the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA178 that there is a risk that the Draft 
Decision’s failure to establish  WhatsApp  IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR, pursuant  to  its 
interpretation by the IE SA, nullifies this provision and makes theoretically lawful any collection and 
reuse of personal data in connection with the performance of a contract with a data subject. WhatsApp 
IE currently leaves the Complainant and other users of the WhatsApp services with a “take it or leave 
it” choice. They  may either contract away their right to  freely determine the processing  of  their 
personal data and submit to its processing for service improvements or security features, which they 
can neither expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information WhatsApp IE provides 
to  them. Alternatively, they  may  decline  accepting WhatsApp  IE’s Terms  of  Service  and  thus  be 
excluded from a service that enables them to communicate with millions of users. 

120. This precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal 
basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There would be the risk that some 
controllers argue some connection between the processing of the personal data of their consumers 
and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as possible and 
advance their economic interests at the expense of the safeguards for data subjects. Some of the 
safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR as legal basis, instead  of others  such  as consent under  Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and  legitimate 
interest under  Article 6(1)(f)  GDPR, are the possibility to specifically consent  to certain processing

their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and 
the  balancing  exercise  of  the  legitimate  interests  of  the  controller  against  their  interests  or 
fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). 

121. The EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA179 to Finding 2 
of the Draft Decision in that the  processing for the purposes of service improvements and security180 
features performed by WhatsApp IE are objectively not necessary for the performance of WhatsApp 
IE’s alleged contract with its users and are not an essential or core element of such contract.  

122. In conclusion, the EDPB decides that WhatsApp IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
to process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of service improvement and security181 
features in the context of its Terms of Service and therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data. 
The EDPB was not required to examine whether data processing for such purposes could be based on 
other legal bases  because the controller relied solely  on Article 6 (1)  (b) GDPR. WhatsApp IE has 
consequently infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing personal data. The EDPB instructs 
the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision which concludes  that WhatsApp IE may rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Service and to include an infringement of 
Article 6(1) GDPR based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified. 

5  ON  THE  POTENTIAL  ADDITIONAL 

INFRINGEMENT  OF  THE 
PRINCIPLES  OF  FAIRNESS,  PURPOSE  LIMITATION  AND  DATA 
MINIMISATION 

5.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

123. In light of the aforementioned inquiry’s scope, the Draft Decision mentions Article 5(1) GDPR in several 
passages182. As for the fairness principle, the inquiry  consists of  reference to the unfair processing 
pointed out by the Complainant 183. Regarding the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles, 
there are  no  other  references  as  the ones  mentioned  above. The  Draft Decision  makes  several 
references to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the principle of transparency184. However, the Draft Decision 
does not address whether Article 5(1)(a) GDPR regarding fairness principle or Article 5(1)(b) and (c) 
GDPR have been infringed. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA mentions  its Decision on  WhatsApp IE’s 
Transparency,  which  made  findings  to  the  effect  that  transparency  obligations  were  infringed. 
Therefore, the IE SA concludes, that “The inquiry in question focused on the same issues  raised in the 
herein Complaint insofar  as transparency is  concerned (although was much broader in scope). Given 
these issues have already been investigated and adjudicated on by the Commission, I provisionally find 
that the transparency issues raised in this Complaint have already been addressed.”185

5.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

124. The IT SA raises an objection arguing that the Draft Decision should be amended to include findings of 
an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in relation to the fairness principle. This objection claims that, 
even though there is  the IE SA’s Decision on WhatsApp  IE’s Transparency, which incorporates the 
principle set out in the EDPB’s Binding Decision 1/2021 and where an infringement of transparency 
principle was to be found, the infringement regarding to the fairness principle should be separate from 
transparency. The IT SA elaborates that referring to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should not be found to be in 
line with the fairness principle, as users are factually unable to grasp how their personal data is being 
used by WhatsApp IE186.  

125. The IT SA raises another objection  stating that the Draft Decision  should  be amended to include 
findings  of infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR. The IT SA is of the view that the fact that 
WhatsApp  IE’s “(multifarious)  processing  activities  involving  personal  data  are  grounded  in  Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR entails an infringement of purpose limitation and data minimization principles” 187. The 
IT SA  states that the IE SA  has failed to investigate compliance with  Article 5(1)(b) and  (c) GDPR. 
Further, the IT SA states that all the purposes of the processing of personal data performed under the 
terms of  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR must be specified  and communicated to data subjects. As such, the 
service that WhatsApp IE offers pursues several purposes, therefore the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR should  be assessed  separately in the context of each service. The IT SA elaborates that the 
purposes provided to users are inadequate and have no connection to the processing activities. 

5.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

126. The final position  of the IE SA is that of not following these objections.  in its Composite  Response, 
concerning all objections, the IE SA notes that the objections on the fairness principle in Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR are not in the scope of the underlying complaint 188. Furthermore, the IE SA states that this would 
procedurally constrain the IE SA’s ability to adopt its final decision189.  

127. In addition, the IE SA states that it would also risk breaching the controller’s right to a fair procedure, 
as the controller was not afforded a right to be heard on such matter. The IE SA highlights the legal 
consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning infringements outside of the 
complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that WhatsApp IE would succeed in arguing before 
the Irish  courts that it has been denied an opportunity to be heard on additional and extraneous 
findings that are adverse to it190. 

128. The  IE SA  further  considers  that  the objection  raised  by  the  IT  SA  with  regard to  the  possible 
infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR is  not relevant and reasoned, since it would not have been 
appropriate to undertake an open-ended assessment of all processing operations by the controller in 
order to handle  the complaint 191. This would  have resulted in a disproportionate  and open-ended 
examination of the processing carried out by WhatsApp IE. Therefore, it was more important to resolve 
the fundamental dispute regarding the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR first 192.

5.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

5.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

129. The IT SA’s objection concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”193. 
130. The EDPB takes note that WhatsApp IE agrees with the IE SA’s conclusion in its Composite Response 
that the objection from the IT SA about finding an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR also with regard 
to non-conformity  with respect to the fairness  principle is  not relevant. In addition, WhatsApp  IE 
submits that the objection does not meet the “reasoned” threshold as it is not based on any detailed 
factual or legal reasoning and fails to address the significance of the alleged risks to fundamental rights 
posed by the Draft Decision194. According to WhatsApp IE, “it would be inappropriate for the EDPB to 
direct the [IE SA]  to make any findings  in respect of Article 5(1)(a) (fairness  of lawfulness)  in its final 
decision in the Inquiry in circumstances where this is outside the Defined Scope of Inquiry.”195 

131. In addition to the above mentioned, the Complainant does note: “Even if a trained lawyer reads all the 
text that the controller provides, he/she can only guess what data is processed, for which exact purpose 
and on which legal basis. This is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 
5(1)(a) and 13(c). This approach therefore stands in clear contrast to informed consent or any form of 
“plain language” or even “easy to understand” requirements (Recital 39).”196 

132. WhatsApp IE also affirms that compliance with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR is distinct from compliance with 
Article 6(1)  GDPR and  must  be  separately  assessed  before  any  finding  of  infringement  could  be 
made197.  

133. The EDPB recalls that an objection could go as far as identifying gaps in the draft decision justifying the 
need for further investigation by the IE SA, for example in situations where the investigation carried 
out by the IE SA unjustifiably  fails to cover some of the issues raised by the Complainant 198. In this 
regard, the  EDPB observes  that, in  the complaint,  the Complainant  alleges that the  information 
provided in WhatsApp IE’s Privacy Policy “is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning 
of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c)”199. This is also noted by the IE SA200. 

134. As previously mentioned, the EDPB notes that the first objection of the IT SA concerns “whether there 
is an infringement of the GDPR” as it argues that the IE SA should have found an infringement of the 
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. As such objection demonstrates that, if followed, it would 
lead to a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or not, the objection 
is to be considered as “relevant”201.  

135. In addition, this objection is also considered to be “reasoned” since it puts forward several factual and 
legal arguments for the proposed change in legal assessment. The additional infringement stems from

the scope  and findings  of the Draft Decision, which also mentions  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 202, and the 
overarching nature of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.  

136. Additionally, the EDPB finds that the objection of the IT SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the 
risks posed  by the Draft Decision to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, since it 
would create a dangerous precedent that would jeopardize the effective protection of data subjects 
and thus entail flawed corrective actions.  

137. The EDPB considers the objection on Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be adequately reasoned and recalls that 
the assessment of merits of the objection is made separately, after it has been established that the 
objection satisfies the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 203. 

138. Although the second objection of the IT SA, relating to the additional infringements of the purpose 
limitation principle under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and the data minimisation principle under  Article 5(1)(c) 
GDPR, is  relevant and includes  justifications  concerning why  and how  issuing  a decision  with the 
changes proposed in the objection is needed and how the change would lead to a different conclusion 
in the  Draft Decision, it does not satisfy  all the requirements stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR. In 
particular, the  objection  raised  does  not  explicitly  motivate why  the  Draft Decision  itself,  if  left 
unchanged, would present risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. In addition, 
the EDPB notes that the IT SA’s objection does not explicitly elaborate why such a risk is substantial 
and plausible204. Therefore, the EDPB concludes that this particular objection of the IT SA does not 
provide a clear demonstration of the risks as specifically required by Article 4(24) GDPR. 

5.4.2  Assessment of the merits 

139. In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision  concerning all the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is 
an infringement of the GDPR. 

140. The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it contains no finding of 
infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. When assessing  the merits of the 
objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account WhatsApp IE’s position  on the objection and its 
submissions, focussed on arguing that the IT SA objection is not relevant and reasoned, rather than on 
the content. 

141. Before proceeding with the assessment of the merits, the EDPB recalls that the basic principles relating 
to processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as such, be infringed205. This is apparent from the text of 
Article  83(5)(a)  GDPR  which  subjects  the  infringement  of  the  basic  principles  for  processing  to 
administrative fines of up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, of up to 4% of the total 
worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 

142. At first, the EDPB notes that the concept of fairness is not defined as such in the GDPR. However, recital 
39 GDPR provides some elements as to its meaning and effect in the context of processing of personal 

                                                             
202 The Objection refers to paragraph 5.7 of the Draft Decision. 
203 Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), paragraph 63 (“The EDPB will assess, in relation to each objection raised, whether 
the objection meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and, if so, address the merits of the objection in the 
binding decision.”).

data. An important aspect of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1) GDPR, which is linked to recital 
39, is that data subjects should be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences of 
the processing entails and that they should not be taken by surprise at a later point about the ways in 
which their personal data have been used206. 

143. Fairness is an overarching principle, which requires that personal data shall not be processed in a way 
that is  unjustifiably  detrimental, unlawfully  discriminatory, unexpected  or misleading  to  the data 
subject. Measures and safeguards implementing the principle of fairness also support the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects, specifically the right to information (transparency), the right to intervene 
(access, erasure, data portability, rectification) and the right to limit the processing (right not to be 
subject  to  automated individual  decision-making  and  non-discrimination  of  data subjects  in  such 
processing)207. 

144. The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject shall be informed of the 
existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject 
with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account 
the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the 
data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling208. 
145. The EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined 
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that 
every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is 
evident from a number of GDPR provisions: recitals 39 and 42, Article 6(2) and Article 6(3)(b) GDPR 
refer to lawful and fair processing, while recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Article 13(2), Article 14(2) 
and Article 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing. 

146. The IT SA states that “the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR should be found by the LSA in the case 
at  hand  by  having  also  regard  to  the  more  general  fairness  principle,  which  entails  separate 
requirements from those relating specifically to transparency.” 209 

147. There is no dispute that in its Decision on WhatsApp IE’s Transparency, the IE SA found a breach of the 
transparency principle, but  the EDPB considers  that the principle  of  fairness  has  an independent 
meaning  and  stresses  that  an  assessment  of  WhatsApp  IE’s  compliance  with  the  principle  of 
transparency does not automatically rule out the need for an assessment of WhatsApp IE’s compliance 
with the principle of fairness too. 

148. The EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter210. 
The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect of the principle of fairness 
in  the  context  of  processing  personal  data. For  example, the  EDPB has  previously  opined  in  its 
Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “Fairness is an overarching principle which 
requires  that  personal  data  should  not  be  processed  in  a  way  that  is  unjustifiably  detrimental,

208 Recital 60 GDPR. 
209 IT SA’s Objection, paragraph 3, p. 9. 
210 Article 8 of the EU Charter states as follows: “1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data 
concerning him or her. 2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent 
of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law” (emphasis added).

unlawfully  discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject”211. Among the key fairness 
elements that controllers should  consider  in this regard, the EDPB mentions autonomy of the data 
subjects,  data subjects’  expectation, power  balance, avoidance  of  deception, ethical and  truthful 
processing 212. These elements are particularly relevant in the case at hand. The principle of fairness 
under  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR underpins  the entire data protection framework and  seeks to  address 
power asymmetries between controllers and data subjects in order to cancel out the negative effects 
of such asymmetries and ensure the effective exercise of data subjects’ rights.  

149. The EDPB has previously explained that “the principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the 
reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible  adverse consequences processing 
may have on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between 
them and the controller”213. The EDPB recalls that a fair balance must be struck between, on the one 
hand, the commercial interests of controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of 
data subjects under the GDPR 214. A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR refers to pursuing “power balance” as a “key  objective of  the controller-data subject 
relationship”215, especially  in  the context of  online  services  provided  without  monetary payment, 
where users  are often  not  aware of  the ways  and  extent to  which  their personal  data is  being 
processed216. Consequently, if data subjects are not enabled to determine what is done  with their 
personal data, this is in contrast with the element of “autonomy” of data subjects as to the control of 
the processing of their personal data 217. 

150. Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is 
particularly  important  to  ensure  that data subjects  are  protected  from  any  form  of  abuse  and 
deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal 
data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative 
requirements  under  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, taking into  account the  particular service  that is  being 
provided  and  the characteristics of  their users,  serves  as a shield  from the  danger of  abuse  and 
deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries. Therefore, the EDPB disagrees with the IE 
SA’s finding that assessing WhatsApp IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness “would therefore 
not only  represent a significant departure from the scope of inquiry, as formulated, but it would also 
risk breaching the controller’s right to a fair procedure, as regards any matter which was never put to

the complainant during the course of inquiry.”218 In addition, it is important to note that WhatsApp IE 
has been heard on the objections and therefore submitted written submissions  on this matter 219. 

151. The EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to 
the principles of fairness and purpose limitation220. In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while 
finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users 
via the terms of service and the Privacy Policy, compliance with the principle of fairness also relates to 
‘how the controller addressed the lawfulness  of the processing activities in connection with its calling 
and messaging service’ 221. Thus, the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by WhatsApp 
IE with the principle of fairness requires also an assessment of the consequences that the choice and 
presentation of the legal basis entail for the WhatsApp services’ users. In addition, that assessment 
cannot  be  made in  the abstract, but  has  to  take into  account  the specificities  of  the  particular 
messaging service and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for purposes related to 
improvements of the messaging service222. 

152. The EDPB notes that in this particular case, the Complainant was forced to consent to the Terms of 
Service and the Privacy Policy223 and this clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of WhatsApp IE’s 
users by confusing them on whether clicking the ”Accept” button results in giving their consent to the 
processing of their personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance 
with the principle of fairness  is avoiding deception  (i.e. providing information “in  an  objective and 
neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design”224). 

153. As the IE SA itself notes, the Complainant argues that WhatsApp IE relied on ”forced consent” for the 
processing simply because it did in fact believe that the controller was relying on the legal basis of 
consent for that processing 225. The Complainant presents the screenshot, aiming to demonstrate that, 
“the data subject was presented with an easy click to quickly consent, and to return to the service.”226 
The EDPB keeps in mind that in the complaint, this was explained in the context of arguing that consent 
was forced. Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that WhatsApp IE misrepresented the legal 
basis  of  the  processing  and  that  WhatsApp  IE’s  users  are left  ”in  the  dark”  as  to  the  possible 
connections  between the purposes  sought, the applicable legal basis  and  the relevant processing 
activities227. This  being  said,  the EDPB considers  that the  processing  by  WhatsApp  IE cannot  be 
regarded as ethical and truthful228 because it is confusing with regard to the type of data processed,

the legal basis used and the purposes of the processing, which ultimately restricts the WhatsApp IE’s 
users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights. 

154. Considering the seriousness of WhatsApp IE’s misrepresentation on the legal basis relied on identified 
in the current Binding decision229, the EDPB agrees with the IT SA that WhatsApp IE has presented its 
service to its users in a misleading manner230, which adversely affects their control over the processing 
of their personal data and the exercise of their data subjects' rights. 

155. This is all the more supported by the fact that the circumstances of the present case as demonstrated 
above231 and the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 232 further intensify the imbalanced nature of the 
relationship between WhatsApp IE and its users brought up by the IT SA’s objection. 

156. The combination of factors, such as the unbalanced relationship between WhatsApp IE and its users, 
combined with the “take it or leave it” situation that they are facing due to the lack of alternative 
services in the market and the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular 
processing  under their contract with WhatsApp  IE, systematically disadvantages them, limits their 
control over the processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under 
Chapter III GDPR. 

157. Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include a finding of an infringement of the principle of 
fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by WhatsApp IE and to adopt the appropriate corrective measures, 
by addressing, but without being limited to, the question of an administrative fine for this infringement 
as provided for in Section 8 of this Binding decision. 

6  ON THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION 

6.1.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

158. According to the claim233 made in the complaint, data subjects have to “agree to” WhatsApp IE’s Terms 
of Service and Privacy Policy at the time of the update that was made to the documents in April 2018. 
The IE SA considers that it is necessary to recognise the difference between agreeing to a contract and 
providing  consent to personal  data processing specifically  for the purposes  of  complying with the 
GDPR. The IE SA elaborates234 that WhatsApp IE does not rely on consent in order to process data on 
foot of the Terms of Service, nor it is legally required to do so, thus reliance on Article 7 GDPR is not 
applicable,  regarding the  subject  matter of  the  complaint  and  will  not  be  a  subject  to  further 
consideration.  

159. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA concludes that arguments on the applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as 
a legal basis for data processing to facilitate (behavioural) advertising “are not relevant to the within 
inquiry”235, given the absence of references, related to advertising or sponsored content in WhatsApp 
IE’s Terms of Service, and the absence of evidence that such processing takes place.

160. Another consideration made by the IE SA is related to the data processing related to “exchange of data 

with affiliated companies” and the processing of special categories of data, namely:  

2) 

1)  The IE SA considers  that there is no  evidence236 for the assertion  that WhatsApp IE is 
processing  data  that  facilitates  the  inferring  of  special  categories  of  personal  data, 
pertaining to religious views, sexual orientation, political views and health status. Further, 
as stated, no evidence is presented in this regard at all, thus a conclusion is made that the 
processing of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, does not fall within the 
scope of the complaint and is thus irrelevant.   
In its Draft Decision, the IE SA notes that a distinguished  feature of WhatsApp IE is the 
regular monitoring  of  its  service,  in  order  to  ensure  its  well-functioning,  as  well  as 
maintaining a security237  and abuse  standards  (both  being  part of  the substance  and 
fundamental object of the contract). Thus, WhatsApp IE could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
as a legal basis for such processing in principle. Further238, the IE SA considers that it is not 
for an authority such as it, tasked with the enforcement of data protection law, to make 
assessments as to what will or will not make the performance of a contract possible  or 
impossible. Instead, the general principles set out in the GDPR and explained by the EDPB 
in the Guidance must be applied. These principles should  be applied on a case-by-case 
basis, and should  be afforded more weight than generalised examples provided in  the 
Guidance, which are helpful and instructive but are by no means absolute or conclusive.  
3)  The IE SA states that it is clear from the Terms of Service239 that “any sharing with affiliated 
companies  forms  part  of  the general “improvements” that are  carried out pursuant  to 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR” and “sharing of WhatsApp user data to Meta Companies takes place 
on  a  controller to  processor basis  only, there does  not  need to be a  distinct  legal  basis 
supporting it (or assessment of this issue in the Inquiry)”. Moreover, in its view, there is not 
an explicit prohibition  envisaged in Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR related to 
the processing of personal data that is necessary to fulfil a contractual term that commits 
to improving the functionality, efficiency, etc. of  an existing service. Further, the IE SA 
states that the core of the service, as outlined in the specific contract with the data subject, 
clearly includes those services. In its view, the processing is necessary to deliver the service 
offered (as set out in the Terms of Service). 

161. The IE SA supports the conclusions made above by reference to the following:  
162. The IE SA240 begins by pointing out that it is important to distinguish between agreeing to a contract 
that might involve personal data processing, and the provision of consent to personal data processing 
specifically for legitimising the said data processing under the GDPR. It should also be noted that there 
are differences between the legal bases for processing under Article 6(1)(a) and  (b) GDPR. The IE SA 
continues that in many such cases involving a contract between a consumer and an organisation, the 
lawful basis for processing of personal data is “the necessity for the performance of a contract” under 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

163. The IE SA states that the GDPR does not set out any form of hierarchy of lawful bases that can be used 
for processing personal data, whether by reference to the categories of personal data or otherwise. 
Moreover, Article 7 GDPR (as relied on by the Complainant) concerns the conditions for consent and 
is relevant when considerations are made regarding whether particular criteria are met, in order to 
ensure that the consent is lawful. The aforementioned provision is not indicative of which lawful basis 
the controller has to rely on, but instead assists the latter to determine whether the conditions of 
validity are met. Therefore, the IE SA thus considers that Article 7 GDPR is not applicable to the subject 
matter raised by the Complainant.  

164. The IE SA considers that no evidence was presented whatsoever by the Complainant that WhatsApp 
IE processes personal data for the purpose of advertising and that it relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to 
do so241. In addition, the IE SA takes note that WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service are not similar to the 
examples of situations, cited in the complaint, where Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not apply, namely for 
advertising and sponsored consent. The IE SA concludes that arguments related to the applicability of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for data processing that facilitates advertising, are not relevant. 

165. In addition, as outlined in the Schedule to the Draft Decision242, the assertions about WhatsApp IE’s 
alleged ability to infer religious views, sexual orientation, political views and health status  are not 
backed with any evidence on the Complainant’s part. The IE SA concludes243 that there is no evidence 
that WhatsApp IE processes special categories of personal data at all, thus the question of processing 
such data does not fall within the scope of the inquiry at all. 

166. Moreover, according to the IE SA, it is  evident 244 from the Terms of  Service that any sharing with 
affiliated companies forms  part of the general “improvements” that are carried out pursuant to Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR, and so in reality any clear delineation between these two forms of processing would be 
artificial. It needs to be pointed out that one aspect of the aforementioned sharing is the possible 
reception of messages for the purposes of direct marketing and, in particular, “an offer for something 
that might interest”245 the respective user. 

167. The Complainant, however, argues246 that such improvements and security features, as referenced, 
and the associated sharing of data with other Meta Companies (then Facebook Companies), is not 
necessary in order to deliver a messaging service, and that simply placing these terms in the contract 
does not make them necessary. Although those statements might be true, according to the IE SA it 
does not follow that fulfilling these terms is not necessary in order to fulfil the specific contract with 
WhatsApp IE. The IE SA adds that to do that, to use the language of the EDPB, it is necessary to consider 
“the nature of the service being offered to the data subject”.  

6.1.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

168. The FI SA, FR SA and IT SA object to the conclusions reached by the IE SA in its Draft Decision, requesting 
the IE SA to further investigate the matters of behavioural advertising, special categories of personal 
data, the provision  of metrics to third parties, including to companies belonging to the same group, 
and marketing.

169. On behavioural advertising, in the FR SA’s view247, the Draft Decision does not include an analysis for 
the applicable legal basis for the processing of personal data, related to behavioural advertising, as it 
considers that neither the Complainant, nor WhatsApp IE’s general Terms and Conditions provide any 
evidence that personal data are processed  for that purpose. It also notes that this exclusion  is not 
justified by other elements such as investigation reports or the sending of questionnaires by the IE SA. 
Moreover, the FR SA248 is of an opinion that the IE SA should have carried out an investigation in order 
to verify whether or not the WhatsApp IE processes personal data for the purposes  of behavioural 
advertising. 

170. On special categories of personal data, the FR SA argues249 that the Draft Decision does not pronounce 
on  the lawfulness  ground  that is applicable with regard to the processing  of special  categories of 
personal data, even though the complaint does. In addition, together with examining whether the 
conditions  are met in  the present  case for  the processing  of  special categories of  personal  data 
pursuant to Article 9(2) GDPR, the IE SA should have carried out the investigations necessary, in order 
to verify whether such processing is actually taking place. 

171. The IT SA opines250 that the processing of special categories of personal data relating to users that 
participate in chats with business  users relying on a third-party provider (which might be WhatsApp 
IE’s controlling company  Meta) should  have been identified  as a specific  processing  activity to be 
assessed  and evaluated separately by the  IE SA. In addition, the IT SA considers  that no in-depth 
assessment has been carried out in this regard, but instead that the IE SA simply endorses WhatsApp 
IE’s statement that all communications are encrypted. 

172. On the provision of metrics to third parties, including to affiliated companies, the FR SA argues that 
the Draft Decision251 does  not pronounce on the applicable legal basis  for such  processing, despite 
mentioned initially in the complaint. It continues that the IE SA has not defined which activities are 
covered under such processing. Therefore, the FR SA requests the IE SA to complete its Draft Decision 
in this regard. In addition, the FR SA requests that the conditions for the application of the other legal 
bases mentioned in Article 6 GDPR, namely consent, contract and legitimate interest are examined, as 
well. Hence, the FR SA considers, that WhatsApp IE cannot rely on the aforementioned legal bases for 
processing for the purposes provision of metrics to third parties.  

173. The IT SA notes252 that the arguments put forward by  the IE SA regarding the joint assessment of 
processing for service improvement purposes and the exchange of data with affiliated companies, is 
neither convincing, nor exhaustive. The IT SA is of the view that the IE SA should have identified and 
separately assessed  the processing  activities in  question  without “pooling”  them into  the service 
improvement category. Moreover, the exact wording used in WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service includes 
“affiliated companies”, “partners” and “service providers”, which are, in the IT SA’s view, unspecified, 
meaning that the exchange of personal data between them could “hardly fall within the intra-group 
communications  between WhatsApp  and  the  other Meta companies  and  could  be  legitimised  as  a 
controller-processor relationship.” The IT SA argues that the IE SA could have identified and separately 
assessed the legal basis for the said exchange of data with partners and third-party service providers. 
In addition, in the light of  the complaint, the  IT SA  notes that data are exchanged with affiliated

companies not only for service improvement purposes, but also for unspecified  ones, related to the 
management and  provision  of  the WhatsApp services. The IT SA  stresses on  the need for further 
investigation on this matter.  

174. On marketing, the FI SA takes note253 that the Draft Decision contains conclusions  that WhatsApp IE 
may rely on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a  legal basis  in the context of its Terms of Service and, more 
precisely, for the processing for the purposes  set out there, including marketing. Further, the FI SA 
opines that an assessment is needed in order to determine whether WhatsApp IE has a relevant legal 
basis for processing personal data for marketing purposes254. The FI SA argues that, provided that there 
is an indication in WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service that a user might receive marketing messages, the 
IE SA should have carried out an investigation in this regard255.  

6.1.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

175. The IE SA states that it does not propose to “follow”256 the objections raised by the CSAs. 
176. In the light of the suggestions made by some of the CSAs257 that the scope of the inquiry ought to have 
considered  additional  factual  matters, such  as  behavioural  advertising,  the  IE  SA  notes  that  a 
complaint-based inquiry has been conducted. The IE SA considers that a requirement, from a CSA, to 
amend the Draft Decision in order to include findings of infringement(s) that fall outside of the scope 
of the complaint would constrain its ability to adopt its final decision. Moreover, the IE SA stresses out 
that WhatsApp IE has already been informed about the scope of the complaint. The IE SA notes, in this 
regard, that the right to be heard is exercised in response to a particularized allegation of wrongdoing, 
and  WhatsApp  IE was  not  informed  of  an allegation of  infringement relating to these  additional 
matters258. In  the IE  SA’s  opinion,  an  amendment would  prevent  the controller’s  right to  a  fair 
procedure and hinder its right to be heard.  

177. With regard to the processing of special categories of personal data and the assessment made by the 
IE SA, the latter concludes that the reference to such processing by WhatsApp IE must be read as an 
element of the Complainant’s fundamental allegation (i.e. that the agreement to the Terms of Service 
was a form of GDPR consent to processing of personal data, including consent to the processing of 
special  categories of  data). In  circumstances, where  the  scope  of  the  inquiry  has  addressed  the 
fundamental issue  of principle on which the complaint depends, the IE SA is satisfied that it is not 
necessary  to  also  conduct  an  indiscriminate  and  open-ended  assessment  of  the  processing  by 
WhatsApp IE that may otherwise fall within the scope of Article 9 GDPR.  

178. Moreover, regarding the statements made by the FR SA259, the IE SA contends that it is unclear of the 
basis  on  which  the  former  makes  its  assumptions,  and  adds  that the  matter has  already  been 
considered in the Schedule to the Draft Decision.  

 

179. In addition, having conducted an assessment of the core functions of WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service, 
the  IE  SA  concludes  that the  nature  of  the  WhatsApp  services  offered  includes  regular service 
improvement as an aspect of the agreement concluded between WhatsApp IE and the respective user,

thus  the  basis  of  the  processing  is  to  be  regarded  as  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the 
contract 260.However, the IE SA further notes261, contracts may include aspects of performance which 
are optional or contingent. For example, most of the processing carried out by WhatsApp IE, which 
relates to communication between users is optional for users, as a user is not obliged to send messages 
to other users (for example). Such processing is nevertheless directly linked to the core “messaging 
service” function; it would  appear to be uncontroversial that such  processing is  necessary for the 
performance of the Terms of Service, as a type of mutually expected processing. At the same time, this 
processing is optional and not indispensable, and the Terms of Service can otherwise be performed 
without any messages being sent by a user. According to the IE SA, this reflects the fact the Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR is not limited to aspects of contractual performance which are expressly mandatory and 
unconditional obligations of the parties. 

180. Regarding the issue262 related to WhatsApp IE’s controllership and its relationship with the other Meta 
companies, and the degree of investigation carried out, the IE SA contends that it “has nothing further 
to add in this regard”.  

6.1.4  Analysis of the EDPB 
6.1.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

 

181. In this  section, the EDPB considers  whether the objections  raised  by the FI  SA, FR SA and  IT SA, 

regarding the need for a further investigation, meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

182. WhatsApp IE considers that the objections made by the aforementioned CSAs are without merit.  
183. In essence, WhatsApp IE argues that the FR SA’s objection raises concerns with regard to behavioural 
advertising that are not connected to any factual content and do not have any merit, because, as 
confirmed  before  to  the  IE SA,  WhatsApp  IE does  not  engage in  such  processing263. Moreover, 
WhatsApp IE considers264 that the IE SA appropriately addressed this matter in its Draft Decision, given 
the vague nature of the complaint, the misconceptions regarding WhatsApp services, and the lack of 
evidence that such processing is taking place. WhatsApp IE that no factual or legal arguments are put 
forward by the FR SA.  

184. Furthermore, the EDPB takes note of WhatsApp IE’s position on the objection raised by the FR SA with 
regard to  the processing  of  special  categories of  data, according to  which  they  are  based  on  a 
“misunderstanding of the Defined Scope of Inquiry”, as well as the nature of the service offered and 
they “fail to take into account the investigations conducted by the [IE SA]”265. Further, WhatsApp IE 
emphasises that it does not process special categories of data in the course of providing the WhatsApp 
services. Moreover, it is of the view266 that the FR SA does not acknowledge that the processing in 
question has already been addressed by the IE SA in its Draft Decision, concluding that there is no

evidence that it was taking place and that it is irrelevant to the complaint and the inquiry. Thus, for 
WhatsApp IE, the FR SA’s objection raised is neither relevant, nor reasoned267. 

185. With regard to the FR SA’s objection268  regarding the legal basis for provisions  of metrics to third 
parties and the need for a further investigation, WhatsApp IE states that it does not rely on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing. Further, the processing for metrics purposes is carried 
out on a controller-to-processor basis in order to assist WhatsApp IE in processing what forms part “of 
the general ‘improvements’”. WhatsApp IE adds that there is no requirement present to have a distinct 
legal basis for such sharing. It states that “the provision of the WhatsApp Service does not involve any 
sharing of EU WhatsApp users’ personal data with other Meta Companies on a controller to controller 
basis”.  Furthermore, WhatsApp IE argues that the IT SA’s objection269 on the investigation of further 
sharing carried out by WhatsApp IE with “unspecified partners and service providers” is not relevant to 
the issues investigated by the IE SA, nor does it have connection to the substance of the complaint or 
the Draft Decision. Moreover, WhatsApp IE considers that it is not clear what “exchange of data” was 
referred to by the IT SA and its relevance to the inquiry. Thus, WhatsApp IE opines that the IT SA’s 
objection should be rejected. 

186. Finally, with regard to the FI SA’s objection270, WhatsApp IE argues that the FI SA’s statement, regarding 
the reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for processing for marketing purposes is irrelevant and falls outside 
of the defined scope of the inquiry. Further, WhatsApp IE points out that the specific reference to the 
Terms of Service is misunderstood, as it is related to potential marketing messages that users might 
receive from businesses  that use the services offered by WhatsApp IE. Finally, WhatsApp IE considers 
that since businesses use WhatsApp Business API for exchanging messages (with their own terms and 
privacy policies), it is not the controller in respect of those processing operations. 

*** 

187. As regards the objection of the FR SA, arguing that the IE SA did not analyse the applicable legal basis 
for the processing of personal data related to behavioural advertising, the EDPB establishes that it has 
a direct connection with the Draft Decision. The EDPB considers that the FR SA’s objection is relevant 
and, if followed,  would  lead to a different  conclusion.  It includes  arguments on  factual and  legal 
mistakes in the IE SA’s Draft Decision that require amendments, for which it is considered reasoned. 
More specifically, the FR SA’s objection alleges that the IE SA should have carried out an investigation 
in order to verify whether or not WhatsApp IE processes personal data for the purposes of behavioural 
advertising. 

188. As regards the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the EDPB takes note of the FR SA’s remark that the 
position of the IE SA would incur a risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, as 
well as the possibility  that a controller could use the legal basis of the contract to process its users' 
data  for  targeted advertising  purpose.  The  FR  SA  stresses  out  that  such  processing  would  be 
particularly massive and intrusive, thus that it is not in line with the provisions  of the GDPR. 

189. The EDPB considers that the objections raised by the FR SA and the IT SA with regard to the processing 
of special categories of personal data have a direct connection with the Draft Decision, as they refer 
(1) to the lack of conclusions  with regard to the lawful ground applicable to the processing of such 
data, and (2) the rejection of the Complainant’s argument of the processing of such data by WhatsApp

IE. Both are found to be relevant and, if followed would lead to a different conclusion since the IE SA 
would have to carry out further investigations in order to establish whether WhatsApp IE processes 
special categories of personal data, and if so, whether this is done in compliance with the conditions 
set forth in Article 9 GDPR.  

190. The EDPB notes that both objections argue on factual and legal mistakes in the Draft Decision that 
would require amendments, thus they are both reasoned. According to the FR SA, the IE SA’s reasoning 
is not consistent, as the  latter has not considered the matter related to the lawful ground for the 
processing of special categories of personal data, nor evaluated its compliance with Article 9(2) GDPR, 
thus the IE SA shall carry out the necessary investigations. As for the IT SA’s arguments, the EDPB notes 
that no  in-depth  assessment  was conducted  by  the IE SA  regarding the allegations made by the 
Complainant  that WhatsApp  IE processes  special categories of  personal  data, and instead  simply 
endorsed WhatsApp IE’s argument that all communications are encrypted.  

191. In the Draft Decision, the EDPB identifies, as previously asserted by the FR SA and the IT SA, risks for 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, with concrete examples of targeted and 
behavioural advertising given, that would hinder the users’ ability to have control over their data, thus 
the FR SA’s and IT SA’s objections are considered reasoned. 

192. Taking into account the objection raised by the FR SA concerning the legal basis for the provision of 
metrics to third parties, the EDPB considers  that it has a direct connection  to the Draft Decision, 
because it reflects on the fact that the IE SA does not define what the processing for provision of 
metrics to third parties covers, and does not pronounce  itself on the legal basis  applicable to such 
processing  (including  sharing  between  companies  within  the  same  group),  even  though  initially 
mentioned in the latter. The objection is relevant, because if it were followed, different conclusions 
would be reached regarding the conditions under which WhatsApp IE collects consent of data subjects 
for the processing of their personal data for provision of metrics to third parties. 

193. The EDPB notes that the FR SA puts forward arguments regarding factual and legal mistakes that relate 
to the legal basis  applicable to the provisions  of metrics to third parties, and regarding the lack of 
definition of what the aforementioned processing entails. For these reasons, the FR SA’s objection is 
considered reasoned. 

194. As regards the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the EDPB takes note of the FR SA’s remark that the 
Draft Decision would be detrimental for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, as the 
only information provided by the IE SA does not amount to any assessment.  

195. An  objection  is  raised  by  the IT SA  with regard to the exchange of  personal  data with affiliated 
companies. The EDPB is of the view that it has a direct connection to the Draft Decision, as the latter 
only covers two purposes of processing, namely this of service improvement and security, out of those 
raised by the Complainant, hence lacks an assessment of the exchange of data between WhatsApp IE 
and its affiliated companies. The EDPB considers  the  IT SA’s objection  to be  relevant, because, if 
followed, it would lead to different conclusions in the Draft Decision, regarding the assessment related 
to the core functions of the contract and the exchange of data with affiliated companies.  

196. As regards to the risks posed to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, the EDPB takes 
note of the IT SA’s remarks that if the Draft Decision  is left unchanged, it would lead to a severe 
infringement of the users’ right to self-determine the processing of their sensitive personal data, as 
also related to the exchange of data with affiliated companies and, thus, it would prevent the users to 
have control over their data.  

Adopted

197. The EDPB notes that the IT SA’s objection includes clarifications and arguments on factual and legal 
mistakes, namely the failure of the IE SA to conduct investigations with regard to the exchange of data 
with affiliated companies not only for service improvement purposes, but also for unspecified ones, 
related to the management and the overall provision of the service. 

198. Finally, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the FI SA, with regard to the processing of 
personal data for the purposes  of marketing, has a direct connection with the Draft Decision, as it 
reflects on  the fact that the  IE SA  concludes  that there is  no  evidence  of  processing  related to 
marketing. The FI SA’s objection  is considered  relevant, as if followed  it would lead to a different 
conclusion regarding the legal basis, namely this of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for processing of personal data 
for marketing purposes. 

199. The FI SA puts forward arguments regarding the factual and legal mistakes made by the IE SA, relating 
to the legal basis for processing of personal data and the possibility for the respective WhatsApp IE 
users to receive marketing messages. For these reasons, the FI SA’s objection is considered reasoned. 
200. As regards to the risks posed by the Draft Decision to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data 
subjects, the EDPB takes note of the FI SA’s remark that it would incur a risk for data subjects and, 
more precisely, their unawareness of the processing and, as a consequence, their subsequent inability 
to have control over the processing of their personal data. Moreover, the EDPB considers that this 
could lead to undermining their fundamental right of protection of their personal data. 

6.1.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

201. In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure, the EDPB 
shall take a binding decision  concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

202. The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed, as they conclude that the IE SA has 
not carried out a enough investigation as to the applicable legal basis for WhatsApp IE’s processing 
operations (a) for the purposes of behavioural advertising, (b) involving special categories of personal 
data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, (c) for provision of metrics to third parties and (d) for the exchange 
of data with affiliated companies for the purposes of service improvements and (e) for the purposes 
of marketing. When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account 
WhatsApp IE’s position on the objections. 

203. In  its  submissions,  WhatsApp  IE  supports  the  conclusions  made  by  the  IE  SA  that  no  further 

investigation is needed as regards the aforementioned issues raised.   

204. With regard to behavioural advertising, WhatsApp IE states that it does not engage in such processing, 

which fact was subsequently “appropriately addressed”271 by the IE SA in its Draft Decision. 

205. As for the special categories of personal data 272, WhatsApp IE contends that it does not process such 
data in the course of providing the WhatsApp IE services. Moreover, the processing in question has 
already been addressed by the IE SA in its Draft Decision, concluding that there is no evidence that it 
is taking place and that it is irrelevant to the complaint and the inquiry.

206. Moreover, WhatsApp  IE argues that it does  not rely  on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a  legal basis  for 
processing for the provision of metrics to third parties273. Further, such processing is carried out on a 
controller-to-processor  basis  in  order to assist  WhatsApp IE in processing  that forms  part “of  the 
general improvements”. WhatsApp IE adds that there is no requirement to have a distinct legal basis 
for such sharing. It states that “the provision of the WhatsApp Service does not involve any sharing of 
EU WhatsApp  users’ personal data  with other Meta Companies  on a  controller to controller basis”. 
Furthermore, WhatsApp IE opines that the matter of further sharing 274  with “unspecified partners and 
service providers” is not relevant to the issues investigated by the IE SA, nor does it have connection 
to the substance of the complaint or the Draft Decision.  

207. Finally, with regard to the processing for the purposes of direct marketing, WhatsApp IE argues275 that 

it is irrelevant and falls outside of the defined scope of the inquiry.  

208. The IE SA argues276 that it would have been infeasible, hypothetical, and contrary to the complaint 
within  the  meaning  of  Article  77  GDPR to  undertake  an  assessment  of  all  discrete  processing 
operations associated generally with the WhatsApp IE’s Terms of Service, including whether WhatsApp 
IE processes special categories of personal data in this context and whether the sharing of data with 
third parties specifically is lawful, as well as the additional matters concerning WhatsApp IE, in order 
to conclude an investigation of the complaint. In relation to the processing of Article 9 GDPR categories 
of personal data, the IE SA considers that the inquiry has addressed the fundamental issue of principle 
on which the complaint depends, and this makes it unnecessary  to conduct an indiscriminate and 
open-ended  assessment  of  processing  falling  within  the  scope  of  this  Article  or  the  ePrivacy 
Directive277. 

209. Moreover, the  IE  SA  considers  that there  is  no  evidence  for  the  assertion  that WhatsApp  IE is 
processing personal data, that facilitates the inferring of special categories of personal data, pertaining 
to religious views, sexual orientation, political views and health status. Further, as stated, no evidence 
is presented in this regard at all, thus a conclusion is made that the processing of special categories of 
personal data, pursuant to Article 9 GDPR consent does not fall within the scope of the complaint and 
is thus irrelevant. The Complainant considers the agreement to the Privacy Policy and the Terms of 
Service to be an alleged consent to data processing operations designated in those documents. This 
also includes  the aforementioned data processing operations and the respective purposes, thus the 
EDPB considers that those processing operations are within the scope of the complaint. 

210. In addition and taking into account the previous paragraph, the IE SA278 warns the CSAs on the legal 
risks derived from asking through the objections to expand the material scope of the inquiry and thus 
cover infringements outside of the complaint (namely the processing of special categories of personal 
data, question of location data, factual investigations into the presence of behavioural advertising, 
sharing with third parties) and the Draft Decision that the IE SA has not investigated (pursuant to its 
own  decision  to  limit  the  scope  of  the  inquiry)  and  put  to  WhatsApp  IE  as  an  allegation  of 
wrongdoing 279.

211. The EDPB notes that the complaint reiterates the confusion of WhatsApp IE’s users over whether it 
processes  personal  data for  the purposes  of  behavioural  advertising, which  of  the users’  special 
categories of personal data are processed and for which purposes, the provision  of metrics to third 
parties and the exchange of data with affiliated companies and on  which basis, as well as for the 
processing of personal data for the purposes of marketing. 

212. WhatsApp  IE’s Terms  of  Service  note  in  general terms  “WhatsApp  works  with  partners,  service 
providers, and affiliated companies to help us provide ways for you to connect with their services. We 
use  the  information  we  receive from  them  to  help  operate, provide,  and  improve  our  Services”; 
“WhatsApp uses the information it has and also works with partners, service providers, and affiliated 
companies to do this” and in the matter of sharing data with affiliated companies: “We are part of the 
Facebook Companies. As part of the Facebook Companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and 
shares information with, the Facebook Companies as described in WhatsApp's Privacy Policy”. 

213. The  Terms  of  Service  make  up  the  entire  agreement, and  include  a  reference to  two  separate 
documents: WhatsApp IE’s Privacy Policy and to the Meta Companies. WhatsApp IE’s Privacy Policy 
states that “The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our Services. We 
require certain of Your Account Information in accordance with our Terms to deliver our Services and 
without this we will  not be able to provide our Services to you.” With regard to sharing information 
with  third  parties,  the  Privacy  Policy  states  that  “You  share  your  information  as  you  use  and 
communicate  through  our  Services,  and  we  share  your  information  to  help  us  operate,  provide, 
improve, understand, customise and support our Services”. Further, the document itself does not make 
any references whatsoever for the processing of data for the purposes of behavioural advertising, or 
the processing of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 GDPR. As for the provision of metrics 
to third  parties and  the exchange of  data with affiliated companies,  as well as  the processing of 
personal data for the purposes  of marketing, the Privacy Policy  does not elaborate further on that 
matter. 

214. The CJEU asserted recently that the purpose of Article 9(1) GDPR is to ensure an enhanced protection 
of  data  subjects  for  processing,  which,  because  of  a  particular sensitivity  of  the  personal  data 
processed, is liable to constitute a particularly serious  interference with the fundamental rights to 
respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the 
Charter280. The CJEU adopts a wide interpretation of the terms “special categories of personal data” 
and “sensitive data” that includes data liable indirectly to reveal sensitive information concerning a 
natural person281. Advocate General Rantos reiterates the  importance for  the protection  of  data 
subjects of Article 9 GDPR and applies the same interpretation to the potential data processing in the 
WhatsApp services for behavioural advertising by stating that “the prohibition on processing sensitive 
personal data may include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network 
consisting in the collection of a user’s data when he or she visits other websites or apps or enters such 
data into them, the linking of such data to the user account on the social network and the use of such 
data, provided that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, make it possible 
to profile users on the basis of the categories that emerge from the listing in that provision of types of 
sensitive personal data.”

215. Therefore, the GDPR and the  case-law pay  especial  attention to the  processing  or  the potential 
processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR to ensure the protection of the 
data subjects. In this connection, the Complainant alleges in its complaint, among others, a violation 
of Article 9 GDPR and expressly requests the IE SA to investigate WhatsApp IE’s processing operations 
covered  by  this  provision.  In  a  subsequent  submission  on  the  preliminary  Draft Decision,  the 
Complainant  criticises  the scope  that the  IE SA  decided  to give  to the  complaint and  its  lack  of 
investigation  of  WhatsApp  IE’s processing  activities  and alleges that the IE SA  failed  to give  due 
consideration to processing under Article 9 GDPR and other cases in which it relies on consent. 

216. In the present case, the IE SA did  not carry out any investigation, regarding (a) the legal basis for 
WhatsApp IE’s processing operations for the purposes of behavioural advertising, (b) the applicable 
legal basis  for processing  special categories of  personal  data, pursuant to Article 9 GDPR, (c) the 
applicable legal basis  for  provision  of  metrics to  third parties and  (d)  the exchange of  data with 
affiliated companies for the purposes of service improvements and (e) the processing of personal data 
for the marketing purposes. The IE SA categorically concludes that no further investigation is needed 
with regard to these issues. 

217. By failing to investigate, further to the complaint, the processing of special categories of personal data 
by WhatsApp IE, the IE SA leaves unaddressed the risks this processing poses for the Complainant and 
for WhatsApp IE’s users in general. First, there is the risk that the Complainant’s special categories of 
personal data are potentially processed by WhatsApp  IE to build  intimate profiles  of them for the 
purposes of behavioural advertising without a legal basis and in a manner not compliant with the GDPR 
and in particular the strict requirements of Articles 7 and Article 9(2) GDPR. Second, there is also the 
risk that WhatsApp IE does not consider certain categories of personal data it potentially processes, as 
special or sensitive categories of personal data in line with the GDPR and the CJEU case-law and treats 
them accordingly. Third, the Complainant and other WhatsApp IE’s users, whose sensitive data are 
potentially processed may be deprived of certain special safeguards derived from the use of consent, 
such as the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to 
the further processing of personal data under Article 6(4) GDPR; the freedom to withdraw consent, 
pursuant to Article 7 GDPR, and the subsequent right to be forgotten. Fourth, given the size and the 
number  of  users    of  WhatsApp  IE in  the  social  media  market, leaving  unaddressed  the  current 
ambiguity in the processing  of special categories of personal  data, and its limited transparency of 
WhatsApp IE vis-à-vis data subjects, may set a precedent for controllers to operate in the same manner 
and create legal uncertainty, hampering the free flow of personal data within the EU. 

218. The EDPB further considers, also in view of these risks to the Complainant and WhatsApp IE’s users, 
that the IE SA did not handle the complaint with all due diligence. The EDPB considers the lack of any 
further investigation into the legal basis for WhatsApp IE’s processing operations for the purposes of 
behavioural advertising, the potential processing  of special categories of personal  data, applicable 
legal basis for provision of metrics to third parties and the exchange of data with affiliated companies 
for the purposes of service improvements, as well as the processing of personal data for the purposes 
of marketing as an omission, and – in the present case – finds it relevant that the Complainant alleged 
infringements of Article 9 in the complaint.  

219. The EDPB contends that in the present case, the IE SA should have verified on the basis of the contract 
and the data processing actually carried out on which legal bases each data processing operation in 
question relies. 

220. The EDPB also highlights that by having excessively limited the scope of its inquiry despite the scope 
of the complaint in this cross-border case and systematically considering the majority of the objections 

Adopted 

 

50 

raised by the CSAs not relevant and reasoned and thus denying their formal admissibility, the IE SA as 
LSA in this case, constrains the capacity of CSAs to act and tackle the risks to data subjects in sincere 
and  effective  cooperation. As  ruled  by  the  CJEU, the  SA  must  exercise  its  competence within  a 
framework of close cooperation with other supervisory  authorities concerned and cannot “eschew 
essential dialogue with and sincere and effective cooperation with the other supervisory authorities 
concerned”. The limited scope that the IE SA gave to the inquiry also impairs the EDPB’s capacity to 
conclude on the matter pursuant to Article 65 GDPR and thus ensure a consistent application of EU 
data protection law, despite the fact that the complaint covered these aspects and was introduced 
more than four years ago.  

221. As a result of the limited scope of the inquiry and lack of assessment by the IE SA in the Draft Decision, 
the EDPB does not have sufficient factual evidence on WhatsApp IE’s processing operations to enable 
it to make a finding on any possible  infringement by WhatsApp IE of its obligations under Article 9 
GDPR and other relevant GDPR provisions. 

222. The  EDPB decides  that the  IE SA  shall  carry out  an  investigation  into  WhatsApp  IE’s  processing 
operations in its service in order to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 
9 GDPR), processes data for the purposes of behavioural advertising, for marketing purposes, as well 
as for the provision of metrics to third parties and the exchange of data with affiliated companies for 
the purposes  of service improvements, and in order to determine if it complies with the relevant 
obligations under the GDPR. Based on the results of that investigation and the findings, the IE SA shall 
issue a new Draft Decision in accordance with Article 60 (3) GDPR. 

7  ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES OTHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE FINES 

7.1  Analysis by the IE SA in the Draft Decision 

223. According to the Draft Decision, the IE SA concludes that the Complainant’s case is not made out that 
the GDPR does not permit the reliance by WhatsApp IE on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its 
offering of Terms of Service282. Therefore, without finding any infringement of this legal basis, the IE 
SA was not in a position to consider the application of its corrective powers as provided for in Article 
58(2) GDPR. 

224. Regarding the provision of necessary information relating to WhatsApp IE’s legal basis for processing 
pursuant  to  acceptance of  the  Terms  of  Service  and  whether  the  information  set  out  was  in  a 
transparent manner, the IE SA recalled that it found infringements in this regard in a previous own-
volition inquiry and exercised a number of corrective powers in response, including an administrative 
fine and an order to bring the WhatsApp IE’s Privacy Policy into compliance283. 

7.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

225. The NO SA objects to the IE SA’s finding by stating that WhatsApp IE cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR as a legal basis for processing in the context of service improvements and security features284. 
As a consequence resulting from the finding of such infringement, the NO SA requests the IE SA to 
exercise corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR accordingly, by ordering WhatsApp IE to delete

personal data that has been unlawfully processed under the erroneous assumption that it could be 
based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR unless those data were also collected for other purposes with a valid 
legal basis,  and by imposing  an administrative fine against WhatsApp  IE for unlawfully  processing 
personal data in the context of service improvements and security features, erroneously relying on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as that legal basis was not applicable in this case285. 

226. The DE SAs object to the IE SA’s finding by stating that the IE SA should find that WhatsApp IE has 
breached the Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR. As a consequence resulting from the finding of such 
infringements, the DE SAs  request the IE SA to impose  a temporary or definitive limitation of the 
respective processing without legal basis in accordance with Article 58(2)(f) GDPR, namely, the erasure 
of unlawfully processed personal data and the ban of the processing of data until a valid legal basis is 
in place286. 

227. The FI SA objects to the IE SA’s finding by stating that the IE SA should find an infringement of Article 
6(1) GDPR, notably because the FI SA is of the opinion that WhatsApp IE cannot rely on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR for all the processing operations set out in the Terms of  Service, such as marketing, service 
improvements  and  security  purposes287.  As  a  consequence  resulting  from  the  finding  of  such 
infringement, the FI SA requests the IE SA to make use of its corrective power accordingly, pursuant to 
Article 58(2) GDPR 288. In order to do so, the FI SA is of the opinion that the IE SA should at least order 
WhatsApp IE to bring its processing operations into compliance with the provisions of Article 6(1) GDPR 
with respect to the processing of marketing, service improvements and security for which WhatsApp 
IE relied upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and consider imposing an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 
GDPR 289. 

7.3  Position of the IE SA on the objections 

228. The IE SA is of the opinion  that since it does not follow the objections  raised on the infringements 
matters, it results that the IE SA does not follow the related objections on the corrective measures 
either290. The IE SA also does not consider the objections to be relevant and/or reasoned.  

7.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

7.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

229. The objections raised by the NO SA, DE SAs and FI SA concern “whether the action envisaged in  the 

Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”291. 

230. As stated and analysed above in Subsection 4.4.1, the EDPB finds the NO SA and DE SA objections on 

the subject of corrective measures pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR relevant but not reasoned292. 

231. Regarding the FI  SA’s objection, WhatsApp  IE considers  it not relevant because it is  based on  an 
objection pertaining to a mistaken allegation of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 293 and which does

not satisfy the thresholds and lacks of merit 294. The EDPB does not follow WhatsApp IE’s position as it 
analyses and concludes in Subsection 4.4.1 above that the objection of the FI SA on the finding of an 
infringement of Article 6 GDPR or more specifically Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, on which the FI SA request of 
corrective measures is based, is relevant and reasoned. 

232. The FI SA’s objection arguing that the IE SA should, in application of Article 58(2) GDPR, at least order 
WhatsApp IE to bring its processing operations into compliance with the provisions of Article 6(1) GDPR 
with respect to the processing of marketing, service improvements and security for which WhatsApp 
IE relied upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and consider imposing an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 
GDPR, is  linked  to the IE SA’s Finding  2 of  its Draft Decision  with regard to Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR. 
Therefore, the FI SA objection is directly connected with the substance of the Draft Decision and if 
followed,  would  lead to  a different conclusion,  namely  a change of  this Finding  2 as well  as the 
imposition of corrective measures. 

233. Thus, the EDPB considers that the FI SA objection is relevant. 
234. In terms of arguments clarifying why the amendment of the Draft Decision requested by the FI SA is 
proposed, the FI SA firstly argues that if the IE SA does not make use of its corrective powers, there is 
a danger that WhatsApp IE continues to unlawfully process personal data on the foot of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR for   processing operations  such  as marketing, service improvements  and security, and that 
WhatsApp IE continues to undermine or bypass data protection principles295. 

235. Secondly,  the FI SA  argues that because WhatsApp  IE cannot rely on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for  all 
processing  operations  set out in  its  Terms of  Service, this inevitably  leads  to the conclusion  that 
corrective powers must be exercised in order to bring the processing operations of WhatsApp IE in line 
with the GDPR 296. 

236. Thirdly, the  FI SA  relies on  the ruling  of  the CJEU  C-311/18  Schrems  II 297 to argue that when  an 
infringement is found, the supervisory authority must take appropriate action in order to remedy any 
findings of inadequacy and therefore the FI SA is of the opinion that the IE SA must exercise appropriate 
and necessary corrective powers298. 

237. Finally, according to the FI SA, the IE SA must exercise appropriate and necessary corrective powers 
and must take into account the nature and severity of the abovementioned infringement since the FI 
SA is of the opinion that this infringement cannot be consider as minor299. 

238. In terms of the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the FI SA argues that the absence 
of appropriate and necessary corrective powers would amount to a dangerous precedent, sending a 
deceiving message to the market and to data subjects, and would  also endanger the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of data subjects whose personal data are and will be processed by the WhatsApp 
IE300. 

239. In addition, the FI SA argues that if WhatsApp IE could continue to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the 
data subjects would not have the possibility to control the processing of their personal data, while the 
right to monitor the processing of personal data is an important principle of the GDPR. 301

240. The FI SA ends its argumentation by stating that the Draft Decision affects all the data subjects within 
the EEA. Therefore, the consequences of not making use of the corrective powers pursuant to Article 
58(2) GDPR are vast 302. 

241. WhatsApp IE considers that the FI SA objection cannot satisfy the significance of risk threshold, as it 
does not set out how the Draft Decision would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights 
and freedoms, because it is based on a misunderstanding of the Draft Decision and the defined scope 
of inquiry303. WhatsApp IE also considers that contrary to the FI SA statement, the GDPR provides data 
subjects with a range of controls and rights over their personal data regardless of the legal bases relied 
on and therefore the Draft Decision does  not pose  a risk to data subjects’ fundamental rights and 
freedom304. Moreover, WhatsApp IE considers that the FI SA statement that the Draft Decision affects 
all the data subjects within the EEA and that therefore, the consequences  of not making use of the 
corrective powers pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR are vast, is based on unsubstantiated concerns and 
unsupported by any facts or legal reasoning or anything which was investigated in the inquiry305. 

242. Considering  WhatsApp IE’s arguments, the EDPB understands that WhatsApp IE is challenging the 
substance of the FI SA objection instead of challenging its ability to clearly demonstrate the significance 
of  the  risks  posed  by  the  Draft Decision306.Therefore, the  EDPB considers  these  arguments  not 
applicable to assess whether the FI SA’s objection is reasoned. 

243. As the FI SA objection clearly demonstrates why an amendment of the Draft Decision is proposed and 
how this  amendment would  lead to  a different  conclusion  as to whether the envisaged action in 
relation to WhatsApp IE complies with the GDPR, it clearly demonstrates a sound and substantiated 
reasoning and the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. 

244. Therefore, the EDPB considers the FI SA objection to be reasoned. 
245. Considering  the FI  SA  objection  and  the arguments brought  forward  by  WhatsApp  IE, the EDPB 
considers that the FI SA objection requesting corrective measures to be imposed according to Article 
58(2) GDPR is relevant and reasoned pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR. 

7.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

Preliminary matters 

246. The EDPB considers that the FI SA objection found to be relevant and reasoned in Subsection 7.4.1 
requires an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed in respect of the corrective 
measures proposed. More specifically, the EDPB needs to assess whether the IE SA should impose an 
order on WhatsApp IE to bring its processing operations in compliance with the provisions of Article 
6(1) GDPR with respect to the processing for marketing, service improvements and security for which 
WhatsApp IE relied upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and consider imposing an administrative fine pursuant 
to Article 83 GDPR, in application of Article 58(2) GDPR. 

247. Any issue concerning the imposition of administrative fines is covered below in Section 8. 
248. Concerning the issue of imposing corrective measures in respect of the alleged infringement of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR for processing personal data for marketing purpose raised by the FI SA and which was 
not part of the scope of the inquiry307, it is appropriate to refer to the EDPB conclusion as stated above

in Subsection 6.1.4.2, which notably states that the IE SA is instructed to launch an investigation into 
WhatsApp IE’s processing operations in its service in order to determine if it processes personal data 
for marketing purposes  and in order to determine if it complies with the relevant obligations under 
the GDPR. In this situation where the possibility for WhatsApp IE to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for 
processing  personal data for marketing purpose  has not been investigated, there is  no ground to 
further proceed in  the assessment of the merits  of  the  FI  SA’s  objection  requesting  to  impose 
corrective measures for  processing personal  data for marketing purpose  by  unlawfully  relying on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. 

249. Conversely,  concerning  the  issue  of  imposing  corrective  measures  in  respect  of  the  alleged 
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR for processing for other purposes stated in the FI SA’s objection, it 
is appropriate to refer to the EDPB conclusion as stated above in Subsection 4.4.2, which notably states 
that WhatsApp IE has infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing the Complainant’s personal 
data, in  particular by  inappropriately relying on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the Complainant’s 
personal data for the purposes of service improvement and security308 features processing operations 
in the context of its Terms of Service. As a consequence, the EDPB further proceed in the assessment 
of the merits of these parts of the FI SA objection309 and analyses whether an order to bring processing 
into compliance should be imposed. 

250. When assessing the merits of the objection raised, the EDPB also takes into account WhatsApp IE’s 

position on the objection and its submissions  and the findings in this Binding Decision. 

251. It is also important to clarify the EDPB’s views in respect of its competence, in contrast to WhatsApp 
IE’s argument, which  considers  the EDPB is  not  competent to direct  the IE SA  to  adopt  specific 
corrective measures310. 

252. WhatsApp IE states “This is clear from the objection of the Finnish SA, which acknowledges that it is for 
the IE SA  alone  to decide which  corrective measures are appropriate and  necessary, citing  Case  C-
311/18 (Schrems II), para 112”311. 

253. The EDPB finds  that WhatsApp IE misunderstands  the FI SA objection when  it argues that it does 
acknowledge that it is for the IE SA alone to decide which corrective measures are appropriate and 
necessary, by citing paragraph 112 of the Judgement of the CJEU of 16 July 2020, Data Protection 
Commissioner  v Facebook  Ireland Limited and  Maximillian  Schrems, C-311/18, ECLI:EU:C:2020:559 , 
(hereinafter ‘C-311/18 Schrems II'). In fact, the FI SA does no such thing: in its objection “The FI SA 
refers to the ruling of the CJEU C-311/18 where it was stated that if a supervisory authority takes the 
view that an infringement was found, the respective supervisory authority must take appropriate action 
in order to remedy any findings  of inadequacy”312 in order to support its conclusion, which states that 
because “WhatsApp cannot rely on Article 6(1) (b) for all processing operations set out in its Terms of 
Service. This inevitably leads into the conclusion that corrective powers must be exercised in order to 
bring the processing operations of WhatsApp in line with the GDPR”313. Thus, this statement by the FI 
SA seems to simply strengthen the need for appropriate corrective measures to be imposed. 

254. Moreover, WhatsApp IE considers the IE SA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective 

measures in the event of a finding of infringement 314.

255. WhatsApp  IE considers  that where a Draft Decision  does  not  find  an infringement and  therefore 
proposes no corrective measures, there cannot be a dispute on corrective measures within the scope 
of Article 65 GDPR. WhatsApp IE argues that “should the EDPB find an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR, the appropriate course is  for  it to  refer the  matter back  to the DPC, as  IE SA, to  determine 
whether to impose  any appropriate corrective measures and,  if so,  what those corrective measures 
should  be. Were the EDPB to do otherwise and direct the DPC to make a  specific order in the terms 
proposed by certain Objections, it would exceed its competence under Article 65 GDPR”315. 

256. WhatsApp IE’s states that it is “a matter for the LSA to determine which (if any) corrective measures to 
order and to ensure that any order complies with all applicable procedural safeguards, including those 
provided for under national  law, and  is  issued in  accordance with due process and in  circumstances 
where the controller has been afforded a right to be heard”316. 

257. WhatsApp IE also argues that “In the context of  an  inquiry  relating to cross-border processing,  the 
power to determine which measures are appropriate to exercise under the GDPR is a matter within the 
sole competence of the DPC as IE SA — not the EDPB”317. While WhatsApp IE acknowledges that “Article 
65(1) GDPR allows the EDPB to consider reasoned objections concerning whether corrective measures 
envisaged  by  the IE SA  comply  with  the GDPR”, it argues “it does  not  empower the EDPB to  issue 
prescriptive instructions  as  to  which (if  any)  of  the corrective powers  under Article 58  ought  to be 
exercised”318. WhatsApp IE adds that “As noted in the EDPB Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR (‘Article 65 Guidelines’), at most, the EDPB can ‘instruct the IE SA to re-assess the 
envisaged  action  and  change  the  draft  decision  in  accordance  with  the  binding  decision  of  the 
EDPB’”319. 

258. According to the EDPB, the views of WhatsApp IE amount to a misunderstanding of the GDPR one-
stop-shop mechanism and of the shared competences of the CSAs. While the EDPB agrees that the IE 
SA does act as ‘sole interlocutor’ of the controller or processor320, this should  not be understood as 
meaning it has ‘sole competence’ in a situation where the GDPR requires supervisory authorities to 
cooperate pursuant to Article 60 GDPR to achieve a consistent interpretation of the Regulation321. The 
fact that the IE SA will be the authority that can ultimately exercise the corrective powers listed in 
Article 58(2) GDPR cannot neither limit the role of the CSAs within the cooperation procedure nor the 
one of the EDPB in the consistency procedure322. 

259. Therefore, contrary to WhatsApp IE’s views, the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote 
a consistent application by the supervisory authorities of the corrective measures, taking into account 
the range of powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR, when a relevant and reasoned objection questions 
the action(s) envisaged by the Draft Decision towards the controller or processor, or the absence 
thereof. More specifically, when raising an objection on the existing or missing corrective measure in 
the Draft Decision, the CSA should indicate which action it believes would be appropriate for the IE SA 
to undertake and include in the final decision. 

260. As mentioned above, aside from the question of administrative fines tackled below in Section 8, the FI 
SA calls on the IE SA to use its corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR, by imposing an order on

WhatsApp IE to bring its processing operations into compliance with the provisions of Article 6(1) GDPR 
with respect to the processing of service improvements and security for which  WhatsApp IE relied 
upon Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. 

WhatsApp IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

261. WhatsApp IE considers that “Any corrective measures should be exercised in a manner consistent with 
the principles of proportionality” and “should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective 
of ensuring compliance with the GDPR”, in particular in accordance with Recital 129 GDPR 323. 

262. In addition, WhatsApp IE argues that “the EDPB cannot direct, nor can the DPC impose, a corrective 
order that would be prescriptive in specifying a legal basis on which WhatsApp Ireland must rely”324. 
263. Moreover, WhatsApp IE states that “WhatsApp Ireland can only be ordered to bring its processing into 
compliance by ensuring it has a valid legal basis for processing and must be afforded discretion as to 
how it achieves such compliance”325. 

264. Finally, WhatsApp IE argues that “There is no basis for the imposition of administrative fines”326 and “it 
would  be inappropriate, disproportionate, and unnecessary  to impose an  administrative fine”327, as 
further developed by WhatsApp IE in Section 8. 

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

265. In  assessing  the  appropriate  corrective measures  to  be  applied,  Article  58(2)(d)  GDPR  lists  the 

following corrective measure: 
“order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions 
of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period”. 

266. According to recital 129 GDPR, every corrective measure applied by a supervisory authority under 
Article 58(2) GDPR should be “appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance 
with the Regulation” in light of the circumstances of each individual case. This highlights the need for 
the corrective measures and any exercise of powers by supervisory authorities to be tailored to the 
specific case. Recital 129 GDPR also provides that each measure should  “respect the right of  every 
person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken”. 
The measures chosen should provide consideration to ensuring that they do not create “superfluous 
costs” and “excessive inconveniences” for the persons concerned in light of the objective pursued. 

267. Recital 148 GDPR shows the duty for supervisory  authorities to impose corrective measures that are 

proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement. 

268. The EDPB recalls that although the supervisory authority must determine which action is appropriate 
and necessary and take into consideration all the circumstances of the processing of personal data in 
question  in  that determination, the  supervisory  authority is  nevertheless  required to  execute its 
responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence328.

269. The EDPB agrees with the FI SA that “the infringement cannot be  consider as  minor”329. The EDPB 
reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law 
and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a clear and serious 
violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection. In addition, the infringement in 
the present case concerns a high number of data subjects330 and a large amount of personal data. 

270. Indeed, the EDPB agrees with the FI SA that “If the IE SA does not make use of their respective corrective 
powers, there is danger that WhatsApp  continues to unlawfully process personal data on the foot of 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR” for service improvement and security processing operations331 and  “there is a 
danger that WhatsApp  continues to undermine or bypass” data protection principles332. In addition, 
failure to adopt any corrective measure in this case “would amount to a dangerous precedent, sending 
a deceiving message to the market and to data subjects, and would endanger the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of data subjects whose personal data are and will be processed by the controller”. 333 

271. As a consequence, the EDPB finds it appropriate for an order to bring processing into compliance to 
be imposed in this case (without prejudice to the additional conclusions  in respect of the imposition 
of administrative fines available below in Section 8). 

272. According  to  the  EDPB, the  deadline  for  compliance  with  the  order  should  be  reasonable  and 
proportionate, in light of the potential for harms to the data subject rights and the resources available 
to the controller to achieve compliance334. 

273. Finally, the EDPB recalls that non-compliance with an order issued by a supervisory authority can be 
relevant both in terms of it being subject to administrative fines up to 20.000.000 euros or, in the case 
of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year in 
line  with Article 83(6)  GDPR, and in  terms of it being  an aggravating factor for  the imposition  of 
administrative fines. 335 In addition, the investigative powers of supervisory authorities allow them to 
order the provision  of all the information necessary for the performance of their tasks including the 
verification of compliance with one of their orders336. 

274. In light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for WhatsApp 
IE to bring its processing of personal data for the purposes of service improvement and security

dispute pursuant to  Article 65 GDPR concerning, among others, the  appropriateness of  the  deadline for 
compliance suggested in the draft decision at stake. After highlighting the relevance of Recitals 129 as well as 
148 GDPR for the imposition of corrective measures, the EDPB took into account the number of data subjects 
affected and the importance of the interest of affected data subjects in seeing the relevant provisions of the 
GDPR complied with in a short timeframe. While the EDPB also took note of the challenges highlighted by the 
controller, it found in that case that a compliance order with a three months’ timeframe could not be considered 
disproportionate considering the infringement as well as the  type  of organization, its size and the  means 
(including inter alia financial resources but also legal expertise) available to it. Consequently, the EDPB instructed 
the LSA to amend the draft decision by reducing the deadline for compliance from six months to three months.

8  ON THE IMPOSITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE FINE 

8.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

275. The IE SA as LSA does not find any infringement in the Draft Decision, thus no corrective measures and, 
in particular, no administrative fine are foreseen. The IE SA points out that in the own-volition inquiry 
in relation to WhatsApp IE’s Privacy Policy (deemed as “WhatsApp Transparency Decision” by the IE 
SA) corrective measures and among them an administrative fine are included339. Moreover, as further 
clarified by the IE SA, no further examination or the issuance of further determination is needed, as 
the issues raised in the latter are consistent with the present case. 

8.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

276. The FR SA, NO SA, DE SA and IT SA object to the IE SA’s failure to take action with respect to one or 
more specific  infringements they  deem should  have been found  and ask  the IE SA  to  impose an 
administrative fine as a result of these infringements.   

277. The FR SA objects to the absence of an administrative fine by the IESA in its Draft Decision. Since a 
breach of Article 6 GDPR has been committed in the opinion of the FR SA, which in light of the serious 
character of  this  infringement should  result  in the imposition  of an administrative fine. If further 
breaches were to  be  identified  with regard to the  processing  related to  behavioural  advertising, 
provision of metrics to third parties and with the processing of special categories of personal data, they 
should be taken into account by the IE SA when defining the amount of the administrative fine340. The 
FR SA therefore asks the IE SA to impose an administrative fine.  

278. The NO SA and DE SA also  argue that the IE SA should  take concrete corrective measures against 
WhatsApp IE in relation to the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
including to impose an administrative fine341. 

279. The IT SA argues that there should be an administrative fine following the finding of an infringement 
of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 342, and of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR 343. The IT SA argues that WhatsApp IE has 
failed to comply with the general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, which, in the view of 
the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically to transparency. Moreover, 
the IT SA states that there is an additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on 
account  of  WhatsApp  IE’s failure  to  comply  with  the  purpose  limitation  and  data minimisation 
principles. The IT SA asks for a fine to be issued for those additional infringements.

59 

280. In addition, the EDPB considers the FI SA’s request to consider the imposition of an administrative fine, 
as summarised above in Subsection 7.2, not as a separate objection but rather as a possible outcome 
of the IE SA’s use of its corrective powers pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR 344. 

8.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

281. The IE SA notes in its Composite Response that it is satisfied that the scope of the inquiry is appropriate 
and no question of an infringement of these provisions  arises from the complaint, therefore the IE SA 
would not exercise its corrective powers and would not follow the respective objections345.  

8.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

8.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 
The objections raised by the FR SA, NO SA, DE SA and IT SA concern “whether the action envisaged in 
the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR” 346. 

282. In addition to the primary argument levelled against all CSA’s objections347 as well as the arguments 
against the objections  regarding Article 6(1) GDPR of these CSAs, WhatsApp IE provides additional 
arguments on  why  it  considers  these  not  to be  relevant and/or  reasoned. In  a general manner, 
WhatsApp IE argues that in any event, there is no basis for a finding that they infringed Article 6(1), 9 
and/or 5 GDPR because the actual processing has not been investigated or assessed in the course of 
the inquiry by the IE SA348. Moreover, WhatsApp IE opines that the imposition of an administrative fine 
with respect to new findings  of infringements would violate its right to be heard and rights of the 
defence349. Furthermore, WhatsApp IE points out that the power to impose  an administrative fine 
under the GDPR lies within the sole competence of  the IE SA and that the EDPB does not have the 
power to consider objections  solely challenging the amount of a fine or the possible  instruction to 
impose a fine350. 

283. WhatsApp IE is of the view that the FR SA’s objection cannot be considered relevant because they are 
dependent on another objection, which WhatsApp IE deems “an incorrect allegation of infringement 
of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”351. WhatsApp IE also does not consider the FR SAs objection to be reasoned 
enough with regards to the power to impose administrative fines lying with the LSA and considers that 
the FR SAs objection “fails to specify any direct, substantial, or plausible risks that could be prevented 
by applying Article 83(3) GDPR”352. Regarding the DE SA and NO SA objections to the imposition of an 
administrative fine, WhatsApp IE does not provide arguments against the “relevant and reasoned” 
threshold apart from the general positions already reflected. 

                                                             
344 FI SA Objection, paragraph 43 to 46. 
345 Composite Response, paragraph 78. 
346 Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 32. 
347 WhatsApp IE’s argues that these are “matters […] outside the Defined Scope of Inquiry and, as such, these 
Objections are not relevant and do not meet the requirements of Article 4(24). Accordingly, the EDPB is not 
competent to enter into the substantive consideration of the subject matters of these Objections or to purport 
to direct the DPC to find additional infringements of the GDPR” (WhatsApp’s Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 
7.3). The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See Section 4.4.1. 
348 WhatsApp IE’s Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.5. 
349 WhatsApp IE’s Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.4.

352 WhatsApp IE's Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 82-83.

284. It is in the EDPB’s understanding that the FR SA disagrees with a specific part of the IE SA’s Draft 
Decision, namely the lack of an administrative fine regarding the breach of Article 6 GDPR. The FR SA 
adds that if additional breaches were to be found  after any further investigations by the IE SA, they 
should  be taken into account when assessing the fine and its amount 353. In consequence, the EDPB 
considers the objection to be relevant.  

285. The FR SA further argues that the lack of an administrative fine is in contradiction with the seriousness 
of the issues at hand, the nature of the processing and the size of the controller354. In the view of the 
FR SA, not imposing a fine would clearly be detrimental to the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the 
data subjects and would also lead to reduce the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their 
ability  to  ensure  effective  compliance  with  the  protection  of  the  personal  data  of  European 
residents355. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned and to clearly demonstrate 
the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. 

*** 

286. The EDPB recalls that the NO and DE SA argue that WhatsApp IE may not rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
for the specified data processing and the IE SA should exercise its corrective powers and impose an 
administrative fine356. If followed, these objections  would  lead to a different  conclusion  as to the 
possible imposition of an administrative fine. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections to be 
relevant and to be reflections upon how the IE SA  in their view should 'give full effect to the binding 
direction(s) as set out in the EDPB’s decision357. The EDPB finds that the objection is concrete in the 
change proposed. However, it takes note that the NO and DE SA’s assessment of the risks of the draft 
decision relate to the IE SAs interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and not sufficiently to the lack of an 
imposition of an administrative fine. Therefore, the EDPB does not consider this aspect of the NO and 
DE SAs objections to meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and are therefore not sufficiently 
reasoned 358. 

287. Taking into account the aforementioned, the EDPB considers that the objection of the FR SA requesting 

the imposition of an administrative fine is relevant and reasoned pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR. 

288. With respect to the objection raised by the IT SA concerning the imposition of an administrative fine 
for the alleged infringement of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a), the EDPB finds that it 
stands  in connection  with the substance  of the Draft Decision, as it concerns the imposition  of a 
corrective measure  for  an  additional  infringement,  which  would  be  found  as  a  consequence  of 
incorporating the finding  put forward by  the objection. Clearly, the decision  on  the merits of the 
demand to take corrective measures for a proposed additional infringement is affected by the EDPB’s 
decision on whether to instruct the IE SA to include an additional infringement. 

289. If followed, the IT SA’s objection sets out how  it would  lead to a different conclusion  in terms of 
corrective measures imposed359. Therefore, the EDPB finds  the objections  raised by the IT SA to be 
relevant.

290. WhatsApp IE argues the IT SA’s objection  is insufficiently  detailed, adding that it is not possible  to 
identify the legal arguments the IT SA wishes to put forward in respect of the fine360.The EDPB finds 
that the IT SA adequately argues why they propose amending the Draft Decision and how this leads to 
a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed361. 

291. WhatsApp IE argues the objection of the IT SA fails to demonstrate the risk posed by the Draft Decision 
as required  and, in  doing so, WhatsApp IE dismisses  the concerns articulated by the IT SA on the 
precedent the draft decision sets362.  

292. The EDPB finds that the IT SA articulates an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection 
in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals363. 

293. Therefore, the EDPB considers the IT SA’s objection concerning the imposition of a fine for the alleged 
additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be reasoned. 

*** 

294. The EDPB recalls its analysis of whether the objection raised by the IT SA in respect of the proposed 
alleged additional infringements of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and 5(1)(c) GDPR meets the threshold set by 
Article 4(24)  GDPR (see Section 5.4.1 above). In light of the conclusion  that such objection  is  not 
relevant and reasoned, the EDPB does not need to further examine this linked objection. 

295. Furthermore, with regard to the FI SA’s objection the EDPB recalls the analysis made in Subsection 

7.4.1 and in 8.2 of this Binding Decision. 

8.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

296. In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision  concerning all the 
matters which  are the subject  of  the relevant and reasoned  objections,  in particular whether the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. 

297. Regarding the processing of purposes or of data categories raised by the FR SA and which were not 
part of the scope of the inquiry, it is appropriate to refer to the EDPB conclusion  as stated above in 
subsection 6.1.4.2, where the IE SA is instructed to launch further investigations. 

298. Regarding the FI SA’s objection as mentioned in Subsection 8.2 and analysed in Section 7, the EDPB 
again recalls that it only takes note of it, as it is not deemed a separate objection but rather a possible 
outcome of the IE SA’s use of its corrective powers pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR. 

299. When assessing the merits of all the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account WhatsApp IE’s 

position on the objection and its submissions.  

300. WhatsApp IE considers that the LSA has sole discretion to impose an administrative fine. WhatsApp IE 
argues that in the context of a matter relating to cross-border processing, the power to impose an 
                                                             
360 WhatsApp IE's Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 108-109. 
361 The IT SA argues that the finding of such infringement “should result into the imposition of the relevant 
administrative fine as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR”, adding the requirement that each fine should be 
proportionate and dissuasive and arguing the gravity of the infringement, see IT SA Objection, p. 10.

administrative fine under the GDPR lies within the sole competence of the LSA and not the CSAs or the 
EDPB. Furthermore, WhatsApp IE argues that the GDPR does not confer any power on the EDPB to 
consider objections solely challenging the amount of a fine, and the EDPB may not give instructions as 
to whether a fine ought to be imposed, or as to its amount 364. 

301. According to the EDPB, the views of WhatsApp IE amount to a misunderstanding of the GDPR one-
stop-shop mechanism and of the shared competences of the CSAs. The EDPB responds to WhatsApp 
IE’s argument that the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the 
event of a finding of infringement above (see Section 7, paragraph 258-259). 

302. While the EDPB agrees that the LSA does act as “sole interlocutor” of the controller or processor365, 
this should not be understood as meaning it has “sole competence” in a situation where the GDPR 
requires SAs to cooperate pursuant to Article 60 GDPR to achieve a consistent interpretation of the 
Regulation366. The fact that the LSA will be the authority that can ultimately exercise the corrective 
powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR cannot limit the role of the CSAs within the cooperation procedure 
or the one of the EDPB in the consistency procedure367.  

303. Therefore, contrary to WhatsApp IE’s views, the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote 
a consistent application by the supervisory authorities of the corrective measures, taking into account 
the range of powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR, when a relevant and reasoned objection questions 
the  action(s)  envisaged  by  the  Draft  Decision  vis-a-vis  the  controller/processor,  or  the  absence 
thereof368. More specifically, when raising an objection on the existing or missing corrective measure 
– such as an administrative fine – in the Draft Decision, the CSA should indicate which action it believes 
would be appropriate for the LSA to undertake and include in the final decision369.  
8.4.2.1.1  Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of 

Article 6(1) GDPR  

304. The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed in respect to the lack of corrective 
measures  proposed.  More  specifically,  the  EDPB  needs  to  assess  the  request  to  impose  an 
administrative fine for the infringements that are ought to be found by  the LSA according to this 
Binding Decision. The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement of Article 
6(1) GDPR 370. 

305. The EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one371. However, the EDPB recalls that

when  a  violation  of  the Regulation has  been  established,  competent  supervisory  authorities  are 
required to react appropriately to remedy this infringement in accordance with the means provided 
to them by Article 58(2)  GDPR 372, which includes the possible  imposition  of an administrative fine 
pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR 373.  

306. Indeed, as already mentioned the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent 
application of administrative fines374: where a relevant and reasoned objection identifies shortcomings 
in the reasoning leading to the imposition of the fine at stake (or naturally the lack of one),  the EDPB 
can instruct the LSA to engage in  a new assessment of the need for a fine or the calculation of a 
proposed fine375. 

307. The EDPB again wants to recall that although the supervisory authority must determine which action 
is appropriate and necessary and take into consideration all the circumstances of the processing of 
personal data in question in that determination, the supervisory authority is nevertheless required to 
execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced with all due diligence376. Recital 
148 shows the duty for supervisory authorities to impose corrective measures that are proportionate 
to the seriousness of the infringement 377. 

308. With respect to the imposition of an administrative fine, the EDPB recalls the requirements of Article 

83(1) GDPR, as well as that due account must be given to the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR. 

309. As already established the EDPB considers the lawfulness of processing to be one of the fundamental 
pillars of the data protection law and that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal 
basis is a clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection378. The 
EDPB therefore agrees with the FR SA in considering the identified breach as serious379. 
Furthermore, the EDPB takes the view that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of 
personal data of a significant number of people in a cross-border scope and that the impact on them 
has to be considered380. 

310. The  EDPB  underlines  that  the  specific  circumstances  of  the  case  have  to  be  reflected.  Such 
circumstances not  only  refer to  the specific  elements  of  the infringement, but also  those  of  the 
controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely its size and financial position381. 

                                                             
important tool that supervisory authorities should use in appropriate circumstances. The supervisory 
authorities are encouraged to use a considered and balanced approach in their use of corrective measures, in 
order to achieve both an effective and dissuasive as well as a proportionate reaction to the breach. The point is 
to not qualify the fines as last resort, nor to shy away from issuing fines, but on the other hand not to use them 
in such a way which would devalue their effectiveness as a tool.”).

measures in general and for the choice of the  combination of corrective measures that is appropriate and 
proportionate to the infringement committed”. EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 256.

311. Though the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that 
data  subjects  have  been  faced  with  data  processing  that  should  not  have  occurred  (by  relying 
inappropriately  on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a legal basis  as established  in  section 4.4.2). The data 
processing  in  question  entails  decisions  about  information  that data subjects  are  exposed  to  or 
excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is explicitly regarded as relevant 
in recital 75 GDPR and that such damage may result from situations “where data subjects might be 
deprived of  their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data”. 
Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, a risk of damage caused to data 
subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement itself. 

312. In the  light of  the  nature and gravity of  the infringement pursuant  to Article  83(2)(a)  GDPR as 
identified in the paragraphs above, in the view of the EDPB the combination of the mentioned factors 
already clearly tip the balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine.  

313. For conduct infringing data protection rules, the GDPR does not provide for a minimum fine. Rather, 
the GDPR only provides for maximum amounts in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR, in which several different 
types of conduct are grouped together. A fine can ultimately only be calculated by weighing up all the 
elements expressly identified in Article 83(2)(a)–(j) GDPR, relevant to the case and any other relevant 
elements, even if not explicitly listed in the said provisions  (as Article 83(2)(k) GDPR requires to give 
due regard to any other applicable factor). Finally, the final amount of the fine resulting from this 
assessment  must  be effective, proportionate and  dissuasive  in  each individual  case (Article 83(1) 
GDPR). Any fine imposed must sufficiently take into account all of these parameters, whilst at the same 
time not exceeding the legal maximum provided for in Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR 382. 

314. In light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to impose an administrative fine, remaining in line 
with the criteria provided  for by  Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive  in line with Article 83(1) GDPR, in accordance with the conclusions  reached by the EDPB, 
namely the identified infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. 
8.4.2.1.2  Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of 

the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR  

315. The EDPB recalls its conclusion  in this Binding Decision on the infringement by WhatsApp IE of the 
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 383 and that the objection raised by the IT SA, which is 
found  to  be  relevant  and  reasoned,  requested  the  IE  SA  to  exercise  its  power  to  impose  an 
administrative fine384. 

316. The EDPB takes note of WhatsApp IE’s view that the IT SA objection is not relevant and reasoned385 
and also notes that WhatsApp IE takes that view that inappropriate, clearly disproportionate, and 
unnecessary to impose an administrative fine386.

317. The EDPB again recalls that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-
by-case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one387 and the specificities of the 
case have to be taken into account. 

318. As previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically 
linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent 
meaning 388. 

319. Considering  the  EDPB’s  findings  in  Section  5.4.2  that  WhatsApp  IE  has  not  complied  with  key 
requirements of the principle of fairness, the EDPB reiterates its view that WhatsApp IE has infringed 
the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement 
should  be  adequately taken  into  account  by  the  IE SA  in  the  calculation of  the  amount  of  the 
administrative fine to be imposed following the conclusion of this inquiry. 

320. Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by WhatsApp IE of the 
fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when determining the fine for 
the violation of Article 6(1) GDPR as instructed above. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional 
fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests 
the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria 
provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with 
Article 83(1) GDPR.  

9  BINDING DECISION 

321. In light of the above and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue 
binding  decisions  pursuant  to Article 65  GDPR, the  EDPB  issues  the  following  binding  decision  in 
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. 

322. The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, in 

accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR.  

323. On  the  objections  concerning  whether  the  LSA  should  have  found  an  infringement  for  lack  of 

appropriate legal basis 

1.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE SA, FI SA, FR SA, NL SA and NO SA regarding 

WhatsApp reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

2.  The EDPB decides  that WhatsApp  IE has  inappropriately relied on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR to 
process the Complainant’s personal data for the purpose of service improvement and security in the 
context of its Terms of Service and therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data. WhatsApp IE has 
consequently infringed Article 6(1) GDPR by unlawfully processing personal data. 

3.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that 
WhatsApp IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) in the context of its offering of Terms of Service, and to include 
an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, on the basis of the conclusion reached by the EDPB in this Binding 
Decision.

4.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the infringement by WhatsApp IE 
of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 
5.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find  in its final  decision  an additional infringement of the 

principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by WhatsApp IE. 

325. On  the  objection  concerning  the  potential  additional  infringement  of  the  principles  of  purpose 

limitation and data minimisation 

6.  On the objection by the IT SA concerning the possible additional infringements of the principles 
of purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the EDPB decides this 
objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

326. On the objections concerning the potential need for further investigation: 

7.  The EDPB decides  that the objections  of the IT  SA, FR SA and FI SA  regarding the lack of 
investigation of WhatsApp’s processing operations in its service of special categories of personal data 
(Article  9  GDPR), of  data  processed  for  the  purposes  of  behavioural  advertising, for  marketing 
purposes, as well as for the provision of metrics to third parties and the exchange of data with affiliated 
companies for the purposes of service improvements, meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 
8.  The EDPB decides that the IE SA shall carry out an investigation into WhatsApp’s processing 
operations in its service in order to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 
9 GDPR), processes data for the purposes of behavioural advertising, for marketing purposes, as well 
as for the provision of metrics to third parties and the exchange of data with affiliated companies for 
the purposes  of service improvements, and in order to determine if it complies with the relevant 
obligations under the GDPR. Based on the results of that investigation and the findings the IE SA shall 
issue a new Draft Decision in accordance with Article 60 (3) GDPR. 

327. On corrective measures other than administrative fines 

9.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the FI SA requesting corrective measures to be imposed 

in compliance with the Article 58(2) GDPR meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

10.On the objections  by the DE and NO SAs  requesting corrective measures to be imposed in 
compliance with the Article 58(2) GDPR, the EDPB decides  that these objections  do not meet the 
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

11.The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for WhatsApp IE to bring 
its processing of personal data for the purposes of service improvement and security features in the 
context  of  its  Terms  of  Service  into  compliance  with  Article  6(1)  GDPR in  accordance with  the 
conclusion reached by the EDPB 389 within a specified period of time390. 

328. On the objections concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis 

12.The  EDPB  decides  that  the  objections  of  the  FR  SA  regarding  the  imposition  of  an 
administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) 
GDPR.

13.The EDPB decides that the relevant parts of the objections of the NO and DE SAs specifically 
relating to an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) 
GDPR. 

14.The EDPB instructs the IE SA to cover the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR with an 
administrative fine, which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive  in accordance with Article 83(1) 
GDPR. In determining the fine amount, the IE SA must give due regard to all the applicable factors 
listed in Article 83(2) GDPR, in particular the nature and gravity of the infringement and the number of 
data subjects affected. 

329. On the objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of the fairness 

principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 

15.The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative 

fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

16.The EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by WhatsApp IE of the 
fairness principle  enshrined  in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR when determining the fine for the violation of 
Article 6(1) GDPR as instructed above. If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach 
of the principle of fairness is an appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include 
this in its final decision. In any case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 
83(2) GDPR and ensuring it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR. 

330. On  the objection concerning the imposition  of an  administrative fine  for the infringement of  Article 

5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR 

17.The EDPB decides that it does not need to examine the objection of the IT SA regarding the 

imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR. 

10 FINAL REMARKS
