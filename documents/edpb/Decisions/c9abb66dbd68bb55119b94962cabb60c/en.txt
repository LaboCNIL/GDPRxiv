The European Data Protection Board

Having  regard  to Article  63  and  Article  65(1)(a)  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the  European
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(hereinafter “GDPR”) 1,

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018 2,

Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure,

Whereas:
(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “EDPB” or the “Board”) is to
ensure  the  consistent  application of the  GDPR  throughout  the EEA.  To this  effect,  it  follows  from
Article 60 GDPR  that  the  lead  supervisory  authority  shall  cooperate  with  the  other  supervisory
authorities concerned in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs shall exchange all
relevant information with each other, and that the LSA shall, without delay, communicate the relevant
information on the matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. The LSA shall without delay
submit a draft decision to the other CSAs for their opinion and take due account of their views.
(2) Where any of the CSAs expressed a reasoned and relevant objection (“RRO”) on the draft decision
in accordance with Article 4(24) and Article 60(4) GDPR and the LSA does not intend to follow the RRO
or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA shall submit this matter to the
consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR.

(3) Pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall issue a binding decision concerning all the matters
which are the subject of the RROs, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.

(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure,
within one month after the Chair and the competent supervisory authority have decided that the file
is complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of
the subject-matter upon decision of the Chair on its own initiative or at the request of at least one
third of the members of the EDPB.

(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of
the extension by a simple majority of its members.

4.

This  document  contains  a  binding  decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 
in  accordance  with
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. The decision concerns the dispute arisen following a draft decision (hereinafter
“Draft Decision”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission”, hereinafter
the  “IE  SA”),  also  referred  to  in  this  context  as  the lead  supervisory  authority  or  “LSA” and  the
subsequent  objections  expressed  by  a  number  of concerned  supervisory  authorities  or  “CSAs”,
namely: the Federal German supervisory authority (“Der Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und
die  Informationsfreiheit”),  hereinafter  the  ”DE  SA”; the  German  supervisory  authority  for  Baden-
Württemberg  (“Der  Landesbeauftragte  für  den  Datenschutz  und  die  Informationsfreiheit  Baden-
Württemberg”),  hereinafter  the  “DE  BW  SA”; the  French  supervisory  authority  (“Commission
Nationale  de  l'Informatique  et  des Libertés”),  hereinafter  the  “FR  SA”; the  Hungarian  supervisory
authority  (“Nemzeti  Adatvédelmi  és  Információszabadság  Hatóság”),  hereinafter  the “HU  SA”; the
Italian supervisory authority (“Garante per la protezione dei dati personali”), hereinafter the “IT SA”;
the Dutch supervisory authority (“Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”), hereinafter the “NL SA” ; the Polish
supervisory authority (“Urząd Ochrony Danych Osobowych”), hereinafter the “PL SA”; the Portuguese
supervisory authority (“Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados”), hereinafter the “PT SA”. The Draft
Decision  at  issue  relates  to  an  “own-volition  inquiry”  (hereinafter,  the  “Inquiry”)  which  was
commenced by the IE SA on 10 December 2018 concerning whether WhatsApp Ireland Limited, a
company  with  its single  establishment  located  in  Dublin,  Ireland  (hereinafter,  “WhatsApp IE”),
complied with its obligations pursuant to Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR.

The Inquiry of the IE SA was limited to WhatsApp IE’s consumer services and does not relate to the
“WhatsApp for Business” service 3. The decision of the IE SA to commence the Inquiry was prompted
by the common theme running across a number of complaints received from individual data subjects
(both users and non-users 4) concerning the data processing activities of WhatsApp IE and a mutual
assistance request pursuant to Article 61 GDPR from the DE SA, i.e. concerns about transparency 5. It
was however clarified by the IE SA that this inquiry was an own-volition inquiry and did not concern
any specific or individual complaint, concern or request, and that those were not taken into account
for the purposes of the Inquiry in circumstances where they are subject to separate complaint handling
processes 6.

The IE SA stated in its Draft Decision that it was satisfied that the IE SA is competent to act as the lead
supervisory authority, within the meaning of the GDPR, for the purpose of the cross-border processing
activities carried out by WhatsApp IE 7.

The following table presents a summary of the events part of the procedure leading to the submission
of the matter to the consistency mechanism.

4 Note: the term “non-user” has been used throughout the inquiry by the IE SA and throughout this decision to
denote an individual data subject who does not have an account with WhatsApp.

The specific procedure followed by the IE SA in this particular Inquiry involved an
assessment,  firstly,  by  an 
investigator  within  the IE  SA  (hereinafter,  the
“Investigator”).
The scope and legal basis of the Inquiry were set out in the notice of commencement
of inquiry that was sent to WhatsApp IE on 10 December 2018.
Following exchanges of information and views with WhatsApp IE, the Investigator
recorded the proposed findings in a draft inquiry report dated 30 May 2019.
WhatsApp IE responded to the content of the draft inquiry report via submissions
dated 1 July 2019.
The Investigator issued the final inquiry report (“Final Report”) on 9 September 2019
and  passed it on  together  with  the  inquiry  file  to  the IE  SA’s  Decision-Maker,
responsible to decide on the existence of infringement(s) of the GDPR as well as on
the possible use of corrective powers (hereinafter, the “Decision-Maker”).
The IE SA notified WhatsApp IE of the commencement of the decision-making stage
on 4 October 2019.
The IE SA shared a Preliminary Draft Decision recording its preliminary views on the
existence of one or more GDPR infringements with WhatsApp IE on 21 May 2020.
The IE SA shared a Supplemental Draft Decision on the possible use of corrective
powers with WhatsApp IE on 20 August 2020.
WhatsApp  IE provided submissions  in  relation to  the  Preliminary  Draft Decision
(“WhatsApp Preliminary Draft Submissions”) on 6 July 2020 and in relation to the
Supplemental Draft Decision (“WhatsApp Supplemental Draft Submissions”) on 1
October 2020.
Both sets of submissions were taken into account by the IE SA when finalising the
final versions of the Preliminary and Supplemental Draft Decisions and combining
them into the Final Draft Decision (hereinafter, the “Draft Decision”).
The Draft Decision was circulated to the CSAs on 24 December 2020.
A number of objections were raised by the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR
(specifically, by the DE SA, DE BW SA, FR SA, HU SA, IT SA, NL SA, PL SA and PT SA).
Several comments were also exchanged.
The IE SA assessed the objections and comments received and invited WhatsApp IE
to  provide  submissions  in  relation  to  a  specific  subset  of  objections  raised
concerning the effectiveness of a specific anonymisation process. These submissions
were provided by WhatsApp IE on 10 March 2021.
The IE SA issued its replies to the objections, including suggestions for compromise
positions, and shared it with the CSAs within a single document (hereinafter, “IE SA
Composite Response”) on 1 April 2021. WhatsApp IE’s submissions concerning the
anonymisation process were also shared with the CSAs on the same date. The IE SA
requested the relevant CSAs to share their views by 20 April 2021. Upon request of
the NL SA, the IE SA provided on 19 April 2021 a provisionally revised version of Part
1  of  the  Draft  Decision  with  the  CSAs,  to provide  more  clarity  as  to  how  the
suggestions for compromise positions could have been translated in practice.
Within its reply to the IE SA Composite Response, the IT SA withdrew one of its
objections.
According to the IE SA, the replies of the CSAs made it clear that no single proposed
compromise position was agreeable to all of the relevant CSAs. The IE SA decided to

not follow any of the objections and to refer them to the EDPB for determination
pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.
On 23 April 2021 WhatsApp IE was invited to exercise its right to be heard in respect
of all the material that the IE SA proposed to refer to the Board, and on 28 May 2021
it provided its submissions (the “WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions”).

The IE SA triggered the dispute resolution process using the Internal Market Information system (IMI) 8
on 3 June 2021. Following the submission by the LSA of this matter to the EDPB in accordance with
Article 60(4) GDPR, the EDPB Secretariat assessed the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair
of the EDPB in line with Article 11(2) of the EDPB Rules of Procedure. The EDPB Secretariat contacted
the IE SA asking for additional documents and information to be submitted in IMI and requesting the
IE SA to confirm the completeness of the file. The IE SA provided the documents and information and
confirmed the completeness of the file. A matter of particular importance that was scrutinized by the
EDPB  Secretariat  was  the  right  to  be  heard,  as  required  by  Article  41(2)(a)  of  the  Charter  of  the
Fundamental Rights. On 11 June 2021, the Secretariat contacted the IE SA with additional questions in
order to confirm, inter alia, whether WhatsApp IE had been given the opportunity to exercise its right
to be heard regarding all the documents that were submitted to the EDPB for making its decision. On
the same day, the IE SA confirmed that this was the case by also providing a confirmation as to all the
documents that were submitted to the right to be heard of the company and further evidence of the
correspondence between WhatsApp IE and the IE SA 9. Further details on this are available in Section 3
below.

On 14 June 2021, after the IE SA and the Chair of the EDPB confirmed the completeness of the file, the
EDPB Secretariat circulated the file to the EDPB members.

The Chair of the EDPB decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4)
of the EDPB Rules of Procedure, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further
month on account of the complexity of the subject-matter.

2 CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION

The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Articles 60(4)
and 65(1)(a) GDPR 10.

2.1 Objection(s) expressed by CSA(s) in relation to a draft decision
The EDPB notes that CSAs raised objections to the Draft Decision via the internal information and
communication system mentioned in Article 17 of the EDPB Rules of Procedure. The objections were
raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR.

10. More specifically, objections were raised by CSAs in relation to the following matters: the infringement
of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR; the conclusion reached in the Draft Decision as to the qualification of non-

8 The Internal Market Information (IMI) is the information and communication system mentioned in Article 17 of
the EDPB Rules of Procedure.
9 Amongst the documents sent by IE SA, there were letters from the controller acknowledging receipt of the
relevant documents and furnishing its submissions.
10 According to Article 65(1)(a) of the GDPR, the Board will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority
has raised a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the
objection or the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.

users’ data subject to a specific process as anonymised data, and the consequences of a different
qualification thereof; the absence of finding an infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR; the scope of the
inquiry and/or potential additional infringements of the GDPR; the compliance order set forth by the
IE SA; the calculation of the proposed fine, and specifically: preliminary matters, the interpretation of
Article 83(3) GDPR, and the consideration of the factors listed by Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR.

2.2 The LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objections to the draft

decision or is of the opinion that the objections are not relevant or reasoned

11. On  1  April  2021, the IE  SA  provided  to  the  CSAs  a  Composite  Response,  setting  out  the  IE  SA’s
assessment on the objections raised by the CSAs, including whether it considered them to be “relevant
and reasoned”, and suggesting some compromise positions.

15.

16.

17.

In the context of its reply to the IE SA Composite Response, the IT SA withdrew one of its objections
since it considered the explanations provided by the IE SA in the Composite Response to be persuasive.
This objection is therefore not considered to be part of the dispute at hand.

According to the IE SA, the responses received from the CSAs in relation to the remaining objections
showed  that  there  was  no  single  proposed  compromise  position  that  was  agreeable  to  all  of  the
relevant  CSAs.  In  accordance  with Article  60(4)  GDPR,  the IE  SA submitted  the  matter to  the
consistency  mechanism EDPB for dispute  resolution pursuant  to  Article  65(1)(a) GDPR.  The  IE  SA
clarified in its Letter to the EDPB Secretariat concerning the Article 65 GDPR referral of the dispute to
the EDPB 11 that it decided not to “follow” the objections raised by the CSAs.

2.3 Conclusion on the competence of the EDPB
The  case  at  issue  fulfils  the  elements  listed  by  Article  65(1)(a)  GDPR,  since  several  CSAs  raised
objections to a draft decision of the LSA pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR, and the LSA did not follow the
objections or rejected them as not relevant or reasoned.

The EDPB is therefore competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which
are  the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objection(s),  in  particular  whether  there  is  an
infringement of the GDPR 12.

3 THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION

The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights (right to good administration).
This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB Rules of Procedure 13. Further details were provided in the
EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR 14.

Article 65(2) GDPR provides that the EDPB’s decision “shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead
supervisory authority and all the supervisory authorities concerned and binding on them”. Article 65(2)
GDPR reflects the fact that the binding decision of the EDPB aims to resolve a dispute emerged among

not taken into account by the EDPB.

two or more national supervisory authorities 15. It is not aiming to address directly any third party.
However, as the decision adopted by the EDPB shall be binding on the LSA in this case and can be
decisive for the outcome of the procedure at national level, it may affect the interests of persons who
were part of the procedure that gave rise to the draft decision, such as the controller who is addressed
by the final decision of the LSA 16.

In order to address the possibility that WhatsApp IE might be adversely affected by the EDPB decision,
the EDPB assessed if it was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the
procedure led by the LSA and in particular whether WhatsApp IE was given the opportunity to make
its views effectively known in relation to the subject matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB,
as well as all documents received in this procedure to be taken into account by the EDPB to take its
decision 17.

Considering that WhatsApp IE has been heard by the IE SA in relation to the subject matter of the
dispute to be resolved by the EDPB, as well as all documents received in this procedure and used by
the EDPB to take its decision, including the objections raised in relation to the draft decision 18, and the
LSA has shared with the EDPB the written observations of WhatsApp IE, in line with Article 11(2) EDPB
Rules of Procedure 19, in relation to the issues raised in this specific Draft Decision, the EDPB is satisfied
that the Article 41 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights has been respected.

4 STRUCTURE OF THE BINDING DECISION

20.

For each of the objections raised, the EDPB assesses first whether they are to be considered as a
“relevant  and  reasoned  objection”  within  the  meaning  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR  as  clarified  in  the
Guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection 20.

21. Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this
specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections it deems
to be relevant and reasoned 21.

17 See also Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), paragraphs 105;106. In this regard, it was confirmed that WhatsApp IE
was afforded its right to be heard against the Preliminary Draft decision, the Supplemental Draft decision, the
objections and comments raised by the CSAs, IE SA’s Composite Response, the comments exchanged by the CSAs
in response to it, and a provisionally amended extract of Part I of the IE SA’s Draft Decision. The IE SA confirmed
it took account of WhatsApp IE’s submissions on the Preliminary Draft decision and on the Supplemental Draft
Decision in the process of consolidating them into the Composite  Draft. A copy of the Composite Draft  was
provided to WhatsApp IE on 24 December 2020. Within its submissions in response to the material that would
be put to the EDPB for the purpose of the present Article 65 GDPR procedure, WhatsApp IE included also its
additional submissions in relation to the Composite Draft. In a letter dated 9 June 2021, WhatsApp IE explicitly
confirmed that WhatsApp IE was afforded the opportunity to submit its views on the Composite Draft.

The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB
may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the
contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s).

5 ON THE INFRINGEMENTS OF THE GDPR FOUND BY THE LSA

5.1 On the findings of an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR on information about

the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party

23.

5.1.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision
In its Draft Decision, the IE SA analysed the information provided by WhatsApp IE insofar as it refers to
reliance on the legal basis set out in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR in the context of assessing compliance with
Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 22. The IE SA then also assessed the information against the requirements of
Article 13(1)(d) GDPR 23. The IE SA identified the excerpts of the Legal Basis notice with regard to the
legal basis set out in Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) as follows 24:

“The other legal bases we rely on in certain instances when processing your data are:
…
Our  legitimate  interests  or  the  legitimate  interests  of  a  third  party,  where  not  outweighed  by  your  interests  or
fundamental rights and freedoms ("legitimate interests"):
For people under the age of majority (under 18, in most EU countries) who have a limited ability to enter into an
enforceable  contract  only,  we  may  be  unable  to  process  personal  data  on  the  grounds  of  contractual  necessity.
Nevertheless, when such a person uses our Services, it is in our legitimate interests:

To provide, improve, customize, and support our Services as described in Our Services;
To promote safety and security; and
To communicate with you, for example, on Service-related issues.

The legitimate interests we rely on for this processing are:

To create, provide, support, and maintain innovative Services and features that enable people under the age of
majority to express themselves, communicate, discover, and engage with information and businesses relevant to
their interests, build community, and utilize tools and features that promote their well-being;
To secure our platform and network, verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent

27.

As to the manner of providing such information, the Draft Decision pointed out that it was provided
by way of a series of bullet points, under identified objectives, and that in this way the user can clearly
identify which legitimate interests are being pursued under each identified objective 25.

The  Investigator  expressed  that  in her view  that  the  Article  13(1)(d)  GDPR  requirement  was: “a
cumulative requirement, which results in Articles 13(1)(c) and 13(1)(d) operating together to place upon
the data controller a requirement to set out the purposes of the processing in relation to the legitimate
interests legal basis, along with the legitimate interests being pursued in carrying out the processing
operations” 26.

The Investigator proposed a finding of an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR along with the finding
of an infringement of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 27. At the decision-making stage, the IE SA adopted a more
formulaic approach (compared to the investigation stage 28) to the assessment of the extent to which
WhatsApp  IE complied  with  the  requirements  of  Article  13 GDPR by  individually  assessing  the
information provided against the requirements of each paragraph of Article 13 GDPR. By reference to
this approach, the Decision-Maker made a finding of non-compliance with Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, but
rejected a finding of an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. The Draft Decision acknowledged that
the objectives need to be detailed with greater specificity, within the assessment of compliance with
Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 29.

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA noted that the information itself has been provided in a meaningful
manner allowing the user to understand the legitimate interests being pursued. The IE SA found that
there  was  sufficient  clarity  as  to  whether  the  legitimate  interests  being  pursued  were  those  of
WhatsApp IE or of a third party, since the information provided included indications as to the “owner”
of the legitimate interests (e.g. “...it is in our legitimate interests...”) 30.

28.

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA explained that WhatsApp IE has fully complied with its obligations under
Article 13(1)(d) GDPR and considered the information provided to be clear and transparent and to

provide the data subject with a meaningful overview of the legitimate interests being relied upon when
processing their personal data 31.

5.1.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs
The DE  SA raised  an objection  stating  that  the  Draft  Decision  does  not  appropriately  address  the
infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. The objection claims that the Draft Decision fails to examine the
question whether the content of the description of each legitimate interest provided by WhatsApp IE
is clear and understandable enough for adult data subjects under Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, since the IE
SA mainly concentrated on whether the information is clear enough for children. According to the DE
SA, it is not sufficient to rely on a variety of different legitimate interests and to present these in an
abstract manner. Rather, the controller also needs to make sure that the description of the legitimate
interests is clear and transparent enough for the data subject to understand. The DE BW SA raised an
objection which merely expressed support for the objections raised by the DE SA.

In its objection, the PL SA argues that “a nonspecific reference to a widely understood controller’s
‘legitimate interest’ or ‘interests of business and other partners’ does not meet [the] requirement” of
Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. According to the PL SA, the Transparency Guidelines 32 explicitly state that, in
order to fulfil the obligations stipulated in Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, the controller has to describe “the
specific interest”. Furthermore, it is unclear which legitimate interest of which third parties is being
described 33.

The objection raised by the IT SA refers to a lack of clarity in the information provided, which conflates
the purposes of the processing of the personal data with the legitimate interests referred to in relation
to the processing of such personal data, without any specific information being provided as to the
processing involved. It is also argued that the language used with regard to the legitimate interests
impacting people under the age of majority is not appropriate since the vocabulary, tone and style of
the information utilised in the relevant section are not different from those of the remaining sections.

5.1.3 Position of the LSA on the objections
As  mentioned,  the  final  position of  the  IE  SA  was  that  of not  following  these  objections 34.
In  its
Composite Response, concerning all three objections, the IE SA noted that the subject-matter of the
objections is within the scope of Article 4(24) GDPR. The IE SA considered, however, that the objections
are not sufficiently reasoned, at least not enough to reverse its position from the Draft Decision, given
that it is required to support its findings with an adequate explanation of the supporting rationale 35.
The IE SA also argued that it was incumbent upon objecting CSAs to adequately support its different
conclusions to allow the LSA to consider replacing its views and rationale with that of the CSA.

33. With regard to the objection of the DE SA, the IE SA considered that because it is not sufficiently
reasoned, the objection of the DE SA would introduce an unnecessary and unacceptable element of

risk, as regards the defensibility of such amended finding in the event of a legal challenge before the
Irish Courts 36.

Concerning the objection of the PL SA, the IE SA argued that the findings of the Investigator cannot be
reinstated as this would create a position whereby WhatsApp IE is found to have infringed Article 13
GDPR twice, but in respect of the same conduct as there is already a finding of infringement of Article
13 (1)(c) GDPR 37.

Regarding the IT SA’s objection, the IE SA stressed that it has clearly set out its reasons for its proposed
finding of compliance with Article 13(1)(d) GDPR and the objection does not have enough reasoning
to support a contrary finding 38.

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

5.1.4 Analysis of the EDPB
5.1.4.1
The EDPB considers that the objection of the DE SA concerns “whether there is an infringement of the
GDPR” as it argues that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. As it
demonstrates that, if followed, the objection would lead to a different conclusion as to whether there
is an infringement of the GDPR or not, the objection is to be considered as “relevant” 39. The objection
is  also  considered  to  be  “reasoned”  since  the  objection  puts  forward  several  factual  and  legal
arguments for the proposed change in legal assessment. Specifically it argues that there is a lack of
intelligibility because WhatsApp IE relies upon a variety of different legitimate interests, yet WhatsApp
IE fails to make sure that all of the legitimate interests listed are described in a manner that is clear
and transparent enough for the data subject to understand. The objection provides several examples
where the legitimate interests are not described in a transparent and intelligible form, which fails to
ensure the purpose of the right to information. The objection also points out that the Draft Decision
incorrectly focused on whether the information was clear enough for children.

As to the requirement for the objection to be “reasoned”, WhatsApp IE submitted that the DE SA
objection did not meet this requirement because its statements “are not accurate” and “cannot be
sufficient  to  satisfy  the  [...]  threshold”,  the  objection  “relies  on  unsupported  descriptions  of  the
information provided by” WhatsApp IE and on “two misplaced understandings of the requirements of
Article 13(1)(d)” 40. The EDPB considers the objection to be adequately reasoned and recalls that the
assessment of the merits of the objection is made separately, after it has been established that the
objection satisfies the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 41. As for the criterion of demonstrating the
significance of the risks posed for the rights and freedoms of individuals, WhatsApp IE submitted that
the objection did not meet this threshold, stating that there was no evidence provided for this 42. The
EDPB finds that the objection raised by the DE SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks
posed for the rights and freedoms of individuals as it points out consequences for the data subjects,
such as not being able to fully exercise their other data subject rights due to the lack of information
under Article 13(1)(d) GDPR.

The EDPB took note of the objection raised by the DE BW SA but decides that as it merely supported
the objection raised by the DE SA, the objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
Since  the  objection  of  the PL  SA disagrees  with  the  finding  of  the  IE  SA  that  there  has  been  no
infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, the EDPB considers it to be relevant as it concerns “whether
there is an infringement of the GDPR” 43. The objection is also sufficiently reasoned as it argues that a
nonspecific reference to a widely understood controller’s “legitimate interest” or “interests of business
and  other  partners” does not meet  the  requirement  under  Article 13(1)(d)  GDPR  as  stated  in  the
Transparency Guidelines and furthermore refers to the original findings of the Investigator as opposed
to  those  of  the  Decision-Maker. WhatsApp IE stated  that  the  objection  “fails  to  engage  with  the
substance of the Composite Draft and the assessment carried out by the decision-maker” 44 and “fails
to explain why it disagrees” 45. The EDPB finds that the objection clearly sets out a disagreement as to
the conclusions reached by the IE SA in the Draft Decision and does so by putting forward sufficient
motivation. Regarding the requirement to demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft
Decision to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, WhatsApp IE argued that the objection of the PL
SA does not provide any evidence to support their claim that a consequence of the Draft Decision
would be that “data subjects cannot exercise other rights provided by the GDPR and are not able to
control  the  flow  of  their  personal  data” 46.  The  EDPB finds  that  the  objection  of  the  PL  SA  clearly
demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision to the rights and freedoms of
data subjects, who due to the inadequate information are placed in a position where they cannot
exercise other rights provided by the GDPR and have control over their personal data.
The  objection  of  the IT  SA considers  that  the  Draft  Decision  does  not  appropriately  address  the
situation of infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR and is therefore deemed to be relevant similarly to
the objections above. WhatsApp IE argued in its submissions that the objection is not relevant, as it is
“based in part on a statement that has not been made by” the IE SA in its Draft Decision 47, and not
reasoned 48. The fact of mistakenly referring to a sentence that is not present in the Draft Decision 49
in any event cannot be considered sufficient to make the objection not relevant, and this is even more
so where the objection is only relying on this “in part”, and is clearly stating a disagreement as to the
conclusion reached by the Draft Decision in respect of the infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. The
EDPB also considers the objection to be reasoned, since it argues that there is a lack of clarity in the
information provided, as there is no specific information being provided as to the processing activities
involved. The objection states that the IT SA disagrees with the arguments relied upon by the IE SA.
Concerning the requirement to demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision
to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, WhatsApp IE submitted that there was no evidence put
forward by the IT SA to support their argument that the consequence of the Draft Decision would be
that there would be a serious impairment of users’ fundamental right to be informed 50. The EDPB finds
that the objection raised by the IT SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed for the

43 Article 4(24) GDPR.

instance it would lead to an impairment of the users’ fundamental right to be informed.

41. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objections raised by the DE SA, PL SA, and IT SA on the
existence  of  an infringement of  Article 13(1)(d)  GDPR  qualify  as  relevant  and  reasoned objections
pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

Assessment on the merits

5.1.4.2
In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB
shall take a binding decision concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.

The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection 51 require
an assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision needs  to  be  changed  in  respect  of  the finding  on
compliance with Article 13(1)(d) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB
also takes into account the position of the IE SA on the objections and the submissions of WhatsApp
IE.

In  its  submissions, WhatsApp  IE argued that  it  provides  clear  and  transparent  descriptions  of  the
legitimate interests being relied on 52 and describes them in detail 53, that it had no obligation to further
specify the third parties in its public facing transparency documents, nor did it have to explain its
business practices to data subjects or explain why the legitimate interests relied on prevail over those
of the data subjects 54. WhatsApp IE also submitted that it has been mindful of providing all of its user-
facing information in as simple a manner as possible, using a high standard of clarity capable of being
understood by those who are 16 and over and using user-friendly, plain, and clear language 55.

The EDPB recalls that the Investigator originally found an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR in
conjunction with an infringement of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR because of a conflation of the purposes of
the processing with the legitimate interests relied upon to process the personal data as well as a lack
of specific information in relation to the processing operation(s) or set of operations involved 56.

As described above in section 5.1.1, the IE SA found no infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR and noted
in its Draft Decision that the information provided by WhatsApp IE allowed the user to understand
which and whose legitimate interests were being pursued 57.

In its Draft Decision, the IE SA relied mainly on the findings of the Investigator with regard to the
information as to the “owner” of the legitimate interest were provided and the manner in which those
descriptions  were  presented 58,  rather  than how the  information provided related to  specific
processing operations. The IE SA referred to elements within the Article 13(1)(c) assessment but did
not  further  engage  with  the  statements  of  the  Investigator  concerning  the  view  on  the  possible
conflation of the purposes of the processing with the legitimate interests relied upon to process the
personal data as well as a lack of specific information in relation to the processing operation(s) or set
of operations involved.

51.

In the view of the PL SA 59 and IT SA 60, the original finding of the Investigator – that the described lack
of relation of the legitimate interests to specific processing activities leads to an infringement of Article
13(1)(d) GDPR – is to be agreed with.

The  DE  SA submitted  that  the  IE  SA  did  not  properly  examine  whether  the  description  of  each
legitimate interest is clear for adult data subjects, and put forward examples of parts of the Legal Basis
Notice considered as not in line with the requirements of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR 61. According to the DE
SA, the legitimate interests described under “measurement, analytics, and other business services” are
not described in a transparent and intelligible form. The first white bullet point in this section states
the interest to “provide accurate and reliable reporting to businesses and other partners”, while it is
unclear who these “other partners” are. In addition, according to the DE SA, the description of the
interest “to demonstrate the value our partners realise using our Services” is too abstract 62.

The  EDPB  recalls  that  where  legitimate  interest  (Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR)  is  the  legal  basis  for  the
processing, information about the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or a third party
has to be provided to the data subject under Article 13(1)(d) GDPR.

As recalled in the Transparency Guidelines, the concept of transparency under the GDPR is user-centric
rather than legalistic and is realised by way of specific practical requirements on data controllers and
processors in a number of articles 63. The Transparency Guidelines go on to explain that the practical
(information)  requirements  are  outlined  in  Articles  12 - 14  GDPR and  remark  that the  quality,
accessibility and comprehensibility of the information is as important as the actual content of the
transparency information, which must be provided to data subjects 64.

52. With regard to Article 13(1)(d) GDPR the Transarency Guidelines state that the specific interest 65 in

question must be identified for the benefit of the data subject.

53.

54.

55.

In this light, the EDPB recalls the wording of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, which reads that information shall
be provided to the data subject  “where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR” -
about “the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party”.

The EDPB notes that the nature of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR (like Article 13(1)(c) GDPR) expressis verbis
relates to the specific processing 66. In this context the EDPB also recalls the broad wording with which
Recital 39 GDPR describes transparency obligations.

Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the purpose of these duties of the controller is to enable data
subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR 67, such as the right to object pursuant to Article 21
GDPR, which requires the data subject to state the grounds for the objection relating to his or her
particular  situation. This  is  elaborated  on  in  the  Draft  Decision  by  the  IE  SA  with  regard  to  the
requirements of Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. There the IE SA correctly identifies that:

“(a) a data controller will usually collect different categories of personal data from an individual
data subject at different times, in different ways and for different purposes […];

(b) a data controller will always need to carry out more than one processing operation in order
to achieve the stated purpose of a processing operation; and

(c)  a  data  controller  might  collect  a  particular  category  of  data  for  a  number  of  different
purposes, each supported by a different legal basis” 68.

56.

The EDPB is of the view, as outlined in the draft decision, 69 that providing full information on each and
every processing operation respectively is the only approach that will ensure that the data subjects
can:

(a) exercise choice as to whether or not they might wish to exercise any of their data subject
rights and, if so, which one(s);

(b) assess whether or not they satisfy any conditionality associated with the entitlement to
exercise a particular right;

(c)  assess whether or  not theyare entitled  to  have  a  particular  right  enforced by  the  data
controller concerned; and

(d) assess whether or not they have a ground of complaint such as to be able to meaningfully
assess whether or not they wish to exercise their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
authority.

57.

58.

59.

However, the EDPB notes that these same arguments also are to be considered when assessing the
information  under  Article  13(1)(d)  GDPR. With  regard  to  the  information  provided  under  Article
13(1)(d) GDPR the EDPB therefore agrees with the objections insofar as in order for the data subject
to properly exercise their rights under the GDPR, specific information about what legitimate interests
relate  to  each  processing operation,  and  about  which  entity  pursues  each  legitimate  interest,  is
necessary 70. Without this information, the data subject is not properly enabled to exercise his or her
rights under the GDPR.

The provided information therefore has to meet these requirements in order to be compliant with
Article 13(1)(d) GDPR.

The EDPB notes that overall the Legal Basis Notice consists of a list of several objectives under which
WhatsApp IE has provided several legitimate interests, usually in the manner of bullet points, as was
identified by the IE SA. The EDPB considers that in the Legal Basis Notice WhatsApp IE has not specified
the provided information with regard to the corresponding processing operation such as information
about what categories of personal data are being processed for which processing pursued under basis
of each  legitimate  interest  respectively. The  Legal  Basis  Notice  does  not  contain  such  specific
information in relation to the processing operation(s) or set of operations involved 71.

62.

63.

64.

This is in line with the arguments brought forward by the CSAs’ relevant objections, and the EDPB notes
that this described lack of information negatively impacts data subjects’ ability to exercise their rights
under the GDPR, such as the Right to Object under Article 21 GDPR 72.

Furthermore, the EDPB notes that several passages from the Legal Basis Notice, including those with
regard to persons under the age of majority, some of which were referred to in the objection of the
DE SA (like “For providing measurement, analytics, and other business services”), do not meet the
necessary threshold of clarity and intelligibility that is required by Article 13(1)(d) GDPR in this case 73.

The  EDPB  notes  the  similarities between  the  examples  of  non-transparent  (“poor  practice”)
information put forward in the Transparency Guidelines 74 and the Legal Basis notice of WhatsApp IE,
which includes for example: “For providing measurement, analytics, and other business services where
we are processing data as a controller […]” 75; “The legitimate interests we rely on for this processing
are: […] In the interests of businesses and other partners to help them understand their customers and
improve their businesses, validate our pricing models, and evaluate the effectiveness and distribution
of their services and messages, and understand how people interact with them on our Services” 76.

Under these circumstances the data subjects are not in a position to exercise their data subject rights,
since it is unclear what is meant by “other business services”, as WhatsApp IE does not disclose this
information or provide a relation to the specific legitimate interest. The EDPB also notes that it is
unclear which businesses or partners WhatsApp IE refers to.

The EDPB  also takes  note of the  fact that  descriptions  of  the  legitimate  interest  as the  basis of  a
processing like “[t]o create, provide, support, and maintain innovative Services and features […]” 77 do
not meet the required threshold of clarity required by Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, as they do not inform the
data subjects about what data is used for what “Services” under the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR,
especially regarding data subjects under the age of majority.

65. WhatsApp IE further relies on the legitimate interest to “secure systems and fight spam, threats, abuse,
or infringement activities and promote safety and security across the Facebook Company Products”. It
therefore “share[s] information with the Facebook Companies to promote safety and security” 78. As is
the case with the above example, the data subject has no information about the specific processing
operation which would enable a data subject to properly exercise his or her data subject rights 79.

66.

In conclusion, the EDPB considers that the finding of the IE SA in the Draft Decision that WhatsApp IE
has  complied,  in  full,  with  the  requirements  of  Article  13(1)(d)  GDPR  does  not  correspond to the
information that WhatsApp IE has provided to the data subjects, as stated in the relevant objections
raised by the CSAs. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its finding concerning the absence of an

6.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision
In Part  1  of its  Draft  Decision  the LSA focuses  on  the  transparency  in  the  context  of  non-users,
establishes observations regarding the Contact Feature and its functionality and presents the factual
framework on which it bases its assessment 80. In this context, the IE SA notes that WhatsApp IE is the
controller  for  the  processing 81.  It  further  establishes that for the  purpose  of  the  Lossy  Hashing
procedure WhatsApp IE is processing the phone numbers of non-users, and that the phone number of
a non-user constitutes personal data 82 83.

The LSA established in the  Draft  Decision (in  contrast  to  the  previous  findings) 84 that due  to the
updated  information  and  additional  elements provided 85, and particularly  the  clarification  of  the
existence  and  use  of  a  “Notification  hash”, the result  of  the  Lossy Hashing procedure  does  not
constitute personal  data. The finding  that WhatsApp  IE failed  to comply with  its  obligation  under
Article 14 GDPR remained unaffected by this new conclusion, but the scope of such infringement was
reduced, which led the LSA to reduce the relevant fine from a range between €75 million and €100
million to a range between €30 million and €50 million.

6.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs
In its objection, the DE SA disagrees with the LSA’s finding of the Draft Decision referenced above in
paragraph 68. Contrary to the LSA’s finding, the DE Federal SA argues that the phone number of non-
users constitutes an item of personal data even after lossy hashing.

The DE SA argues that it is not comprehensible in what way the new facts put forward by WhatsApp IE
concerning the Notification Hash led the IE SA at the decision-making stage to overturn the previous
finding made at the investigation stage, where it concluded that it is possible for third parties to make
an indirect identification of the non-user.

The DE SA argues that the LSA incorrectly focused on the subjective elements presented by WhatsApp
IE as “the legal assessment of whether a personal data exists does not only depend here on how the
controller determines the use of the existing data for itself at that moment” 86.

The objection raises that not all computationally possible numbers are indeed assigned. Therefore, the
lossy  hash  refers  not  to  at  least  16  numbers  but  to  a  maximum  of  16  numbers.  Furthermore,  if
additional  data  is  stored  along  with the  lossy  hash, the  number  of individuals  represented  by  the
associated phone numbers can be reduced as data subjects not matching this additional data can be
excluded. If e.g., so the DE SA, the gender is also stored, it is possible to at least divide these 16 in half.

The objection raises that the non-user number could be reconstructed by matching it with comparative
values, by resolving it back via rainbow tables or by combining a lot of particulars with the same hash
value.

The DE SA states that hashes are inherently lossy, the existence of “lossless” hashing cannot be applied
to the concept of a hash. Further, the role of the salt described in the Lossy Hashing procedure is
unclear. A fixed salt, once disclosed, would not increase the brute-forcing difficulty, should not be
called “salt”, and plays no discernible role in increasing the security of the process.

The DE SA argues that the Decision-Maker’s examination is based solely on the lossy hash while other
relevant parameters are stored in the list. Therefore, it causes incompleteness of the assessment and
therefore  a  false  result.  In  contrast,  according  to  the DE  SA the  procedure  does  not  lead  to  non-
personal data, since the lossy hashes are stored in the non-user list.

Further, it is raised that the notification hash remains unexamined by the LSA. At the same time,
according to the DE SA, the notification hash is sufficient to identify contacts without the need of the
lossy hashes list. Instead, personal data is sent to up to 15 uninvolved users.

The  correct  assessment,  according  to  the DE SA,  would  lead  to  the  question  of whether  data  is
processed lawfully. It argues that no legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR requiring necessity would be
applicable.  Therefore,  the  correct  assessment  would  most  likely  lead  to  a  higher  fine level. With
respect to necessity, the DE SA argues that the procedure is not necessary for the sync function, nor is
it “data protection friendly”, as the data is stored for an indefinite amount of time with no tangible
benefit for users and non-users. Additionally, it is unclear when lossy hash lists are deleted.

Finally, the DE SA argues in its objection that the decision creates a high risk of a significant gap in the
protection of data subjects, as the interference with the rights of non-users due to the Contact Feature
is already intense (also considering that non-users are de facto hardly enabled to exercise their rights)
and if the processing remained without consequences, it would encourage other parties to introduce
similar procedures.

***

The FR SA in its objection raises that in spite of the details provided in the Draft Decision regarding the
submissions of WhatsApp IE responding to the Draft Report, and the information summarised above
in paragraph 68, the lossy hash of the phone number still constitutes personal data and thus is subject
to the GDPR.

According to the FR SA, the process described is a pseudonymisation processing in the sense of Article
4(5) GDPR and does not amount to anonymisation to the extent that by using additional information
WhatsApp IE could identify the data subject to which the lossy hash refers. The storing of the lossy
hash in connection with the details of the user from whom the contact list was collected could lead to
infer the user’s social graph and to retrieve the phone number of the non-user or to establish a link
between users when the non-user creates an account.

Additionally, the FR SA raises that the amount of numbers linked, described as a minimum of 16, is
theoretical. In reality, this figure will be significantly lower, taking into account that WhatsApp IE has
additional information to retrieve the data subject attached to the lossy hash. It also points out that
the

algorithm has been regarded as obsolete.

Further, the objection raises that the consideration of the LSA that found the data to be anonymous
led it to decrease the amount of the intended fine 87 and thus has an impact on the decision’s dissuasive
effect.

Lastly, the FR SA states that the draft decision poses a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of
data  subjects.  The  decision  cannot  ensure  the  effective  respect  of  the  protection  of  European
residents’ personal data, as it lead to a decrease of the fine. Additionally, it would exclude the lossy
hash  from  the  material  scope  of  the  GDPR  and  prevent  any  control  on  its  use  in  the  subsequent
processing, in particular, in the event of the data being transmitted to a third party.

***

In its objection, the PT SA disagrees with the LSA’s finding referenced above in paragraph 68, that the
non-user’s phone number after the lossy hashing procedure no longer constitutes personal data, and
its interpretation of the application of Article 4(1) GDPR to the list of non-users after the lossy hashing
procedure differs from the one of the IE SA.

In reaction to the submissions of WhatsApp IE, the PT SA states that the purpose of the processing
does  not determine  whether  data  qualifies  as  personal  data.  Analogously,  it  does  not  matter  if
WhatsApp IE pursues any interest in identifying non-users. Rather it is necessary to look at whether
the piece of information meets the conditions laid down in Article 4(1) GDPR. In this case, according to
the PT SA, it is personal data because it is possible to single-out non-users by rebuilding their phone
number with a relatively low degree of uncertainty.

The PT SA first raises that the lossy hash maintains a level of identifiability that is not at all negligible.
The lossy hash has a potential match with a maximum of 16 numbers and not with a minimum of 16
numbers. Also, the process is repetitive and the salt is constant, thus the process applied repeatedly
to the same phone number will always result in the same lossy hash with no randomness.

According to the PT SA, if WhatsApp IE gets to know the 15 phone numbers that share the same lossy
hash,  the  remaining  phone  number  is  totally  revealed,  particularly  as  the  volume  of  information
already held by the company enables this without having to resort to third parties to redo many of the
phone numbers initially deleted. Therefore, it is possible to single out some non-users by rebuilding
their phone number.

The PT SA  argues  that  for  this  reason  the  lossy  hashing  does  not  effectively  guarantee  the
anonymization of the data also considering that the above-mentioned means are reasonable, within
the meaning of Recital 26 GDPR, as they are immediately available to WhatsApp IE without requiring
excessive time and costs.

Additionally, the PT SA highlights that the vast contact network among users and between users and
non-users which WhatsApp  IE has  at  its  disposal represents  a  significant  additional  source  of
information that increases the possibilities of identifiability. It highlights further that as mentioned by
the  LSA, the possibility  of  access  by  law  enforcement  authorities  to  this  informational  source  of
interpersonal relationships, once the lossy hashing procedure is applied to phone numbers, confirms
the identifiability.

90.

Finally, the PT SA understands that lossy hashes are personal data “(...) because they contain a high
identifiability component, considering the enormous amount of information held by [WhatsApp IE], to

97.

the extent that they enable with reasonable use of means, to remake phone numbers that had been
deleted.” 88

Following this, the PT SA argues that the data at stake is subject to GDPR also with respect to the
obligations of Articles 12 and 14 GDPR. It therefore disagrees with the conclusions of the LSA as to the
absence of infringement of Article 14 GDPR as regards phone numbers converted into lossy hash and
as to the reduction of the fine in paragraph 747(c) of the Draft Decision. According to the objection,
the infringement of Article 14 GDPR would also be extended to the processing carried out after the
lossy hashing procedure, with particular emphasis on the retention period of the list of non-users.

Lastly, the PT SA states that the finding in the draft decision creates a serious risk for the rights and
freedoms of data subjects as it excludes the data from the application of the GDPR, particularly when
the  processing  raises  concerns  of  lawfulness  that  were  due  to  be  addressed  in  a  near  future.
Additionally,  the  decision  would  set  a  very  disturbing  precedent  related  to  the  core  of  the  data
protection legal framework.

***

In its objection, the HU SA states that the Draft Decision details that non-users’ phone numbers are
considered  personal  data  before  and  after  the  lossy  hashing  procedure,  in  contrast  to  the  LSA’s
conclusion referenced above in paragraph 68.

Therefore, the HU SA argues that the scenario outlined in the Draft Decision whereby WhatsApp IE
could, if requested, achieve the indirect identification of the non-user 89 remains valid as the phone
number  stored  in  hashed form  (with WhatsApp  IE knowing  the  hash  key,  therefore  being  able  to
decrypt it) is pseudonymous personal data. Thus, this allows the contact with a specific person to be
re-created. While, according to the HU SA, the phone number is merely technical data, the contact
with others makes it personal data for WhatsApp IE.

Further, the HU SA recalls that in order for the data to not be anonymous the controller does not need
to have all the data necessary for re-identification, as long as it can have access to data which allows
the re-identification. It argues that with anonymous data, it is not possible to make decisions targeted
at individual users. If this is possible in the case at hand, it is incorrect to conclude the data to be
anonymous. Therefore, it would be a serious mistake to conclude that the GDPR does not apply to data
used for an operation that ultimately allows for the unique identification of users. Due to the above,
the  HU  SA  states  that  following  the  lossy  hashing  procedure, the  phone  numbers  of  non-users
constitute personal data.

Additionally, the HU SA argues that providing information pursuant to Article 14 GDPR to non-users on
WhatsApp IE’s website is not appropriate, since they might have no knowledge of the existence of the
service and it is not possible to prove that the non-users are fully informed that they are affected by
WhatsApp IE’s processing, as they cannot be expected to be interested in WhatsApp’s website.

Further, the HU SA raises that the processing of non-users’ data is excessive and thus violates the
principle of data minimisation. Only once a non-user becomes a user the processing has a purpose, i.e.
only at that point does WhatsApp IE have a real purpose to store the non-users’ phone number. At the
same  time,  according  to  the  objection,  the same  could  be  achieved  if WhatsApp  IE periodically

88 PT SA Objection, paragraph 46.
89 This scenario is presented in paragraph 66 of the Draft Decision and refers to the possibility by WhatsApp IE, if
requested to do so by a competent authority, to achieve the indirect identification of the non-user concerned by
subjecting any mobile phone number provided by the authority to the new user process with a view to identifying
those existing users who have the number in their address books.

compared the hash database of users’ phone numbers with the contact list to see if the user knows a
person  that  has  registered  since  the  previous  check.  Thereby WhatsApp  IE would  not  need  to
continuously  store  all  non-users’  data.  Therefore,  the  HU  SA  proposes  to  declare  an additional
infringement of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

Finally, the HU SA argues that not establishing this would undermine the data protection rights of data
subjects as setting a false precedent would impair the possibility for individual rights to be enforced
and exercised.

In its objection, the NL SA disagrees with the conclusion that non-user data after the hashing procedure
method are no longer personal data, contesting the finding of the Draft Decision referenced above in
paragraph 68. In its view, the process results in pseudonymised data rather than anonymised data.

***

98.

99.

100. According to the NL SA, the technical part of the draft decision contains errors and relies overly on
statements by WhatsApp IE concerning the assumed technical difficulty to regain a phone number
from a lossy hash. The NL SA notes that the Draft Decision mistakenly refers to a single hash value
being shared by at least 16 numbers, whereas it should read “at most”, and raises for instance that in
many cases, only a single phone number out of the 16 possible ones will be processed by WhatsApp
IE. In the case where indeed multiple numbers are in the same range, a multitude may already be
known in the Contact Feature.

101. Further, the NL SA argues that the hashing scheme applied by WhatsApp IE is vulnerable to a brute
force  attack. For  example,  in  the  Netherlands,  54  million  mobile  phone  numbers  are  issued.
Constructing a  look-up table  takes  around  three  minutes with  hardware  released  in  2017,  which,
according to the NL SA, is well within the capabilities of WhatsApp IE. The NL SA is also concerned that
a constant single salt value is used in all operations, which makes the brute-force attack “cheap to
perform”. Therefore, according to the NL SA, it is possible for WhatsApp IE to go from the hash value
to one or more mobile phone numbers, without unreasonable effort.

102. The NL SA also argues that WhatsApp IE is very likely to be aware of the fact that the lossy hash is a
pseudonymous identifier because a practice is described whereby it matches data from customers that
have the app with data from the phone book of its customers’ device to find other phone numbers
that match with users.

103. Further, according  to the  objection,  a  law  enforcement  authority  could  as  part  of  a  criminal
investigation request WhatsApp IE to apply the lossy hashing process to a phone number. It could then
request WhatsApp  IE to  provide  all  the  associated  users  linked  to  that  hash  (as  potential  known
associates). These potential associates could then be further investigated.

104. Additionally,  the  NL  SA  argues  that  given  recent  advancements  in  social  network  graph  analysis,
augmentation or re-identification may prove possible. If multiple phone numbers belong to a single
hash, this graph can be used to separate the identical hashes into different persons.

105. The NL SA  concludes  that  the  erroneous  assessment  leads  to  the  findings  that  the  impact  of  the
processing activities on non-users is fairly limited and that, even though a compliance deficit regarding
transparency towards non-users is established, only a slight amendment of policies would suffice to
remedy the infringement. On the contrary, according to the NL SA, the processing of non-user data
does not stop after applying said lossy hashing methods and the GDPR must continue to apply (also in
light of relevant CJEU case law), which may well entail more amendments to the privacy policy than
envisaged in Appendix C to the Draft Decision. The NL SA therefore expresses concerns that the LSA
may not envision appropriate action towards WhatsApp IE to enforce transparency towards non-users.

Adopted

23

106. The NL SA states that consequently, amending the conclusion in the Draft Decision referenced above
in  paragraph 68 would  mean  that  the  subsequent  processing  is  covered  by  the  GDPR  and  that
WhatsApp IE must make sure it complies with the GDPR and that the risks to the rights and interests
of non-users are reduced. In particular, it would influence the scope of obligations upon WhatsApp IE
under the LSA’s proposed order, since in light of Article 14 GDPR it should be noted that also non-users
should receive information about the processing of their data by WhatsApp IE even though they are
not customers of the service.

107. Additionally,  the NL SA  raises  that WhatsApp  IE should  also  inform  non-users  of  the  subsequent
processing of their data, in accordance with Article 12 GDPR. For example, if the hashed non-user data
were to be used by a third party, Article 14(1) GDPR would prescribe that this must be reflected in the
information to data subjects.

108. Further, following the NL SA’s objection, the potential circle of affected data subjects is significantly
larger than envisaged by the LSA. It raises that the conclusion above also affects the scope of corrective
measures proposed by the LSA. The NL SA argues that it may add to the impact and gravity of the
infringements and thereby may justify higher sanctions.

109. The NL SA highlights that the draft decision creates the risk that the personal data of non-users after
the lossy hashing would no longer be protected by the application of the GDPR. Non-users would have
a very limited window of opportunity to exercise their data subjects rights and any legal restrictions,
which are provided by the GDPR, to store, transfer or use after the lossy hashing would not apply.

110. The  NL  SA  argues  that  it  would  further  create  a  legal  precedent  for  other  organisations  and
circumstances on what de facto would be sufficient to anonymise personal data. Other controllers may
process personal data without complying with the GDPR, because they assume they hold anonymous
data following the procedure above, while they actually process personal data.

***

111.

In its objection, the IT SA expresses a disagreement with the conclusion reached by the IE SA at the
decision-making  stage  (departing  from  those  reached  at  the  investigation  stage)  that  there  is  no
infringement  of  Article  14  GDPR  with  regard  to  the processing  of  non-users’  data  following the
application of the so-called Lossy Hashing procedure.

112. According to the IT SA, non-users’ data collected by WhatsApp IE through access to users’ address
books with users’ consent is to be considered personal data both at the time of their storage in clear
text and after the application of the so-called lossy hashing. It argues that encrypted data is to be
regarded as being pseudonymised, not anonymised, therefore it is unquestionably personal data.

113. This conclusion, according to the IT SA, is not affected by the WhatsApp IE’s submission that “reverse
engineering decryption used by [WhatsApp IE] to present users with the numbers of non-users who
have joined the service does not allow identifying an individual number as yields a set of sixteen phone
numbers” 90, nor by the statement that users are notified via notification hashing rather than via the
lossy  hashing. Rather,  according  to  the  IT  SA,  this  amounts  to  an  additional  reason  to  argue  that
personal data is indeed processed.

114. The IT SA argues that these considerations are relevant to the existence of an infringement of Article
14 GDPR and to calculating the amount of the administrative fine (as the fine was reduced by the IE SA
in light of the conclusions reached in this regard).

115. Finally, the IT SA states that the decision poses a significant risk for the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects as  it  impairs their  right to  be  informed  as well  as due  to the  disproportionate  corrective
measure.

6.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

116. The  final  position  taken  by  the  IE  SA  was  to  not  follow  any  of  the  objections 91. However, in  the
Composite Response the IE SA indicated that it considered the objections relevant and reasoned. It
acknowledges the common issue, i.e. that the data is to be regarded as pseudonymous rather than
anonymous, and takes account of the proposed ways in which identification might be achieved. The
LSA further takes stock of the concerns raised by the CSAs regarding the salt, that the number of 16
numbers being represented by the lossy hash is in practice not a minimum, but rather a maximum and
that WhatsApp IE has at its disposal a vast network of contacts among users and non-users 92.

117. Considering the above, the LSA argues that while it is theoretically possible to consider the 39-bit hash
Value as being anonymous, viewing the hash value in isolation disregards the risks that are present in
the processing environment that might enable the re-identification of the data subjects 93. Further, in
reaction  to WhatsApp  IE’s submissions  refuting  the  objections  as  theoretical  and  raising  that the
objections fail to identify why WhatsApp IE might want to re-identify the non-users, the LSA states that
it is not unusual to rely on hypothetical scenarios to identify the re-identification risks and that the
motivation does not affect the technical ability to re-identify a data set. However, it states that the
motivation will be relevant when assessing whether the means identified are reasonably likely to be
used.

118. Further, the LSA refers to the WP29 Opinion 05/2014 94 and points out that, since the retained dataset
contains links from the hash value to users of the service, it presents a “greater-than-zero risk that
some non-users could be re-identified by inference, linking or singling out” 95. However, it also points
out that in many of the scenarios presented by the CSAs, the auxiliary data is the phone number of the
non-user  itself, thereby  creating  a  somewhat circular  argument. It argues  as well, that  a  zero-risk
approach is likely to result in very few, if any, processes achieving anonymisation. The LSA questions
that such an outcome was envisaged by the legislator.

119. Finally, following the above, the LSA concludes that neither the CSAs have provided solid arguments
to  conclude that  the  process  is  insufficient  to  anonymise  data,  nor are WhatsApp  IE’s  responses
sufficiently developed to support a finding that the process is sufficient to anonymise data in every
case 96. Therefore, it agrees with the concerns expressed by the CSAs in relation to the potential finding
having a very significant impact as a precedent, but remains concerned whether the reversed finding
according to the varying hypotheses proposed by the CSAs would be sustained if challenged in court.

120. Further,  it  is  to  be  noted  that before  referring  the  dispute  to  the  Board, the  LSA  proposed as  a
compromise to amend the draft decision to only retain the finding that WhatsApp IE processes the
personal data of non-users, thus being subject to Article 14 GDPR, and to remove all references to the
Lossy-Hashing procedure, including any associated findings.

6.4 Analysis of the EDPB

6.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

121. The objection of the DE SA disagrees with the finding of the Decision Maker that the Lossy Hashing
procedure applied to the phone number of a non-user does not constitute personal data, due to the
presence of several factors that allow identification of the data subjects. The DE SA states that, if
followed, this objection would lead to a different conclusion as to the nature of the aforementioned
data, and would also raise questions as to the lawfulness of the processing, which may lead to the
finding  of  an  additional  infringement  of  Article  6(1)  GDPR,  as  well  as  most  likely  to  different
administrative measures. Therefore, as there is a direct link between the objection and the substance
of the draft decision at issue, the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

122.

In addition, the DE sets out factual and legal mistakes concerning the analysis of the Lossy Hashing
procedure in the Draft Decision. Further, the DE SA’s objection refers to how the Draft Decision ought
to  be  changed, arguing  that,  as  it  considers that “[n]one  of [the] legal  bases  of  Article 6(1)  GDPR
requiring necessity would be applicable” to the processing of the pseudonymised data, this would lead
“to a different outcome and thus most likely to different administrative measures and a higher level of
fine’’ 97.

123. The objection argues that if the Draft Decision was not amended in this instance, it would entail a high
risk  for  data  subjects’ fundamental rights  and  freedoms  as incorrectly  not  finding  the  data  to  be
personal data would create “a significant gap in protection for the data subjects throughout Europe”.
Further, it “would encourage other providers/responsible parties to introduce similar procedure’’ and
thus  prevent  the  data  subjects  from  exercising  their  rights 98.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  the
objection to be reasoned.

124. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the DE SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

125. WhatsApp IE considers all the objections concerning Lossy Hashing procedure neither relevant nor
sufficiently reasoned to meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. Regarding the reasoning of the
above objections, WhatsApp IE reiterates what it has already explained in its submissions as to why
the phone numbers of non-users cannot be re-identified 99. As to the demonstration of the significance
of the risk in these objections, WhatsApp IE argues that the objections raise only "vague and unfounded
concerns", as lossy hashed data is not considered as personal data. Nonetheless, the EDPB considers
these objections, instead, to be adequately reasoned and recalls that the assessment of the merits of
the  objection  is  made  separately,  after  it  has  been  established  that  the  objection  satisfies  the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 100. Therefore, as the arguments presented address the merits of
the objection, the EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of whether the Article 4(24) threshold
itself is met. This is relevant for all the objections analysed in this subsection.

126. The objection of the FR SA states that it disagrees with the conclusion of the LSA referenced above in
paragraph 68. It raises that the finding that Lossy Hash was not personal data led the LSA to reduce

97 DE SA Objection, p. 11.
98 DE SA Objection, p. 12.
99 More specifically, WhatsApp IE claims that the objections of the CSAs are not sufficiently reasoned as they rely
‘’(i)  on  mischaracterisations  of  the  process,  (ii)  hypothetical  and  unsupported  scenarios  that  do  not  enable
identification of the non-user including in a manner that would satisfy the test set out in Breyer, and (iii) inaccurate
statements  that  certain  information  and  means  would  be  available  to  WhatsApp  Ireland  to  enable  the
identification of the non-user’’ (WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 24.2 to 24.8).

the  amount  of  the  fine  initially stipulated,  and  therefore expresses concerns as  to whether  the
envisaged action proposed by the LSA complies with the GDPR. As there is a direct link between the
objection and the substance of the draft decision at issue, the EDPB considers the objection to be
relevant.

127. The EDPB also considers the objection “reasoned’’, since it points to factual errors in the Draft Decision.
In this regard, the FR SA’s objection highlights that the Draft Decision considered that the GDPR did
not apply insofar as the Lossy Hash procedure resulted in the anonymisation of data, whereas it should
be qualified as pseudonymised data. Additionally, the EDPB finds that the objection of the FR SA clearly
demonstrates the significance of the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects
posed by the Draft Decision as the FR SA argues that, if not followed, this decision would jeopardize
“the effective respect of data subjects’ rights’’. In addition, the objection refers to the absence of the
dissuasive effect of the fine. Lastly, the FR SA considers that the issuing of this decision would exclude
this data from the material scope of the GDPR and consequently prevent any future control on this
type of data 101.

128. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the FR SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

129. The objection of the PT SA considers that, as the data undergoing the lossy hash procedure is not
anonymised this would lead to a further infringement of Article 14 GDPR due to the lack of information
regarding the processing of non-users’ data after the Lossy Hashing procedure. The PT SA states that
it disagrees with the conclusions reached by the LSA in the Draft Decision. This objection therefore
concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”. Further, as there is a direct link between the
objection and the substance of the draft decision at issue, the EDPB considers the objection to be
relevant.

130.

In addition, the EDPB notes that the objection of the PT SA refers to legal mistakes in the Draft Decision,
namely that the LSA finds the result of the Lossy Hashing procedure not to constitute personal data,
and therefore that there is no breach of Article 14 GDPR after the Lossy Hashing procedure has been
applied. Further, the PT SA explains how the finding that the Lossy Hashing does not guarantee the
anonymization of data would lead to a different conclusion (namely, an additional infringement of
Article 14 GDPR). Furthermore, the EDPB finds that the objection of the PT SA clearly demonstrates
the significance of the risks posed to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects by the
Draft  Decision,  as  in  this  regard,  the  PT  SA  explains  that  this  will  amount  to  “removing  the  legal
protection and guarantees of the data subjects who might be identified’’, as well as to “a very disturbing
precedent related to the core of the data protection legal framework which is the concept of personal
data’’ 102.

131. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the PT SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

132. The  objection  of  the HU  SA concerns  both  “whether  there  is  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR”  and
“whether the envisaged action proposed by the LSA complies with the GDPR’’. The HU SA’s objection
refers to the lack of findings of Article 5(1)(c) and objects to the conclusions made in the Draft Decision
on the appropriate method to be used by WhatsApp IE for providing information to non-users. As there
is a  direct link  between  the  objection  and  the  substance  of  the  draft  decision  at  issue,  the EDPB
considers the objection to be relevant.

133. Moreover, the EDPB notes that the HU SA adequately justified the need to amend the Draft Decision.
In this regard, the HU SA pointed out that the data is incorrectly assessed as anonymous data, that
there is no evidence that non-users are informed about the processing of their phone number, and
that the processing of this data is excessive in regards to the purpose for which they are processed.
Thus, the HU SA explains how the finding that the Lossy Hashing procedure does not guarantee the
anonymization of data would lead to a different conclusion (namely, an additional infringement of
Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and the need to appropriately inform non-users about this processing). Further,
the EDPB finds that the objection of the HU SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed
by the Draft Decision, as the HU SA explains that this would undermine the enforceability of data
subject rights under the GDPR, make it impossible for non-user data subjects to exercise their rights
under the GDPR, as well as explains that “it could set a false precedent (...) for an unforeseeable number
of data subjects’’ 103.

134. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the HU SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

135. The  objection  of  the NL  SA claims  that WhatsApp  IE failed  to  inform  non-users  of  the  processing
operations carried out after the Lossy Hashing procedure, as well as points out the lack of corrective
measures issued in the Draft Decision. Therefore, this objection concerns both “whether there is an
infringement of the GDPR” and “whether the envisaged action complies with the GDPR’’. As there is a
direct link between the objection and the substance of the draft decision at issue, the EDPB considers
the objection to be relevant.

136. Moreover, the EDPB notes that the NL SA adequately justified the need to amend the Draft Decision.
In this regard, the NL SA’s objection states that the Draft Decision insufficiently assessed the statement
made by WhatsApp IE concerning the presumed technical difficulty to regain a phone number from a
Lossy  Hash. Thus,  the  NL SA  explains  how  the  finding  that  the  Lossy  Hashing  procedure does  not
guarantee the anonymization of data would lead to a different conclusion as regards both the scope
of  the obligations  under Articles  12  and  14 GDPR  and  the  corrective  measures  (order  to  bring
processing into compliance and administrative fine). Finally, the EDPB finds that the objection of the
NL SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision, as it explains how
this decision would prevent non-user data subjects to enforce their rights under the GDPR and would
create a legal precedent 104.

137. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the NL SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

138. The objection of the IT SA concerns both “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR” and “whether
the envisaged action complies with the GDPR’’. In this objection, the IT SA indeed considers that the
Draft Decision should be amended to include an additional infringement of Article 14 GDPR as regards
the  processing  of  lossy-hashed  data, as  well  as  suggest  to  re-examine  the  corrective  measures
envisaged  which  were  initially  reduced  due  to  the  qualification  of  these  data  as  non-personal.
Considering that there is a direct link between the objection and the substance of the draft decision at
issue, the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

139.

In addition, the EDPB notes that the IT SA adequately justified the need to amend the Draft Decision
by referring to the mischaracterisation of lossy hashed data as anonymised data. Thus, the objection
of  the  IT  SA  explains  how  the  finding  that  the  Lossy  Hashing  procedure does  not  guarantee  the
anonymization of data would lead to a different conclusion (namely, the corrective measures taken in

103 HU SA Objection, p. 5.
104 NL SA Objection, p. 1-8.

Adopted

28

the Draft Decision and an additional infringement of Article 14 GDPR). Finally, the EDPB finds that the
objection of the IT SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed to the fundamental rights
and freedoms of the data subjects by the Draft Decision, as it explains that this decision would lead to
a “serious impairment of non-users’ fundamental right to be informed, as well as the inadequate and
disproportionate corrective measures and fining that are envisioned vis-a-vis the controller’’ 105.

140. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the IT SA is a relevant and reasoned

objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

6.4.2 Assessment on the merits

141. The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection 106 require
an assessment of whether, in the case at hand, the Lossy Hashing procedure indicated by WhatsApp
IE achieves the anonymisation of personal data so as to render the GDPR no longer applicable. In this
context, the EDPB already notes that a lossy hashed non-user phone number is stored by WhatsApp IE
in a table (hereinafter called “Non-User list”), linking a lossy hash to mobile phone numbers of those
users who uploaded numbers via the Contact Features that fall into the group of different phone
numbers that would have generated that same lossy hash 107.

142. The procedure of lossy hashing is detailed by WhatsApp IE as consisting of the following steps:

143. WhatsApp IE explains that this table is used to select the existing users to which a so-called ‘notification
hash’ is sent when a new user joins the service. This selection is done by performing the Lossy Hashing
procedure with the phone number of the new user and then sending the ‘notification hash’ to all those
users who have uploaded any one of the pool of numbers which are represented by the lossy hash,
that are linked to it in the above-mentioned table. Once WhatsApp IE’s application on a user’s device
receives a notification hash, it will create an equivalent notification hash of the users in its address

Submissions”), paragraph 9.

book to compare whether the new user is part of the contacts in its address book, in which case it will
initiate a sync request 109.

144. For the purpose of assessing whether the data described above amounts to personal data, and also in
consideration of WhatsApp IE’s submissions in relation to the draft decision and the objections, the
EDPB recalls the definition provided in Article 4(1) GDPR 110 and the clarifications provided by Recital
26 GDPR 111.

145.

146.

In other words, WhatsApp IE needs to analyse whether data has been processed in such a way that it
can no longer be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person using “all the means likely
reasonably to be used’’ by either the controller or a third party 112. Such analysis needs to take account
of objective factors as required by Recital 26 GDPR but can and should rely on hypotheticals allowing
the understanding of the likelihood for re-identification to occur.

In the case at hand, on the basis of the information available, the risk for non-users to be identifiable
by inference, linking or singling out is not just “greater-than-zero” as acknowledged by the IE SA 113,
but is such that it can be concluded that those non-users are identifiable for the purposes of the
definition in Article 4(1) GDPR. The EDPB takes note of the statement by WhatsApp IE that “there is
zero risk of re-identifying the original phone numbers from which they were generated” and “[e]ven if
there was any re-identification risk, the factors applicable to the Anonymisation Process and creation
of the Lossy Hash clearly demonstrate that any such risk has been reduced to below what the law sets
as an acceptable risk level” 114. However, the EDPB considers, as detailed below, that given the means
and the data which are available to WhatsApp IE and are reasonably likely to be used, its capacity to
single out data subjects is too high to consider the dataset anonymous.

147. The EDPB notes that, within its submissions, WhatsApp IE argued that the objections fail to identify
why WhatsApp  IE might  want  to  single-out  the  non-users  whose  phone  numbers  have  been
deliberately subjected to a process that is designed to achieve anonymisation 115. The EDPB highlights
that neither the definition nor Recital 26 GDPR as such provide any indication that the intention nor
the motivation of the controller or of the third party are relevant factors to be taken into consideration
when assessing whether the dataset at hand is to be considered personal data or not 116. The EDPB
concurs with the IE SA, that what is relevant for the GDPR to apply, i.e. for data to be considered as

109 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 3.3; WhatsApp LH Submissions, paragraph 9.
110 Article 4(1) GDPR: “‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data
subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
111 Recital 26 GDPR: “Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a
natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable
natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means
reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the
natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the
natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time
required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and
technological developments”.

“personal”, is rather whether the data relate to a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
and whether the controller or a third party have the technical ability to single out a data subject in a
dataset 117. This possibility may materialise irrespective of whether such technical ability is coupled
with the motivation to re-identify or single out a data subject.

148.

In addition, the EDPB stresses that the whole context of the processing needs to be considered, as “all
objective factors” affect “whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person”
118. In the specific situation at hand, the creation of the Lossy Hashing procedure is only one step in the
process and cannot be considered in isolation. Rather, the phone number of any user that activated
the Contact Feature and that had at least at that moment one non-user contact will be linked to the
lossy hash created from the number of this non-user 119. The result is a “Non-User List” which is stored
by WhatsApp IE 120.

149. As noted by the IE SA, viewing the hash value in isolation disregards the “risks present in the processing
environment that might enable the re-identification of the data subjects concerned” 121. Therefore, it is
important to assess if the result of the entire process allows for singling out, rather than assessing an
individual  step  of  the  process.  For  the  possibility  of  re-identification,  all  the  data  and  resources
available to the controller or a third party needs to be considered. In this context, the EDPB does not
consider that WhatsApp IE has conclusively shown that the processing environment is subject to such
organisational and technical measures that the risks of re-identification are purely speculative 122.

150.

In its submission, WhatsApp IE indicates that each lossy hash represents a pool of at least 16 phone
numbers 123. However, in the view of the EDPB and as maintained by several objections raised by the
CSAs, this is incorrect. While it cannot be ruled out that there will be cases where 16 phone numbers
are connected to a lossy hash, in many cases a lossy hash will be connected to fewer phone numbers,
even only one 124.

151. There is for example no certainty, nor is it likely, that all the theoretically available phone numbers in
a range are indeed assigned to a data subject. Further, WhatsApp IE correctly points out in line with
the NL SA’s objection that the number of mobile phone numbers in the Netherlands exceeds the actual
population. This leads to a situation where even though a lossy hash may refer to a set number of
mobile phone numbers, the number of associated data subjects can be lower.

152. Additionally, considering that WhatsApp IE processes all the phone numbers that are contacts of the
user that enables the Contact Feature, the EDPB notes that it is highly likely that a user will have at
least one non-user phone number as a contact 125. Therefore, the phone number of each user will be
retrievable from the “Non-User lists” and these numbers can be used to exclude numbers that could

124 For completeness sake, the 39bit kept allow for the representation of over 500 billion distinct values, which
for all practical purposes should provide sufficient assurance that the appearance of collisions in practice is not
significant.
125 This is particularly evident as the Contact Feature, according to the information provided by WhatsApp IE,
does transfer any phone number, not only mobile phone numbers, and then applies the lossy hashing procedure
to the non-user numbers.

31

be possibly represented in a lossy hash 126. For example, if all but one phone number that would lead
to a specific lossy hash are found to be users of the service, as they are part of at least one Non-User
list, the remaining phone number is identified. Therefore, the proposed k-anonymity is not based on a
k of 16 as indicated by WhatsApp IE, as that would require this value to be accurate for the entire data
set.

153. For  completeness,  the  EDPB  refers  to  the  Article  29  Working  Party Opinion  on  anonymisation
techniques 127, which clarified that k-anonymisation on its own merely avoids singling out, but does
not necessarily address the risks of linkability or inference. In addition, it is to be noted that WhatsApp
IE is even able to make use of the information on the devices of the users of its services, including the
address book 128.

154. Further, the EDPB also notes that evidently the result of the Lossy Hashing procedure allows inferring
information about a non-users or a set of non-users in relation to the phone number(s) to which the
specific lossy hash correlates. For each of the user phone numbers in the Non-User list, it is provided
that this user had at least one of the non-users’ phone number, which is part of the set of non-user
phone numbers represented by the lossy hash, in its address book when the user had activated that
Contact Feature.

155. Lastly, considering the amount of users of the service, the “Non-User List”, which links each lossy hash
and those users of the service that have at least one contact in their address book that would create
this lossy hash, forms an extensive network of associations of users to various lossy hashes 129. This
network of connections between users and non-users, and thereby indirectly among users, constitutes
a sort of topological signature of lossy hashes which becomes fairly unique as the dimension of the
network and the number of connections grows 130. This is the circumstance for the case at stake and
the  availability  of  the  social  graph  among  users  and  non-users  can  substantially  increase  the  re-
identification risk of data subjects 131.

156. Therefore, based on the analysis done and the information available to it, the EDPB concludes that the
table of lossy hashes together with the associated users’ phone numbers as Non-User List constitutes
personal data 132 and instructs the IE SA to amend its decision accordingly.

157. As the consequences of the aforementioned conclusion which the CSAs proposed in their objections
are diverse, they are addressed below in sections 7.4.4.1 (Infringement of Art (6)(1) GDPR), 7.4.4.2

126 See also PT SA Objection, paragraph 39.

131 See NL SA Objection, paragraph 17 and 18 and FR SA Objection page 2.
WhatsApp IE in its Submissions (WhatsApp LH Submissions) argues that  it does not have a “social graph network”
of the sort that appears envisaged by the objection, and that the service could be described as a “social graph
network” only relating to the links between existing users of the service (and not non-users). However, the EDPB
considers that the data provided in the Non-Users list is sufficient to allow for graph-based attacks, considering
the means available to WhatsApp IE.
132 By  this  finding  the  EDPB  also  disagrees  with  WhatsApp  IE’s  position  in  its  Submission  (WhatsApp LH
Submissions, paragraph 14 and following), that the data is not pseudonymous but rather anonymous.

7 ON POTENTIAL FURTHER (OR ALTERNATIVE) INFRINGEMENTS OF

THE GDPR IDENTIFIED BY THE CSAS

7.1 Objections relating to the scope of the Inquiry

158.

7.1.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision
In the introductory part of its Draft Decision, the LSA states that the Inquiry relates to WhatsApp IE’s
transparency obligations pursuant to Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR 133. The LSA also clarified that, since
this  Draft  Decision  concerns  an  own-volition  inquiry,  it  is  not  based  on  any  specific  or  individual
complaint, concern or request, including those submitted though mutual assistance, which will be
addressed by way of separate processes under the 2018 Act (as might be required) 134.

7.1.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

159. The objection raised by the DE SA refers to the limited scope of the investigation and to the failure by
the IE SA to consider, before analysing compliance with Articles 13-14 GDPR, which data processing
took place. The DE SA considers that “consensus on the scope of the investigation should be reached
at an earlier stage by the competent supervisory authorities than in the current stage of the draft
decision. Therefore, before providing the draft decision of the ex officio procedure the DPC should have
sought consensus regarding the scope of the procedure prior to initiating the procedure formally” 135.
Particularly, the DE SA argues that the Draft Decision omits the first step of the review of Articles 13
and 14 GDPR, which should be on the factual level. According to the DE SA, the assessment on the
manner  in  which  the  information  is  provided  can  only  take  place  after  determining  the  factual
elements  of  the  processing  operation  in  question.  The  DE  SA  refers,  in  particular,  to  the  factual
requirements of the legal bases and the existence of data transfers to third countries. It is argued that
incorrect information is worthless for data subjects and deceives them. In addition, the DE SA considers
that the imposition of a fine for lacking information pursuant to the infringement of Articles 12 to 14
GDPR can result in the impossibility to apply sanctions for the provision of incorrect information for
the same period. This would risk the right of data subjects to effective judicial protection, since they
will not be able to complain against the decision of the IE SA, since it is not communicated to them.
The DE SA considers that “a (further) fine against WhatsApp would no longer be possible due to the
discontinuance  of  criminal  proceedings” 136.  The  DE  SA  also  argues  that  the  limited  scope  of  the
investigation and the fact that the assessment of the factual bases was insufficient or lacking increases
the risk of non-uniform application of EU law.

160.

In addition, the DE SA raises  another objection whereby it considers that “the question of whether and
which data of WhatsApp users and non-users is disclosed to Facebook was not sufficiently investigated
either  in  factual terms  or at  the  normative  level” 137. The DE SA considers that there are “obvious
contradictions” in  WhatsApp IE’s  statements  regarding  the  existence  or  not  of  data  transfers  to

Facebook  and,  therefore,  “it  would  be  necessary  to  examine  in  detail  what  data  processing  takes
place” 138. The DE SA considers that, without a thorough investigation of these issues, “it makes no
sense to check transparency issues and the right to be informed” 139 and, therefore, they should have
been investigated.

***

161. The HU SA raised an objection arguing that since consent needs to be informed, and the LSA found
that WhatsApp IE had failed to properly inform data subjects, the Draft Decision should include that in
case of consent-based processing, consent was invalid and WhatsApp IE had been processing personal
data without a legal basis for years.

7.1.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

162. The LSA considered that the objections raised by the DE SA regarding the scope of the investigation
were  not  relevant  and  reasoned,  since  they  fall  outside  the  scope  of  the  Inquiry 140.  The  IE  SA
emphasises that the Inquiry underpinning the Draft Decision was purposefully focused on WhatsApp
IE’s transparency obligations 141.

163. The IE SA further states that, as expressed in the Draft Decision, “the findings and outcome of the
inquiry are without prejudice to any assessment of the legal bases being relied upon to support the
processing of personal data” 142, and that a separate inquiry regarding that matter is underway 143.
Thus, the IE SA highlights that the Draft Decision does not prevent further inquiries on the legitimacy
of the processing 144. Likewise, the IE SA underlines that the Inquiry did not assess WhatsApp IE’s
obligations  regarding  international  data  transfers  and  that  the  IE  SA  has  commenced  an  inquiry
examining the legality of Facebook’s data transfers to the United States of America 145.

164. Concerning the involvement of the CSA(s) in the determination of the own-volition inquiry, the IE SA
notes that, while the DE SA relies on the RRO Guidelines to make that claim, the Inquiry commenced
well before the preparation and adoption of the RRO Guidelines 146. In addition, the IE SA considers
that “the entitlement of the LSA to determine the scope of its own inquiries reflects the entitlement of
each supervisory authority to manage its own resources and to regulate its own procedures” and “the
fact that the LSA is primarily responsible for defending the adopted decision [...] in the event of an
appeal” 147. The IE SA further notes that the approach adopted regarding the scope of the Inquiry does
not  entail  any  risk  of  non-uniform  application  of  EU  law,  since  the  GDPR  does  not  establish  any
particular requirement as to the scope of the investigations carried out by the SAs 148.

165. As to the lack of investigation of the factual level, the IE SA argues that, given the findings on the
deficiency  of  the information  provided,  the  outcome  of  the  transparency  assessment  would  not

change regardless of what processing takes place 149. The IE SA also notes that the Draft Decision
represents an assessment of the materials relied upon by WhatsApp IE at a particular point in time and
does  not  purport  to  be  determinative  of  all  WhatsApp  IE  transparency  issues  into  the  future 150.
Additionally, regarding the contradictions on the information on the sharing of data with Facebook,
the IE SA notes that the Draft Decision contains the order to WhatsApp IE to remedy the information
deficits identified 151.

166. Regarding the impact of the Draft Decision on the data subjects’ effective judicial protection, the IE SA
stresses that no complaint is displaced by the existence of the Inquiry and that the assessments and
outcomes  recorded  in  the  Draft  Decision  will  not  impact  upon  the  unique  circumstances  of  an
individual complainant 152.

***

167. The LSA considered that the objection raised by the HU SA on the finding of an additional infringement
due to the invalidity of the consent obtained by WhatsApp IE is not "relevant and reasoned", since it
falls  outside  of  the  scope  of  the  investigation,  that  only  focused  on  WhatsApp  IE’s  transparency
obligations. The IE SA also clarified that a separate investigation was pending on the issue of the legal
grounds relied upon by WhatsApp IE 153.

7.1.4 Analysis of the EDPB
7.1.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

168. The  EDPB  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  objections  raised  by  the DE  SA,  relating  respectively  to  the
incomplete scope of the investigation regarding the factual level of the processing and the lack of
investigation regarding data transfers to Facebook, are not "relevant and reasoned" as required by
Article 4(24) GDPR.

169.

In this respect, the EDPB first notes that the Guidelines on RRO address the situation in which an
objection identifies gaps in the draft decision justifying the need for further investigation 154. When
such objection is raised, it would be sufficient for the CSA to present the arguments in a conclusive and
substantiated manner 155.

170. As stated in the Guidelines on RRO, an objection is relevant when, if followed, it would entail a change
leading to a different conclusion as to the existence of an infringement of the GDPR or the compliance
of the envisaged action with the GDPR. Thus, there needs to be a link between the content of the
objection and such potential different conclusion 156. Likewise, an objection is reasoned when, inter
alia, it demonstrates how the change would lead to a different conclusion 157.

171.

In this case, the EDPB considers that the objections raised by the DE SA fail to clearly identify how the
objection, if followed, would entail a change leading to a different conclusion as to whether there is
an infringement of the GDPR. Regarding the first objection on the incompleteness of the scope, while

the DE SA states that “crucial questions of fact and legal issues have been omitted and not examined"
and that "when  reviewing  Art.  13,  14  GDPR  it  is  necessary  to  determine  in  a first  step  which  data
processing actually takes place (factual level)" 158, it does not specify which questions and issues should
have  been  examined.  Likewise,  with  regard  to  the  objection  on  the  lack  of  investigation  of  data
transfers  to  Facebook,  the  DE  SA  argues  that  a  more  thorough  investigation  should  have  taken
place 159, albeit it does not clearly set out which elements should have been considered. The EDPB
recalls that abstract or broad concerns cannot be considered relevant 160. Therefore, although the DE
SA explained to the satisfaction of the EDPB the reasons why it considers a change in the Draft Decision
to be necessary, as well as the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision if it were to be issued
unchanged,  the  EDPB considers  that  it  did  not  identify with  sufficient  detail how the objection,  if
followed, would entail a change leading to a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement
of the GDPR. Since this is one of the elements that needs to be fulfilled in order to consider an objection
relevant and reasoned, the EDPB considers these objections to not be relevant and reasoned.
Although the objection of the HU SA relating to the invalidity of the consent obtained by WhatsApp IE
is relevant and includes justifications for the changes proposed in the objection and how the proposed
change  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  in  the  Draft  Decision,  it  does  not  satisfy  all  the
requirements stipulated by Article 4(24) GDPR. In particular, the objection raised does not explicitly
motivate why the Draft Decision itself, if left unchanged, would present risks for the fundamental rights
and  freedoms  of  data  subjects.  In  addition,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  HU  SA’s  objection  does  not
explicitly elaborate why such a risk is substantial and plausible 161. Therefore, the EDPB concludes that
the objection of the HU SA does not provide a clear demonstration of the risks as specifically required
by Article 4(24) GDPR.

7.2 Objections relating to the additional infringement of Articles 5(1)(a) / 5(2) GDPR

172.

7.2.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision
In  light  of  the  aforementioned  Inquiry’s  scope,  the  Draft  Decision  draws  conclusions  regarding
WhatsApp IE's compliance with its obligations under Articles 14 and 12(1) GDPR in the context of
personal data processing of non-users and Articles 13 and 12(1) GDPR in the context of processing
personal data of users. The Draft Decision makes several references to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and the
principle  of  transparency 162.  Likewise,  the  accountability  principle  under  Article  5(2)  GDPR  is  also
mentioned in several passages 163. However, the Draft Decision does not address whether Articles
5(1)(a) and 5(2) GDPR have been infringed.

7.2.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

173. The HU SA raised an objection stating that the Draft Decision should be amended to include findings
of infringement of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(2) GDPR. The HU SA is of the view that,  given “the intentional
nature", as well as the severity of the infringements for the data subjects, the finding of a violation of
Article 12, 13 and 14 GDPR also gives rise to a breach of the principle of transparency set out in Article
5(1)(a)  GDPR.  Furthermore,  the  HU  SA  considers  that  a  demonstrable  failure  to  comply  with  the
principle  of  transparency  leads  to  a  breach  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  the  principle  of
accountability as required by Article 5(2) GDPR, as these principles are closely interlinked. According

to the HU SA, the breach of the accountability principle is, in addition, supported by the intentional
nature of the infringement committed by WhatsApp IE. Therefore, the HU SA argues that the Draft
Decision should also find a breach of the principle of accountability set out in Article 5(2) GDPR.

***

174. The IT  SA raised  an  objection  arguing  that  the  Draft  Decision  should  also  contain  a  finding  of  an
infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The objection claims that, even though the Draft Decision refers
to  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR  several  times,  it  does  not  draw  a  conclusion  of  an  infringement  of  such
provision. The IT SA observes that, given that transparency is the focus of the Inquiry and consequently
of  the  Draft  Decision,  and  that  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR  has  a  general,  overarching  nature,  the  Draft
Decision should include a finding of infringement of that provision.

7.2.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

175. The LSA considered that the objection raised by the HU SA with regard to the possible infringement of
Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(2) GDPR was not relevant and reasoned, since it fell outside the scope of the
Inquiry 164. Nonetheless, the LSA acknowledged that the objection regarding the possible infringement
of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR could be followed considering that it is consistent with the scope and findings
of the Draft Decision, subject to allowing WhatsApp IE the right to be heard before taking a final
decision on the matter 165. Furthermore, the IE SA also expressed its intention to follow the objection
raised  by  the  HU  SA  with  regard  to  the  possible  infringement  of  Article  5(2)  GDPR,  should  an
infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR be found, considering that the accountability principle is closely
interconnected with the obligation of the controller to comply with the principle of transparency 166.
As before, this would be subject to allowing WhatsApp IE the right to be heard before taking a final
decision on the matter.

176. Despite  this,  the  responses  received  from  the  CSAs  showed  that  there  was  no  single  proposed
compromise position that could be agreed upon by all of the relevant CSAs. The IE SA clarified that the
Article 65 GDPR referral was made under the circumstances where the objections made by the CSAs
were not “followed’’ 167.

177. The LSA considered that the objection raised by the IT SA with regard to the infringement of Article
5(1)(a)  GDPR  was  not  relevant  and  reasoned, since  it  fell  outside  the  scope  of  the  Inquiry 168.
Nonetheless, the LSA acknowledged that it would be consistent with the scope and findings of the
Draft  Decision  to  follow  the  objection,  subject,  as  mentioned  above,  to  allowing  WhatsApp  IE  to
exercise its right to be heard before taking a final decision on the matter 169.

178. Despite this, as explained above, the responses received from the CSAs showed that there was no
single proposed compromise position that was agreeable to all of the relevant CSAs. For the sake of
completeness, the EDPB takes note that the IT SA welcomed the proposal by the IE SA in its response.
The IE SA clarified that the Article 65 GDPR referral was made in circumstances where it does not
propose to “follow” the objections raised by the CSAs 170.

7.2.4 Analysis of the EDPB
7.2.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

179. Although the objection of the HU SA relating to the additional infringements of Articles 5(1)(a) and
5(2) GDPR is relevant and includes justifications concerning why and how issuing a decision with the
changes proposed in the objection is needed and how the change would lead to a different conclusion
in  the  draft  decision, it  does  not  satisfy  all  the  requirements  stipulated  by  Article  4(24)  GDPR.  In
particular,  the  objection  raised  does  not  explicitly  motivate  why  the  Draft  Decision  itself,  if  left
unchanged, would present risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. In addition,
the EDPB notes that the HU SA’s objection does not explicitly elaborate why such a risk is substantial
and plausible 171. Therefore, the EDPB concludes that the objection of the HU SA does not provide a
clear demonstration of the risks as specifically required by Article 4(24) GDPR.

***

180. The EDPB notes that the objection of the IT SA concerns “whether there is an infringement of the
GDPR” as it states that the Draft Decision should include an additional infringement of Article 5(1)(a)
GDPR 172. The EDPB considers that the objection is to be considered “relevant” since if followed, it
would lead to a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR 173. More
specifically, it includes a “disagreement as to the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the
investigation”, since it states that the “findings amount to the infringement of a provision of the GDPR
[...] in addition to [...] those already analysed by the draft decision” 174. The EDPB is thus not swayed by
the arguments put forward by WhatsApp IE which stated that this objection is not relevant because it
does not refer to the “specific legal and factual content of the draft decision’’ and relates to “a matter
that have not formed part of the Inquiry’’, since the objection clearly sets out a disagreement as to the
conclusions reached by the IE SA 175.

181. The EDPB also considers the objection “reasoned” since it puts forward several legal arguments for the
proposed additional infringement, clearly explaining the reasons for the objection 176 : the additional
infringement stems from the scope and findings of the Draft Decision, which also mentions Article
5(1)(a) GDPR 177, and the overarching nature Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. Additionally, the EDPB finds that the
objection of the IT SA clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision to
the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, since it would create a dangerous precedent
that would jeopardize the effective protection of the data subjects and thus entail flawed corrective
actions. WhatsApp IE argues that the objection is “unsupported by clear reasoning”, as it is based on
“the  assumption  that  an  infringement  of  Articles  12  to  14  GDPR  must  automatically  qualify  as  an
infringement  of  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR’’ 178,  and considers  that  the  objection  does  not  adequately
demonstrate the risk, since Article 5(1)(a) GDPR was outside the scope of the Inquiry and the findings
of infringements in the Draft Decision address the concerns of the IT SA 179. Nonetheless, the EDPB
considers the objection, instead, to be adequately reasoned and recalls that the assessment of merits

of  the  objection  is  made  separately,  after  it  has  been  established  that  the  objection  satisfies  the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 180.

182. On this basis, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the IT SA on the infringement of Article

5(1)(a) GDPR qualifies as a relevant and reasoned objection pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

7.2.4.2

Assessment on the merits

183. The EDPB now analyses the relevant and reasoned objection of the IT SA on Article 5(1)(a) GDPR - as

well as the LSA’s Composite Response to those objections and WhatsApp IE’s submissions.

184. The IT SA argues that, given that transparency has been identified by the IE SA as the core of the
Inquiry, and the Draft Decision contains findings of infringements of Articles 12 to 14 GDPR, the Draft
Decision should also contain a finding of non-compliance with article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The IT SA argues
that “Article  5(1)a.  is  a  provision  of  a  general  nature  setting  forth  one  of  the  seven  key  principles
underlying the whole framework of the Regulation” 181. The IT SA also observes that the Draft Decision
refers “cursorily  to  Article 5(1)a.  in  various  passages  [...],  however  it  does  not ultimately  draw  the
conclusion that there was an infringement of that provision as well” 182. Finally, the IT SA considers that
the finding of an infringement of such provision would not undermine WhatsApp IE’s right to be heard,
given that “this is a provision of a general, overarching nature compared to Articles 12 to 14 GDPR, so
that WhatsApp’s defence regarding those Articles may be automatically relayed back to the general
principle as well” 183.

185.

186.

In the Composite Response, the IE SA acknowledges that “[h]aving considered this objection against
the  backdrop  of  the  existing  scope,  facts  identified  and  provisional  findings  previously  notified  to
WhatsApp concerning various infringements of Articles 12, 13 and 14, IE SA considers, on a preliminary
basis, that a finding that WhatsApp has infringed Article 5(1)(a) insofar as it concerns transparency
potentially may  arise  from  the  various  findings  of  infringement  of  the  more  specific  transparency
obligations which are set out in the Composite Draft” 184.

In its submissions, WhatsApp IE outlined two different possible approaches. First, if the objections are
premised on the assumption that a finding of non-compliance with Articles 12 to 14 GDPR must equate
automatically  to  non-compliance  with  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  they  are  insufficiently  relevant  and
reasoned and from a procedural perspective the controller cannot be punished twice for the same
conduct 185. In this regard, WhatsApp IE agrees with the statement by the FR SA (which “fails to see on
which facts, not already covered by the breach to article 12, the breach to article 5(1)(a) would be
based” and “wonders if [the addition of fines in respect of such additional infringements] would be
compatible with the principle according to which the same facts should be punished only one time” 186).

187. Second, WhatsApp IE argues that according to the second approach, compliance with Article 5(1)(a)
GDPR  addresses  something  different  to  the  provision  of  prescribed  information  in  an  appropriate
manner, and would be a “more expansive principle, holistically encapsulating transparency, fairness

and lawfulness,” and arguably concerned with the justifiability of a processing operation rather than
with whether prescribed items of information have been provided 187. Therefore, it would be possible
for a processing operation to comply with Articles 12-14 GDPR and fall short of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR or
vice  versa 188.  More  specifically,  “a technical  contravention  of  Articles  12  to  14  GDPR  would  not
necessarily  give  rise  to  a  “transparency”  failure  under  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  if  the  controller has
nonetheless made data subjects aware of the processing in question” 189. WhatsApp IE submits that it
complied with the obligations under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in full, as it is a controller that has committed
considerable resources to engaging with its users “and that publishes comprehensive information on
its  processing:  therefore,  even  if  it  was  found  that  information  provided  to  data  subjects  was
insufficiently granular or could have been provided in a different manner (such that there has been a
technical contravention of Articles 12 to 14 GDPR), it would not necessarily follow that such a controller
could be considered to be acting in an unfair or non-transparent manner which infringes Article 5(1)(a)
GDPR” 190. Also, if Article 5(1)(a) GDPR imposes a separate and distinct obligation, WhatsApp IE states
that it meets these obligations, and this did not fall within the scope of the Inquiry, which means that
WhatsApp IE needs to speculate as to what the case against it might be and is not in a position to
exercise its full right to be heard 191. According to WhatsApp IE, it would be procedurally unfair to
incorporate a finding on this issue at this stage, also because it should have a proper opportunity to
reply to fully reasoned arguments as to why there has been an alleged distinct infringement of Article
5(1)(a) GDPR 192.

188. The EDPB notes that the concept of transparency is not defined as such in the GDPR. However, Recital
39 GDPR provides some elements as to its meaning and effect in the context of processing personal
data. As stated in the Transparency Guidelines, this concept in the GDPR “is user-centric rather than
legalistic and is realised by way of specific practical requirements on data controllers and processors in
a  number  of  articles” 193. The  key  provisions  concretising  the  specific  practical  requirements  of
transparency  are  in  Chapter  III  GDPR.  However,  there  are  other  provisions  that  also  realise  the
transparency principle, for example, Article 35 (data protection impact assessment) and Article 25
GDPR (data protection by design and by default), to ensure that data subjects are aware of the risks,
rules and safeguards in relation to the processing, as stated in Recital 39 GDPR 194.

189. The EDPB also notes that transparency is an expression of the principle of fairness in relation to the
processing of personal data and is also intrinsically linked to the principle of accountability under the
GDPR 195. In fact, as noted in the Transparency Guidelines, a central consideration of the principles of
transparency and fairness is that “the data subject should be able to determine in advance what the

190 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 12.3.
191 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 12.1.
192 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 13.2(B). WhatsApp further argues that it is inappropriate for it
not to have the case for infringement put to it in line with the other issues in scope of the inquiry and instead be
required to make  submissions in the abstract in response to insufficiently particularised reasoning as to the
meaning and application of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR where WhatsApp does not have adequate notice of the nature
of the case being made against it.

scope and consequences of the processing entails” and should not be taken by surprise about the ways
in which their personal data has been used 196.

190. Thus, it is apparent that, under the GDPR, transparency is envisaged as an overarching concept that
governs  several  provisions  and  specific  obligations.  As  stated  in  the  Transparency  Guidelines,
“[t]ransparency is an overarching obligation under the GDPR applying to three central areas: (1) the
provision  of  information  to  data  subjects  related  to  fair  processing;  (2)  how  data  controllers
communicate with data subjects in relation to their rights under the GDPR; and (3) how data controllers
facilitate the exercise by data subjects of their rights” 197.

191. This being said, it is important to differentiate between obligations stemming from the principle of
transparency  and  the  principle  itself.  The  text  of  the  GDPR  makes  this  distinction,  by  enshrining
transparency as one of the core principles under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR on the one hand, and assigning
specific and concrete obligations linked to this principle, on the other one. The concretisation of a
broad principle in specific rights and obligations is not a novelty in EU law. For example, with regard to
the principle of effective judicial protection, that CJEU has stated that it is reaffirmed in the right to an
effective remedy and to a fair hearing, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter 198. Nonetheless, that does
not imply that principles as such cannot be infringed. In fact, under the GDPR the infringement of the
basic principles for processing is subject to the highest fines of up to 20.000.000€ or 4% of the annual
turnover, as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR.

192. On the basis of the above considerations, the EDPB underlines that the principle of transparency is not
circumscribed by the obligations under Articles 12-14 GDPR, although the latter are a concretisation
of the former. Indeed, the principle of transparency is an overarching principle that not only reinforces
other  principles  (i.e.  fairness,  accountability),  but  from  which  many  other  provisions  of  the  GDPR
derive. In addition, as stated above, Article 83(5) GDPR includes the possibility to find an infringement
of transparency obligations independently from the infringement of transparency principle. Thus, the
GDPR distinguishes the broader dimension of the principle from the more specific obligations. In other
words, the transparency obligations do not define the full scope of the transparency principle.

193. That being said, the EDPB is of the view that an infringement of the transparency obligations under
Articles 12-14 GDPR can, depending on the circumstances of the case, amount to an infringement of
the transparency principle.

194.

195.

In this particular case, the question that the EDPB is confronted with is whether the infringements of
specific  transparency  obligations  by  WhatsApp  IE amount  to  an  infringement  of  the  overarching
principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

In  the  draft  decision,  the  IE  SA  considers  that  WhatsApp  IE  has  not  complied  with  the  following
obligations under the GDPR with regard to the information provided to users of the service: obligations
pursuant to Articles 13(1)(c) and 12(1) 199; 13(1)(e) and 12(1) 200; 13(1)(f) and 12(1) 201; 13(2)(a) 202; and
13(2)(c)  and  12(1)  GDPR 203.  With  regard  to  non-users,  the  IE  SA  considers  that  WhatsApp  IE  has

infringed  its  obligations  under  Article  14  GDPR,  albeit  noting  that  the  personal  data  undergoing
processing is very limited 204. Finally, with regard to the transparency obligations in the context of
sharing user data between WhatsApp IE and Facebook Companies, the IE SA considers that Articles
13(1)(c), 13(1)(e) and 12(1) have been infringed 205.

196. On the contrary, the IE SA did not find any infringement with regard to Articles 13(1)(a)-(b), 13(1)(d)
and 13(2)(d) GDPR. With regard to Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, the EDPB reached the conclusion described
in paragraph 66 above.

197. The EDPB also notes that, in its Composite Response, the IE SA recalls that the Draft Decision contains
a finding whereby “the information provided by WhatsApp , in relation to its data processing operations
and the legal basis/bases being relied upon to support any such processing, is so inadequate that it is
not  possible  to  identify: i) the  specific  processing  operations  taking  place;  (ii)  the  purpose  of  those
processing  operations;  or  (iii)  the  legal  basis  being  relied  upon  to  ground  those  processing
operations” 206. Indeed, the Draft Decision recalls that “it is impossible [for the IE SA] to understand
which legal basis might be relied on for any particular act of processing” 207, and that “it is self-evident
[...] that there is a significant information deficit” which is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of the
information208. This inaccessibility is also reflected in the Draft decision, with the IE SA stating that the
assessment  of  the  material  “was  a  needlessly  frustrating  exercise  that  required  the  extensive  and
repeated search of the Privacy Policy and related material to try and piece together the full extent of
the information that had been provided” 209. The IE SA considers that the deficiencies identified are
such that the users “cannot make informed decisions in relation to whether or not they wish to continue
using the service” 210 and that they may also be “deprived of the information they need to exercise their
data subject rights” 211. In fact, the IE SA’s assessment is that WhatsApp IE failed to provide 41% of the
information required by Article 13 GDPR 212. With regard to non-users, the IE SA considers that there
has been a “total failure” to provide them with the required information. This information is “vitally
important so as to enable the non-user to make an informed choice, in the event that he/she might
consider joining the Service” 213.

198.

In short, the IE SA considers that the infringements found in the Draft Decision “reflect a significant
level of non-compliance” which impact on all of the processing carried out by WhatsApp IE 214.

199. Taking all the above into consideration, the EDPB is of the view that, in this particular case, there has
been an infringement of the transparency principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in light of the gravity
and the overarching nature and impact of the infringements, which have a significant negative impact
on all of the processing carried out by WhatsApp IE.

200. Furthermore, the EDPB considers that WhatsApp IE has been provided the right to be heard on this
issue, contrary to its claims, since it had the opportunity to express its point of view on the objections
raised by the CSA on this matter 215.

201. Therefore, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is required to amend its Draft Decision in order to include

a finding of an infringement of the transparency principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

7.3 Objections relating to the additional infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR

7.3.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

202. The Draft Decision notes that the Investigator did not propose or confirm any finding or conclusion
with regard to the potential infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR 216. In its assessment, the Decision-
Maker considers that the language used to provide the information “does not clearly identify the data
that must be provided or the consequence of failure to provide that data” 217. However, to the extent
that compliance with the requirements of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR does not appear to have been pursued
by the Investigator, the Draft Decision proposes no finding on this matter 218, although it recommends
that  WhatsApp  IE  consider  its  position  in  relation  to  the  extent  to  which  it  has  incorporated  the
information required by Article 13(2)(e) into its Privacy Policy (and Legal Basis Notice) 219. The Draft
Decision specifies that this recommendation is “on an obiter dicta basis and solely for the purpose of
assisting WhatsApp to achieve compliance with its transparency obligations’’ 220.

7.3.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

203. The DE  SA raised  an  objection  stating  that  no  finding  was  made  regarding  an  infringement  of
Article 13 (2)(e) GDPR although this was covered by the scope of the investigation. The DE SA does not
consider  appropriate  the  justification  in  the  Draft  Decision  whereby,  given  to  the  fact  that  the
Investigator did not cover this issue within the investigation, the IE SA recommends WhatsApp IE to
consider its position in relation to the extent to which it has incorporated the information prescribed
by Article 13(2)(e) GDPR into its Privacy Policy .

204. Additionally, the DE SA underlines that the Draft Decision exposes “obvious ambiguities and confusion”
regarding the provision of information on the extent of the minimum amount of personal data required
to  provide the service  and the consequences of failure to provide data. The DE SA therefore considers
that a finding should have been included concerning this provision in the Draft Decision in order to
avoid the creation of a dangerous precedent (as “other controllers could see it as a sign of possibility
to circumvent an administrative order regarding one specific data protection aspect, as long as the
(first) inspection did not include investigations on that matter” 221) and to ensure the protection of data
subject  rights  on  information  and  transparency.  Finally,  the DE  SA points  out  that  a  sufficient
investigation into this topic would have also been reflected in the amount of the fine as an independent
infringement.

7.3.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

205. Regarding the required finding of an infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR, the IE SA explains that the
Decision-Maker was unable to conclude a finding on this aspect of matters in circumstances where it
was not specifically examined by the Investigator. The making of any finding in the circumstances
would have breached WhatsApp IE’s procedural rights under EU and Irish law 222. Furthermore, it is
unclear to the IE SA how the Draft Decision gives rise to risk, as regards the fundamental rights and
freedoms of data subjects, as the IE SA had specifically addressed how WhatsApp IE should remedy
the deficiencies in this context 223. Finally, the IE SA states that it is unclear what meaningful impact a
finding of infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR would have made on the fine to be imposed given that
it would only have resulted in a slight increase in the extent of overall non-compliance with Article 13
GDPR and the fine that has been proposed reflects the finding of infringement of Article 14 GDPR (this
being the “gravest infringement” for the purpose of Article 83(3) GDPR) 224.

7.3.4 Analysis of the EDPB
7.3.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

206. The DE SA’s objection concerning the infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR is relevant as it concerns
“whether there is an infringement of the GDPR” by specifically disagreeing with the failure by the Draft
Decision to include a finding of an infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR, which would also have been
reflected in the amount of the fine. The EDPB also considers the objection “reasoned” as it points to
the elements that would have, according to the CSA, required a different conclusion. The objection
clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision for the fundamental
rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects  by  expressing  the  view  that  the  Draft  Decision  creates  a
dangerous  precedent  as  other  controllers  could  see  it  as  a  sign  of  possibility  to  demand  certain
violations be ignored by supervisory authorities. The EDPB considers that this objection raised by the
DE SA meets the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR.

207. As to the requirement for the objection to be “reasoned”, WhatsApp IE expressed the view that the
DE  SA’s  objection  is,
inter  alia,  ‘‘speculative  and  premised  on  an  incorrect  presumption  of
infringement”, ‘’does not identify legal arguments or factual evidence on the infringement of Article
13(2)(e) GDPR’’, as well as relies on ‘’unsubstantiated and theoretical risks’’ 225. However, as outlined
above the EDPB considers the objection to be adequately reasoned and recalls that the assessment of
the merits of the objection is made separately, after it has been established that the objection satisfies
the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 226.

7.3.4.2

Assessment on the merits

208. The EDPB now analyses the DE SA’s objections on Article 13(2)(e) GDPR found being relevant and

reasoned as well as the LSA’s response to those objections and the submissions by WhatsApp IE.

209. Regarding the objection on Article 13(2)(e) GDPR, the EDPB notes that the IE SA indeed makes an
assessment of WhatsApp’s Privacy Policy “Information We Collect” section, the “contractual necessity”
section and the “About Our Services” section. Inter alia, the IE SA - in the view of the EDPB, rightfully -
concludes that "[…] the language used does not clearly identify the data that must be provided or the

consequences of failure to provide that data" and that certain parts of the cited Privacy Policy sections
were confusing 227.

210. However, the IE SA does not make use of its corrective powers stipulated in Article 58(2) GDPR but
(merely) recommends that "[…] WhatsApp consider its position in relation to the extent to which it has
incorporated  the  information  prescribed  by  Article  13(2)(e)  into  its  Privacy  Policy  (and  Legal  Basis
Notice)” 228. According to the IE SA, the reason for this approach was that “[…] the requirements of
Article 13(2)(e) GDPR does not appear to have been pursued by the Investigator (notwithstanding that
it is covered by the scope of the within Inquiry, as set out in the Notice of Commencement)” 229.

211. The EDPB welcomes the IE SA’s initiative to provide WhatsApp IE with recommendations in order to
provide data subjects with clearer and more transparent information concerning the processing of
personal  data  at  stake.  Nonetheless,  it  has  to  be  noted  that,  according  to  the  IE  SA,  the  Inquiry
concerned "[…] the question of compliance or otherwise by WhatsApp Ireland Limited (“WhatsApp”)
with  its  obligations  pursuant  to  Articles  12,  13  and  14  of  the  GDPR" 230 without  excluding  Article
13(2)(e) GDPR from the Inquiry.

212. Furthermore, the EDPB stresses the importance of the information obligations as only full compliance
with all aspects of Article 13 GDPR enables data subjects to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of
the processing and to effectively exercise their rights as guaranteed by the GDPR.

213. Additionally, the EDPB notes that the IE SA in the Draft Decision stated that while “[i]t stands to reason
that WhatsApp needs to process a certain, minimum amount of personal data in order to provide the
Service”, “[t]he extent of the minimum required [...] is not clear” from the Privacy Policy, nor are the
possible consequences of the failure to provide data clearly set out, except for a reference within the
section of the Legal Basis Notice dedicated to contractual necessity: “if  you  choose  not  to  provide
certain data, the quality of your experience using WhatsApp may be impacted” 231. The IE SA found this
to  be  “further  confusing  in  circumstances  where  processing  is  either  necessary  for  the  purpose  of
administering a contract or it is not” 232.

214.

Indeed, controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable legal basis is.
This is particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and a contract
regarding  online  services  is  entered  into  by  data  subjects.  Depending  on  the  circumstances,  data
subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are giving their consent in line with Article
6(1)(a) GDPR when signing a contract or accepting terms of service 233.

215. The EDPB takes note of the arguments put forward in WhatsApp IE’s submissions concerning whether
Article 13(2)(e) GDPR was infringed. WhatsApp IE disagreed that an infringement of this provision took
place, first of all, because the language of Article 13(2) GDPR makes clear that the requirements listed
in this provision inherently depend on context and are only mandatory to the extent “necessary to
ensure  fair  and  transparent  processing” 234.  The  EDPB  recalls  that,  instead,  “there  is  no  difference
between the status of the information to be provided under sub-articles 1 and 2 of Articles 13 and 14

GDPR respectively, as all of the information across these sub-articles is of equal importance and must
be provided to the data subject'' 235. WhatsApp IE also argued that the information to be provided
pursuant  to  Article  13(2)(e)  GDPR  was  adequately  provided  in  the  privacy  policy  and  user-facing
information, as well as in the sign-up flow 236. Nevertheless, it appears from the observations made by
the IE SA, as well as from the sentence quoted above from the Legal Basis Notice that such information
was not provided in a way that clearly allows the user to understand what is necessary and what
consequences arise from the failure to provide certain information, nor the nature of the “optional
features”.

216. The EDPB sees no justification in excluding Article 13(2)(e) GDPR from the formal decision since the
scope of the investigation inter alia covered compliance with Article 13 GDPR as such. The EDPB indeed
considers that a stance of a SA where it displays that it will not exercise corrective powers impairs the
position of data subjects to be fully aware of the processing at stake as a mere recommendation cannot
be enforced and WhatsApp IE is not obliged to follow the view of the IE SA in this regard.

217. Furthermore,  the  EDPB considers  that  a  finding  of  an  infringement  instead  of  a  recommendation
concerning Article 13(2)(e) GDPR does not undermine WhatsApp IE’s right to be heard, and in any case
there  is  no  right  that  certain  aspects  are  excluded  from  an  investigation.  As  outlined  above,  the
investigation covered, inter alia, compliance with Article 13 GDPR as such, meaning the finding relates
to the same subject-matter and not a completely different provision or chapter of the GDPR. Apart
from this and as mentioned above, WhatsApp IE was given the opportunity to reflect on a potential
finding  of  an  infringement,  clearly  setting  out  its  arguments,  and  took  the  stance  that  it  had  not
infringed Article 13(2)(e) GDPR 237.

218. Therefore, in the view of the EDPB, it is a mere legal assessment whether the relevant sections of the
Privacy Policy of WhatsApp are in compliance with the GDPR or not as the factual findings (the use of
the Privacy  Policy of  WhatsApp)  are  undisputed  in  this  context  and  are  sufficient  to  reach  a  legal
conclusion.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  instructs  the  LSA  to  include  in  its  final  decision  a  finding  of  an
infringement  of  Article  13(2)(e)  GDPR,  which 
it  considers  a  mere
recommendation to be insufficient to ensure effective enforcement of the GDPR against WhatsApp IE
and to fully protect the rights of natural persons as stipulated in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the EU.

section 6.4.1 above.

223.

7.4.4.1

Assessment on the merits - Objection relating to the additional infringement of Article 6(1)
GDPR

In the view of the DE SA, the pseudonymised data regarding non-users is not processed lawfully by
WhatsApp IE 238. The DE SA argues that no legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR requiring necessity would
be applicable and, therefore, the correct assessment would most likely lead to a higher fine level 239.
The EDPB understands the concerns expressed by the DE SA. However, the file submitted to the EDPB
does  not  contain  sufficient  elements  that  would  allow  the  EDPB  to  establish  the  existence  of  an
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.

224. The  EDPB  recalls  that  a  relevant  and  reasoned  objection  may  refer  to  the  finding  of  additional
infringements 240. The information included in the file and the reasoning provided in the objection
should  be  taken  into  account  by  the  EDPB  when  determining  whether  or  not  there  has  been  an
infringement of the GDPR 241. In this regard, the EDPB is aware that, as a general matter, the limited
scope of the Inquiry by the IE SA - focused since the outset only on whether there were infringements
by WhatsApp IE of Articles 12-14 GDPR - directly affects the remit of the investigation and further fact
finding, which may therefore impact on the ability for CSAs to substantiate their objections in such a
way that would allow the EDPB to make a final determination on the matter.

225.

In any case, the EDPB notes that the DE SA has raised relevant concerns in its objection as to the
lawfulness of the processing of personal data of non-users and underlines the importance of taking
them into consideration in the context of any current or future investigation of the IE SA. The EDPB
recalls the obligation of the LSA to cooperate with the CSAs with an “endeavour to reach consensus”,
and the mutual obligation to exchange all relevant information 242. The EDPB also recalls that, even in
case of an own-volition inquiry, the LSA should seek consensus regarding the scope of the procedure 243
and should anyway frame the scope in such a way that permits the CSAs to effectively fulfil their role,
alongside  the  LSA,  when  determining  whether  there  has  been  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR 244.
Moreover, the EDPB underlines that every CSA has the possibility to submit to the LSA a request for
mutual assistance under Article 61 GDPR to ask that their concerns regarding the lawfulness of the
processing be addressed. Therefore, due regard should be given to the concerns of the DE SA by the
IE SA. In light of the above, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision
on the basis of the objection raised by the DE SA with respect to the lawfulness of the processing of
non-users data.

7.4.4.2

Assessment on the merits - Objection relating to the additional infringement of Article 14
GDPR

226. The EDPB notes that the objections issued by the IT SA, the NL SA, and the PT SA, as they consider the
data resulting from the Lossy Hashing procedure to be personal data, argue that the infringement of

Article 14 GDPR must referred also to such data 245. These objections also point out that, due to the
change made by the LSA in its finding, the proposed fine 246 was also changed.

227. As elaborated in Section 6.4.2, the EDPB concurs with the position of the CSAs that the data resulting
from the Lossy Hashing procedure, which is stored as Non-User lists, is personal data. Furthermore, as
pointed out in multiple objections, the EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the LSA has changed its
original finding as to whether the non-user data after the application of the Lossy Hashing procedure
constitute personal data (compared to those reached in the investigation stage), and that also the
following sections of the previously shared version of the Draft Decision 247 were amended on the basis
of such modified finding.

228. As a consequence, the EDPB points out that the existence of an infringement of Article 14 GDPR is
stipulated in the Draft Decision 248 and was not challenged in any of the objections submitted by the
CSAs.  The  only  aspect  that  needs  to  be  assessed  is  whether,  as  a  consequence  of  the  conclusion
concerning the nature of the non-user data after the application of the Lossy Hashing procedure, the
infringement of Article 14 GDPR extends to such data, too, and whether this needs to be reflected in
the choice of corrective measures and amount of the administrative fine.

229.

230.

In this regard, the EDPB agrees with the CSAs’ objections that the infringement of Article 14 GDPR
extends as well to the processing of non-users’ data in the form of Non-User Lists after the Lossy
Hashing procedure was applied, and instructs the LSA to amend its Draft Decision accordingly.

It is important to note at this point that neither the LSA nor WhatsApp IE provided elements that refer
to the CSAs position that the extent of the infringement of Article 14 GDPR needs to be reassessed in
case the result of the Lossy Hashing procedure is personal data 249.

231. Finally, the IT SA, NL SA and the PT SA considered that if the extent to which Article 14 GDPR is infringed
changes,  this  this  should  be  reflected  in  the  considerations  for  the  sanctions  (NL  SA)  or  the
administrative fine (IT SA and PT SA). Analogously, the FR SA noted in its objection that the incorrect
finding regarding the Lossy Hashing procedure lead to a decrease of the fine by the LSA regarding
Article 14 GDPR.

232. With respect to the need for the enlarged infringement of Article 14 GDPR to be reflected in the
corrective measures, as brought up by the aforementioned objections, please see section 9.4, for the
considerations on the sanctions as a general matter, see sections 8 and 9.

233.

7.4.4.3

Assessment on the merits - Objection relating to the additional infringement of Article 5(1)(c)
GDPR

In its objection, the HU SA raised that it does consider the processing of non-users’ data excessive in
view of the purpose of the processing. It argued that the same result can be achieved if WhatsApp IE
periodically compares the hash database of users’ phone numbers with the contact list to see if the
user knows a person who has registered since the previous check. This way, according to the HU SA,
WhatsApp IE does not need to continuously store all non-users’ data, but still provides the Contact

Feature offered. Therefore, while acknowledging that this aspect was not covered by the investigation,
the HU SA proposes to declare an infringement of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

234. The EDPB notes that WhatsApp IE has in its view not provided a full submission dedicated to this
aspect, as it deems that (i) the issues have not been investigated and it has not had an opportunity to
respond to them during the course of the Inquiry, (ii) it was not able to respond to provisional findings
of the LSA in relation to this issue and (iii) that the objections are insufficiently reasoned to allow it to
adequately exercise its right to be heard 250. According to WhatsApp IE, including these allegations at
this late stage would violate the right to fair procedure as a matter of EU law and Irish law, and the
decision would thereby be unlawful.

235. However,  WhatsApp  IE  still  states  that, as  far  as  it  is  able  to  understand the objections, they  are
unfounded in substance and that it can confirm that its processing of personal data does not infringe
Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

236. Further, both the LSA, in its Composite Response, and WhatsApp IE, in its Article 65 Submissions, argue
that it is unclear how the HU SA reached the conclusion that the same end result can be achieved with
less processing of personal data.

237. Additionally, WhatsApp IE argues that it is processing the minimum amount of information required
for the purpose pursued, which is the quick and efficient update of the WhatsApp contact list. It argues
that this is demonstrated by only accessing the phone numbers stored in the address book of a user’s
mobile phone, submitting it to the Lossy Hashing procedure and using that data exclusively for this
purpose.

238. Further, the EDPB notes that the objection by the HU SA stipulates a general approach on how the

updating of the WhatsApp contact list could be done using less personal data.

239. The EDPB considers that the file does not contain sufficient elements to allow the EDPB to establish
the existence of an infringement of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, in particular having regard to the purpose and
nature of the processing at issue. The EDPB recalls that each CSA has the possibility to submit to the
LSA a request for mutual assistance under Article 61 GDPR to ask that their concerns be addressed.

8 ON  THE  CORRECTIVE  MEASURES  DECIDED  BY THE  LSA -

IN
PARTICULAR, THE PROPOSED ORDER TO BRING PROCESSING INTO
COMPLIANCE

8.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

240. Among the proposed corrective measures, the Draft Decision includes an order to bring processing
operations into compliance, pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR. The aim of the order is to bring about
the required remedial action, in conjunction with the reprimand which serves to formally identify and
recognise the fact of infringement 251.

241. The order is set out in Appendix C of the Draft Decision and includes seven actions requiring WhatsApp
IE to provide information in compliance with Articles 12-14 GDPR as assessed in the Draft Decision. For

and 3.4.

each action, the deadline for compliance is set to a period of six months, commencing on the day
following the date of service of the order 252.

8.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

242. The HU SA objected to the six-month deadline for compliance specified in the order to bring processing
operations into compliance (Appendix C of the Draft Decision, hereinafter ‘compliance order’), which
the HU SA characterised as a “grace period”. The HU SA argued that the deadline for compliance is too
long  for  the  corrective  measure  to  be  considered  appropriate,  recalling  that  “the  applicable  legal
sanction must be chosen in a way for it to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive” 253, and that it
was not in line with Recital 148 GDPR which requires that the nature, gravity and consequences of the
infringement must be taken into account. In the present case, the HU SA considers in particular the
number of data subjects affected and the nature of the infringement pertinent. For this reason, the
HU SA argues that the Draft Decision should not have included a period of six months as a deadline for
compliance, or that it should have been shorter.

243.

In addition, with regard to the part of the proposed order in the Draft Decision relating to the provision
of  the  information  prescribed  by  Article  14  to  non-users 254,  the HU  SA also  raised  an  objection
whereby  it  argued  that  providing  the  information  on  WhatsApp’s  website  is  not  appropriate  for
providing information to non-users, since non-users may not know of the existence of the service and,
therefore, are not expected to look for the information on the website. As this objection also relates
to the Lossy Hashing procedure, it is summarised in Section 6.2 of the present decision.

244. The NL SA raised concerns in its objection that the Draft Decision seems to consider that only a slight
amendment of policies would suffice to remedy the infringement of Article 14 GDPR, whereas if non-
user data after the application of the Lossy Hashing procedure are found to be personal data, more
amendments  to  WhatsApp’s  privacy  policy  than  currently  envisaged  in  Appendix  C  of  the  Draft
Decision may  be  necessary  (see  paragraph 105 above - as this objection  also  relates  to the Lossy
Hashing procedure, it is summarised in Section 6.2 of the present decision).

245.

8.3 Position of the LSA on the objections
In its Composite Response, the IE SA considered that while an objection to the terms of an order is a
subject  matter  captured  by  the  scope  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR, the  objection  raised  by  the  HU  SA -
requesting to either remove or minimize the period of six months as a deadline for compliance - was
not “relevant and reasoned” 255.

246. On  the  merits  of  the  objections,  the  IE  SA  explained  that  it  had  initially  proposed  a  three-month
compliance deadline for all actions save for those in connection with non-users, for which a six-month
deadline  was  proposed.  The  IE  SA  added  that  “WhatsApp,  by  way  of  its  Supplemental  Draft
Submissions, explained that it could not make the required changes within the deadlines proposed” and
“[i]n light of WhatsApp’s position and the detailed explanations put forward by WhatsApp as to the
implementation timeframe, IE SA adjusted the deadlines for compliance proposed in the order to the
shortest deadline possible, by reference to the constraints identified by WhatsApp” 256.

247. The Composite Response summarises WhatsApp IE’s submissions on the initial proposal of a three-

month deadline for all actions save for those in connection to non-users as follows:

“…  the  implementation  of  changes  to  [WhatsApp’s]  Privacy  Policy  and  other  user  facing
information is an involved and resource intensive process that requires sufficient lead in time
for preparing the relevant changes, internal cross-functional engagement as well as of course
engagement  with  the  Supervision  Team  in  [IE  SA],  localisation  and  translation  of  the
information for countries in the European Region, and implementing technical changes in the
WhatsApp app across five different operating systems. Accordingly, and without prejudice to
WhatsApp’s position that it has not infringed [the] GDPR and that any order is unnecessary, if
[IE SA] was to require WhatsApp to make further changes over and above those it is voluntarily
aiming to make this year, WhatsApp would require at least six months to implement these
changes, with the ability for WhatsApp and [IE SA] to have potential flexibility around that
period in order, for example, to allow WhatsApp to engage with the Supervision Team in [IE SA]
as it usually does or deal with unforeseen technical issues” 257.

248. The  IE  SA  further  pointed  out  that “non-compliance  with  the  order  would  constitute  a  separate
infringement  of  the  GDPR  and  would  give  rise  to  the  risk  of  further  action  being  taken  against
WhatsApp. In the circumstances, it would be unfair for IE SA to impose an order, the terms of which
cannot be complied with by WhatsApp” 258.

249. While the final position taken by the IE SA was to not follow any of the objections 259, in the Composite
Response  the IE  SA  had  made  a  compromise  proposal  to  take  into  consideration  the  concerns
expressed by the HU SA in the follow-up of WhatsApp IE’s compliance with the actions set out in the
order. In particular, the IE SA stated that it would require that “the time line for implementation of the
order requires full compliance by WhatsApp within an absolute maximum timeframe of 6 months” and
it would include additional text in the order “to emphasise that the interests of data subjects require
expeditious implementation” and “that, in its supervision of implementation of the order, [it would] be
driving for early implementation and testing any assertions made by WhatsApp as to the relevant time
frames required in respect of each corrective implementation measure” 260.

8.4 Analysis of the EDPB

250.

8.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned
In its objection, the HU SA disagrees with the deadline for compliance provided for in the compliance
order (Appendix C of the Draft Decision) and thus concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft
decision  complies  with  the  GDPR” 261.  There  is  a  direct  connection  between  the objection  and  the
substance of the draft decision at issue, therefore the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

251. The HU SA sets out legal and factual arguments, namely the nature, gravity and consequences of the
infringement as well as the number of affected data subjects, as reasons for objecting to the deadline
for compliance. Further, the HU SA sets out their view on how the Draft Decision ought to be changed
(non-application or minimization of the period of six months as a deadline for compliance). The HU SA

argues that if the Draft Decision was not amended in this instance it would “[undermine] confidence in
the institution of data protection within the EU, which could cause a serious crisis of confidence among
the concerned data subjects” since the Draft Decision would lead to processing to continue a further 6
months under circumstances that “severely restricts the fundamental rights and freedoms of hundreds
of millions of EU citizens” 262, which demonstrates sufficiently clearly the significance of the risks posed
by the Draft Decision in the HU SA’s view. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned.

252. WhatsApp IE considers the objection neither relevant nor sufficiently reasoned to meet the threshold
of Article 4(24) GDPR. The arguments presented address the merits of the objection, not whether they
are relevant and reasoned 263, therefore the EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of whether
the Article 4(24) GDPR threshold itself is met.

253. The  EDPB  concludes  that  the  HU  SA’s  objection  on  the  deadline  for  compliance  is  relevant  and
reasoned. Additionally, the EDPB recalls that it concluded the same for what concerns the objection of
the HU SA raising the fact that it is not appropriate to provide information to non-users via the website
and the objection of the NL SA. Consequently, in the following section, the merits of these objections
will be assessed 264.

8.4.2 Assessment on the merits
8.4.2.1 On the deadline for compliance

254. The EDPB recalls Recital 129 GDPR on the exercise of powers by supervisory authorities, which recalls
the need to adopt measures that are appropriate, necessary and proportionate in accordance with the
circumstances of the case 265.

255. The EDPB notes that the HU SA argued that the deadline for compliance suggested in the Draft Decision
would not be in line with Recital 148 GDPR and more specifically with the need for the “applicable
legal sanction” to be “chosen in a way for it to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive”, taking into
account  the  nature,  gravity  and  consequences  of  the  infringement.  It  can  be  acknowledged - as
highlighted also by WhatsApp IE 266 - that this recital refers primarily to the imposition of penalties,

262 HU SA Objection, p. 7.
263 WhatsApp considers the objection “does not relate to specific legal and factual content in the Composite
Draft”, adding it is premised on unsubstantiated allegations towards WhatsApp. In addition, Whatsapp considers
the HU SA’s objection is not adequately reasoned because it “assumes (incorrectly) that WhatsApp Ireland is
unlawfully  processing  data”  and  also  because  “unsubstantiated  (and  incorrect)  claims  cannot  provide  an
adequate basis for an objection”. Further, WhatsApp’s deems the objection does not persuasively articulate how
the Draft Decision poses any risk – let alone significant risk – to data subjects, adding that to an extent the HU SA
“is making assertions of risk based on unsubstantiated claims of WhatsApp Ireland ‘processing data unlawfully’”.
See WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, 43.2 and 43.4.
WhatsApp’s  submission  goes  into  the  merits  of  the  objection,  while  not  refuting  that  the  HU  SA  objection
articulates  concerns  about  a  precise  part  of  the  Draft  Decision,  alleges  risks  attached  to  the  draft  decision
impacting data subjects, suggests a specific change to the draft decision and succinctly gives reasons why this is
warranted in the HU SA’s view. WhatsApp’s criticism of the wording in the HU SAs objection arguing the deadline
for compliance “is in serious breach of recital 148 of the GDPR” being illogical (WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions,
43.4 (B)), is immaterial in assessing whether objection as a whole (in this instance revolving around whether the
corrective measure is effective, proportionate and dissuasive) is reasoned.
264 See paragraph 132 and following and 135 and following respectively
265 Recital 129 GDPR states that : “[...] each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in
view of ensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case,
respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her
adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned.”

including  administrative  fines,  which  should  be  imposed  in  addition  to,  or  instead  of  appropriate
measures imposed by the SA.

256. Nevertheless, it can also be noticed that Recital 148 GDPR also refers, for instance, to the imposition
of a reprimand instead of a fine in case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would
constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person. Therefore, the indications provided by this
Recital can be relevant for the imposition of corrective measures in general and for the choice of the
combination  of  corrective  measures  that  is  appropriate  and  proportionate  to  the  infringement
committed.  Additionally,  the  need  for  the  corrective  measures  and  any  exercise  of  powers  by
supervisory authorities to be tailored to the specific case is more broadly expressed also by Recital 129
GDPR.

257. The  EDPB  takes  note  of  WhatsApp  IE’s  statement  that  “compliance  with  transparency  obligations
involves considerable  challenges,  particularly  for  controllers  who  have  to  explain  complex  data
processing to a wide variety of non-expert users in a way that is nonetheless concise, intelligible, and
easily accessible. This is particularly acute in WhatsApp Ireland’s case given the Service - which involves
a  variety  of  highly  technical  processes - is  used  by  a  broad  demographic”, and that the period for
compliance needs to be a time within which WhatsApp can actually comply 267. WhatsApp IE further
adds that “the implementation of changes to its Privacy Policy and other user facing information is an
involved and resource intensive process that requires sufficient lead in time for preparing the relevant
changes, internal cross-functional engagement as well as of course engagement with the Commission,
localisation and translation of the information for countries in the European Region, and implementing
technical changes in the WhatsApp app across five different operating systems” 268.

258. The EDPB notes that the HU SA’s objection refers to the number of data subjects affected and the
nature of the infringement, both of which are pertinent to determine the appropriate, necessary and
proportionate  deadline  for  the  order.  In  its  Draft  Decision,  the  IE  SA  explicitly  considers  the
significance, utility and function of the transparency obligation, as well as the number of data subjects
affected 269. However, the HU SA’s objection emphasises the need to remedy the infringements within
a  short  timeframe  in  light  of  their  nature,  gravity  and  consequences  in  terms  of  restricting  the
fundamental rights and freedoms of hundreds of millions of EU citizens.

259.

In light of the considerable number of individuals affected in the EU, the EDPB shares the concerns of
the  HU  SA  as  articulated  above,  highlighting  the  importance  of  the  interests  of  the  affected  data
subjects in seeing Articles 12 - 14 GDPR complied within a short timeframe. The EDPB takes note of
the challenges highlighted by WhatsApp IE when it comes to implementing changes to its privacy
policy, but in light of the circumstances of the case, in particular, due to the type of organisation, its
size and the means (including inter alia financial resources but also legal expertise) available to it, finds
of  primary  importance  that  compliance  with  transparency  obligations  is  ensured  in  the  shortest
timeframe  possible.  If  WhatsApp  IE  was  found  to  need  six months  to  update  its  Privacy  Policy  to
implement the LSA’s clear and specific requests, the SAs would be expected to allow for much longer
time  frames  for  any  smaller  organisation,  which,  in  the  view  of  the  EDPB,  is  not  appropriate  and
proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

260. Moreover, in the circumstances of the present case, the EDPB does not see how a compliance period

of three months could be considered disproportionate 270.

261. With respect to WhatsApp IE’s arguments as to the need for sufficient time to allow “engagement with
the Commission”, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s Draft Decision contains a comprehensive assessment,
guidance and commentary, sufficiently clear and precise to allow WhatsApp IE to fulfil its obligations
in accordance with the specific provisions on transparency (Articles 12-14 GDPR) and in view of the
accountability principle (Article 5(2) GDPR), with a minimum need to interact with the IE SA in order to
implement the request.

262. As regards the argument raised by the IE SA, relating to the fact that non-compliance with the order
would constitute a separate infringement of the GDPR and would give rise to the risk of further action
being taken against WhatsApp IE, although it is true that non-compliance with an order constitutes a
separate infringement of the GDPR (in accordance with Article 83(6) GDPR), it is speculative at this
stage whether this situation will occur.

263.

In light of the above, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is required to amend its Draft Decision to the
effect that the period of six months deadline for compliance is reduced to a period of three months.

8.4.2.2 On other issues concerning the order to bring processing into compliance

264. Regarding the objection of the HU SA raising the fact that it is not appropriate to provide information
to non-users via the website, the HU SA raises that including the information on WhatsApp’s website
is  not  the  “appropriate  method  of  providing  information”  since  non-users may  not  know  of  the
existence of the service and, therefore, are not expected to look for the information on the website.
Thus, WhatsApp IE “cannot prove [...] that non-users will learn about the privacy policy” 271.

265. The EDPB notes that the IE SA has taken into account in its Draft Decision that non-users are “unlikely
to have a reason to visit WhatsApp’s website” 272. Thus, according to the IE SA “WhatsApp should give
careful consideration to the location and placement of such a public notice so as to ensure that it is
discovered  and  accessed  by  as  wide  an  audience  of  non-users  as  possible” and that “the  non-user
transparency information must be presented separately (by way of a separate notice, or a separate
section within the existing Privacy Policy, or otherwise) to the user-facing transparency information so
as to ensure that it is as easy as possible for non-users to discover and access the information that
relates specifically to them" 273.

266. The EDPB acknowledges that many data subjects who do not make active use of WhatsApp services
might not visit WhatsApp’s website in order to retrieve information regarding the processing of non-
user  data.  However,  given  the  arguments  raised  and  that  the  Draft  Decision  already  instructs
WhatsApp IE to give careful consideration to the location of placement of the public notice to non-
users, the EDPB does not see the need to amend the Draft Decision. This is without prejudice to any
assessments the EDPB may be called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties,
taking into account the contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSA.

267.

In light of the above, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the
basis of the objection raised by the HU SA with respect to the order to provide the information to non-
users.

270 This is in line with the deadline for compliance initially proposed by the IE SA for actions related to user
data. IE SA Composite Response, paragraph 102.

268. With respect to the NL SA objection concerning the amendment of policies that would be necessary
for WhatsApp IE to remedy the infringement of Article 14 GDPR, the EDPB directs the IE SA to ensure
that the order to bring processing into compliance, to the extent that it covers the infringement of
Article 14 GDPR, clearly reflects the expanded scope of the infringement of this provision as described
in section 7.4.4.2 above (i.e. its connection also to non-user data after the application of the Lossy
Hashing procedure).

9 ON THE CORRECTIVE MEASURES - IN PARTICULAR, THE

ADMINISTRATIVE FINE

9.1 Preliminary matters: the turnover of the preceding financial year

9.1.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

269. After determining a proposed range for the fine amount, the Draft Decision turns to Article 83(5) GDPR,
which  sets  the maximum amount  of  any  fine  that  may  be  imposed  in  respect  of  certain  types  of
infringement 274. The notion of ‘undertaking’ is determined to encompass WhatsApp IE and Facebook,
Inc. Accordingly, the relevant fining “cap” is calculated by reference to the worldwide annual turnover
of the undertaking as a whole, rather than that of the controller or processor concerned. The Draft
Decision concludes that the fine proposed does not exceed the applicable fining “cap” prescribed by
Article  83(5)  GDPR,  calculated  with  reference  to  the  combined turnover  for  Facebook,  Inc.  and
WhatsApp IE for the year ending 31 December 2019 (estimated at approximately 

) 275.

9.1.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

270. The DE SA raised an objection concerning different aspects of how the Draft Decision approaches the

turnover figure of the preceding financial year in the present case.

271. Firstly, the DE SA considered that “[according] to the IV/2019 quarterly report, Facebook Inc.’s total
revenue was USD 70.7 billion. According to Recital 150 of the GDPR, the concept of undertakings laid
down in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU is relevant. Therefore, the doctrine of the Single Economic Unit must
be applied. Such an undertaking may consist of various legal persons. The overall turnover of the Single
Economic Unit is therefore key and reference point for assessing and determining whether a fine is
effective, proportionate and deterrent” 276. This objection considers that the Draft Decision should be
amended so that the turnover figure reflected in Part 4 is that of the entire Facebook group.

272. Secondly, the DE SA argued that the turnover figure reflected in Part 4 of the Draft Decision should be
amended to the turnover figure for the financial year ending 31 December 2020. The DE SA explained
that  the “[t]he  event  from  which  to  determine  the  “previous  year”  is  the  fining  decision  of  the
Supervisory Authority, not the event of infringement. The decision of the DPC is expected to be made in
2021. The previous financial year is therefore the calendar year 2020, so its values must be taken into
account. Key financial figures communicated by the group in the course of the year indicate that the
annual revenue for 2020 could be at least 15% higher than the annual revenue for 2019. Due to such

significant  differences  in  the  course of  the  year,  older  figures  cannot  be  used for  practical reasons
either” 277.

273. Finally, in its objection, the DE SA argued that the turnover figure should be taken into account for the
determination  of  the  fine  amount,  adding  that  “[t]he  high  annual  results  (profits)  and  the  high
profitability of the company are not taken into account discernibly when calculating the fines. However,
the sensitivity to punishment is significantly influenced by the level of returns and must be taken into
account in order to achieve the goal of specific deterrence. In our opinion, when it comes to setting an
effective fine within the meaning of Art. 83(1) GDPR, the sensitivity to punishment must be given a
fairly significant weight. This requirement is not sufficiently fulfilled in the draft decision” 278.

274. The DE SA noted that Facebook Group’s “expected annual global revenue of around USD 81 billion in
”, adding that referring to

2020 (USD 70.7 billion + 15%) is well above the estimated USD 
incorrect lower figures could impact the effectiveness of measures 279.

275.

9.1.3 Position of the LSA on the objections
In its Composite Response, the IE SA noted that the subject-matter of the objection concerning the
turnover of the preceding financial year is within the scope of Article 4(24) GDPR and considered it to
be relevant and reasoned 280.

276. While the final position taken by the IE SA was to not follow any of the objections 281, in the Composite
Response the IE SA agreed with the DE SA in relation to the application of the doctrine of the single
economic  unit  by  supervisory  authorities  when  administrative  fines  are  being  imposed  on  an
undertaking, pursuant to Article 83 and Recital 150 of the GDPR. Part 4 of the Draft Decision (paragraph
797) referred to the combined turnover of Facebook, Inc. and WhatsApp IE. The IE SA proposed to
“amend this figure to reflect the combined turnover of the entire Facebook, Inc. group of companies,
as required by the German (Federal) SA’s objection” 282.

277. On the application of the ‘preceding financial year’, the IE SA noted that in the present case, the Draft
Decision was circulated to the CSAs on 24 December 2020, therefore the IE SA could not have reflected
the 2020 turnover figure in the Draft Decision 283. The Draft Decision recorded the most up to date
financial information available at the date it was circulated to the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR
(“the date of commencement of the co-decision-making process”) 284. The IE SA added that the LSA “is
not permitted unilaterally to amend its draft decision once it has been circulated to the CSAs pursuant
to Article 60(3)” 285.

278.

In the Composite Response, the IE SA proposed the following approach: “To the extent necessary in
the  [Draft  Decision],  IE  SA  will  use  the  most  up  to  date  financial  information  for  the  purposes  of
calculating the proposed cap on the proposed penalty. That remains the turnover for the financial year
ending 31 December 2019. That figure will operate as a provisional estimate of the turnover for the
financial  year  ending  31 December 2020.  In  advance  of  the  final  decision,  IE  SA  will  obtain  from

WhatsApp the updated turnover figure for the financial year ending 31 December 2020. That figure will
be used to calculate the cap in the final decision. Accordingly, at the time that the final decision is
adopted, IE SA will apply the turnover figure for the year ending 31 December 2020 for the purpose of
its calculations in Part 4” 286.

279. On the matter of considering the turnover figure when determining the fine amount, the Composite
Response initially states that the “turnover figure is only relevant for the purposes of the fining cap”,
later  elaborating  that  “Article  83(2)  does  not  require  account  to  be  taken  of  the  turnover  of  the
undertaking concerned. In fact, turnover is primarily relevant to the calculation of the applicable fining
cap, pursuant to Articles 83(4) – (6). ). Increasing the turnover figure recorded in the Composite Draft
will not have any effect on the calculation of the fine itself in this case” 287.

280. With reference to the expected annual global revenue mentioned in the objection, the IE disagrees “to
the extent that the DE SA is suggesting that IE SA could and/or should identify the relevant turnover by
reference to assumptions and estimated figures [...]. As a statutory regulator, IE SA is required to adopt
an evidence-based approach to its decision-making and to adhere to, and apply, fair procedures. The
making or adoption of assumptions, particularly in relation to features of a decision-making process
that are prescribed by statute, is not consistent with the GDPR or the general obligation for statutory
decision-makers to conduct their inquiries in a fair and transparent manner” 288.

9.1.4 Analysis of the EDPB
9.1.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

281. The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application

of administrative fines 289.

282.

In its objection on the turnover of the preceding financial year as applied in the Draft Decision, the DE
SA considers that the Draft Decision should be amended with respect to the relevant turnover of the
undertaking, the determination of the preceding financial year and the consideration of the turnover
figure when calculating the fine 290. This objection concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft
decision complies with the GDPR” 291. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

283. The objection can also be deemed as reasoned, since the DE SA pointed out alleged mistakes in the
Draft Decision arising from the revenue figure used and the year considered, which in turn lead the
proposed  fine  to  not  fulfilling  its  purpose  as  a  corrective  measure.  The  change  proposed  by  the
objection aims to ensure that the fine is effective, dissuasive and proportionate, as required by Article
83(1) GDPR. WhatsApp IE’s position is that the DE SA’s objection is not sufficiently reasoned to meet
the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR, submitting that it (i) is unsupported by any substantiated legal
argument and (ii) does not demonstrate a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects 292. The EDPB
finds that the objection clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision
as it states that using the wrong revenue figure amounts to a dangerous precedent, jeopardising the

286 IE SA Composite Response, paragraph 64.b.iii. The final position of the IE SA was that of not following the
objections as clarified above in paragraph 13.

effectiveness of sanctions also for future cases 293. The EDPB considers that this objection raised by the
DE SA meets the threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR.

284.

In arguing that the DE SA’s objection is not reasoned, WhatsApp IE states that “turnover is relevant
only  to  determining  the  maximum  fine  that  can  be  lawfully  imposed  and  not  the  fine  amount”,
therefore the objection concerns only a theoretical maximum amount, which could “not entail a higher
fine so even if one would consider that there is a significant risk because the fine is not high enough
(which WhatsApp Ireland disputes)”294. The EDPB notes that there is a disagreement between the LSA
and CSA precisely about whether turnover is relevant only to determine the maximum fine that can be
lawfully  imposed,  or  whether  it  is  potentially  also  relevant  in  the  calculation  of  the  fine  amount.
Furthermore, the disagreement on the turnover figure could only be set aside as purely hypothetical
if:

- no additional infringements were included in any objections accepted as relevant and reasoned;
and also

- the calculation and amount of the fine were not included in any objections accepted as relevant and
reasoned.

285. The remaining arguments submitted by WhatsApp IE address the merits of the objections, not whether
they are relevant and reasoned 295, therefore the EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of
whether the Article 4(24) GDPR threshold itself is met.

9.1.4.2

Assessment on the merits

Determination of the relevant turnover of the undertaking

286. The DE SA raised an objection stating that as Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp IE were found to be the
undertaking by the LSA, the overall turnover of the single economic unit should be used in the context
of Article 83 GDPR, instead of the combined turnover of Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp IE only 296. While
the  final  position  taken  by  the  IE  SA  was to  not  follow  any  of  the objections 297,  in  its  Composite
Response the IE SA expressed its intention to amend this figure to reflect the combined turnover of
the entire Facebook, Inc. group of companies 298.

287. The EDPB notes that the IE SA had communicated their assessment of the notion of undertaking to
WhatsApp IE, including the application made in the context of Article 83 GDPR. The IE SA requested
WhatsApp IE to bring this matter to the attention of “any parent or controlling company as might be
required to fully address the matters raised’’ 299. WhatsApp IE confirmed having brought the IE SA’s
letter and their response to the attention of personnel at WhatsApp Inc. and Facebook, Inc. on a

293 DE SA Objection, p. 12-14 and 15-17.
294 For this reason “WhatsApp Ireland fails to see how this Objection clearly demonstrates the significance of
the risks posed by the Composite Draft given that only abstract and unsubstantiated risks have been identified
by the German (Federal) SA”. WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 30.3, 30.6 and 30.7
295 WhatsApp considers the reasons set out in the DE SA’s objection as either unsubstantiated in fact, incorrect
in law or irrelevant (WhatsApp Article 65  Submissions, paragraphs 29 and 30).  The EDPB understands these
considerations as arguments on the merits. WhatsApp’s submission does not refute that the DE SA objection
alleges risks attached to the draft decision impacting data subjects, suggests specific changes to the draft decision
and gives reasons why this is warranted in the DE SA’s view.

voluntary basis, noting that neither WhatsApp Inc. nor Facebook, Inc. are parties to the Inquiry 300.
WhatsApp IE expressed the view that “the relevant ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Articles 83(4) to
(6)  GDPR  is  WhatsApp  Ireland  alone”, adding that it “disagrees  with  the  [IE  SA]’s  approach  to  the
assessment of whether an entity is in a position to exercise ‘decisive influence’ over WhatsApp Ireland’s
‘behaviour  on  the  market’  in  the  context  of  the  GDPR” 301.  WhatsApp  IE  put  forward  that  the
interpretation and application of competition law concepts of “undertaking” and “decisive influence”
over “conduct on the market” in the very different statutory context of the GDPR raises questions likely
to require judicial consideration 302.

288. While the qualification of Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp IE as a single undertaking is not contested by
the DE SA, the EDPB notes however that there is a disagreement between the LSA and the CSA on the
amount of the turnover to be taken into account for this single economic unit.

289. On this specific issue, and in accordance with Recital 150 GDPR, the EDPB considers the case law of the
CJEU in the field of competition law relevant when assessing the turnover to be taken into account in
the context of Article 83 GDPR, in particular for the verification of the upper limit of the amount of the
fine under Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR.

290. Firstly, according to established case law of the CJEU and as recalled by the IE SA in its Draft Decision 303,
when a parent company and its subsidiary are found to form a single undertaking within the meaning
of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, this means that the conduct of the subsidiary may be imputed to the
parent  company,  without  having  to  establish  the  personal  involvement  of  the  latter in  the
infringement. In particular, the parent company may be held liable for the fine 304.

291. Secondly, the  CJEU  has  ruled  that  when  a  parent  company  and  its  subsidiary  form  the  single
undertaking that has been found liable for the infringement committed by the subsidiary, the total
turnover of its component companies determines the financial capacity of the single undertaking in
question 305. With regards to the parent company at the head of a group, the CJEU specified that
consolidated accounts of the parent company are relevant to determine its turnover 306. In the present
case, this implies the consolidated turnover of the group headed by Facebook Inc. is relevant.

292.

In light of the above and bearing in mind that the IE SA qualified Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp IE as a
single  undertaking  in  the  Draft  Decision,  the  EDPB  decides  that  the  IE  SA  should  amend  its  Draft
Decision in order to take into account the total turnover of all the component companies of the single
undertaking for the purpose of Article 83 GDPR.

293. On the disagreement between the IE SA and DE SA concerning the role the turnover figure might play
when  calculating  the  fine amount,  the  EDPB  notes  that  this  matter  is  inextricably  linked  with the
objections revolving around the effective, dissuasive and proportionate nature of the fine pursuant
Article 83(1) GDPR. The merits of this aspect of the DE SA’s objection are therefore assessed below in
section 9.3.4.2 307.

Preceding financial year

294. The EDPB notes that the IE SA takes into account, for the calculation of the fine, the global annual
turnover in the financial year preceding its Draft Decision 308. In this respect, the DE SA argues that the
financial year that should be taken into account is that preceding the final decision of the LSA 309. Since
there is no dispute on the fact that the expression “preceding financial year” refers to the decision of
the LSA, the EDPB will therefore focus its assessment on whether such decision shall be the draft or
the final one.

295.

In the field of competition law, the CJEU has clarified the meaning of “preceding business year” with
regards  to  the  power  granted  to  the  European  Commission  to  impose  fines  on  undertakings  in
application of Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003 310. As a rule, the maximum amount of the fine “should
be calculated on the basis of the turnover in the business year preceding the [European] Commission
decision” 311.

296. The IE SA points out that in terms of the one-stop-shop procedure, the “LSA is not a sole decision-
maker; rather, it is required to engage with CSAs via the process outlined in Article 60 of the GDPR. That
process prescribes consultation periods and a further mechanism for the resolution of disagreements
on  which  consensus  cannot  be  reached.  The  practical  consequence  of  this  is  the  potential  for  the
significant passage of time between the original circulation of the LSA’s draft decision and the adoption
of  the  final  decision” 312.  The  EDPB  concedes  the  one-stop-shop  procedure  of  Article  60  GDPR  is
different from the procedure applicable to the European Commission in the field of competition law.
However, in both cases it is true that the fine comes into being only at one point in time, namely when
the final decision is issued.

297. At  the  same  time,  the  LSA  is  required  to  circulate  a  complete  draft  decision,  including  where
appropriate a fine amount, when it launches the consultation procedure in accordance with Article
60(3) GDPR. The IE SA proposed to maintain in its Draft Decision a reference to the turnover for the

year preceding the decision of the European Commission to impose fine does not provide any useful indication
as to the actual economic situation of the undertaking concerned and the appropriate level of fine to impose on
that undertaking. In such a situation, the European Commission is entitled to refer to another business year in
order to be able to make a correct assessment of the financial resources of that undertaking and to ensure that
the fine has a sufficient and proportionate deterrent effect. See 1. garantovaná a.s. v. European Commission

financial year ending 31 December 2019, which was the most up to date financial information available
to determine the relevant turnover, at the time the draft decision was circulated to the CSAs pursuant
to Article 60(3) GDPR. The IE SA further elaborated that “[that] figure will operate as a provisional
estimate  of  the  turnover  for  the  financial  year  ending  31  December  2020.  In  advance  of  the  final
decision, IE SA will obtain from WhatsApp the updated turnover figure for the financial year ending 31
December 2020. That figure will be used to calculate the cap in the final decision. Accordingly, at the
time that  the  final  decision  is  adopted,  IE  SA  will  apply  the  turnover  figure  for  the  year  ending 31
December 2020 for the purpose of its calculations in Part 4” 313.

298.

In light of the above, the EDPB decides that the date of the final decision taken by the LSA pursuant to
Article 65(6) GDPR, is the event from which the preceding financial year should be considered. The
EDPB agrees with the approach taken by the IE SA for the present case to include in the draft decision
a provisional turnover figure based on the most up to date financial information available at the time
of circulation to the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR 314.

9.2 The interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR

9.2.1 Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision

299. When assessing the fine, the IE SA considered that the infringements concern simultaneous breaches
of Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR in the context of the same set of processing operations. Therefore, and
by reference to Article 83(3) GDPR, the IE SA stated in the Draft Decision that the amount of any
consequent fine cannot exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement. The IE SA considers
the  infringement  of  Article  14  GDPR  in  the  context  of  non-users  to  be  the  gravest  of  the  three
infringements. For this reason the IE SA decided to impose only a fine for the infringement of Article
14 GDPR, noting that the fine to be imposed is limited to the maximum amount specified for the
infringement of Article 14 GDPR 315.

9.2.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

300. The DE SA raised an objection regarding the IE SA’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR. According to
the DE SA, the IE SA’s approach is not in line with the intention of the legislator, since its result is that
less serious infringements are factually rejected and only the most serious infringement is sanctioned;
although the fine itself may only be calculated based on the legal maximum of the highest fining tier,
the offender should still be explicitly found guilty of having infringed several provisions, since not
finding the offender guilty of the other provisions infringed has an adverse effect on the effective
protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.

***

301. The FR  SA raised  an  objection  concerning  the  calculation  of  fines  in  the  case  of  concurrent
infringements. According to the FR SA, Article 83(3) GDPR refers to the "total" amount of the fine,
resulting from the addition of several amounts, whereas the consequence of the reading proposed by
the IE SA is that the fine imposed on an organisation that has committed several breaches is similar to
the fine which would be imposed in case of only one breach. The FR SA adds that the Draft Decision

objections as clarified above in paragraph 13.
314 Article 60(6) GDPR, providing that the LSA and CSA are bound by the draft decision on which they (are
deemed to) agree, in any case does not apply to the present situation.

Adopted

implies  that  the  multiplicity  of  violations  committed  would never  be  taken  into  account  when
determining the severity of the fine imposed.

***

302. Finally, the PT SA argues that the word "specified" in Article 83(3) GDPR refers to the maximum fine
amount for the most serious breach abstractly provided for in the GDPR. The IE SA’s interpretation
resulted in the elimination of two fines and imposing only the third. However, in the event of several
infringements, several fines should be applied even if the overall amount of the fines altogether shall
not exceed the maximum limit prescribed by the GDPR for the most serious frame of those which can
be mobilised for each infringement found.

9.2.3 Position of the LSA on the objections

303. While the final position of the IE SA was that of not following the objections, it considers all three
objections to be captured by the scope of Article 4(24) GDPR and views them to be sufficiently relevant
and reasoned for the purpose of Article 4(24) GDPR. The IE SA notes, however, that there is no agreed
position,  at  EDPB  level,  as  to  the  manner  in  which  Article  83(3)  GDPR  should  be  interpreted  and
applied.  The  IE  SA  further  argues  that  the  manner  in  which  other  supervisory  authorities  have
interpreted  and  applied  this  provision,  in  the  context  of  earlier  Article  60  GDPR  decisions,  varies
significantly 316. The IE SA argues that the literal meaning as well as the purpose of Article 83(3) GDPR
supports their interpretation of the provision 317. The IE SA argues that the wording suggests that the
assessment of whether to impose a fine, and of the amount of any fine, must be carried out in respect
of each individual infringement that has been found to have occurred in any given inquiry 318. The IE
SA considers that the assessment of the gravity of the infringement should not be done in an abstract
manner  (by  reference  to  the  placement  of  the  infringement  within  the  Article  83(4)/(5)  GDPR
hierarchy) but rather by taking into account the individual circumstances of the case in relation to
Article 83(2)(a) GDPR 319. The IE SA argues that, if Article 83(3) were intended as another provision on
the maximum fine amount, to apply in complex scenarios, it would have been placed by the legislator
after Art. 83(4)-(5) GDPR instead of before 320.

304. As regards the shared concern of the DE, FR and PT SAs that the approach favoured by the IE SA would
“limit  the  possible  maximum  amount  of  the  total  fine  in  a  disproportionate  way”,  hamper  the
“imposition of dissuasive fines” or “largely amputate” the high level of sanctions provided for by the
GDPR, the IE SA argues that Article 83(3) GDPR is limited in its application and will not apply to every
single case in which multiple infringements are found to have occurred, but only to those cases where
multiple infringements have arisen from “the same or linked processing operations” 321.

305. The IE SA also argued that there is an overarching requirement on a supervisory authority, pursuant to
Article 83(1) GDPR, to ensure that “the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to [Article 83 GDPR]
in respect of infringements of [the GDPR] … shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and
dissuasive” 322. This means that supervisory authorities, regardless of what approach is taken to Article
83(3) GDPR, must always ensure that the resulting fine is, in each case, “effective, proportionate and

dissuasive” 323.  The  IE  SA  recalled  that  the  legislator  afforded  supervisory  authorities  considerable
freedom, within the framework prescribed by Article 83(2) GDPR, to weigh up and quantify what level
of  fine  would  satisfy  the  requirement  for  the  resulting  fine  to  be  “effective,  proportionate  and
dissuasive” in any given case 324.

306. According to the IE SA, just as it is possible for a fine to be decreased because (either in and of itself,
or  when  combined  with  other  fines)  it  is  considered  by  the  supervisory  authority  to  be
disproportionately high, a supervisory authority has the freedom to increase any proposed fine that it
considers is too low to be effective or dissuasive in the circumstances. The approach favoured by the
IE SA does not limit the ability of the supervisory authority to increase or decrease any proposed fine
if,  in  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  case,  it  is  unlikely  to  be  effective,  proportionate  and
dissuasive 325.

307. Further, the IE SA noted that the legislator, by way of Article 58(2) GDPR, has conferred a wide range
of corrective powers on SAs. Article 58(2)(i) GDPR makes it clear that an administrative fine can be
imposed “in addition to, or instead of” the other available measures. This leaves room for an SA to
consider the imposition of other measures (such as a ban on processing) in addition to a fine, in a case
where the SA might have doubts as to the deterrent value of a proposed fine 326.

308. The IE SA therefore did not make any proposal for compromise in its Composite Response as, while it
acknowledged the concerns raised by the DE, FR and PT SAs, it argued that its analysis of Article 83(3)
GDPR already takes account of the rationale underlying those concerns 327.

309. With regard to the DE SA’s objection, the IE SA noted that the suggestion that the IE SA’s approach
results  in  the  “factual  rejection”  of  certain  infringements  is  in  its  view  not  correct:  the  proposed
findings of several infringements of the GDPR “are not in any way affected by IE SA’s approach to Article
83(3) GDPR, which is directed only to the determination of the administrative fine to be imposed” 328.

9.2.4 Analysis of the EDPB
9.2.4.1

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

310. The DE SA’s objection concerning the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR is relevant in that it concerns
the compliance of the envisaged action with the GDPR. The EDPB also deems the objection to be
reasoned, since the DE SA argues an alleged misinterpretation of the relevant provision, in particular
pointing out the intention of the legislator to fully penalise infringements. Furthermore, the objection
demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision to the fundamental rights and
freedoms  of  data  subjects.  In  particular,  the  DE  SA  highlights  that  the  Draft  Decision  creates a
dangerous  precedent  as  other  controllers  could  also  demand  further  violations  to  be  ignored  by
supervisory authorities. As a result, the effectiveness of measures and sanctions would be far lower
for future cases, resulting in a significant risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
subjects concerned.

311. The FR SA’s objection concerning the infringement of Article 83(3) GDPR is relevant since a change of
the method of calculation would result in each of the infringements identified to be fined. The EDPB
also considers the objection reasoned as it points out that the Draft Decision would impose a penalty
on only one of the three breaches observed, thus lowering the level of administrative fines and thereby

reducing the corrective powers of SAs and consequently their ability to ensure the effective respect of
the protection of personal data.

312. Finally, the EDPB also considers the PT SA’s objection concerning the infringement of Article 83(3)
GDPR to be relevant as the suggested change on the interpretation of such article would result in the
imposition of a fine for each of the infringements identified. Furthermore, the PT SA states that an
effective implementation of the GDPR requires that the sanctioning regime of the GDPR must not be
undermined and that the deterrent effect of the fine would lose a good part of its effectiveness if in
cases of multiple infringements, only the maximum limit specifically established for one of the offences
is applied. The EDPB regards that such deterrent effect of administrative fines can ensure compliance
with the GDPR thus contributing to a high level of protection for the rights and freedoms of concerned
data subjects.

313. WhatsApp  IE  considers  all  the  objections  concerning  the  interpretation  of  Article  83(3)  GDPR  not
adequately reasoned and also argues that they do not meet the significant risk threshold of Article
4(24) GDPR. Regarding the reasoning of the objections in this subsection, WhatsApp IE argues that
none of them provide enough elaboration or reasoning to support a different interpretation of Article
83(3) GDPR than the one of the IE SA, suggesting such interpretations would be contrary to the literal
meaning of Article 83(3) GDPR 329.

314. With regard to the status of all the objections analysed in this subsection, the EDPB considers them to
be  adequately  reasoned  and  recalls  that  the assessment  of  the  merits  of  the  objection  is  made
separately, after it has been established that the objection satisfies the requirements of Article 4(24)
GDPR 330. Regarding  the  arguments  presented  that  address  the  merits  of  the  objection,  the  EDPB
considers those below in section 9.2.4.2.

9.2.4.2

Assessment on the merits

315. All CSAs argued in their respective objections that not taking into account infringements other than
the “gravest infringement” is not in line with their interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, as this would
result in a situation where WhatsApp IE is fined in the same way for one infringement as it would be
for several infringements. On the other hand, as explained above, the IE SA argued that the assessment
of  whether  to  impose  a  fine,  and  of  the  amount  thereof,  must  be  carried  out  in  respect  of  each
individual infringement found 331 and the assessment of the gravity of the infringement should be done
by taking into account the individual circumstances of the case 332.  The IE SA decided to impose only
a  fine  for  the  infringement  of  Article  14  GDPR,  considering  it  to  be  the  gravest  of  the  three
infringements 333.

316. The  EDPB  notes  that  the  IE  SA  identified  several infringements  in  the  Draft  Decision  for  which  it
specified fines, namely infringements of Article 12, 13 and 14 GDPR 334, and then applied Article 83(3)
GDPR.

317. Furthermore, the EDPB notes that WhatsApp IE agreed with the approach of the IE SA concerning the
interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR 335. In its submissions on the objections, WhatsApp IE also raised
that  the  approach  of  the  IE  SA  did  not  lead  to  a  restriction  of  the  IE  SA’s  ability  to  find  other

infringements of other provisions of the GDPR or of its ability to impose a very significant fine 336.
WhatsApp IE argued that the alternative interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR suggested by the CSAs is
not consistent with the text and structure of Article 83 GDPR and expressed support for the IE SA’s
literal and purposive interpretation of the provision 337.

318.

In this case, the issue that the EDPB is called upon to decide is how the calculation of the fine is
influenced by the finding of several infringements under Article 83(3) GDPR.

319. Article 83(3) GDPR reads that if “a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same or
linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the
administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement.”

320. First of all, it has to be noted that Article 83(3) GDPR is limited in its application and will not apply to
every single case in which multiple infringements are found to have occurred, but only to those cases
where multiple infringements have arisen from “the same or linked processing operations”.

321. The  EDPB  highlights  that  the  overarching  purpose  of  Article  83  GDPR  is  to  ensure  that  for  each
individual case, the imposition of an administrative fine in respect of an infringement of the GDPR is
to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In the view of the EDPB, the ability of SAs to impose such
deterrent fines highly contributes to enforcement and therefore to compliance with the GDPR.

322. As regards the interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR, the EDPB points out that the effet utile principle
requires all institutions to give full force and effect to EU law 338.  The EDPB considers that the approach
pursued  by  the  IE  SA  would  not  give  full  force  and  effect  to  the  enforcement  and  therefore  to
compliance with the GDPR, and would not be in line with the aforementioned purpose of Article 83
GDPR.

323.

Indeed,  the  approach  pursued  by  the  IE  SA  would  lead  to  a  situation  where,  in  cases  of  several
infringements of the GDPR concerning the same or linked processing operations, the fine would always
correspond  to  the  same  amount  that  would  be  identified,  had  the  controller  or  processor  only
committed one – the gravest – infringement. The other infringements would be discarded with regard
to calculating the fine. In other words, it would not matter if a controller committed one or numerous
infringements of the GDPR, as only one single infringement, the gravest infringement, would be taken
into account when assessing the fine.

324. With regard to the meaning of Article 83(3) GDPR the EDPB, bearing in mind the views expressed by
the  CSAs,  notes  that  in  the  event  of  several  infringements,  several  amounts  can  be  determined.
However, the total amount cannot exceed a maximum limit prescribed, in the abstract, by the GDPR.
More specifically, the wording  “amount  specified  for  the  gravest  infringement”  refers  to  the  legal
maximums of fines under Articles 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR. The EDPB notes that the Guidelines on the
application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679 339 state
that the "occurrence of several different infringements committed together in any particular single case
means  that  the  supervisory  authority  is  able  to  apply  the  administrative  fines  at  a  level  which  is
effective, proportionate and dissuasive within the limit of the gravest infringement" 340. The guidelines

include an example of an infringement of Article 8 and Article 12 GDPR and refer to the possibility for
the SA to apply the corrective measure within the limit set out for the gravest infringement, i.e. in the
example the limits of Article 83(5) GDPR.

325. The wording “total amount” also alludes to the interpretation described above. The EDPB notes that
the  legislator  did  not  include  in  Article 83(3)  GDPR  that  the  amount of  the  fine  for  several  linked
infringements should be (exactly) the fine specified for the gravest infringement. The wording “total
amount” in this regard already implies that other infringements have to be taken into account when
assessing the amount of the fine. This is notwithstanding the duty on the SA imposing the fine to take
into account the proportionality of the fine.

326. Although the fine itself may not exceed the legal maximum of the highest fining tier, the offender shall
still be explicitly found guilty of having infringed several provisions and these infringements have to be
taken into account when assessing the amount of the final fine that is to be imposed. Therefore, while
the legal maximum of the fine is set by the gravest infringement with regard to Articles 83(4) and (5)
GDPR, other infringements cannot be discarded but have to be taken into account when calculating
the fine.

327.

In light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the
objections raised by the DE SA, FR SA and PT SA with respect to Article 83(3) GDPR and to also take
into account the other infringements – in addition to the gravest infringement – when calculating the
fine, subject to the criteria of Article 83(1) GDPR of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness.

duration of the infringement, as per Article 83(2)(a) GDPR 342.
In terms of nature, the infringement at the heart of the Inquiry concerns the right to information,
which the IE SA asserts is the cornerstone of the rights of the data subject, adding that “the provision
of  the  information  concerned  goes  to  the  very  heart  of  the  fundamental  right  of  the  individual  to
protection of his/her personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to
share his/her personal data in a voluntary situation such as this” 343.
In terms of gravity, the IE SA takes into account a very significant level of non-compliance with the
prescribed information, referring to the finding that none of the information prescribed by Article 14
GDPR has been provided to data subjects who are “non-users” and the finding of wholly insufficient
information provided to data subjects who are users of WhatsApp’s service 344.

In terms of duration of the infringement, the IE SA takes into account the period of infringement
occurring  from  25  May  2018  onwards,  noting  the  Privacy  Policy  under  investigation  bears  a  “last
modified” date of 24 April 2018 345.

333. The Draft Decision considered that in terms of nature, scope and purposes of the processing that “the
processing of personal data by WhatsApp, in the context of both users and non-users, is not extensive”,
adding that purpose of the processing is directed towards achieving connectivity for users. The IE SA
finds  that  this  factor  does  not  operate  to  mitigate  against  the  infringement  of  the  right  to  be
informed 346.

335.

334. The  Draft  Decision  also  took  into  account  the number  of  data  subjects  affected and the  level  of
damage suffered by them by concluding that a very high number of data subjects were affected as
user of the service and an extremely high number of data subjects were affected as non-users 347.
In relation to the intentional or negligent character of the infringements, as per Article 83(2)(b) GDPR,
the  IE  SA  concluded  in  its  Draft  Decision  that  they  ought  to  be  classified  as negligent. The  IE  SA
considered that the Article 14 GDPR infringement demonstrated a high degree of negligence, and took
it into account as an aggravating factor for the purpose of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment. With
regard to the Articles 12 and 13 GDPR infringements, the IE SA noted that for “an organisation of
WhatsApp’s size, reach and available internal and external resources, the failure to achieve the required
standard  of  transparency  is,  in  my  view,  negligent”,  which  reflected  carelessness  on  the  part  of
WhatsApp IE 348.
In relation to the degree of responsibility for the controller or processor, as per Article 83(2)(d) GDPR,
the Draft Decision considered the total failure to provide the required information to data subjects in
the  case  of  non-users  a  further  aggravating  factor.  In  relation  to  the  Articles  12  and  13  GDPR
infringements the Draft Decision finds that “[w]hile the provision of 59% of the prescribed information
to users mitigates the position somewhat [...] WhatsApp fell significantly short of what it might have
been expected to do” 349.

336.

337. With regard to other aggravating or mitigating factors, as per Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, the Draft Decision
assesses  in  particular  the  potential  impact  that  a  more  transparent  approach  could  have  on  the
continued growth of WhatsApp IE’s user base. The IE SA notes that, in the Supplemental Draft, it
considered that “a more transparent approach to the Contact Feature would represent a risk factor for
the continued growth of WhatsApp’s user base” 350. However, given the explanations provided in the
WhatsApp  Supplemental Draft  Submissions,  the  IE SA  considers that “neither  I  nor  WhatsApp  can
know, until the contingent event has happened, which one of us is correct in our belief as to the likely
impact  [...]  of  a  more  transparent  approach” 351.  Thus,  the  IE  SA  concludes  that  it  is  “unable  to
determine such impact and, therefore, it is neither an aggravating factor nor a mitigating one” 352.

between the LSA and the CSAs 353.

The application of the criteria under Article 83(1) GDPR

339. The Draft Decision explains how the IE SA considered the principles of effectiveness, proportionality
and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1) GDPR) each in turn. The Draft Decision considered that for any fine
to be “effective”, it must reflect the circumstances of the individual case 354. Further, the Draft Decision
considered that in order for a fine to be “dissuasive”, it must dissuade both the controller/processor
concerned  as  well  as  other  controllers/processors  carrying  out  similar  processing  operations  from
repeating  the  conduct  concerned 355.  Finally,  as  regards  the  requirement  for  any  fine  to  be
“proportionate”, the Draft Decision states the need to “adjust the quantum of any proposed fine to the
minimum amount necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR” 356. The Draft Decision also
stated that the fines proposed “do not exceed what is necessary to enforce compliance with the GDPR,
taking into account the size of WhatsApp’s user base, the impact of the Infringements (individually and
collectively) on the effectiveness of the data subject rights enshrined in Chapter III of the GDPR and the
importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR and, indeed, the scheme of EU law, as a whole,
which makes the right to protection of one’s personal data a Charter-protected and Treaty-protected
right” 357.

340. The IE SA proposes in the Draft Decision to impose an administrative fine within the range of 30 million

- 50 million euro 358.

9.3.2 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

341. The DE SA raised an objection arguing that the fine proposed by the LSA is “hardly noticeable for the
undertaking” and “does not meet the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR of being effective, dissuasive
and proportionate” 359.

342. More  specifically,  the  DE  SA  argued  that  the  fine  is  not  dissuasive.  The  objection  recalled that  a
sanction can be deemed effective and dissuasive if it is suitable both as a general preventive measure
- to deter the other controllers from committing infringements - and as a special preventive measure

353 Any action taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects, as per Article 83(2)(c)
GDPR, is discussed in paragraphs 700-704 of the  Draft Decision. Any relevant previous infringements by the
controller or processor, as per Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, is discussed in paragraphs 712-714 of the Draft Decision.
The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, as per Article 83(2)(f), is discussed in paragraphs 715-
719 of the Draft Decision. The categories of personal data affected by the infringement, as per Article 83(2)(g) is
discussed in paragraph 720 of the Draft Decision. The manner in which the infringement became known to the
supervisory authority, as per Article 83(2)(h) GDPR, is discussed in paragraphs 721-724 of the Draft Decision.
Where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor
concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures, as per Article 83(2)(i) GDPR,
is discussed in paragraphs 725-727 of the Draft Decision. Adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to
Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42, as per Article 83(2)(j) GDPR, is discussed
in  paragraphs  728-730  of  the  Draft  Decision.  Any  other  aggravating  or  mitigating  factor  applicable  to  the
circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the
infringement, as per Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, is discussed in paragraphs 731-745 of the Draft Decision.

- to deter the specific controller from committing further infringements. The DE SA expresses the
concern that other controllers will orientate their compliance with data protection law taking into
account the amount of the fine levied in the present case and may conclude that even total disrespect
of data protection laws would not lead to significant administrative fines. The DE SA further argues
that the sensitivity to punishment, which is influenced by the level of return of the company, must be
given a fairly significant weight.

343. The DE SA goes on to argue that the financial capacity of an undertaking (in terms of turnover and
profit) provides an important indication of the amounts required to achieve dissuasiveness. In the
present case, the DE SA argues the turnover and profits of the Facebook Group undertaking is such
that it could easily absorb “several fines with comparable amounts before rentability shrinks by even
1 percentage point” 360. The DE SA notes the Facebook Group is an undertaking driven by processing
personal  data.  The  DE  SA  highlights  that  the  fine  must  have  a  dissuasive  effect,  particularly  it  is
necessary to issue a fine that has noticeable impacts on the profits of the undertaking, ensuring that
future fines for infringements of data protection law would not be “discounted” into the processing
performed by the undertaking. In this respect, the DE SA deems an impact of at least several percent
of the annual profit as necessary, not an “impact” in the “low per mille range”, as envisaged in the
Draft Decision, and questions the proposed imposition of a fine that is significantly behind the legal
maximum and corresponding to such a low percentage of the revenue.

344. Finally, the DE SA disagrees with the weighting given to the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR in the
calculation of the fine proposed by the IE SA. The DE SA considers the Draft Decision recognises only
limited  mitigating  factors,  while  finding  there  to  be  a  very  significant  level  of  non-compliance 361
affecting  a  large  number  of  data  subjects (326  million  users  plus  125 million  non-users  are
concerned 362). For these reasons, the DE SA deems a fine in the upper range of the possible level of
4% of the previous year’s revenue would be expected.

***

345. The PL SA raised an objection stating that the amount of the administrative fine proposed in the Draft
Decision is insufficient and should not be expressed as a range, but rather as a fixed sum. The objection
claims that the range of €30-50 million in the draft decision was modelled by the DPC in light of a fine
imposed on Google by the FR SA in 2019. Therefore, the PL SA is of the opinion that the fine issued by
the IE SA did not take into consideration the differing factual and legal contexts of the present case. In
addition,  the PL  SA  considered  the  proposed  fine  to  be  too  low, taking  into  account  the  affected
number of both WhatsApp’ users and non-users, as well as the impact of the infringements. Therefore,
the PL SA concluded that the proposed fine issued in the Draft Decision did not fulfil the GDPR-required
standards of effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence of administrative fines.

***

346. The HU SA raised an objection stating that the Draft Decision does not appropriately address the
intentional character of the infringement. The HU SA argues that the behaviour of WhatsApp IE should
be considered intentional, on the basis of the criteria of knowledge and wilfulness established in the
Guidelines on Administrative Fines. The HU SA draws an analogy with the example provided in the
Guidelines regarding the trade of personal data for marketing purposes and considers that “it is not a

coincidence  that  [WhatsApp]  collects  personal  data,  but  a  conscious  decision  to  gain  profit” and,
therefore,  the  provision  of  incomplete  information  to  data  subjects  is “presumably  based  on  an
intentional decision” 363. In the view of the HU SA, the inconsistency of whether to use personal data
for profiling and targeted advertising also supports the fact that WhatsApp IE acted in bad faith. The
HU SA goes on to argue that the Draft Decision is self-contradictory in this regard, since it considers
that WhatsApp IE acted in good faith, while at the same time it recognises that “a more transparent
approach to the Contact Feature would represent a risk factor for the continued growth of WhatsApp’s
user base” 364. Therefore, the HU SA considers that WhatsApp IE can clearly see a risk in fully informing
data subjects and could intentionally decide to provide incomplete information.
In its objection, the HU SA also considers that the proposed fine is ineffective, disproportionate and
non-dissuasive, given their view on the intentional character of the infringement, the non-transparent
profiling  of  natural  persons,  the  number  of  data  subjects  affected,  the  lengthy  duration  of  the
infringement and the seriousness of the case and its impact for the rights of data subjects. The HU SA
also contests the comparison drawn in the Draft Decision with the FR SA’s decision against Google LLC,
and considers that, in this case, the number of data subjects affected is significantly higher. For these
reasons, the fine should be closer to the 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover.

347.

***

348. The IT SA raised an objection whereby it considered that some of the elements underpinning the
calculation of the fine proposed by the IE SA were not appropriately addressed 365. Firstly, with regard
to the character of the infringement, the IT SA argues that the elements taken into account by the IE
SA would point to considering that the conduct of WhatsApp IE may not be regarded merely to be
negligent. In particular, the IT SA points to a previous inquiry of the NL SA, referred to in the Draft
Decision 366, which concluded that non-users’ data were to be regarded as personal data. Given that
the notion of personal data has not changed since, the IT SA considers that “WhatsApp was fully aware
– well in advance of the entry into force of the GDPR and prior to the changes made in 2018 to its
privacy policy – that the data in question could be classed as personal and therefore were subject to
the requirement of unambiguous, appropriate information” 367. The IT SA further argues that, in case
that there are no sufficient elements to consider WhatsApp IE’s conduct intentional, they should be
taken into account in assessing its degree of responsibility.

349. Concerning the aggravating factors, the objection raised by the IT SA points out that the IE SA does not
maintain in the Draft Decision, as an aggravating factor, the conclusion in the Final Report on the
relationship between transparency and the impact on WhatsApp’s policies aimed at increasing the
number of service users. In this respect, the IT SA considers that, “media reports have shown [...] that
the changes to the privacy policy introduced unilaterally by WhatsApp are producing exactly the effects
mentioned  by  the  IE  SA  in  its  Final  Report” 368. Additionally,  the  IT  SA  considers  that  WhatsApp’s
decision to delay the application of the new privacy policy is proof of WhatsApp’s concerns on the
negative impact. Thus, the objection of the IT SA considers that the two factors raised should be given
a different weight, consequently increasing the amount of the fine.

9.3.3 Position of the LSA on the objections
In  its  Composite  Response,  the  IE  SA  noted  that  the  subject-matter  of  objections  related  to  the
weighing  of  the  Article  83(2)  GDPR  criteria  are  within  the  scope  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR.  The  IE  SA
considers  however,  that  the  DE,  HU,  PL,  IT  SA’s  objections  are  not  sufficiently  reasoned  or  the
accompanying reasoning is unsound. Thus, the IE SA does not consider any of these objections to meet
the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR 369.

351. Regarding the objection raised by the HU SA on the characterisation of the infringements, the IE SA
first clarifies that the question of financial gain was not considered as part of the assessment on the
character of the infringement 370. With respect to the analogy drawn by the HU SA, the IE SA argues
that there is nothing in the facts that support the assumption of the HU SA whereby WhatsApp IE
processes data purely for the purposes of profiling and targeted advertising 371. In addition, the IE SA
considers that the example cited by the HU SA is not applicable to the circumstances of the case 372.

352. Concerning the HU SA’s statement on the self-contradiction of the Draft Decision, the IE SA argues that
the quoted statement has no evidential value since it has been taken out of context and it constituted
the preliminary view of the IE SA 373. In addition, the statement was made as a reply to the abstract
question  on  the  potential  impact of  a  more  transparent  approach  and  did  not  entail  a  subjective
assessment of WhatsApp IE’s own thinking in the matter 374.

353. With regard to the reasons raised by the HU SA justifying an increase of the fine, the IE SA considers
that the findings do not support the suggestion that WhatsApp IE processes personal data for the
purpose of profiling and that the duration of the infringement has already been considered as part of
the Article 83(2)(a) GDPR assessment 375. Regarding the seriousness of the case and its impact on data
subject rights, the IE SA is of the view that it has appropriately assessed and weighed it. Concerning
the impact of the Article 14 GDPR infringement to the rights of non-users, the IE SA states that “the
risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons are somewhat limited in circumstances where the
most significant impact occurs at the point in time at which a non-user decides to subscribe to the
Service” and “outside of this specific scenario, the rights that might be exercised by non-users are very
limited” 376. Therefore, even though the infringement of Article 14 GDPR is severe, its impact to non-
users should not be overstated 377.

354. Finally, with regard to the reference in the Draft Decision to the FR SA’s decision mentioned by several
CSAs, the Composite Response clarifies that it was only considered retrospectively, after the fines were
calculated, for the purpose of ensuring the overall consistency of application of the GDPR 378. In this
regard, the IE SA notes that, while the numbers of affected data subjects in this case is higher, the
processing examined by the FR SA was far more extensive and had a more significant impact on the
rights and freedoms of the data subjects concerned 379.

355. Regarding the objection of the DE SA on the weight given to the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria, the IE SA
argues that the Draft Decision contains a detailed assessment of each of the factors and that the IE SA
has appropriately assessed and weighted the criteria in the circumstances of the Inquiry 380. On the DE
SA’s claim that the fine is hardly noticeable for the undertaking and other controllers will take that into
account when deciding on their data protection compliance practices, the IE SA argues that the DE SA
“conflates excessively the roles of the data controller and the undertaking of which the data controller
forms part” 381. As to the sensitivity to punishment, the IE SA argues that it is a principle of German
national law and not EU law, and thus it is not appropriate for the IE SA to apply it 382. In addition, the
IE SA underlines that “Article 83(2) GDPR does not identify any requirement for an SA to engage in an
assessment of what impact a proposed fine will have on the profit margins of the data controller or
processor concerned” 383. Concerning the amount of the fine, the IE SA further argues that the HU SA
and the DE SA have placed greater significance on the turnover of the undertaking than is permitted,
or envisaged, by Article 83 GDPR. The IE SA argues that, while the turnover is relevant to calculate the
maximum fine amount, the key factors to determine the range of the penalty are those in Article 83(2)
GDPR 384. The IE SA considers that this is consistent with the position whereby infringements under the
GDPR are pronounced against controllers and processors, rather than undertakings 385.

356. Regarding the objection raised by the IT SA, the IE SA is of the view that the infringement falls short of
the high threshold required in order to classify an infringement as being intentional in character 386.
Consequently, the IE SA considers that no further weight can be attributed to the 2012 Investigation,
since that “would introduce an unnecessary element of risk, as regards the legal sustainability and
defensibility (in the event of a legal challenge before the Irish Courts) of the decision that will ultimately
be adopted” 387.

357. Concerning the other aggravating factor raised by the IT SA, the IE SA firstly sets forth the difficulty to
ascertain, from the media reports, the reasons for concerns from individuals, given that WhatsApp IE
and WhatsApp Inc. simultaneously announced changes to their privacy policies and terms of service.
In addition, the IE SA considers that the assumption that WhatsApp IE’s delayed the application of its
privacy policy due to concerns on the negative impact is purely speculative 388. Finally, on the lack of
explanation of the percentage of the fine, the IE SA argues that there is no obligation to provide such
explanations  and  that  the  Draft  Decision  already  contains  detailed  explanations  on  the  elements
considered for the fine 389.

358. With regard to the PL SA’s objection specifically, the IE SA claimed that the fine proposed in the Draft
Decision appropriately weighted each of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria in light of the particular facts
of  the  case 390. In  this  regard,  the  IE SA explained  that  the  processing  of  non-users  mobile  phone
number is limited to the scenario where there is an activation of the Contact Feature by an existing
user contacts and that the lack of information of these non-users is remedied at the time they join the

impact of the Article 14 GDPR infringement on WhatsApp’ non-users should not be overestimated 391.

Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned

9.3.4 Analysis of the EDPB
9.3.4.1
In its objection on the proposed amount of the fine, the DE SA considers the fine proposed in the Draft
Decision to be ineffective, disproportionate and non-dissuasive in the present case 392. This objection
concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft decision complies with the GDPR” 393. Therefore,
the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

360. The DE SA sets out legal and factual arguments, in particular its views on how the Draft Decision
assesses the criteria of Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR and applies them to the facts of the case. In its
objection, the DE SA argues that a higher fine ought to be imposed and that without amendment the
Draft Decision would set a dangerous precedent with regards to deterrence. In particular, it argues the
Draft Decision as it stands would lead to “a significant risk to the rights and fundamental freedoms of
data  subjects,  since  the  undertaking  and  other  controllers  could  orientate  their  abidance  of  data
protection  law  on  such  a barely noticeable  fine” 394. In the objection, the DE SA articulates why it
proposes amending the Draft Decision and clearly demonstrates its view on the significance of the risks
posed by the Draft Decision. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned.

361. WhatsApp IE’s position is that the DE SA’s objections are not reasoned, arguing inter alia that they are
either unsubstantiated in fact, incorrect in law or irrelevant 395: the EDPB takes the view that these
arguments  address  the  merits  of  the objections,  not  whether they  are  relevant  and  reasoned,
therefore the EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of whether the Article 4(24) GDPR threshold
itself is met.

***

362. Although the objection of the PL SA regarding the amount of the administrative fine is relevant since
it outlines a disagreement as to whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller proposed by
the  LSA  complies  with  the  GDPR,  the  EDPB  considers  that  it  fails  to  meet  the  Article  4(24)  GDPR
standard  as  it  is  not  sufficiently  ‘’reasoned’’ 396.  In  particular,  the  objection  does  not  include  any
clarification  or  argument  supporting  amendments  of  the  Draft  Decision  leading  to  a  different
conclusion. Thus, the objection does not explain how the issuance of the Draft Decision as proposed
by  the  IE  SA  would  impact  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects,  nor  does  it
demonstrate why such risk is substantial and plausible 397. Therefore, the EDPB concludes that the
objection of the PL SA does not meet the requirements set out by Article 4(24) GDPR as it does not

395 WhatsApp IE submitted that the DE SA’s objections (i) raise vague and unsubstantiated concerns and (ii) do
not demonstrate a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. WhatsApp IE considers the reasons set out
in the DE SA’s objection as either unsubstantiated in fact, incorrect in law or irrelevant (WhatsApp Article 65
Submissions, paragraphs 38.1, 38.2(A) and 38.3(A)). The EDPB understands these considerations as arguments
on the merits. WhatsApp IE’s submission does not refute that the DE SA objection alleges risks attached to the
draft decision impacting data subjects, suggests a specific change to the draft decision and gives reasons why
this is warranted in the DE SA’s view.

clearly demonstrate the need for amending the Draft Decision, nor of the risks posed by the Draft
Decision if it were to be issued.

363.

In its objection on intentional or negligent character of the infringements, the HU SA disagrees with
the application of Article 83(2)(b) GDPR in the Draft Decision (paragraphs 685-692, 745 and 746 in
particular) 398. This objection concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft decision complies
with the GDPR” 399. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

364. The HU SA sets out legal and factual arguments, namely its view that the IE SA incorrectly “drew a
conclusion that the controller’s act was negligent, taking into account the fact that WhatsApp claimed
that because it does not charge a fee for using the Service, it does not directly get a financial gains in
relation to the alleged infringements” 400. In addition, the HU SA considers that the IE SA’s finding is
contradicted by paragraph 731 (d) of the Draft Decision (noting that a more  transparent approach to
the Contact Feature would represent a risk factor for the continued growth of WhatsApp IE’s user
base). In the objection, the HU SA argues that the finding of negligence ought to be changed to one of
intention. In terms of risk, the objection argues that, if it is not amended, the Draft Decision would set
a precedent that “a  serious  infringement  would  be  considered  as  a  negligent  act  in  circumstances
where  the  controller  fails  to  inform  the  data  subjects”,  which  would  “infringe  data  subjects’
fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection and privacy, and undermine the trust regarding
data protection” 401. The HU SA’s objection articulates why it proposes amending the Draft Decision
and  demonstrates  sufficiently  clearly  its  view  on  the  significance  of  the  risks  posed  by  the  Draft
Decision. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned.

In its objection on the proposed amount of the fine, the HU SA considers the fine proposed in the Draft
Decision to be ineffective, disproportionate and non-dissuasive in the present case 402. This objection
concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft decision complies with the GDPR” 403. Therefore,
the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

366. The HU SA sets out legal and factual arguments, in particular its views on how the Draft Decision
interprets the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR and applies them to the facts of the case. In its objection,
the HU SA argues that a higher fine ought to be imposed and that without this amendment, the Draft
Decision would set a precedent that “undermines confidence in the institution of data protection within
the EU, which could cause a serious crisis of confidence among the concerned data subjects” 404. The
HU SA articulates why it proposes amending the Draft Decision and demonstrates sufficiently clearly
its view on the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. Therefore, the EDPB considers the
objection to be reasoned.

presented  address  the  merits  of  the  objections,  not  whether  they  are  relevant  and  reasoned 406,
therefore the EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of whether the Art 4(24) GDPR threshold
itself is met.

***

368.

In its objection on the proposed amount of the fine, the IT SA considers the fine proposed in the Draft
Decision to fall short of the proportionality and dissuasiveness requirements set forth in Article 83
GDPR 407. This objection concerns “whether the action envisaged in the draft decision complies with
the GDPR” 408. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.

369. The  IT  SA  sets  out  legal  and  factual  arguments,  in  particular  its  views  on  how  the  Draft  Decision
interprets the criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR and applies them to the facts of the case. The objection
argues that a higher fine ought to be imposed. In terms of risk, the objection argues that without this
amendment the Draft Decision would lead to the risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data
subjects due to a lack of proportionality and dissuasiveness 409. The IT SA’s objection articulates why it
proposes amending the Draft Decision and demonstrates sufficiently clearly its view on the significance
of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned.

370. WhatsApp IE’s position is that the IT SA’s objections are not reasoned 410. The arguments presented
address the merits of the objections, not whether they are relevant and reasoned 411, therefore the
EDPB is not swayed as far as the assessment of whether the Article 4(24) GDPR threshold itself is met.

371. On  this basis,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  objections  raised  by  the  DE  SA,  HU  SA,  and  IT  SA  on
application  of  the  criteria  under  Article  83(1)  and  83(2)  GDPR  qualify  as  relevant  and  reasoned
objections pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR.

372. As the objection raised by the PL SA does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the EDPB

will not consider the merits of the substantial issues raised in the present case 412.

9.3.4.2

Assessment on the merits

373. The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection 413 require
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  proposes  a  fine  in accordance with  (i)  the  criteria

405 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 38.1.
406 WhatsApp states that the HU SA’s objection is premised on assumptions and unsubstantiated allegations
towards  WhatsApp  (WhatsApp Article  65  Submissions,  paragraphs  38.2(C)  and  38.3(C)),  which  the  EDPB
understands  as  arguments  on  the  merits.  WhatsApp’s  submission  does  not  refute  that  the  HU  SA  objection
alleges  risks  attached  to  the  draft  decision  impacting  data  subjects,  suggests  a  specific  change  to  the  draft
decision and succinctly gives reasons why this is warranted in the HU SA’s view.

409 IT SA Objection, p. 9-12.
410 WhatsApp Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 38.1.
411 WhatsApp considers the reasons set out in the IT SA’s objection as either unsubstantiated in fact, incorrect in
law  or  irrelevant  (WhatsApp Article  65  Submissions,  paragraphs  38.2(D)  and  38.3(D)),  which  the  EDPB
understands as arguments on the merits. WhatsApp’s submission does not refute that the IT SA objection alleges
risks attached to the draft decision impacting data subjects, suggests a specific change to the draft decision and
gives reasons why this is warranted in the IT SA’s view.
412 The EDPB reiterates that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may be
called upon to make in other cases, including with the same parties, taking into account the contents of the
relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.
413 These objections are those of the HU SA, DE SA, and IT SA.

established  by  Article  83(2)  GDPR  and  the Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines and  (ii)  the  criteria
provided for by Article 83(1) GDPR.

374.

Indeed,  the  consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent  application  of
administrative fines 414: where a relevant and reasoned objection challenges the elements relied upon
by the LSA to calculate the amount of the fine, the EDPB can instruct the LSA to engage in a new
calculation of the proposed fine by eliminating the shortcomings in the establishment of causal links
between the facts at issue and the way the proposed fine was calculated on the basis of the criteria in
Article 83 GDPR and of the common standards established by the EDPB 415. A fine should be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive, as required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the
case 416. In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the
criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.

The application of the criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR

375. Article 83(2) GDPR considers, among the factors to be taken into account when deciding the imposition
and amount of an administrative fine, “the intentional or negligent character of the infringement”. In
the same sense, Recital 148 GDPR states that “[i]n order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of
this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this
Regulation  [...]. Due  regard  should  however  be  given to  the  nature,  gravity  and  duration  of  the
infringement, the intentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage
suffered, degree of responsibility [...]” (emphasis added).

376. The characterisation of the infringement as intentional or negligent may therefore have a direct impact
on the amount of the fine proposed. As stated in the Guidelines on Administrative Fines, “intentional
breaches, demonstrating contempt for the provisions of the law, are more severe than unintentional
ones” 417 and thus may be more likely to warrant the application of a (higher) fine.

377. As the IE SA notes in the Draft Decision, “the GDPR does not identify the factors that need to be present
in order for and infringement to be classified as either ‘intentional’ or ‘negligent’” 418. The Guidelines
on  Administrative  Fines refer  to  the  fact  that “in  general, ‘intent’  includes  both  knowledge  and
wilfulness in relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas ‘unintentional’ means that there
was no intention to cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care
which is required in the law” 419. In other words, the Guidelines on Administrative Fines identify two
cumulative elements whereby an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the
breach and the wilfulness in relation to such act. On the other hand, an infringement is “unintentional”
when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement.

378. The  characterisation  of  an  infringement  as  intentional  or  negligent  shall  be done  on  the  basis  of
objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case 420. The Guidelines on Administrative
Fines  provide  some  examples  of  conduct  that  may  demonstrate  the  existence  of  intent  and
negligence 421.  It  is  worth  noting  the  broader approach  adopted  with  respect  to  the  concept  of
negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt

the  required  policies,  which  presumes  a  certain  degree  of  knowledge  about  a  potential
infringement 422.

In this case, the IE SA has considered the infringements by WhatsApp IE reflect carelessness and are
therefore the result of a negligent behaviour 423. With respect to the infringements of Articles 12 and
13 GDPR, the IE SA acknowledges the efforts made by WhatsApp IE towards compliance. However, the
IE SA considers that such efforts fell significantly short of what is required, despite the fact that the
requirements of those provisions are not complex 424. Thus, the IE SA considers that the failure to
achieve the  required  standard  of  transparency  amounts  to  a  negligence  for  an  organisation  of
WhatsApp IE’s size, reach and resources 425. Likewise, the infringement of Article 14 GDPR is found to
be negligent. In particular, the IE SA considers that it shows a “high degree of negligence” 426, since
WhatsApp IE “ought to have know, from the outcome of the 2012 Investigation, that its views, as to
the status of non-user numbers, would likely not be endorsed by a data protection authority” 427.

380.

It stems from the above that WhatsApp IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement
of  Article  14  GDPR.  However,  this  mere  element  is  not  sufficient  to  consider  an  infringement
intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated. In
this  respect,  the  IE  SA  considers  that  the  infringement  of  Article 14  GDPR “falls  short  of  the  high
threshold required in order to classify an infringement as being intentional in character” 428.

381. On this regard, the IT SA argues that the awareness of the outcome of the 2012 Investigation by the
NL SA would point to considering the infringement of Article 14 by WhatsApp IE in relation to non-
users as not merely negligent, but rather intentional.  In this respect, WhatsApp IE argues that the IT
SA does not adequately justify why it considers WhatsApp IE’s conduct intentional and that the reliance
on  the  2012  Investigation  is  misplaced 429.  In  particular,  WhatsApp  IE  considers  that  the  2012
Investigation is irrelevant since it involved a different set of facts, occurred 8 years ago in relation to
another controller, notably before the ruling on Breyer and the processing practices described in the
2012 Investigation are not the same ones subject to the Inquiry 430. More specifically, WhatsApp IE
submits that the findings of the 2012 Investigation “focused primarily on users, rather than non-users,
and placed considerable weight on the fact that WhatsApp Inc. (as the service provider at the time)
collected other data points about users in addition to phone numbers, thereby making the data readily
identifiable. In contrast, this is not the case for non-users” 431. Therefore, WhatsApp IE argues that the
2012 Investigation is irrelevant and should be disregarded.

382. The HU SA also made reference to elements relevant for the assessment of the “wilfulness” of the
action. The objection raised by the HU SA refers to the value of processed data for WhatsApp IE and
its conscious choice to obtain profit from it, as well as to the alleged purposes of “profiling and targeted

422 The Guidelines on Administrative Fines mention, among the circumstances indicative of negligence, “failure
to adopt policies (rather than simply failure to apply them)”. This provides an indication that non-compliance in
situations in which the controller of processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example
provided, due the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence.

advertising” 432.  Given  the  value  of  the  data,  the  HU  SA  considers  that  WhatsApp  IE presumably
intentionally decides to give incomplete information to data subjects.

383.

In this regard, WhatsApp IE argues that the HU SA “has no basis to allege an intentional nature to the
infringements, and concedes that it relies only on assumptions in this regard. In particular, there is no
basis for the Hungarian SA to claim - falsely, and with no supporting evidence - that WhatsApp Ireland
engages  in  ‘non-transparent  profiling  of  natural  persons’  or  ‘targeted  advertising’” 433. In  general,
WhatsApp IE’s views on the objections regarding the character of the infringement are that they rely
on “misplaced allegations” and that no evidence has been provided to support the claims 434.

384. The EDPB firstly points out that having “conscience” of a specific matter does not necessarily imply
having the “will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the Guidelines on
Administrative  Fines,  where  the  “consciousness”  (which  could  be  understood  as  equivalent  to
“knowledge”) and the “wilfulness” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality. While
it may prove difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner,
there needs to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality.

385. On the basis of the available information (including the findings of the IE SA and the objection raised
in this regard by the IT SA), the EDPB is not able to identify the will of WhatsApp IE to act in breach of
the law. While the objection submitted by the IT SA points at the potential existence of knowledge, it
fails to identify other objective elements that would demonstrate the will of WhatsApp IE to infringe
the provision.

386. A presumption, as seems to be the case for some of the arguments raised by the HU SA, does not fulfil
the high threshold set to consider an act intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has
acknowledged the existence of “severe  negligence”, rather than “intentionality” when “the  person
responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care which he should have and could have complied
with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and individual situation” 435.

387.

It shall be underlined that, in the context of the assessment of Article 83(2)(c) GDPR, the IE SA notes
that WhatsApp IE’s position regarding its compliance with GDPR “represents a genuinely held belief of
WhatsApp’s  part” 436.  In  addition,  as  noted  above,  the  IE  SA  acknowledges  WhatsApp  IE’s  efforts
towards achieving compliance, albeit clearly insufficient. Some of those efforts included engaging with
experts and carrying our research on how to meet the transparency obligations. These are objective
elements mentioned in the Draft Decision that, in the view of the EDPB, would indicate the absence of
wilfulness to act in breach of the law with regard to the infringements of Articles 12 to 13 GDPR. As
regards the infringement of Article 14 GDPR, the EDPB refers to the reasoning above.

388. Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the HU and the IT SAs fail to provide
objective elements that indicate the intentionality of the behaviour. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the
view that the Draft Decision does not need to be changed with respect to the findings on the character
of the infringements.

389. As regards the nature, gravity and duration of the infringements, Article 83(2)(a) GDPR requires to
take into consideration, inter alia, the nature, scope and purpose of the processing concerned as well
as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them.

390. Regarding the nature and scope of the processing, the IE SA acknowledges that the processing of
personal data by WhatsApp IE is not extensive, as it covers a limited number of categories of personal
data of users and the mobile phone numbers of non-users, being the latter processed for a very short
period 437. As for the purpose, the IE SA considers that “the processing only serves the interests of users
and WhatsApp” 438.

391. With regard to the data subjects affected, the IE SA highlights that the infringements of Article 12 and
13 GDPR “appear to affect approximately 63% of the population of the EEA”, and estimates that the
corresponding percentage of affected non-users is 24% of the EEA population 439. As to the level of
damage, the IE SA recalls that users “have only been provided with 59% of the information they are
entitled to receive” and “non-users have not been provided with any of the information they are entitled
to receive”. This represents, in the view of the IE SA, “a very serious information deficit” that “can only
equate to a significant (in the case of users) and total (in the case of non-users) inability to exercise
control over personal data” 440.

392. The EDPB notes that, according to the IE SA, the infringements are very serious in nature and severe
in gravity, since they concern a very significant information deficit and thus go to the heart of the
fundamental  right  of  data  protection 441.  In  particular,  the  IE  SA  considers  Article  14  GDPR
infringements  as  particularly  serious 442.  Due  to  the  seriousness  of  the  infringements,  the  IE  SA
considers  that  the  limited  nature  and  scope  of  the  processing  cannot  be  attributed  a  significant
weight 443.

393.

394.

In this respect, the HU SA considers that, in the determination of the fine, the IE SA has not taken into
account  that “the  risks  due  to  the  non-transparent  profiling  of  natural  persons  are  considered
serious” 444. In addition, the HU SA is of the view that “the long standing of the unlawful processing
[since 24  April  2018]  must  be  taken  into  account  as  an  aggravating  factor,  in  view  of  which  it  is
necessary to set the amount of the fine at a higher amount” 445.

In its Composite Response, the IE SA argues that “there are no findings of fact to support the suggestion
that WhatsApp processes personal data for the purpose of profiling” 446. WhatsApp IE also argues that
the objection is based on “unsubstantiated allegations” 447 and that there is no supporting evidence
for such claim 448. In this respect, the EDPB considers that the objection did not conclusively show that,
on the basis of the findings, “non-transparent profiling” is taking place.

395. With regard to the duration of the infringement, the IE SA argues that it has already been taken into
account 449. As for the dies a quo, the IE SA takes the 25 May 2018 450, instead of 24 April 2018 as argued
by the HU SA. In keeping with the principle of legal certainty 451, in the circumstances of this case the
EDPB considers the dies a quo to determine the duration of the infringement is the 25 May 2018, as it
is the day where the GDPR became applicable and, therefore, its application could be enforced. As to
the consideration of the duration as an aggravating factor, the EDPB notes that it is mentioned in the
Draft Decision as one of the elements taken into account to consider the infringements serious 452.
Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to be amended regarding the
consideration of the duration as an aggravating factor.

396. The  HU  SA  also  considers  that  “the  amount  of  the  fine  does  not  reflect  either  the  importance  or
seriousness of the case or the specific circumstances of the case” 453. The HU SA further recalls that
users and non-users have not been able to exercise their rights given the situation since 24 April 2018.

397.

In its submissions, WhatsApp IE considers that data subjects are provided with clear information and
refers to the Draft Decision 454, thus it argues that the claim of the HU SA has no basis in fact 455. With
regard to non-users, WhatsApp IE considers that “the concerns about risk and harm raised [...] are
unwarranted and based on unsupported speculation” 456 In general, it states that “neither the [IE SA]
nor the CSAs have put forward any evidence to support claims of any harm or risk to users or non-users
arising  from  the  infringements  alleged,  and  certainly  not  the  kind  of  harm  that  would  warrant  an
increase to the proposed very significant fine” 457.

398. The EDPB notes that the HU SA refers to the “circumstances of the case” and its seriousness and
importance. However, the EDPB considers that the objection fails to identify which elements relating
to the “importance, seriousness or the specific circumstances of the case” have not been considered
for the calculation of the amount of the fine, given that the IE SA considers the infringement very
serious in nature and severe in gravity 458. Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision
does not need to be amended regarding the qualification of the seriousness of the infringement as an
aggravating factor. With regard to the assessment of whether the fine is proportionate, effective and
dissuasive in light of these elements, the EDPB refers to paragraph 405 and following of the present
decision.

399. Concerning the weight given to the number of data subjects concerned, the DE SA considers that the
IE SA did not give it a sufficiently aggravating effect, also in light of the very significant level of non-
compliance 459. The DE SA further notes that the amount of the proposed fine would be, at most, of
0.11€ per affected data subject. In the Composite Response, the IE SA expressed its views that it has

appropriately  assessed  and  weighed  the  Article  83(2)  GDPR  criteria 460.  In  this  respect,  the  Draft
Decision states that “the Infringements (collectively and individually) are very serious, both in terms of
the extremely large number of data subjects potentially affected and the severe consequences that
flow from the failure to comply with the transparency requirements (with particular reference to the
impact of the Article 14 infringement on non-users)” 461.

400.

In its submissions, WhatsApp IE argues that this element has already been taken into account by the
IE SA. WhatsApp IE further argues that “the number of data subjects is only a relevant factor if this can
be linked to damage caused to those data subjects” and that “neither the [IE SA] nor the CSAs have
articulated any risk or harm arising from the infringements” 462.

401. The EDPB recalls that the number of data subjects affected should be assessed in order to identify
whether  this  is  an  isolated  event  or  symptomatic  of  a  more  systemic  breach  or  lack  of  adequate
routines  in  place 463.  The  EDPB  acknowledges  that  the  Draft  Decision  adequately  qualifies  the
infringements as very serious in terms of the affected number of data subjects and the consequences
of the non-compliance in light of the facts of the case 464. With regard to the assessment of whether
the  fine  is  proportionate,  effective  and  dissuasive  in  light  of  these  elements,  the  EDPB  refers  to
paragraph 405 and following of the present decision.

402. With regard to the degree of responsibility of WhatsApp IE (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR), the EDPB notes
the  subordinate  objection  raised  by  the  IT  SA  on  the  elements  related  to  the  character  of  the
infringement, which the EDPB will analyse given its conclusion on the lack of intentionality. In this
regard, the EDPB notes that the elements raised by the IT SA are already taken into account by the IE
SA in its Draft Decision to consider the degree of negligence high 465. In addition, the IE SA considers
the degree of responsibility of WhatsApp IE as “a further aggravating factor, in the case of non-users,
given the total failure to provide the required information” and notes that “WhatsApp fell significantly
short of what it might have been expected to do” 466. Taking into account that the IE SA considered the
degree of negligence as high on the basis, inter alia, of the elements mentioned by the IT SA, and that
the IE SA finds as an aggravating factor WhatsApp IE’s failure to provide information in the context of
its processing of non-users data 467, the EDPB considers that the Draft Decision does not need any
amendments on this regard.

403. Concerning other aggravating factors in accordance with Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, the IT SA considers
that  the  Draft  Decision  does  not  appropriately  take  into  account  the  relationship  between
transparency and the impact on WhatsApp IE’s policies aimed at increasing the number of service
users. The IT SA cites some media reports that, in its view, demonstrate the conclusions reached by
the IE SA in the Supplemental Draft. While the relationship between compliance with transparency
obligations and users’ behaviour, and the consequence on WhatsApp IE’s choices, also from a financial
point  of view, may  be  taken  into  account when  assessing  potential  aggravating  factors, the  EDPB
considers that the specific media reports referred to by the IT SA in this case are not sufficient to
provide adequate evidence, also taking into account that they refer to a specific customer behaviour

that may have been triggered by different, albeit simultaneous, events 468. The EDPB also notes that
the IT SA assumes the reason for WhatsApp IE’s decision to delay the application of its privacy policy.
In this regard, WhatsApp IE claims that such decision “was made in order to allow WhatsApp Ireland
the opportunity to clear up misinformation that was circulating and had been causing concern among
users, based on misunderstandings of how privacy and security works on WhatsApp” 469. The EDPB
recalls that, when deciding on the imposition of corrective measures in general, and fines in particular,
“supervisory  authorities  must  assess  all  the  facts  of  the  case  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  and
objectively justified” 470. Taking the above into account, the EDPB is not in a position to consider, on
the basis of the elements provided by the IT SA, that the IE SA should change its conclusion in this
matter.

404. On the basis of the above, the EDPB considers that the IE SA has adequately qualified the relevance of
the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR. Those elements should therefore be given due regard for the
imposition of a fine that is proportionate, effective and dissuasive as per Article 83(1) GDPR. In the
following paragraphs, the EDPB assesses whether the proposed fine fulfils the criteria of Article 83(1)
GDPR.

The application of the criteria under Article 83(1) GDPR

405. Article  83(1)  GDPR  provides  that “[each]  supervisory  authority  shall  ensure  that  the  imposition  of
administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive”.

406. As indicated above, there is a disagreement between the IE SA and DE SA about whether the turnover
figure is relevant only to determine the maximum fine that can be lawfully imposed, or whether it is
also potentially relevant in the calculation of the fine amount.

407. WhatsApp IE’s position is that “[the] sole relevance of turnover for the purpose of Article 83 GDPR is to
ensure that any proposed fine - once calculated - does not exceed the maximum fining caps set out in
Articles 83(4) to (6) GDPR.” Furthermore, WhatsApp IE states that “turnover is not a relevant factor to
take into account as part of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment” because this provision “prescriptively
lists the relevant factors that can be taken into account and the legislature chose not to include turnover
as a specific factor” 471. WhatsApp IE rejects the notion that “sensitivity to punishment needs to be
taken  into  account  and  that  the  fine  needs  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  the  profits  of  an
undertaking”, as was raised by the DE SA. Moreover, in WhatsApp IE’s view “such an interpretation
would be contrary to legal certainty as such a precise factor should have been expressly included in
Article 83(2) GDPR” 472.

408. “Turnover” is mentioned explicitly in Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, in connection with the calculation of the
maximum fine amount applicable to undertakings with a total annual turnover in the previous financial
year that amounts to more than 500 million EUR (the dynamic maximum fine amount). The aim is clear:
to ensure an effective, appropriate and dissuasive fine can be applied to deter even to the largest
undertakings. The Guidelines on Administrative Fines state that “[i]n order to impose fines that are
effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the supervisory authority shall use for the definition of the
notion of an undertaking as provided for by the CJEU for the purposes of the application of Article 101

468 In this respect, the EDPB notes the changes announced simultaneously by WhatsApp Inc. and WhatsApp IE.

and 102 TFEU” 473. The connection is made between the size of the undertaking, measured in terms of
turnover,  and  the  magnitude  a  fine  needs  to  have  in  order  to  be  effective,  proportionate  and
dissuasive. In other words, the size of an undertaking - measured in terms of turnover - matters.

409. Though it is true that neither Article 83(2) GDPR nor Article 83(3) GDPR refer to the notion of turnover,
drawing from this an absolute conclusion that turnover may be considered exclusively to calculate the
maximum  fine  amount  is  unsustainable  in  law.  Firstly,  including  a  reference  to  turnover in  these
provisions is unnecessary, as on the one hand all fines - whether set close to the upper limit or far
below it - must be set at a level that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive (cf. Article 83(1) GDPR),
and on the other hand the dynamic maximum fine amount sets out the limits within which the SAs
may  exercise  their  fining  power.  Secondly,  it  would  be  internally  contradictory  for  the  GDPR  to
introduce a dynamic upper limit to fines, while at the same time prohibiting supervisory authorities
from assessing whether a fine might need to be increased or decreased in light of the turnover of a
company - again - to ensure it is effective, proportionate and dissuasive (cf. Article 83(1) GDPR).

410. The words “due regard shall be given to the following” in Article 83(2) GDPR by themselves do not
indicate the list is an exhaustive one. The wording of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, which allows for any other
aggravating  or  mitigating  factor  to  be  taken  into  account - even  though  not  explicitly  described -
supports this view.

411. The  application  of  a  dynamic  maximum  fine  amount  is  not  a  novelty  in  EU  law,  as  this  is  a  well-
established  notion  in  European  competition  law.  While  the  EDPB  concedes  there  are  differences
between both systems, the similarities are such that CJEU case law from the field of competition law
may serve to clarify a number of questions on the application of the GDPR. In particular, the EDPB
notes  that  taking  into  consideration  turnover - as  one  relevant  element  among  others - for  the
calculation of fines is an accepted practice in the field of competition law 474.

412.

In  light  of  all  of  the  above,  the  EDPB  takes  the  view  that  the  turnover  of  an  undertaking  is  not
exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article
83(4)-(6) GDPR, but it may also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate,
to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. The
EDPB therefore  instructs  the  IE  SA to  take  this  into account  in the  present case  in  the  context  of
amending its Draft Decision on the basis of this binding decision.

413. As stated in the Guidelines on Administrative Fines, the assessment of the effectivity, proportionality
and dissuasiveness of a fine has to “reflect the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen,
that is either to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour (or both)” 475.

414. The EDPB underlines that, in order to be effective, a fine should reflect the circumstances of the case.
Such circumstances not only refer to the specific elements of the infringement, but also those of the
controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely its financial position.

415. Similarly, the EDPB recalls that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is one that has
a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general deterrence

1/2003, OJ C 210, 1.9.2006, p. 2–5; Lafarge v European Commission, (Case C-413/08 P, judgment delivered 17

(discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific deterrence
(discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again) 476. Moreover,
in order to be proportionate, the severity of penalties must be commensurate with the seriousness of
the infringements for which they are imposed 477. It follows that fines must not be disproportionate to
the aims pursued, that is to say, to compliance with the data protection rules and that the amount of
the fine imposed on an undertaking must be proportionate to the infringement viewed as a whole,
account being taken in particular of the gravity of the infringement 478.

416. Therefore,  when  determining  whether  a  fine  fulfils  the  requirements  of  Article  83(1)  GDPR,  due
account must be given to the elements identified on the basis of Article 83(2) GDPR. In this regard, the
EDPB notes that, although the Draft Decision contains a detailed assessment on the different elements,
it is unclear how those impact the proposed fine. In particular, the EDPB notes that the IE SA refers to
the “nature, gravity and duration of the infringement” and “to the potential number of data subjects
affected” when determining the fine range 479. In addition, the IE SA considers that the only mitigating
factors (ie. the limited categories of personal data and WhatsApp IE’s willingness to amend its Privacy
Policy and related material) cannot be attributed “significant weight” given the “overall seriousness
and severity” of the infringements 480.

417.

In its objection, HU SA argues that the fine is ineffective, disproportionate and non-dissuasive, since
the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR have not been given due regard and that the IE SA cannot rely on
the FR SA’s decision on Google LLC in order to determine the amount of the fine, given the higher
number of data subject affected in the present case. The IE SA clarifies that the FR SA’s decision was
only  considered  after  the fines  were  calculated,  in order  to  ensure  the overall  consistency  of the
application of the GDPR 481 and underlines the differences between both cases. The EDPB takes note
of the views expressed by WhatsApp IE, according to which not only the HU SA mischaracterised the
IE SA’s reliance on the FR SA’s decision but any such reliance was not appropriate 482: while the FR SA’s
decision was limited to French residents, the scope of the processing at issue was much broader and
had a more significant impact on rights and freedoms of data subjects than the one subject to the
Inquiry,  and  included  a  finding  of  infringement  of  Article  6  GDPR  in  addition  to  transparency
obligations 483. According to WhatsApp IE, to the extent that the IE SA relies on the FR SA’s decision in
determining a fine at the higher end of the proposed range, it should be disregarded 484.

418. As stated above, the DE SA also considers that the amount of the fine does not reflect the seriousness
of the infringement, in light of the number of data subjects affected. Further, the DE SA also highlighted
in its objection the need for the fine to have a “general preventive effect”, since the envisaged fine will
instead lead other controllers to “conclude that even total disrespect [for] data protection laws would
not lead to significant administrative fines” 485.

419. The EDPB takes note of the position of WhatsApp IE, which is that the fine set out in the Draft Decision

is excessive and therefore inconsistent with Article 83(1) GDPR 486.

420. The EDPB agrees with the argument of the IE SA on the need to ensure an overall consistency in the
approach when imposing corrective measures, specifically regarding fines. To this end, even though
consideration of other fines imposed by other SAs may be insightful, the EDPB underlines that the
criteria in Articles 83(1) and 83(2) GDPR remain the main elements to be considered when determining
the  amount  of  the  fine.  In  the  present  case,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  IE  SA has  considered  the
infringements very serious in nature, severe in gravity, with particular reference to the Article 14 GDPR
infringement  and  amounting  to  a  high  degree  of  negligence,  being  the  degree  of  responsibility  a
further aggravating factor. In addition, the IE SA does not attribute significant weight to any mitigating
factor 487. All these elements shall be given due regard when determining the proportionality of the
fine. In other words, a fine must reflect the gravity of the infringement, taking into account all the
elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease of the amount. Likewise, as
stated above, the turnover of the undertaking is also relevant for the determination of the fine itself.
Otherwise, the objective of attaining fines which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive would not
be met.

421.

In sum, when considering whether the proposed fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the
EDPB has taken into account the turnover of the concerned undertaking, the infringements occurred
and the elements identified under Article 83(2) GDPR.

422. Considering the global annual turnover, the infringements found and the aggravating factors correctly
identified by the IE SA, the EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the
seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on WhatsApp IE. Therefore,
the fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive. In light of this,
the EDPB directs the IE SA to amend its Draft Decision in order to remedy the issue identified when it
proceeds with the overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine, in accordance with
section 9.4.

9.4 The reassessment of the administrative fine

423. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to re-assess its envisaged corrective measure in terms of administrative

fine in accordance with the conclusions reached by the EDPB, namely:

-

-

-

-

the relevant turnover is the global annual turnover of all the component companies of the single
undertaking (paragraph 292);

the relevant turnover is the one corresponding to the financial year preceding the date of the final
decision taken by the LSA pursuant to Article 65(6) GDPR (paragraph 298).

the relevant turnover is relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount and also for
the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate
and dissuasive (paragraph 412).

the amount of the fine shall appropriately reflect the aggravating factors identified in the Draft
Decision under Article 83(2) GDPR, to ensure the fine is proportionate (paragraph 404).

-

-

the  identified  additional  infringements  of  Articles  5(1)(a),  13(1)(d),  13(2)(e)  and  the  extended
scope of 14 GDPR are to be reflected in the amount of the fine, as brought up by several CSAs in
their objections 488;

all the infringements identified in the Draft Decision, as well as the additional ones identified in
the present decision, are to be taken into account when calculating the amount of the fine, in
accordance with the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR (paragraph 327).

424.

In light of the above, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to set out a higher fine amount for the infringements
identified, in comparison with the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision, while remaining
in line with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1)
GDPR.

10 BINDING DECISION

425.

In light of the above and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue
binding  decisions  pursuant  to  Article  65  GDPR,  the  EDPB  issues  the  following  binding  decision  in
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR:

426. On the objections concerning a possible finding of an infringement of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR:



In relation to the objections of the DE, IT and PL SAs on the possible finding of an infringement
of Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, the EDPB decides that they meet the requirements of Article 4(24)
GDPR and instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision that there has been an infringement of
Article 13(1)(d) GDPR, on the basis of the shortcomings identified by the EDPB.

427. On the objections concerning the Lossy Hashing procedure:

 With regard to the relevant and reasoned objections pursuant to Article 4(24) GDPR of the DE
SA, the FR SA, the HU SA, the NL SA, the IT SA and the PT SA, as well as based on the analysis
done and the information available to it, the EDPB concludes that the table of lossy hashes
together with the associated users’ phone numbers as Non-User List constitutes personal data
and instructs the IE SA to amend its Draft Decision accordingly.

428. On the objections relating to the possible further (or alternative) infringements of the GDPR identified

by the CSAs:

 With  regard  to  the  two  objections  by  the  DE  SA  relating  to  the  limited  scope  of  the
investigation and the objections by the HU SA on the possible invalidity of consent and on the
possible additional infringements of Articles 5(1)(a) and 5(2) GDPR, the EDPB decides that the
IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of these objections as they do
not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.



In relation to the objection of the IT SA on the possible infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR,
the EDPB decides that it meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and in light of the
gravity and the overarching nature and impact of the infringements, the IE SA is required to

488 See IT SA Objection, p. 12, which states that the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed should be
reconsidered  in  case  the  objections  pointing  to  additional  infringements  were  taken  on  board. Additionally,
please see the objections raised by the FR SA, PT SA and the NL SA described in paragraph 231 regarding the
impact on the corrective measures of the consideration of the lossy hashed data as personal data.

include in its final decision a finding of an infringement of the transparency principle enshrined
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

Regarding the objection of the DE SA on the possible further infringement of Article 13(2)(e)
GDPR, the EDPB decides that the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR are fulfilled and requires
the IE SA to include in its final decision a finding  of an infringement of Article 13(2)(e) GDPR
(instead of issuing a mere recommendation).

In relation to the objection by the DE SA arguing that the pseudonymised data regarding non-
users is not processed lawfully and there is therefore an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, the
file submitted to the EDPB does not contain sufficient elements that would allow the EDPB to
establish the existence of an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. Therefore, the EDPB decides
that the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision on the basis of the objection raised
by the DE SA with respect to the lawfulness of the processing of non-users data.

Regarding  the objections of  the  IT  SA, the  NL  SA  and  the  PT  SA  relating  to  the  additional
infringement of Article 14 GDPR, the EDPB decides that they meet the requirements of Article
4(24)  GDPR  and  that  the  IE  SA  is  required  to  amend  its  Draft  Decision  to  reflect  that  the
infringement of Article 14 GDPR extends to the processing of non-users’ data in the form of
Non-User Lists after the lossy hashing procedure was applied.

In relation to the objection of the HU SA regarding the additional infringement of Article 5(1)(c)
GDPR, the EDPB decides that, while it meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the file
does  not  contain  sufficient  elements  to  allow  the  EDPB  to  establish  the  existence  of  an
infringement of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR and, therefore, the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft
Decision in this regard.

429. On the objections concerning the proposed order to bring processing into compliance:





In relation to the objection by the HU SA on the deadline for compliance provided for in the
proposed order, the EDPB decides that it meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and
requires the IE SA to amends its Draft Decision to the effect that the period of six months
deadline for compliance is reduced to a period of three months.

In relation to the objection by the HU SA on the provision of information to non-users, the
EDPB decides that, while it meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, given the arguments
raised and that the Draft Decision already instructs WhatsApp IE to give careful consideration
to the location of placement of the public notice to non-users, there is no need to amend the
Draft Decision on that regard.

 With regard to the objection by the NL SA concerning the amendment of policies that would
be  necessary  for  WhatsApp  IE  to  remedy  the  infringement  of  Article  14  GDPR,  the  EDPB
decides that it meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and directs the IE SA to ensure
that  the  order  to  bring  processing  into  compliance,  to  the  extent  that  it  covers  the
infringement of Article 14 GDPR, clearly reflects the expanded scope of the infringement of
this provision as described in section 7.4.4.2 above.

430. On the objections concerning the corrective measures, in particular the administrative fine:



In  relation  to  the  objection  by  the  DE  SA  regarding  the  turnover  figure  of  the  preceding
financial  year,  the  EDPB  decides  that  it meets  the  requirement  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR  and
instructs  the  IE  SA  to  amend  its  draft  decision  in order  to: (a) take  into  account  the total

Adopted

87

turnover  of  all  the  component  companies  of  the  single  undertaking  for  the  purpose  of
calculating the amount of the fine itself; (b) consider the date of the final decision taken by the
LSA pursuant to Article 65(6) GDPR as the event from which the preceding financial year should
be considered.

In relation to the objections of the DE SA, FR SA and PT SA concerning the application of Article
83(3) GDPR, the EDPB decides that they meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and that
the IE SA is required to amend its Draft Decision in respect to Article 83(3) GDPR in order to
also take into account the other infringements – in addition to the gravest infringement – when
calculating  the  fine,  subject  to  the  criteria  of  Article  83(1)  GDPR  of  effectiveness,
proportionality and dissuasiveness.

Regarding the objections of the DE SA, the IT SA, and the HU SA, concerning the application of
the criteria under Art. 83(1) and 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers the objections to be in line
with the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. With regard to the objections of the IT SA and
the  HU  SA  on  the  intentional  character  of  the  infringement,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the
arguments put forward by the IT and HU SAs fail to provide objective elements that indicate
the intentionality of the behaviour. With regard to the assessment of the other criteria under
Article 83(2) GDPR contested by the DE, IT and HU SAs in their objections, the EDPB considers
that the IE SA has adequately qualified the relevance of the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR
and, therefore, the Draft Decision does not need to be amended in this regard. However,
considering the global annual turnover, the infringements found and the aggravating factors
correctly identified by the IE SA, the EDPB decides that the fine does not fulfil the requirement
of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR.

In light of this, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to re-assess its envisaged corrective measure in
terms of administrative fine in accordance with section 9.4 of the present binding decision and
to  amend  its  Draft  Decision  by  setting  out  a  higher  fine  amount  for  the  infringements
identified, in comparison with the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision, while
remaining  in  line  with  the  criteria  of  effectiveness,  proportionality,  and  dissuasiveness
enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR.

In relation to the objection of the PL SA concerning the decision of the IE SA to issue not a fixed
sum but a range when assessing the fine, the EDPB decides that the IE SA is not required to
amend  its  Draft  Decision  on  the  basis  of  the  objection  raised  as  it  does  not  meet  the
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
