The European Data Protection Board 

Having regard to Article 63 and  Article 65(1)(a) of  the Regulation 2016/679/EU of  the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC 
(hereinafter “GDPR”)1, 

Having regard to  the  EEA Agreement and  in  particular to Annex  XI  and Protocol  37  thereof, as 
amended by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20182, 
Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure (hereinafter “EDPB RoP”)3, 
Whereas: 
(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “EDPB”) is to ensure the 
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it follows from Article 60 GDPR 
that the lead supervisory  authority (hereinafter “LSA”) shall cooperate with the other supervisory 
authorities concerned (hereinafter “CSAs”) in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs 
shall  exchange all  relevant information  with  each other, and  that the LSA  shall,  without  delay, 
communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. 
The LSA shall without delay submit a draft decision to the other CSAs for their opinion and take due 
account of their views. 
(2) Where any  of the CSAs  expressed  a reasoned and  relevant objection  on the draft decision  in 
accordance with Article 4(24) and  Article 60(4)  GDPR and the LSA does  not  intend to follow  the 
relevant and reasoned objection or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA 
shall submit this matter to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR. 
(3) Pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall issue a binding decision concerning all the matters 
which are the subject of  the  relevant and  reasoned objections,  in particular whether there is an 
infringement of the GDPR.  
(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the 
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) EDPB RoP, within one month 
after the Chair of the EDPB and the competent supervisory  authority have decided that the file is 
complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of 
the subject-matter upon decision of the Chair of the EDPB on own initiative or at the request of at 
least one third of the members of the EDPB. 
(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able 
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of 
the extension by a simple majority of its members. 
(6) In accordance with Article 11(6) EDPB RoP, only the English text of the decision is authentic as it is 
the language of the EDPB adoption procedure.

1  SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE 

1. 

2. 

3. 

This  document  contains  a  Binding  Decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 
in  accordance  with 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. The decision concerns the dispute arisen following a draft decision (hereinafter 
“Draft Decision”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission”, hereinafter 
the “IE SA”, also referred to in this context as the “LSA”) and the subsequent objections expressed by 
a  number  of  CSAs  (“Österreichische  Datenschutzbehörde”  hereinafter  the  “AT  SA”;  “ Der 
Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit” also on behalf of other German 
SAs4, hereinafter the “DE SAs”; “Agencia Española de Protección de Datos”, hereinafter the “ES SA”; 
“Office of  the Data Protection Ombudsman”,  hereinafter the “FI SA”; “Commission  Nationale de 
l'Informatique et des  Libertés", hereinafter the  “FR SA”; “Hungarian National Authority  for  Data 
Protection and Freedom of  Information, hereinafter “HU SA”; “Garante per la protezione dei dati 
personali",  hereinafter  the  “IT  SA”;  “Autoriteit  Persoonsgegevens”,  hereinafter  the  “NL  SA” ; 
“Datatilsynet”, hereinafter the “NO SA”; and “Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten”, hereinafter the “SE 
SA”).  

The Draft Decision at issue relates to a “complaint-based inquiry” which was commenced by the IE SA 
on  20 August  2018 into  the Instagram social  media processing  activities (hereinafter “Instagram 
service”) of Facebook Ireland Limited, a company established in Dublin, Ireland. The company has 
subsequently changed its name to “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited” and hereinafter it is referred to 
as “Meta IE”. Any reference to Meta IE in this Binding Decision means a reference to either Facebook 
Ireland Limited or Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, as appropriate.  

The complaint  was lodged on  25  May 2018  with the Belgian supervisory  authority (“Autorité de 
protection des données”), hereinafter the “BE SA” by a data subject who requested the non-profit 
NOYB - European Center for Digital Rights (hereinafter, “NOYB”) to represent them under Article 80(1) 
GDPR (both hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant”). The Complainant alleged a violation of the 
right to data protection and especially infringements of  “all  the particular requirements set out  in 
Article 4(11), Article 6(1)(a), Article 7 and/or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR”, by arguing that the controller 
relied on a “forced consent”, as well as alleging misrepresentations of the controller with regard to 
consent and the legal basis for the processing, and consequently, an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR 5. The complaint articulated its requests into a request to investigate, and a request to impose 
corrective measures6.   

                                              
4 Objections raised on behalf of the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, 
the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and 
Freedom of Information, the Brandenburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the 
Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the   State Commissioner for Data 
Protection in Lower Saxony and the State Commissioner for Data Protection North Rhine-Westphalia. 
5 Complaint, paragraphs 2.2.5. and 2.3.2. 
6 Within its request to investigate in paragraph 3.1 of the Complaint, the Complainant requested that a full 
investigation be made to determine “which processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the 
data subject”, “for  which purpose they  are performed”, “on  which legal basis for  each specific processing 
operation the controller relies on”, and to acquire “a copy of any records of processing activities”. The complaint 
also requested “that the results of this investigation [be] made available to [them]”. As regards the request to

On 31 May 2018, the BE SA transferred the complaint to the IE SA. The IE SA stated in its “Schedule to 
the Draft Decision”7 that it was satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning of the GDPR, for 
Meta IE, as controller, for the purpose of the cross-border processing of personal data in the context 
of the Instagram service.   

The following table presents a summary timeline of the events part of the procedure leading to the 
submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism:

Several CSAs (AT, DE , ES, FI, FR, HU, IT, NL, NO, and SE SAs) raised 
objections in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR. 

The IE SA issued a Composite Response setting out its replies to 
such  objections  and  shared  it  with  the  CSAs  (hereinafter, 
“Composite Response”). The IE SA requested the relevant CSAs 
to confirm  whether, having considered  the IE SA’s  position  in 
relation  to  the  objections  as  set  out 
in  the  Composite 
Memorandum, the CSAs intended to maintain their objections. 
In  light  of  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  IE  SA  in  the 
Composite  Response, the DE, ES, FI, HU, NL, NO, and SE SAs), 
confirmed  to  the  IE  SA  that  they  maintain  their  remaining 
objections9. 
The IE SA invited  Meta IE to exercise its  right to  be heard in 
respect  of  the  objections  (and  comments)  that  the  IE  SA 
proposed  to refer to the EDPB under Article 65(1) GDPR along 
with the IE SA’s Composite  Response and the communications 
received from the CSAs in reply to the Composite Response. 
Meta IE furnished the requested submissions  (“Meta IE Article 
65 Submissions of 9 August 2022”). 

The IE SA referred the matter to the EDPB in accordance with 
Article  60(4)  GDPR, thereby  initiating  the  dispute  resolution 
procedure under Article 65(1)(a).

8. 

The  IE SA  triggered the  dispute  resolution  process  in  the  Internal  Market Information  system 
(hereinafter “IMI”)10 on 11 August 2022 in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR.  

The EDPB Secretariat assessed the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair of the EDPB in line 
with Article 11(2) EDPB RoP in order to ensure that all the necessary documents were included in the 
file.   

The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA on 23 and 27 September 2022, asking for the transmission 
via IMI of specified documents pertaining to the investigation conducted by the IE SA11. The request

was made to allow the EDPB to come to a fully informed decision on the objections raised by some 
CSAs on the scope and conduct of the investigation. From the schedule to the Draft Decision, the EDPB 
Secretariat concluded that both Meta IE and the Complainant were given access to the documents 
requested and invited the IE SA to confirm this was indeed the case.  

9. 

The IE SA declined the request, as it considered that the material already provided as sufficient to 
enable the EDPB to determine the objections referred to it,  as the draft decision provides information 
about  the  scope  of  the  inquiry  commenced  for  the  purpose  of  examining  the  complaint,  the 
procedural steps taken in the inquiry, the information that was collected during the course of the 
inquiry process, the allegations that were put to the data controller, the submissions  made by the 
parties to the inquiry and the assessments and views of the IE SA. Further, the IE SA expressed its 
concern over the possibility  of the EDPB concluding its decision on the basis of material which was 
never  put  to the  controller  concerned  as  part of  the  formulation  of  any  allegation of  potential 
wrongdoing. Finally, the IE SA underlined that, in accordance with Article 11(2) of the EDPB RoP, they 
would provide documents the Board deems necessary.  

10.  A matter of particular importance that was scrutinised by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be 
heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Further details on this are 
provided in Section 2 of this Binding Decision. 

11.  On 5 October 2022, the decision on the completeness of the file was taken, and it was circulated by 

the EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB. 

12. 

The Chair of the EDPB decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) 
EDPB RoP, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on account 
of the complexity of the subject-matter

2  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

13. 

14. 

The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular Article 41 (right 
to good administration). This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB RoP. Further details were provided 
in the EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR 12.    

The EDPB Decision “shall  be reasoned  and addressed  to the lead  supervisory  authority and  all  the 
supervisory  authorities  concerned and  binding  on  them” (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is  not aiming to 
address directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possible need 
for the EDPB to offer the right to be heard at the EDPB level to Meta IE, the EDPB assessed if Meta IE 
was offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the procedure led by the 
LSA and the subject matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB. In particular, the EDPB assessed 
if all the documents containing the matters of facts and law used by the EDPB to take its decision had 
been previously shared with Meta IE.   

15. 

The EDPB notes that Meta IE has received the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard regarding 
all the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered by the EDPB in the context of 
this decision and provided its written observations13, which have been shared with the EDPB by the 
LSA.  

16.  Considering  that Meta IE has been  already heard by the IE SA  on all matters of facts and of  law 
addressed by the EDPB in its decision, the EDPB is satisfied that the Article 41 of the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights has been respected. 

17. 

The EDPB considers that the Complainant is not likely to be adversely affected by this Binding Decision, 
and consequently does not meet the conditions to be granted a right to be heard by the EDPB in line 
with Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, applicable case law, and Article 11 of the 
EDPB RoP. This is without prejudice to any right to be heard or other related rights the Complainant 
may have before the competent national supervisory authority(/-ies). 

3  CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION 

18. 

The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4) 
and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR 14. 

19. 

3.1  Objection(s) expressed by several CSA(s) in relation to a Draft Decision 
The EDPB notes that several CSAs (AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, IT, NL, NO and SE SAs) raised objections to 
the Draft Decision via IMI. The objections were raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR.  

                                              
12 EDPB Guidelines 3/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, adopted on 13 April 2021 (version for 
public consultation) (hereinafter, “EDPB Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a)”), paragraphs 94-108. 
13 In particular, Meta IE Preliminary Draft Submissions dated 4 February 2022, Meta IE Article 65 Submissions 
dated 9 August 2022. 
14 According to Art. 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority has raised 
a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the objection or 
the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned. 

Adopted 

9 

3.2  The IE SA finds the objections to the Draft Decision not relevant or reasoned and 

does not follow them  

20.  On 1 July 2022, the IE SA provided to the CSAs an analysis of the objections raised by the CSAs in the 

Composite Response.  

21. 

The IE SA concluded that it would not follow the objections, as it did not consider them “relevant” 
and/or “reasoned”, within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR for the reasons set out in the Composite 
Response and below15. 

22. 

23. 

3.3  Admissibility of the case 
The  case at  issue  fulfils  the  elements  listed  by  Article  65(1)(a)  GDPR, since  several  CSAs  raised 
objections to a draft decision of the LSA (the IE SA) within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, 
and the IE SA has not followed  objections  or rejected them for being, in its view, not relevant or 
reasoned.  

The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that the current Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution should 
be suspended  due to pending preliminary ruling proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU 
(hereinafter, “CJEU”)16. Meta IE refers in particular to cases C-252/2117 and C-446/2118. Following its 
assessment, the EDPB decides to continue its proceedings on this Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution, 
as there is no  explicit legal basis for  a stay of the dispute  resolution procedure in EU law, nor are 
existing CJEU rulings on the matter conclusive for the situation of the EDPB19. Also, the EDPB takes 
into consideration  the data subjects’  right to have their complaints handled  within a  “reasonable 
period” (Article 57(1)(f) GDPR), and to have their case handled within a reasonable time by EU bodies 
(Article 41 Charter). Moreover, ultimately there are remedies available to the affected parties in case 
of a discrepancy between the EDPB Binding Decision and CJEU rulings in the aforementioned cases20.  

24.  Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the  EDPB is 
competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of

17 Request for a preliminary ruling of 22 April 2021, Meta Platforms and Others, C-252/21 (hereinafter ‘C-252/21 
Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf request’). 
18 Request for a preliminary ruling of 20 July 2021, Schrems, C- 446/21 (hereinafter ‘C-446/21 Austrian 
Oberster Gerichtshof request’). 
19 C-234/89 Judgement of the Court of Justice of 28 February 1991, Delimitis, C-234/89, ECLI:EU:C:1991:91; C-
344/98 Judgement of the Court of Justice of 14 December 2000, Masterfoods, C-344/98, ECLI:EU:C:2000:689. 
These cases  concerned  proceedings before the  national courts, where the  parties faced the risk of being 
confronted with a conflicting decision of the  national  judge that could be seen as de  facto nullifying the 
Commission decision –  a power which is retained  by the CJEU.  The  current dispute resolution procedure 
concerns the adoption of an administrative decision, which can be subject to full judicial review. 
20 In case an action for annulment is brought against the EDPB decision(s) and found admissible, the General 
Court/CJEU has the opportunity to invalidate the decision of the EDPB. In addition, and if the General Court/CJEU 
were to deliver any judgment in the time between the adoption of the EDPB’s Art. 65 decision and the adoption 
the IE SA’s final decision, the IE SA may ultimately decide to revise the final national decision it takes following 
the EDPB's binding decision - if the CJEU’s rulings give cause to do so - in accordance with the principle of 
cooperation as elaborated by the CJEU in the C-453/00 Judgement of the Court of Justice of 12 January 2004,

the relevant and reasoned objection(s), i.e. whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether 
the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR 21.  

25. 

The EDPB recalls that its current Decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may 
be called  upon  to make in  other cases, including  with the same parties, taking into  account the 
contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s). 

26. 

3.4  Structure of the Binding Decision 
For each of the objections raised, the EDPB decides on their admissibility, by assessing first whether 
they can be considered as a “relevant and reasoned objection” within the meaning of Article 4(24) 
GDPR as clarified in the Guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection22.  

27.  Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the 
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this 
specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections it deems 
relevant and reasoned23.  

4  ON WHETHER THE LSA SHOULD HAVE FOUND AN INFRINGEMENT 

FOR LACK OF APPROPRIATE LEGAL BASIS  

28. 

4.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 
The IE SA concludes that the GDPR, the jurisprudence and the EDPB Guidelines do not preclude Meta 
IE from relying on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a legal basis to carry out the personal  data processing 
activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as 
that forms a core part of the service24. Finding 2 reads “I find the Complainant’s case is not made out 
that the GDPR does  not permit the reliance by  Meta Ireland on 6(1)(b)  GDPR in  the context of  its 
offering of Terms of Use 25”   

29. 

The IE SA states that it does not have competence to consider substantive issues of contract law and, 
accordingly, its analysis is limited to the specific contract entered into by the complainant and Meta 
IE in respect of the Instagram service26.  

30. 

The IE SA understands the complainant’s allegations as27:  being that, firstly, they were given a binary 
choice: i.e. either accept the Instagram Terms of Use and the associated Data Policy by selecting the 

                                              
21  Art.  65(1)(a) and Art. 4(24) GDPR. Some CSAs raised comments and not per se objections, which were, 
therefore, not taken into account by the EDPB.   
22 EDPB Guidelines 9/2020 on the concept of relevant and reasoned objection, version 2 adopted on 9 March 
2021, (hereinafter, “EDPB Guidelines on RRO”).  
23 See EDPB Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), paragraph 63 (“The EDPB will assess, in relation to each objection raised, 
whether the objection meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and, if so, address the merits of the objection 
in the binding decision.”)

“accept” button, or deleting their Instagram account 28, lack of clarity on which specific legal basis Meta 
IE relies on for each processing operation29, and their concern on Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) 
to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use30.  

31.  While the IE SA acknowledges that the EDPB considers in its Guidelines  2/201931 that, as a general 
rule, processing for online behavioural advertising is not necessary for the performance of a contract 
for online  service under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 32, in this particular case, having regard to the specific 
terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, IE SA 
concluded that Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) as legal basis of the processing of users’ 
data  necessary  for  the  provision  of  its  service,  including  through  the  provision  of  behavioural 
advertising insofar as this forms a core part of that service offered to and accepted by users33.  Further, 
the IE SA states that while the examples provided in  any form of  EDPB guidance are helpful and 
instructive, they are not necessarily conclusive of the position in any specific case and indeed do not 
purport to be34.  

32. 

The IE SA disagrees with what it defines as a “strict threshold of ‘impossibility’ in the assessment of 
necessity” proposed  by  the  complainant  and  the EDPB 35. By  “impossibility”,  IE  SA  refers  to  the 
argument put  forward that a particular term of  a contract (here, behavioural  advertising) is  not 
necessary to deliver an overall service or contract 36. The IE SA is of the view that “it is  not  for an 
authority  such  as  the  Commission,  tasked  with  the enforcement of  data  protection law, to  make 
assessments as to what will or will not make the performance of a contract possible or impossible” and 
that the general principles set out in the GDPR and explained by the EDPB in the guidelines must be 
applied on a case-by-case basis37. The IE SA considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be interpreted 
as requiring that it is impossible to perform the contract without the data processing operations in 
question38.    

33. 

The IE SA refers to Meta IE’s position that in the specific context of the Instagram service, personalised 
advertising may constitute a distinguishing feature of said service which is an “exact rationale” and 
one of the “essential elements of the Terms of Use” for which the ordinary user would reasonably 
expect their personal data to be processed so  as to receive the Instagram service as advertised39. 
Further, the IE SA refers to Meta IE’s submission regarding whether the necessity test encompasses 
an impossibility threshold, and Meta IE’s argument that were impossibility an aspect of necessity, it

would not, in any case operate as a “blanket prohibition” on relying on Article (1)(b) GDPR as the legal 
basis for the processing in this context 40. 

 The IE SA considers personalised advertising a core part of the service offered to and accepted by the 
users, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and 
agreed upon  by Meta IE and the user41. The IE SA points  out that the nature of the service being 
offered to Instagram users is set out in the Terms of Use which describe the Instagram service as being 
“personalised” and connects users with brands, including by means of providing “relevant” advertising 
and content 42.  

The IE SA considers this as the Instagram service is advertised in the Terms of Use as being predicated 
on personalised advertising, any reasonable user would understand and expect that this is part of the 
core bargain that is being struck with Meta IE, even if they might prefer that the market would offer 
them better alternative choices43.  

The IE SA considers that as personalised advertising forms part of the core bargain struck between 
Meta Ireland and Instagram users, any processing necessary for the delivery of such advertising  is 
deemed to fall within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 44. 

The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of 
the processing of users’ data necessary for the delivery of a service based on behavioural advertising 
of the kind provided for under the contract between Meta IE and Instagram’s users45. 

The IE SA  clarified  that, having regard to  the scope  of  the  complaint and  its  inquiry,  the above 
conclusion  ought not to be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on 
users’ personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 46.  

The IE SA also notes that other provisions of the GDPR such as transparency act to strictly regulate the 
manner in which this service is to be delivered and the information that should be given to users and 
decides  to address  it separately in  its Draft Decision47.The IE SA  considers  that there have been 
significant failings of transparency in relation to the processing 48.  

The IE SA considers  that these failings of transparency, having regard to the specific terms of the 
contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, do not, in principle 
prevent Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data

4.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 
The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs   object to Finding 2 of the draft decision and the 
assessment leading up to it.  

The AT, ES, FI, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs50  consider that, the IE SA should have found an infringement 
of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, in line with the EDPB’s interpretation of this provision51. The DE and FR 
SAs argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 52.  

The DE SAs, in their objection, further argue that the IE SA should find an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR and make use of corrective powers of  Article 58(2)(f)  and (i) GDPR and order to erase the 
unlawfully processed personal data, impose a ban of the respective processing of data for the purpose 
of  behavioural  advertising  until  a valid  legal basis  is  in  place and  impose  an administrative  fine 
pursuant to Article 83 GDPR 53. 

The FI SA, in its objection, also argues that the finding that Meta IE was not entitled to rely on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for all the processing operations in the scope of the Instagram Service 
should lead to the conclusion that corrective powers pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR must be exercised 
to bring the processing operations of Meta IE into compliance with the GDPR 54. Furthermore, the FI 
SA considers  that this additional  infringement should  be properly  reflected in  the amount of the 
administrative fine imposed pursuant to Article 83 GDPR 55. 

The FR SA notes that reversing the findings  concerning the infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR also 
affects the scope of the corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative 
fine56. 

The HU SA, in its objection, argues that in light of the infringement, the legal consequences of Article 
58(2) (d)  (order to bring processing operations into compliance)  GDPR should  be applied, and the 
controller should be instructed to indicate another alternative legal basis57. 

The NO SA, in its objection, also argues that the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures. More 
specifically, the NO SA considers that the IE SA should order Meta IE to delete personal data processed 
under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, unless those data were also collected for other purposes with a valid legal 
basis, as well as order Meta IE to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising

or abstain  from such  processing  activities and  impose  an administrative fine  against Meta IE for 
unlawfully processing personal data in the context of online behavioural advertising58.  

The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs put forward several factual and legal arguments for the 
proposed  change in legal assessment 59. Specifically they argue that Meta IE cannot rely on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process an Instagram user’s data for behavioural advertising. 

In addition, in the context of their objection, the AT and FR SAs argue that the factual background of 
the Draft Decision does not include all relevant facts. They request amending the factual background 
to include a definition of “behavioural advertising”60. The AT SA suggests mentioning also the technical 
possibilities Meta IE uses to conduct it, such as collecting data from other group services, third-party 
websites, apps, cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the user’s computer or mobile device 
and linking that data with the user’s Instagram account 61. The AT SA also suggests including the fact 
that on 25 May 2018 Meta IE switched its legal basis to process data for behavioural advertising from 
consent to contractual performance62.   

The DE and NL SAs63 question the validity of the contract between Meta IE and the Instagram service’s 
user to ground the said processing on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in light of the transparency issues identified 
by the IE SA 64. The DE SAs question whether the parties reached an agreement if the user did not 
know  that they would  enter into  a contract, because  Meta IE did  not clearly  communicate in a 
transparent manner that the use of its services would in the future be based on a contract65. The NL 
SA argues that, as a general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of a contract in order 
to willingly enter into it 66 and considers that “the established serious lack of transparency on behalf of 
the controller, leads, at the very least, to a reasonable doubt whether data subjects have indeed been 
able to enter into a contract with the controller both willingly and sufficiently informed"67. The DE and 
NL  SAs  therefore  considered  that  Meta IE’s statement that it  relies  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR, in 
combination  with  documents  with  general descriptions  of  the  service provided,  and the  IE SA’s 
reference to the controller’s right to choose its own legal basis to process data are insufficient  to 
accept the performance of a contract as a legal basis68.

5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR have been infringed”. The IE SA considered, among other, that “Meta Ireland 
have not provided meaningful information as to the processing operation(s) and/or set(s) of operations that 
occur in the context of the Instagram service, either on basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR or any other legal basis. 
Indeed, I would go so far as to say that it is impossible for the user to identify with any degree of specificity what 
processing is carried out on what data, on foot of the specified lawful bases, in order to fulfil these objectives”

51. 

The DE SAs contend that the IE SA is competent to assess the validity of contracts in the context of the 
GDPR, which is a prerequisite for controllers to base the processing of personal data on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR 69. Would  that not be the case, the assessment  of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR would practically be 
deducted from Supervisory Authorities’ tasks provided for in Article 57(1)(a) GDPR 70. The DE and NL 
SAs argue that the IE SA should assess whether a valid contract is in place as required under Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR 71. 

52.  Without prejudice to any arguments made on the existence of a valid contract above, the AT, DE, ES, 
FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs are not satisfied by the assessment of necessity in the Draft Decision72 . 
They assert that the data processing for the delivery of personalised advertising is objectively not 
necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s contract with the data subject to deliver the Instagram 
service and it is not an essential or core element of it. To highlight the unnecessity of behavioural 
advertising to perform the contract with the Instagram user, the AT, DE, NL and SE SAs argue that this 
contract of  providing  personalised  advertisement is  a  contract between Meta IE  and  a  specific 
advertiser, in which Meta IE would presumably have this obligation towards the advertisers, yet not 
towards Instagram users that are not party to this contract 73. The DE SAs support this assertion by 
pointing out that there is no obligation to offer personalised advertising to the user, and contractual 
sanctions for the failure to provide it, as it can be seen from the terms of use74. The AT, DE, HU, FI, FR, 
HU, NO and SE SAs consider, while referring to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
that the business  models to offer “free” services and in return generate income by behavioural and 
personalised  advertisement, inter alia, to support  the service, cannot be necessary  to perform a 
contract and fail to comply with data protection regulations75. The DE, FR and HU SAs also cite the 
EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 to underscore that processing cannot be rendered lawful by Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR simply  because such advertising indirectly funds  the provision  of the service and that while 
personalisation  of  content,  may,  in  certain  circumstances, constitute  an  intrinsic  and  expected 
element of certain online  services, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of targeting of social media 
users is hardly applicable76. The AT, ES and SE SAs argue that advertisements can still be displayed on 
Instagram using alternative methods to behavioural advertising not involving profiling and tracking77. 
The SE SA adds that some degree of targeting for increased relevance is possible, such as geography, 
language and context 78.  

53. 

In addition, the AT, ES, FI, FR, HU, NO and SE SAs argue, also while referring to EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that the IE SA should have considered the EDPB’s argument that behavioural

advertising cannot be “necessary” within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR while a data subject can 
object to the processing of his/her personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time without 
any reason, in accordance with Article 21(2) GDPR 79.  

The AT, DE, FR, NO, NL and SE SAs  also point out some arguments on data subjects’ expectations 
about the processing of their personal data for personalised advertising as a necessary element of the 
contract entered into between users and Meta IE80. The AT, DE, NL, and SE SAs contend that data 
subjects  do not  reasonably expect that their data is  being processed  for personalised  advertising 
simply  because Meta IE briefly refers to it in the Instagram Terms of Use81. The NO SA takes into 
account how Meta IE markets its Instagram platform towards potential users (“A simple, fun & creative 
way to capture, edit & share photos, videos & messages with friends & family”) and considers that 
Instagram users  (including  those  with  prior  knowledge  of  data protection,  technical means  for 
profiling  or the ad tech industry)  should  not be  deemed to reasonably  expect online  behavioural 
advertising, especially to the extent as it is carried out by Meta IE82. The FR and NO SAs consider that 
the particularly massive and intrusive nature of the processing of the users’ data cannot meet the 
reasonable expectations of the users83. The AT, NL and SE SAs also consider that the Draft Decision is 
inconsistent in finding that information on specific processing operations should have been provided, 
linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described in an unambiguous manner, while considering that 
data subjects  had  a perspective or expectation or were well  informed  that their data was being 
processed for behavioural advertising 84.  

In addition to the arguments made above on the existence of a valid contract and the necessity of 
behavioural advertising for the performance of that contract, several SAs raise other considerations 
in their objections.  

The NO SA argues that the IE SA’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) is contrary to the fairness principle, 
since data subjects face the dilemma of approving contractual terms possibly entailing intrusive and 
harmful processing practices, and being excluded from services on which they are de facto dependent, 
due to a lack of realistic alternatives to them85.

56. 

57.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT, DE, ES, HU, FI, NL, NO and SE SAs explain that the 
proposed interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR leads to a situation where data protection principles 
are  either undermined  or  bypassed  entirely  with  regards to  data subjects  using  the  Instagram 
service86 .

Specifically, the AT, DE and NO SAs point to the conditions of consent pursuant to Article 7 GDPR as 
being bypassed87. The NL SA considers  that the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to engage in online 
behavioural  advertising in  a way  that bypasses  informed  consent  of  data subjects88.  The NO  SA 
considers that users ‘would face a dilemma between approving (though not by way of valid  consent) 
contractual terms possibly  entailing  intrusive and harmful  processing practices, and  being excluded 
from services’, which ultimately would also ‘adversely affect data subjects’ freedom of expression and 
information’ 89. The  FI,  FR  and  NO  SAs  considered  that the  Draft Decision  poses  a  risk  to  the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned, insofar as using the legal basis of the 
contract for the processing of the personal data for personalised advertising, would prevent European 
users of the social network to have control over their data 90. 

Further, the AT SA sees the risk materialise as in its view Article 25(2) GDPR (privacy by default) is not 
applied,  “since  Meta  Ireland –  at  least  in  its  contract –  declares  that  behavioural  advertising  is 
‘necessary’ for the contractual performance”91. 

The DE SAs argue the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to “bypass the requirements of a valid legal basis 
for the processing that cannot be based on contract performance” 92. The NL SA considers the Draft 
Decision lowers the threshold for legality of data processing on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) severely 93. 
The NO SA considers that the Draft Decision erodes the lawfulness principle, as in the Draft Decision 
“it  is  not  the  legislation  which  sets  the  boundaries  for  lawfulness  under  Article 5(1)(a)  GDPR, but 
instead the individual  contract”, which is incompatible with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 94. 

FR, HU, NL and SE SAs take the view that the Draft Decision, as it stands, sets a dangerous precedent 
contrary to the GDPR 95.  The FR SA notes that it could be understood as reflecting the common position 
of the European supervisory  authorities on this matter, since it is issued following the cooperation 
procedure among SAs96. Moreover, the AT, DE, FI, HU and SE SAs raise that this interpretation of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could essentially be used by every controller and therefore endanger the rights 
of nearly every data subject within the EEA97.  

62. 

The DE SAs specify that the risks concern the complainant in person but it argues that there is also a 
significant risk as regard the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Meta IE’s users in the European 
Union that their personal data are processed without any legal basis98; the FI SA adds that the risks

Finally, the AT, DE, FI, NL and NO SAs explain that the Draft Decision creates a loophole, allowing Meta 
IE and any other controllers to make lawful virtually any collection and reuse of personal data by, as 
long as they declare that it is processed for the performance of a contract 100.

4.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 
The IE SA considers that the objections above are not relevant and/or not reasoned for the purpose 
of Article 60(4) GDPR and decides not to follow them101.  

The IE SA contends that a broad, direct competence in contract law to assess the validity of contracts 
cannot be inferred from the GDPR tasks of supervisory authorities. It argues that this inference would 
create a very extensive power for SAs  to regulate private law, without an appropriate basis  in EU 
law102.  

The IE SA argues that the core or fundamental aspects of the Terms of Use, including behavioural 
advertising processing, reflects the mutual expectations of the parties on contractual performance. 
The IE SA contends that a reasonable user would have had sufficient understanding that the Instagram 
service was provided  on the basis of  personalised advertising, based  also on a “recognised public 
awareness” of behavioural advertising as a form of processing 103. 

67.  On the necessity of the processing to perform the contract, the IE SA considers that it does not adopt 
a merely formal approach to Article 6(1)(b) that relies only on the textual content of the Terms of Use. 
The IE SA states that it does not take the view that all written contractual terms are necessary for the 
performance  of  the  contract. The  IE  SA  contends  that  it  focuses  in  its  Draft Decision  on  the 
fundamental purpose or core function of the contract that is necessary for its performance104. 

68. 

69. 

The IE SA argues that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not prohibit behavioural 
advertising processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR if it falls within the core or essential aspects of the 
service105. In relation to Meta IE’s processing of personal data, the IE SA differs from the SAs in that it 
considers  online  behavioural  advertising  as  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the  contract (as 
described in the Instagram Terms of Use) between Instagram and the data subject 106.  

The IE SA also disagrees with the interpretation of Article 21 GDPR making behavioural advertising 
optional and not indispensable107. The IE SA argues that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is not limited to aspects 
of  contractual performance  which are expressly  mandatory and  unconditional  obligations  of  the

parties108. The IE SA contends that the CJEU has in the past held that processing which exceeds the 
most minimal level of processing possible  may be regarded as necessary, where it renders a lawful 
objective “more effective”. The IE SA  affirms that the necessity in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
cannot be assessed by reference to hypothetical alternative forms of the Instagram service and that 
it is not the role of SAs to impose specific business models on controllers109.  

The IE SA considers  EDPB Guidelines as not binding on supervisory authorities, yet it acknowledges 
that they should  be taken into account 110. However, the IE SA argues that the EDPB has not been 
provided with the legal power to mandate that certain categories of processing must be based on 
consent, to the exclusion of any other legal bases for processing.  The IE SA’s view is that such a power 
is properly exercised from time to time by the EU legislator, in the form of specific legislative measures.  
The IE SA is therefore not satisfied that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be 
construed as a binding and specific prohibition on processing for online behavioural advertising on the 
basis of Article 6(1)(b)GDPR. The IE SA considers that under these Guidelines, where processing for 
behavioural advertising is a distinguishing characteristic of the service in question, it can support the 
business  objectives and interests of the controller and be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA 
considers  that to  be  the  case  regarding  Meta IE’s processing  with  reference to  the  Instagram 
service111.  

The IE SA  argues that compliance with GDPR transparency obligations under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 
involves a separate and different legal assessment to that required in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA 
acknowledges that the necessity test under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR may require considering contractual 
terms and other relevant information, and that the information provided under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 
could, in some cases,  inform a data subject’s expectations as to a contractual service. However, in the 
present case, the IE SA considers that the transparency infringements it proposes for its Draft Decision 
do not impact its findings on the legal basis, as it considers that the expectations and understanding 
of the parties on the Terms of Use include personalised advertising 112.  

4.4  Assessment  of the EDPB 

4.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 
The objections raised by the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs concern “whether there is an 
infringement of the GDPR”113.  

The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 
threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR 114. Meta IE’s primary argument is that “it is not open to the EDPB to 
now decide on the lawfulness of Meta Ireland’s actual processing as the Objections suggest. Such an 
assessment is  not within the scope of  the Inquiry as  defined by the DPC115.” In Meta IE’s view, “the 
EDPB cannot expand the scope of the Inquiry in the manner suggested by the CSAs through Objections

that are not relevant to the substance of the Complaint.” and “such objections ‘ought to be disregarded 
in their entirety by the EDPB”116. In this context, Meta IE cites EDPB Binding Decision 2/2022, adopted 
on 28 July 2022 (hereinafter, “EDPB Binding Decision 2/2022”), and in particular, the EDPB’s analysis 
of some of the objections in that case, which were found to be not relevant or reasoned, due to the 
fact that these objections “fail[ed] to establish a direct connection with the specific legal and factual 
content of the draft decision”117.  

74.  Contrary to Meta IE’s position on relevance, as described above, objections can have bearing on the 
“specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision”, despite not aligning with the scope of the 
inquiry as defined by an LSA118.  

75. 

76. 

In essence, Meta IE argues that CSAs may not, under any circumstance, express disagreement with 
the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection. The EDPB does not share this 
reading of Article 65 GDPR, as is explicitly stated in the EDPB RRO Guidelines119.  

Further, Meta IE states that “several CSAs now propose to expand the scope of the Inquiry even further 
to include many other unrelated issues.” and that in this regard Meta IE “agrees with the DPC’s position 
in the Composite Memo that these unrelated issues raised by the CSAs are irrelevant to the resolution 
of this Inquiry and that expanding the scope of the Inquiry at this point would seriously infringe Meta 
Ireland’s procedural rights under both Irish and EU law120.” Meta IE also agrees with the IE SA’s position 
in the Composite Response that “expanding the scope of the Inquiry at this point as the CSAs propose 
would seriously infringe Meta Ireland’s legitimate expectations, right to fair procedures (including the 

                                              
116 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.9. 
117 In respect of Meta IE’s arguments in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 Submissions on these objections not being 
“relevant”, the EDPB recalls that the analysis of whether a given objection meets the threshold set by Art. 4(24) 
GDPR is carried out on a case-by-case basis. Meta IE refers to the EDPB’s Binding Decision 2/2022 and specifically 
to the paragraphs where the EDPB established that specific objections raised by the DE SAs and NO SA in that 
case were not relevant and reasoned. There are several differences between those objections and the objections 
which are analysed in this section.  
More specifically, in the Binding Decision 2/2022 the objections referred to by Meta IE did not “establish a direct 
connection with the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs 
139, 147, 164) whereas each CSA here has made several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, as is 
described in paragraph 77 of this Binding Decision. 
118 Meta IE does not consider that any of the objections are reasoned, as set out in their replies to each of the 
objections in Annex 1. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, pp. 66 - 124. In respect of Meta IE’s arguments 
in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 Submissions on these objections not being reasoned, the EDPB notes that the 
objections that were found to be not relevant and/or not reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 did “not 
provide sufficiently precise and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in 
question”, did not explain sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion proposed 
could be reached, or did not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for 
the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision 2/2022, 
paragraphs 140, 148, 165). Here, each CSA provides a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations 
as to why an infringement for lack of appropriate legal basis is to be established, and adequately identifies the 
risk posed by the Draft Decision if it was adopted unchanged (paragraphs 79-81 of this Binding Decision). 
119 “For instance, if the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised 
by the complainant or resulting from an infringement reported by a CSA, a relevant and reasoned objection may 
be raised based on the failure of the LSA to properly handle the complaint and to safeguard the rights of the data 
subject.” EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph. 27.

right to be heard) and rights of defence 121”. Despite claiming it this has been explained “clearly” in the 
Composite Response, Meta IE does not demonstrate in which manner its procedural rights would be 
inevitably  breached  by  the  mere  fact  that  the  EDPB  finds  specific  objections  admissible122. 
Admissibility determines the competence of the EDPB, but not the outcome of the dispute between 
the LSA and the CSAs. Likewise, Meta IE does not explain how the mere act of considering the merits 
of admissible objections inevitably and irreparably breaches the procedural rights cited by Meta IE 123.  
Accepting Meta IE’s interpretation would severely limit the EDPB possibility to resolve disputes arising 
in the one-stop-shop, and thus undermine the consistent application of the GDPR.  

77. 

The objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs all have a direct connection with the 
LSA  Draft Decision  and  refer to a  specific  part of  the Draft Decision,  i.e. Finding  2. All  of  those 
objections concern “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR” as they argue that the IE SA should 
have found an infringement of Article 6, 6(1) or (1)(b) of the GDPR. As the LSA considered that Article 
6(1)(b) of the GDPR was not breached, the objections entail a need of a change of the LSA decision 
leading to a different conclusion. Consequently, the EDPB finds that the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO 
and SE SAs objections relating to the infringement of Article 6, 6(1) or 6(1)(b) GDPR are relevant.  

78.  As regards the part of the DE SAs’ objection  arguing that the IE SA should  find an infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and impose the erasure of unlawfully processed personal data and the ban of the 
processing of data for the purpose of behavioural advertising until a valid legal basis is in place, the 
part of the FI SA objection asking that the infringement of Article 6(1) be properly reflected in the 
amount of the administrative fine, as well as the part of the NO SA objection arguing the IE SA should 
order Meta IE to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as well as order Meta IE 
to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising or from now on abstain from 
such processing activities, the EDPB notes that these parts of the objections concern “whether the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR.” These parts of the objections 
are linked to the IE SA’s Finding 2 with regard to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Therefore, they are directly 
connected  with  the substance  of  the Draft Decision  and,  if  followed,  would  lead  to  a different 
conclusion. Thus, the EDPB considers that these parts of the DE, FI and NO SAs objections are relevant. 

79. 

The objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs on the finding of an infringement are 
reasoned because they all include clarifications and arguments on legal/factual mistakes in the LSA’s 
Draft Decision that require amending. More specifically, the AT, DE, ES, FI, HU, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs 
provide detailed arguments to challenge the Draft Decision’s consideration of behavioural advertising 
as a necessary, core or fundamental aspect of a contract leading to the need to change the decision 
and to find  an infringement of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR124. Some of them provide detailed arguments

challenging the validity of the contract on which the use of Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis depends and 
which the IE SA accepts125.  

80. 

Some SAs recall, while referring to the terms of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
that it is  the fundamental and mutually  understood  contractual purpose, which  justifies  that the 
processing is necessary126. This purpose is not only based on the controller’s perspective but also on 
a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into the contract and thus on  “the mutual 
perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract”. The AT, NL, and SE SAs contend that data 
subjects  do not  reasonably expect that their data is  being processed  for personalised  advertising 
simply because Meta IE briefly refers to it in the Instagram Terms of Use127.  The FR and NO SAs also 
support this finding and add that data subjects cannot be presumed to be aware of the particularly 
massive and intrusive nature of this processing 128. Several SAs also consider that the Draft Decision is 
inconsistent in finding that information on specific processing operations should have been provided, 
linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described in an unambiguous manner, while considering that 
data subjects  had  a perspective or expectation or were well informed  that their data was being 
processed for behavioural advertising 129.  

81. 

The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs objections also identify risks posed by the Draft Decision, 
in particular an interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) that could be invoked  by any controller and would 
undermine or bypass data protection principles, and thus endanger the rights of data subjects within 
the EEA130.  

82.  Meta IE’s contends that in terms of risk, the objections must “demonstrate the likelihood  of a direct 
negative impact of a certain significance of the Draft Decision on fundamental rights and freedoms 
under the Charter and not just any data subject rights131.” Meta IE thus adds a condition to Article 
4(24) GDPR, which is not supported by the GDPR 132.  

83.  As regards the parts of the DE and NO SAs’ objections requesting the finding of an infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and the parts of the DE, FI and NO SAs’ objections requesting specific corrective 
measures under Article 58 GDPR for  the infringement of Article 6(1) or  6(1)(b)  GDPR, namely the 
imposition  of  an administrative fine, a ban of  the processing of  personal  data for the purpose  of 
behavioural advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and 
an order to identify a valid legal basis for future online behavioural advertising or to abstain from such 
processing  activities,  the  EDPB considers  that these  parts  of  the  objections  do  not  sufficiently 
elaborate the legal or factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision leading to 
the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR or to the imposition of the specific corrective

132 Article 1(2) GDPR provides that the GDPR itself “protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons 
and in particular their right to protection of personal data”, which directly stems from Article 8(1) of the Charter. 
Therefore, there is no reason to draw a distinction between the data subject rights protected by the GDPR and 
the fundamental rights protected under the Charter when interpreting Article 4(24) GDPR.

measures mentioned above. Likewise, the significance of the risk for the data subjects, which stems 
from the IE SA’s decision not to conclude on the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and not to impose 
the requested corrective measures, is not sufficiently demonstrated.  

84.  Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE 

SAs are relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR.  

85.  However, the parts of the DE and NO SAs’ objections concerning the additional infringement of Article 
5(1)(a)  GDPR and  the  imposition  of  specific    corrective measures, namely  the imposition  of  an 
administrative  fine,  a  ban  on  the  processing  of  personal  data for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and an order to 
identify  a valid  legal basis  for future  behavioural  advertising or  to abstain  from  such  processing 
activities are not reasoned and do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR Similarly, the part of 
the  FI  SA’s  objection  concerning  the  imposition  of  a  specific  corrective  measure,  namely  an 
administrative fine is not reasoned and does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.

4.4.2  Assessment on the merits 
In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure, the EDPB 
shall take a binding  decision  concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

 The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  needs  to  be  changed  insofar  as  it  rejects  the 
Complainant’s claim that the GDPR does  not permit Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR to 
process personal data in the context of its offering of the Instagram Terms of Use133. When assessing 
the merits  of  the objections  raised, the EDPB also  takes  into account  Meta IE’s position  on  the 
objections and its submissions. 

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

In its submissions, Meta IE argues that the objections lack merit. Meta IE considers that they are based 
on incorrect factual assumptions and are legally flawed134. Meta IE states that its reliance on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR does not ‘bypass’ the GDPR. Nor would it, according to Meta IE, jeopardise data subject 
rights, be limited to individually  negotiated agreements or be affected by Meta IE’s purported pre-
GDPR legal basis for processing conducted pre-GDPR 135.   

89.  Meta IE argues that there is a lack of factual material and evidence on the issues on which the CSAs 
raise objections, including on its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the specific processing operations 
it conducts in its Instagram service for the purposes of behavioural advertising 136. Meta IE notes that 
in its inquiry, the IE SA “only  addresses the issue  of  whether Meta Ireland may in principle  rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for purpose of behavioural advertising, but not the issue of whether Meta Ireland 

                                              
133 These objections being those of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs arguing that the IE SA should 
have found an infringement of Article 6(1)(b), 6(1) or 6 GDPR.

may in fact rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which would have required a detailed factual assessment of 
all of Meta Ireland’s data processing. 137“ 

90.  At the same time, Meta IE contends that, to address the complaint, the IE SA did not have to reach 
any conclusions  as to whether the actual processing conducted by  Meta IE to deliver behavioural 
advertising based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was lawful. 138 Meta IE supports  the IE’s position  that “it 
would not be appropriate to undertake substantial factual findings  for an open-ended assessment of 
all processing operations by Meta Ireland. 139” 

91.  Meta IE thus agrees with the finding the IE SA reached on Meta IE’s not being precluded from relying 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of data necessary to deliver behavioural advertising upon 
the IE SA’s review of the Instagram Terms of Use and the nature of the Instagram service as described 
in those terms140.  

92.  Meta  IE  defends  that  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  can  be  relied  on  as  a  legal  basis  for  behavioural 
advertising 141. Meta IE argues that its application requires the assessment of whether a given data 
processing  operation,  when  properly  investigated  and  analysed,  is  actually  necessary  for  the 
performance of a contract 142. Meta IE notes that the provision of a personalised experience, including 
in the form of behavioural advertising, is  “core” to the Instagram Service (as per the Terms of Use 
which govern the contractual relationship between Meta IE and Instagram users)143.  

93.  Meta IE argues that the Terms of Use make clear that users will be shown advertising personalised to 
their interests under the heading “Connecting you with brands,  products, and  services in  ways  you 
care about”144. Meta IE supports the DPC’s finding, based on its review of the Instagram Terms of Use 
and that Instagram is “promoted as such”, that an average user who accepts the Terms of Use would 
have the expectation that personalisation, including in the form of behavioural advertising, forms a 
core and integral part of the Instagram of Service145. Meta IE backs this argument with a reference to 
a survey  and a study  conducted by  a private entity and a digital industry  association146. Meta IE 
considers  that its  compliance  with the  GDPR’s transparency obligations  involves  a separate and 
different legal assessment from Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 147. Meta IE considers demonstrated in this case 
that Meta IE and its users have a mutual expectation that personalisation, including in the form of 
behavioural ads, is core to its Terms of Use148.  

94.  Meta IE recalls that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not categorically prohibit 
reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for behavioural advertising 149. Meta IE further adds, referring to the

CJEU’s Huber judgment, that “processing beyond the most minimal required to achieve the processing 
purpose could  still be deemed ‘necessary’ if  it allowed the relevant processing purpose  to be ‘more 
effectively’ achieved”150. Meta IE submits that even if Article 6(1)(b) GDPR required the processing to 
be absolutely  essential to perform the contract, it would  be impossible  to provide the  Instagram 
Service in accordance with the Term of Use without providing behavioural advertising 151. Meta IE 
states that the EDPB may not dictate the nature of the services Meta IE provides. Meta IE would view 
this as a violation of Article 16 of the Charter on the freedom to conduct a business, enabling service 
providers to determine what measures to take in order to achieve the result they seek, based on their 
resources, abilities, and compatibility with other obligations and challenges they may encounter in the 
exercise of their activity152.  

95.  Meta IE further argues that its reliance on the contractual necessity legal basis does not jeopardise 
data subject rights153. Meta IE considers that these would also be protected by contract and consumer 
protection legislations in the EU Member States154. Meta IE defends that the contractual necessity 
legal basis is not limited to individually negotiated agreements and can also be used for standard form 
contracts155. Meta IE further adds that it would be improper for CSAs and the EDPB to analyse the 
validity  of Instagram Terms of  Use under  applicable laws of  contract or  to draw inferences  from 
them156. In response to what Meta IE considers mischaracterisations in certain objections of national 
contract law Meta IE provides expert reports on the validity of its Terms of Use in 10 Member States157.  

96.  Meta IE concludes its arguments in support of its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR stating that its pre-
GDPR legal basis for data processing does not affect its flexibility to rely on other legal bases post GDPR 
if it complies with the relevant requirements158. Meta IE also distinguishes behavioural advertising on 
the Instagram Service from direct marketing pursuant to Article 21(2) GDPR and thus considers this 
provision not applicable to behavioural advertising 159.  

The EDPB’s assessment of the merits 

97. 

The EDPB considers it necessary to begin its assessment on the merits with a general description of 
the practice of  behavioural advertising carried out in the context of the  Instagram service before 
determining whether the legal basis  of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR is appropriate for this  practice in the 
present case, based on the Instagram Terms of Use and the nature of its products and features as 
described in those terms. The requests for preliminary rulings made to the CJEU in the cases C-252/21 
and C-446/21 to which some of the documents in the file refer contain helpful descriptions of Meta’s

behavioural advertising practices in the context of its Facebook services160. Given that behavioural 
advertising is  also  carried out  in  the context of  the Instagram service,  and given  the similarities 
between the two services, relying on the same Data Policy161, the EDPB considers that these cases are 
also useful in gaining an understanding of the practice of behavioural advertising in relation to the 
Instagram service.  Furthermore,  in  the  request  for  a  preliminary  ruling  in  case  C-252/21,  it  is 
mentioned that if the CJEU answers the question 7 positively (regarding the competence of a Member 
State national competition authority to determine, when assessing the balance of interests whether 
data processing and their terms comply with the GDPR) that the questions 3 to 5 must be answered 
in  relation to data from the use  of  the group’s Instagram service. 162 In addition,  Meta IE makes 
reference to both of these requests for preliminary rulings in its submissions,  and therefore clearly 
considers them relevant to this case163. 

98. 

These requests for preliminary rulings mention that Meta IE collects data on its individual users and 
their activities on and off its Facebook service via numerous means such as the service itself, other 
services of the Meta group including Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus, third party websites and apps 
via integrated programming interfaces such as Facebook Business Tools or via cookies, social plug-ins, 
pixels  and  comparable technologies  placed on  the internet user’s  computer or mobile  device164. 
According to the descriptions provided, Meta IE links these data with the user’s Facebook account to 
enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based on their consumer 
behaviour,  interests, purchasing  power  and  personal  situation. This  may also  include  the  user’s 
physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers its services to its

(Facebook Products or Products). You can find additional tools and information in the Facebook Settings and 
Instagram Settings.”) Section I of this policy refers to the “Facebook products” when describing the kinds of 
information collected for the  processing. Instagram Data Policy of 22.05.2018, annex 2 of  the  Instagram 
Complaint. Similarly, according to Instagram Terms of Use “Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which 
share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you  (...) in order 
to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook 
Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across

funded by advertising and offers personalised content and advertising, network security, product improvement 
and continuous, seamless use of all of its group products in its terms of service, justify collecting data for these 
purposes from other group services and third-party websites and apps via integrated interfaces such as Facebook

device, linking those data with the user’s Facebook.com account and using them, on the ground of necessity for

interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR?”

in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way.  

99. 

The EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale 
and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook 
service, as well as off the Facebook service itself, through third party websites and apps which are 
connected to Facebook.com via programming interfaces (“Facebook Business Tools”), including the 
Instagram service165. Furthermore, among the aspects described in the Instagram Terms of Use is 
“Providing  consistent  and  seamless  experiences across  other Facebook  Company  Products.” which 
involves “shar[ing] technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have 
about you.” It is therefore clear that personal data is shared between Facebook companies (”We use 
data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to 
show you ads (...)” 

100.  These are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal 
basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users  may understand and expect 
behavioural advertising when they accept the Instagram Terms of Use and perceive it as necessary for 
Meta IE to deliver its service166.  Accordingly, the EDPB further considers that the IE SA could have 
added to its Draft Decision a description of behavioural advertising that Meta IE conducts through the 
Instagram service to  appropriately substantiate its  reasoning leading  to its  acceptance of  Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for that practice in accordance with the IE SA’s duty to state the reasons 
for an individual decision167.  

101.  Notwithstanding  the  EDPB’s  considerations  above,  the  EDPB  considers  that  there  is  sufficient 
information in the file for the EDPB to decide whether the IE SA needs to change its Draft Decision 
insofar as it rejects the complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit Meta IE’s reliance on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its offering of the Instagram service, based on 
its Terms of Use. 

102.  As described  above in  section 4.1., the IE SA concludes  in Finding  2 of its Draft Decision  that the 
Complainant’s case was not made out that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by Meta IE on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Terms of Use, neither Article 6(1)(b) GDPR nor any other 
provision of the GDPR precludes Meta IE from relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to deliver

assessment. These requirements essentially serve the purpose of legal certainty and legal protection of the

and complainant should be able to acknowledge all the reasons in order to decide whether they should bring

a service, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms a core part of the service168. The IE 
SA considers that, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service 
provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a 
legal basis  of  the processing  of  users’ data necessary  for  the provision  of  its  Instagram service, 
including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of its service 
offered to and accepted by its users169. The IE SA considers the core of the service offered by Meta IE 
is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising 170. The IE SA considers a reasonable user would 
understand and expect this having read the Terms of Use171. Meta IE supports this conclusion of the 
IE SA172. 

103.  To assess these claims of the IE SA and Meta IE, the EDPB considers it necessary to recall the general 
objectives that the GDPR pursues, which must guide its interpretation, together with the wording of 
its provisions and its normative context 173. 

104.  The GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of 
the EU Charter of  Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the TFEU, which constitute EU primary 
law174. As the CJEU clarified, “an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to 
affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions 
of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, 
preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary 
law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law”175. In the 
face of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and sharing, the 
GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong 
enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control of their own personal 
data 176. By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection throughout the 
EU, the  GDPR seeks  to ensure  the free movement  of  personal  data within  the EU177. The GDPR 
acknowledges that the right to data protection needs to be balanced against other fundamental rights 
and  freedoms,  such  as  the  freedom  to  conduct  a business,  in  accordance with  the principle  of 
proportionality and has these considerations integrated into its provisions178. The GDPR, pursuant to 
EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to a data subject and his/her 
dignity, and not as a commodity data subjects can trade away through a contract 179. The CJEU provided

additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy 
and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests180.  

105.  The principle of lawfulness of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to the 
protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process 
the personal data of individuals if it is able to rely on one of the bases found in the exhaustive and 
restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR 181.  

106.  The principle of lawfulness goes hand in hand with the principles of fairness and transparency in Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR. The principle of fairness includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of 
the data subjects, considering possible  adverse consequences  processing may have on them, and 
having  regard  to  the  relationship  and  potential  effects  of  imbalance  between  them  and  the 
controller182.  

107.  The EDPB agrees with the IE SA and Meta IE that there is no hierarchy between these legal bases183. 
However, this does not mean that a controller, as Meta IE in the present case, has absolute discretion 
to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller may only rely on one 
of the legal bases established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the processing at stake184. A 
specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet its requirements set by the 
GDPR and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons and 
in particular their right to the protection of personal data 185. The legal basis will not be appropriate if 
its application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect “effet utile” pursued by the GDPR 
and Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR 186. These criteria stem from the content of the GDPR and the 
interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given thereto described in paragraph 104 
above 187. 

108.  The GDPR makes Meta IE, as a data controller for the processing at stake, directly responsible  for 
complying  with the  Regulation’s principles,  including  the processing  of  data in  a lawful, fair and 
transparent manner, and any obligations derived therefrom188. This obligation applies even where the

184 As mentioned in the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, paragraph 18, the identification of the 
appropriate lawful basis is tied to  the  principles of fairness and purpose limitation. It will be difficult for 
controllers to comply with these principles if they have not first clearly identified the purposes of the processing, 
or if processing of personal data goes beyond what is necessary for the specified purposes. See also Section 6 of

practical application of GDPR principles such  as those of  Article 5(1)(a) and  Article (5)(2)  GDPR is 
inconvenient  or runs counter to the commercial interests of Meta IE and its business  model. The 
controller is also obliged to be able to demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations 
derived therefrom, such as that it meets the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis189.  

109.  The first condition  to be able to rely on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a legal basis  to process the data 
subject’s data is that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, 
has to be able to demonstrate that (a) a contract exists and (b) the contract is valid pursuant to 
applicable national contract laws190. 

110.  Both the IE SA and Meta IE consider that the Terms of Use make up the entire agreement between 
the Instagram user and Meta IE and that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document setting out 
information to fulfil the GDPR transparency obligations191. The IE SA thus considers that the contract 
for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR takes place, is the Terms of Use192.   

111.  The IE SA and  Meta IE argue that the GDPR does not confer a broad and  direct competence to 

supervisory authorities to interpret or assess the validity of contracts193.  

112.  The EDPB agrees that SAs do not have under the GDPR a broad and general competence in contractual 
matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks that the GDPR bestows on SAs imply 
a limited competence to assess a contract’s general validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment 
of their tasks under the GDPR. Otherwise, the SAs would see their monitoring and enforcement task 
under Article 57(1)(a) GDPR limited to actions such as verifying whether the processing at stake is 
necessary for the performance of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a 
processor under Article 28(3) GDPR and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate 
safeguards pursuant to the GDPR. Pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation, the SAs would thus be obliged 
to always consider a contract valid, even in situations where it is manifestly evident that it is not, for 
instance because there is no proof of agreement between the two parties, or because the contract 
does not comply with its Member State’s rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in 
relation to a child194.  

113.  As the DE and NL SAs195 argue, the validity of the contract for the Instagram service between Meta IE 
and the complainant is questionable, given the strong indications that the Complainant was unaware 
of entering into a contract, and (as the IE SA establishes with its Finding 3 of its Draft Decision) serious 
transparency issues  in relation to the legal basis relied on. In contract law, as a general rule, both 
parties must be aware of the substance of the contract and the obligations of both parties to the 
contract in order to willingly enter into such contract.

114.  Notwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB, refers to its previous interpretative 
guidance  on  this  matter to  provide  below  its  analysis on  whether behavioural advertising is 
objectively necessary for Meta IE to provide its Instagram service to the user based on its Terms of 
Use and the nature of the service196.   

115.  The EDPB recalls197 that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “[i]t is important 
to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is 
against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance”198. As 
the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of 
the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively 
necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject 199. 

116.  Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing 
by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only 
on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into 
the contract 200. 

117.  The  IE  SA  accepts  the  EDPB’s position  that, as  a  general rule,  processing  of  personal  data for 
behavioural  advertising is  not  necessary for the performance of  a contract for online  services201. 
However, the IE SA considers  that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the 
contract and the nature of the Instagram service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE 
may in principle rely on Article 6(1)b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of 
its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part 
of that service offered to and accepted by users202.  

118.  The IE SA views behavioural advertising as “the core of both Meta Ireland’s business  model and the 
bargain struck between Meta Ireland and Instagram users” 203. In support of this consideration, the IE 
SA refers to the ”first and  sixth clauses” of “the specific contract entered into between Meta IE and 
Instagram users”204. The IE SA considers that from the text of these “clauses” it is “clear that the core 
of the service offered by Meta Ireland is premised on the delivery of personalised advertising. 205” The 
IE SA considers that this position is supported by the fact that “the Terms of Use describe the Instagram 
service  as  being  ‘personalised’  and  connects  users  with  brands,  including  by  means  of  providing 
‘relevant’ advertising and  content.” Based on this, the IE SA is of the view that “It is  clear that the 
Instagram  service  is  advertised  as  offering  a  'personalised'  experience, including  by  way  of  the 
advertising it delivers to users206.” The IE SA considers that as the Instagram service is “advertised” in 
its Terms of Use “as  being  predicated on  personalised  advertising  (...) any  reasonable user  would

that “users may prefer that the market offer alternative choices207.” 

119.  On this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under 
EU  law. It must  be  interpreted  in  a  manner  that  fully  reflects  the  objective  pursued  by  an  EU 
instrument, in this case, the GDPR 208. Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision  and the GDPR’s general objective of 
protecting the right to the protection of personal data or contradicts Article 8 of the Charter209. On 
the  processing  of  data  in  the  Facebook  services,  Advocate  General  Rantos  supports  a  strict 
interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR among other legal bases, particularly to avoid any circumvention 
of  the  requirement  for  consent 210.  Given  the  similarities  between  the  Facebook  and  Instagram 
services, as explained above in paragraph 97, and the fact that this case may concern the legal basis 
for processing of personal data for the Instagram service211. 

120.  As the IE SA states in its Draft Decision, “Instagram is  a  global  online social  network service which 
allows  registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video 
calls  and  video  chats,  and  by  sending  images  and  video  files212.”  Meta IE promotes  among  its 
prospective and current users the perception that the main purpose of the Instagram service and for 
which it processes its users’ data is to enable them to share content and communicate with others. 
Meta IE presents its Instagram service on its “About” page of its website as a platform which “give[s] 
people the power to build  community and bring[s] the world closer together 213.” At the beginning of 
its Terms of Use, Meta IE presents its mission for the Instagram service as “To bring you closer to the 
people  and  things  you  love 214.” The description  of  the  aspects of  the service  includes  “Offering 
personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate.” 

121.  The fact that the Terms of Use do not provide for any contractual obligation binding Meta IE to offer 
personalised advertising to the Instagram users and any contractual penalty if Meta IE fails to do so 
shows that, at least from the perspective of the Instagram user, this processing is not necessary to 
perform the contract 215. Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation between

214 Both the IE SA and Meta IE consider the Instagram Terms of Use as constituting the entire contract between 
Meta IE and the Instagram users (see paragraphs 92, 110 and 118 of this Binding Decision).  
215 The Instagram Terms of Use are formulated in one-sided terms as follows: “These Terms of Use govern your 
use of Instagram and provide information about the Instagram Service (...).“ While under the first heading of the 
Terms of Use (“The Instagram Service”), Instagram announces that it “provide[s]“ the Instagram service. After 
describing the aspects of the service and referencing the Data Policy, the Instagram Terms of Use include a

Meta IE and the specific advertisers that pay for Meta IE’s targeted display of their advertisements in 
the  Instagram service  to  Instagram users,  but  it  is  not  presented  as  an obligation  towards the 
Instagram users.  

122.  Nor does Meta IE’s business model of offering services, at no monetary cost for the user to generate 
income by behavioural advertisement to support its Instagram service make this processing necessary 
to perform the contract. Under the principle  of lawfulness  of the GDPR and its Article 6, it is the 
business model which must adapt itself and comply with the requirements that the GDPR sets out in 
general and for each of the legal bases and not the reverse. As the Advocate General Rantos stressed 
recently in  his opinion  on Meta IE’s processing in Facebook, based  on Article 5(2) GDPR, it is the 
controller (Meta IE) in this case who is  responsible  for demonstrating that the personal  data are 
processed in accordance with the GDPR 216.  

123.  As the EDPB provided in its guidance, “Assessing what is ‘necessary’ involves a combined, fact-based 
assessment of the processing ‘for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared to 
other  options  for  achieving  the  same  goal’.  If  there are  realistic,  less  intrusive  alternatives,  the 
processing is not ‘necessary’. Article 6(1)(b) will not cover processing which is useful but not objectively 
necessary for performing the contractual service or  for taking  relevant pre-contractual steps at the 
request of the data subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes. 217” 

124.  On  the  question  of  whether  here  there  are  realistic,  less  intrusive  alternatives to  behavioural 
advertising that make this processing not “necessary”218, the EDPB considers that there are. The AT 
and SE SAs mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, 
which do not involve intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users219. In his recent opinion 
on  Facebook,  Advocate  General  Rantos  also  refers  to  the  Austrian  Government’s  “pertinent” 
observation that in  the past, Meta IE allowed Facebook users  to choose between a chronological 
presentation and a personalised presentation of newsfeed content, which, in his view, proves that an 
alternative method is possible220. By considering the existence of alternative practices to behavioural 
advertising that are more respectful of the Instagram users’ right to data protection, the EDPB, as the 
Advocate General did in relation to Facebook users, aims to assess  if this processing is  objectively 
                                              
section which is headed with “Your Commitments”. While Instagram itself only “offers” various services, it makes 
clear that the Instagram Terms of Use unilaterally impose duties and obligations on the user. Otherwise, the 
user may face suspension or termination of their account, as described under “Content Removal and Disabling 
or Terminating Your Account” of the Instagram Terms of Use. No (contractual) sanctions appear to apply in the 
event that Meta IE fails to provide or poorly performs one or more of these services.

necessary to deliver the service offered, as perceived by the Instagram user whose personal data is 
processed, and not to dictate the nature of Meta IE’s service or impose specific business models on 
controllers, as Meta IE and the IE SA respectively argue221. The EDPB considers  that Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR does not cover processing which  is useful  but not objectively necessary for  performing the 
contractual service, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business purposes222.  

125.  The EDPB considers that the absolute right available to data subjects, under Article 21(2)(3) GDPR to 
object  to the  processing  of  their data (including  profiling)  for  direct marketing purposes  further 
supports  its consideration that, as a general rule, the processing of  personal data for behavioural 
advertising is not necessary to perform a contract. The processing cannot be necessary to perform a 
contract if a data subject has the possibility to opt out from it at any time, and without providing any 
reason. 

126.  The EDPB finds that a reasonable user cannot expect that their personal data is being processed for 
behavioural advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to this processing in its Instagram Terms 
of Use (which Meta IE and the IE SA consider as constituting the entirety of the contract), or because 
of the “wider circumstances” or “recognised public awareness of this form of processing” derived from 
its “widespread prevalence of OBA processing” to which the IE SA refers223. Behavioural advertising, 
as briefly described in paragraph 98 above, is a set of processing operations of personal data of great 
technical  complexity,  which  has  a  particularly  massive  and  intrusive  nature.  In  view  of  the 
characteristics of behavioural advertising, coupled with the very brief and insufficient information that 
Meta provides about it in the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy (a separate document that the 
IE SA and Meta IE do not even consider part of the contractual obligations), the EDPB finds it  extremely 
difficult to argue that an average user can fully grasp it, be aware of its consequences and impact on 
their rights to privacy and data protection, and reasonably expect it solely based on the Instagram 
Terms of Use. The EDPB recalls its Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in which it argues that 
the expectations of the average data subject need to be consider in light, not only of the terms of 
service but also the way this service is promoted  to users224. Advocate General Rantos expresses 
similar doubts where he says in relation to Facebook behavioural advertising practices “I am curious 
as to what extent the processing might correspond to the expectations of an average user and, more 
generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up 
for”225 and adds in a footnote that he does not “believe that the collection and use of personal data 
outside  Facebook  are necessary  for  the provision  of  the  services offered  as  part  of  the  Facebook 
profile”226. 

127.  The  EDPB notes  that the mission  of  the Instagram service,  as expressed  in  its  Terms of  Use,  is 
formulated in a vague and broad manner (“To bring you closer to the people and things  you love.”) 
When  using  the Instagram service, a user  is  primarily  confronted  with the  possibility  of  viewing

photographs and videos by people or organisations that they follow, as well as sharing such content 
with their followers. This is acknowledged by the IE SA which provides the following description of the 
Instagram service in  its Draft Decision: “Instagram is  a  global  online  social  network service which 
allows  registered users to communicate with other registered users through messages, audio, video 
calls and video chats, and by sending images and video files227.” 

128.  Based on the considerations above, the EDPB considers that the main purpose for which users use 
Instagram and accept its Terms of Use is to share content and communicate with others, not to receive 
personalised advertisements.  

129.  Meta IE infringed its transparency obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) 
GDPR by not  clearly informing  the complainant and other users  of  the Instagram Service  specific 
processing operations, the personal data processed in them, the specific purposes they serve, and the 
legal basis  on  which  each of  the processing  operations relies, as the IE SA concludes  in  its Draft 
Decision228.  The  EDPB  considers  that  this  fundamental  failure  of  Meta  IE  to  comply  with  its 
transparency obligations contradicts the IE SA’s finding that Instagram users could reasonably expect 
online behavioural advertising as being necessary for the performance of their contract (as described 
in the Instagram Terms of Use) with Meta IE229.  

130.  The EDPB recalls that “controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable 
legal basis is” and that this is “particularly relevant where the appropriate legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects”, because “[d]epending 
on  the circumstances, data  subjects may  erroneously get the impression  that they  are giving  their 
consent in line  with Article 6(1)(a)  GDPR when signing  a contract or accepting terms of  service”230. 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR requires the existence, validity of a contract, and the processing being necessary 
to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the Parties (in this case the data subject) 
is not provided with sufficient information to know that they are signing a contract, the processing of 
personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes  and on which legal basis, and how this 
processing is necessary to perform the services delivered. These transparency requirements are not 
only an additional and separate obligation, as the IE SA seems to imply, but also an indispensable and 
constitutive part of the legal basis231. 

131.  The  risks  to  the  rights  of  data  subjects  derived  from  this  asymmetry  of  information  and  an 
inappropriate reliance on this legal basis are higher in situations such as in the present case, in which 
the Complainant and other Instagram users face a “take it or leave it” situation resulting from the 
standard contract pre-formulated by Meta IE and the lack of few alternative services in the market. 
The EU legislator has regularly identified and aimed to address with multiple legal instruments these 
risks and the imbalance between the parties to consumer contracts. For example, Directive 93/13/EEC

on unfair terms in consumer contracts232 mandates, as the transparency obligations under the GDPR, 
the use of  plain, intelligible language in the terms of  the contracts offered to consumers233. This 
Directive even provides that where there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation 
most favourable to the consumer shall prevail234. Processing of personal data that is based on what is 
deemed to be an unfair term under this Directive will generally not be consistent with the requirement 
under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that the processing is lawful and fair235. 

132.  Advocate General Rantos concludes in reference to Meta IE that the fact that an undertaking providing 
a social network enjoys  a dominant position  in the domestic market for online social network for 
private users “does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that 
provision, which it is  for the controller to demonstrate, taking into account, where appropriate, the 
existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement 
for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of 
the services in  question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and  the 
need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it 236.” In line 
with the logic of this argument, the EDPB considers that the dominant position of Meta IE also plays 
an important role in the assessment of Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for its Instagram 
service  and its  risks  to data subjects,  especially considering  how  deficiently  Meta IE informs  the 
Instagram users of the data it strictly needs to process to deliver the service. 

133.  Given that the main purpose for which a user uses Instagram service is to share and receive content, 
and communicate with others237, and that Meta IE conditions their use to the user’s acceptance of a 
contract and the behavioural advertising they include, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have 
the option of opting out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to 
argue238. The users’ lack of choice in this respect would rather indicate that Meta IE’s reliance on the 
contractual performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their 
consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and 7 and/or to object to the processing of their data based on Article 
6(1)(f) GDPR. 

134.  The EDPB agrees with the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs that there is a risk that the Draft 
Decision’s failure to establish Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR, pursuant to the IE SA’s 
interpretation of it, nullifies this provision  and makes lawful theoretically any collection and reuse of 
personal  data in connection  with  the performance of  a contract with  a data subject 239. Meta IE 
currently leaves the complainant and other users of the Instagram service with a single choice. They 
may either contract away their right to freely determine the processing of their personal data and 
                                              
232 A  contractual term that has not been individually negotiated is unfair under the Directive 93/13/EEC “if, 
contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations 
arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer” Article 3(1).

submit to its processing for the obscure, and intrusive purpose of behavioural advertising, which they 
can neither expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information Meta IE provides to 
them. Or, they may decline accepting Instagram Terms of Use and thus be excluded from a service 
that enables them to communicate, share content with and receive content from millions of users and 
for which there are currently few realistic alternatives. This exclusion would thus also adversely affect 
their freedom of expression and information.  

135.  This precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal 
basis of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There would be the risk that 
some  controllers  argue some  connection  between  the processing  of  the personal  data of  their 
consumers and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as 
possible  and advance their economic interests at the expense of the safeguards for data subjects. 
Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as legal basis,  instead of  others  such  as  consent  (Article 6(1)(a)  GDPR) and 
legitimate  interest  (Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR),  are  the  possibility  to  specifically  consent  to  certain 
processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 
6(4) GDPR); their freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 
GDPR); and the balancing exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests 
or fundamental rights and freedoms (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). As a result, owing to the number of users 
of the Instagram service, the market power, and influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive 
business model, the risks derived from the current findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the 
Complainant and the millions of users of Instagram service in the EEA and affect the protection of the 
hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR 240.   

136.  The EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU, NL, NO and SE SAs 241 to Finding 
2 of the Draft Decision in that the behavioural advertising performed by Meta IE in the context of 
the Instagram service is objectively not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s alleged contract 
with data users for the Instagram service and is not an essential or core element of it.  

137.  In conclusion, the EDPB decides that the Meta IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to 
process the complainant’s personal data in the context of Instagram Terms of Use and therefore lacks 
a legal basis to process these data for the purposes of behavioural advertising. Meta IE has not relied 
on any other legal basis to process personal data in the context of the Instagram Terms of Use for the 
purposes  of  behavioural  advertising.  Meta  IE  has  consequently  infringed  Article  6(1)  GDPR  by 
unlawfully processing personal data. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding  2 of its Draft 
Decision which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering

that it “provides the Instagram service to  hundreds of millions of users across the European region.” Draft 
Decision, paragraph 223. In its submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision, Meta IE stated that the correct 
figure for monthly active accounts for the Instagram Service as of 31 August 2018 (the date of commencement 
of the Inquiry) is approximately 
, while clarifying that this number represents active accounts on 
Instagram rather than unique users and thus does not represent the number of unique users. This figure does 
not include UK-based accounts as Meta IE considered accounts in that territory were not relevant for the Inquiry.

Complaint. Meta IE’s Reponse to the Preliminary Draft Decision, paragraph 14.13. Draft Decision, paragraph 223.

5  ON WHETHER THE LSA’S DRAFT DECISION INCLUDES ENOUGH 
ANALYSIS AND EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE THAT META IE IS NOT 
OBLIGED TO RELY ON CONSENT TO PROCESS THE COMPLAINANT’S 
PERSONAL DATA 

5.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

138.  The IE SA concludes as a matter of fact, in its Draft Decision that Meta IE did not rely, and did not seek 
to rely, on the complainant’s consent to process personal data in connection with the Terms of Use242 
and is not legally obliged to rely on consent to do so243.  

139.  The IE SA accepts that Meta IE never sought to obtain consent from users through the clicking of the 

“Agree to Terms” button, based also on Meta IE’s confirmation thereto244.  

140.  The IE SA distinguishes between agreeing to a contract (which may involve the processing of data) and 
providing  consent  to  personal  data processing  specifically  for  the  purposes  of  legitimising  that 
personal data processing under the GDPR 245. The IE SA observes that, as noted by the EDPB, these are 
entirely different concepts which “have different requirements and legal consequences”246. 

141.  The IE SA also emphasises that there is no hierarchy between the legal basis that controllers may use 
to process personal data under the GDPR 247. The IE SA further argues that neither Article 6(1) GDPR 
nor any other provision in the GDPR require that the processing of data in particular contexts must 
necessarily be based on consent 248. The IE SA argues the GDPR does not provide that the specific 
nature and content of a contract, freely entered into by two parties, requires a higher category or 
“default” legal basis. The IE SA includes reference to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR which assert that where data processing is necessary to perform a contract, consent is not an 
appropriate lawful basis on which to rely249.  

142.  The IE SA considers Article 7 GDPR and its conditions do not in and of themselves indicate the legal 
basis  on which  a controller should  rely on  in a particular context. The IE SA contends  that these 
conditions would only be relevant where the controller relies upon consent as the legal basis for its 
processing, which it views as not being the case for the processing of data by Meta IE in question250.

5.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

143.  The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs object to the assessment in the Draft Decision on consent, leading to 
Finding 1 of the IE SA251. These SAs put forward several factual and legal arguments for the changes 
they propose to the Draft Decision.  

144.  The SE SA holds that if the EDPB were to find that the processing can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the 
investigation needs to encompass whether special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) 
GDPR are processed, since the performance of a contract is not an exemption pursuant to Article 9(2) 
GDPR. Since the SE SA presents its objection as being contingent on whether the EDPB finds that the 
data processing in Instagram, based on its Terms of Use, can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 252 and the 
EDPB finds that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (see above in Section 4.4.2), the 
SE SA objection is no longer applicable.   

Arguments on the finding of the LSA that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent 

145.  The AT, DE and NL SAs consider that the IE SA has not included enough analysis, evidence and research 
in the Draft Decision to conclude that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process the 
complainants’ data 253.  

146.  The AT SA points out that the IE SA limits its facts and its legal assessment to the general question 
whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be used as legal basis, specifically for behavioural advertising. The 
Draft Decision does not clarify which data categories are being used for behavioural advertising and 
where  Meta  IE  relies  on  Articles  6(1)(a)  and  6(1)(b)  GDPR  for  behavioural  advertising.  Also 
unaddressed  is,  if  and  to  which  extent Meta  IE relies  on  Article  9(2)(a)  GDPR for  behavioural 
advertising as far as sensitive data are concerned and whether Meta IE respected the GDPR conditions 
(for example, Article 7 GDPR) when obtaining the consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) 
GDPR. The AT SA argues that the Draft Decision did  not address the part of the complaint on the 
differences between “consent” and “contractual performance” and regarding Article 9 GDPR 254.  

147.  Even though the DE SAs share the IE SA’s finding that Meta IE did not rely on consent for the processing 
of data as described in the Instagram Terms of Use, the DE SAs objects against the IE SA’s assessment 
that  in  the  specific  case  at  issue  Meta IE  was  not  legally  obliged  to  obtain  consent  from  the 
Complainant 255. The DE SAs further add, also in relation to the potential use of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as 
a legal basis, that further investigations on the specific processing activities, purposes and their risks 
for rights and freedoms of the Complainant would be necessary to conclude an assessment on the 
applicable legal basis256.  

148.  The NL SA notes its view that there is lack of any substantive investigation into what kind of personal 
data is  being processed besides  relying on  information submitted  by the controller257. The NL SA

considers that there are clear indications that consent is legally required for (parts of) the processing 
operations of the controller, and that the IE SA could thus draw a different conclusion on the basis of 
further inquiries and analysis258. The NL SA considers that the Draft Decision should be amended if a 
further inquiry by the IE SA establishes that the reliance on consent as a legal ground is mandatory259. 

149.  In addition, the DE and FR SAs consider that even if Meta IE had relied on consent, it would not have 
met the requirements of Article 7(1) GDPR as being “freely given”, as it is conditional on the use of 
their services as a whole (“take it or leave it”). Nor would consent meet the requirements of Article 
7(2) GDPR since, as the IE SA finds, information on the processing of data as described in the Terms of 
Use, is not provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and 
plain language260.   

Arguments on the possible breach of the obligation to rely on consent to process special categories of 
personal data (Article 9 GDPR) 

150.  The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs  consider that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed 
any processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of Instagram 
Terms of Use261. The DE SAs conclude that Meta IE processes the complainant’s special categories of 
data in breach of Article 9 (1) GDPR 262. The AT, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs take the view that the IE SA should 
broaden the scope of  its investigation and examine whether the conditions  for the processing  of 
special categories of personal data have been met by Meta IE263. 

151.  The AT, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs consider that the factual background of the Draft Decision misses facts 
on whether Meta IE relies on Article 9(1)(a) GDPR to process special categories of personal data for 
the purpose of behavioural advertising and whether Meta IE respects the requirements of the GDPR, 
such as those of Article 7, in obtaining consent to that end264. 

152.  The FR and NL SAs  argue that the data that Meta IE processes may include  special categories of 
personal  data under  Article 9  GDPR 265. The  DE SAs  contend  that nothing  indicates  that Meta IE 
excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes266.  

153.  The FR SA notes that Instagram users can provide various sensitive data about themselves, including 
their sexual orientation, religious views and political opinions in the description of their profile. The 
FR SA considers that the IE SA cannot simply state that it has no evidence that Meta IE processes such 
data in the context of the Instagram service. In order to deal with the complaint, the FR SA asks for

further investigation, in particular it asks the LSA to examine whether sensitive data are processed by 
the controller and, if so, whether one of the conditions of Article 9(2) GDPR is met in this case267.  

154.  The NL SA argues that there is strong indication that some data processed in  the context of the 
Instagram service actually belongs to a special category of data considering “photographs and other 
images that are, or were, potentially processed with use of  facial recognition technology and other 
artificial intelligence technologies in  the context of  Facebook services”268. The NL SA highlights that 
according to the CJEU ruling in case C-136/17 the mere indexing of certain data could already suffice 
to conclude that Article 9 GDPR applies269.  

155.  The DE and NL SAs recall that only consent may be used in this context among the exceptions that 
Article 9 (2) GDPR lays down to the general prohibition of processing special categories of data270. The 
FI SA recalls that the performance of a contract is not an exception pursuant to Article 9(2) GDPR 271.  

Arguments on other types of data requiring consent 

156.  The NL SA identifies as another indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation 
to seek consent the fact that the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has 
been collected through cookies for online advertising purposes and of location data272.  

Risks 

157.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs consider that, as the subject of the complaint was 
the processing  as described in  the Instagram Terms of Use  there is  also a significant risk  for the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of all Instagram users in the European Union that their personal 
data, including data of special categories are processed  without any legal basis273. The AT SA also 
considers that the compliance of Meta IE with the GDPR rules on the processing of special categories 
of data goes beyond the case at stake and affects hundreds of millions of data subjects within the EEA, 
as Meta IE is the provider of the biggest media network in the world274. 

158.  The AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs argue that the IE SA’s conclusion that consent is not required affects the 

rights of data subjects and their control over their personal data 275.  

159.  The AT  SA argues that the first  risk  is  that the data subject’s  right to  lodge a  complaint with a 
supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because the IE SA did not 
handle the complaint in its entire scope, including sensitive data pursuant to Article 9 GPDR. The AT

SA  argues that this  is  not in  line with  the CJEU ruling in  case C-311/18, which  provides  that the 
supervisory authority must handle complaints with all due diligence276.  

160.  The FR SA argues that the Draft Decision poses a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
individuals  concerned, according to  Article 4(24)  GDPR, insofar  as  the legal basis  of  contractual 
performance to process the personal data of Instagram users to send them targeted advertising does 
not allow the European users to have control over the fate of their data 277. The FR SA also notes that 
since the Draft Decision will be taken at the end of a cooperation procedure and made public, it could 
be interpreted as reflecting the common  position  of the European supervisory  authorities on  this 
issue, and setting a precedent for accepting that a company may use the legal basis of the contract to 
process its users’ data for targeted advertising purposes when such processing is particularly massive 
and intrusive278.  

161.  The NL SA specifies the protections from which the data subjects would be deprived due to the IE SA’s 
conclusion that consent is not required, such as the right to data portability (Article 20(1) GDPR); the 
possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further 
processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) 
and the subsequent right to be forgotten279.  

162.  The AT, DE, FI and NL SAs note as an additional risk that sensitive personal data falling within the scope 

of Article 9 GDPR is processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9(2) GDPR 280.  

163.  The FI SA highlights that the will of  the legislator has been to protect the Article 9  GDPR special 
category data with a duty of care and if there is any reasonable doubt that Meta IE has no legal basis 
for processing operations of such sensitive data of the Instagram users, the said claim needs to be 
properly  investigated or  otherwise the  lack of  investigation  would  negatively affect  hundreds  of 
millions of Instagram users within the EEA and undermine their right to privacy and data protection281. 

164.  The NL SA underlines  the risk  that allowing the bypassing of legal provisions requiring consent to 
process data creates legal uncertainty that hampers the free flow of personal data within the EU282. 

165.  The NL SA also argues that not assessing the processing in a sufficiently thorough manner could create 
a precedent for  controllers  to exclude  from  their privacy  policies  or  terms of  service  processing 
operations that must be based on consent. This would risk leaving data subjects with a reduced degree 
of transparency283.

5.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

166.  The IE SA considers the objections not reasoned and does not follow them284.  

167.  The IE SA argues that the scope of the inquiry  is appropriate and relates to the issues raised in the 
complaint.  It  also  argues  that  finding  of  additional  infringements  which  have  not  been  fully 
investigated or put to the controller would impose a risk of procedural unfairness by depriving the 
controller of its right to be heard in response to a particularised allegation of wrongdoing285.  

168.  The IE SA notes that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry, taking into account 
the scope of the written complaint as lodged. The IE SA argues that it would not have been possible 
to assess  each discrete processing  operation by Meta IE, without first  resolving the fundamental 
dispute between the parties on the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR. The IE SA considers that it 
would have been inappropriate and disproportionate for it to undertake an open-ended assessment 
of  all of  Meta IE’s processing  operations  related to  the  Instagram Terms  of  Use  to  handle  the 
complaint 286.   

169.  The IE SA argues that its analysis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not preclude the possibility that certain 
discrete processing operations by Meta IE may fall outside the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE 
SA finds it reasonable and practical to set the scope of the inquiry, focusing on the principled issues of 
dispute, which it considers as not prejudicing the operation of more specific data protection rules287.  

170.  The IE SA considers that the reference to Article 9 GDPR processing by Meta IE is an element of what 
it views as the Complainant’s fundamental allegation, i.e. that the agreement to the Terms of Use was 
a form of GDPR consent to processing of personal data, including consent to the processing of special 
categories of data. The IE SA argues that since the scope of its inquiry addresses this issue, it is not 
necessary for it to also conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of Meta IE’s processing 
that may otherwise fall within the scope of Article 9 GDPR 288. 

171.  The IE SA notes that under Irish national law, there would be a very significant risk of procedural 
unfairness  to Meta IE if the IE SA assumed, without any further factual examination, that Meta IE 
unlawfully processes special categories of personal data 289. 

172.  According to the IE SA, the CSAs objecting to the Draft Decision intend to maximise the complainant’s 
rights by requiring consent-based processing for certain processing operations and thus prioritising it 
over other legal basis. The IE SA considers that very extensive data protection rights also apply under 
the GDPR where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) or Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The IE SA contends 
that the variation in the extent of data subject rights and protections, depending on the applicable 
legal basis, is an inherent element of the legislative scheme of the GDPR. The IE SA considers that 
Article 6 GDPR does not provide that the “appropriate” data subject rights determine the legal basis 
for processing. The IE SA notes that separate to the user’s acceptance of the Terms of Use, Meta IE

relies  on  different  “acts”  of  consent  for  specific  aspects  of  the  service,  including  personalised 
advertising based on users’ off-Instagram activities. In this regard, the IE SA states that the complaint 
in  this  case  was  about  the  agreement to  the  Terms  of  Use  and  the  processing  it  entails  once 
accepted290.  

173.  The IE SA argues that the objections are inconsistent with the principle of legal certainty, as cited in 
Recital 7 GDPR. The IE SA indicates that it is not satisfied that the GDPR requires the limitation of 
processing for the purposes of behavioural advertising to situations where processing is based on data 
subject consent 291. The IE SA contends that interpretative approach of the CSAs raising objections 
would result in the arbitrary application of more restrictive data protection rules for reasons that are 
not found in the GDPR. The IE SA also states that this approach does  not take due account of the 
extensive data protection rights which apply to all legal bases under the GDPR. The IE SA asserts that 
it is not open to the supervisory authorities to create additional binding limitations on the applicable 
legal basis  for  the processing  of  data for  behavioural  advertising. The  IE SA states that it is  the 
legislator, not the supervisory authorities, which has defined the conditions for lawful processing 292.  

5.4  Assessment  of the EDPB 

5.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

174.  The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s primary arguments to the contrary in Section 4.4.1 above293. 

175.  The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs objections analysed in this section have a direct connection with the 
Draft Decision and refer to a specific part of the Draft Decision, i.e. Finding 1. The AT, DE, ES, FI, FR 
and NL SAs argue that the IE SA has not carried out enough investigation and legal analysis in the Draft 
Decision to conclude that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process the complainants’ 
data 294. According  to  these CSAs,  the IE  SA  should  have  identified  and  separately assessed  any 
                                              
290 Composite Response, paragraphs 46. 
291 Composite Response, paragraph 47. 
292 Composite Response, paragraph 47. 
293 Meta IE argues that “Objections which raise matters which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry are not 
‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR” and such objections “ought to be disregarded 
in their entirety by the EDPB”. The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See paragraphs 
73-75 of this Binding Decision above. In particular, the EDPB recalls that the analysis of whether a given objection 
meets the threshold set by Art. 4(24) GDPR is carried out on a case-by-case basis. More specifically, in contrast 
to the objections referred to by Meta IE that did not “establish a direct connection with the specific legal and 
factual content of the Draft Decision” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs 139, 147, 164) here, each CSA has 
made several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, as is described in paragraphs 143, 145-147 and 
150-151 of this Binding Decision. Moreover, while the objections referenced by Meta IE in paragraph 4.9 of its 
Article 65 submissions were found not to be relevant and/or reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 as they 
did “not  provide sufficiently precise  and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each  specific 
provision in question”, did not explain sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion 
proposed could be reached, or did not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft 
Decision for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision 
2/2022, paragraphs 140, 148, 165), as regards the objections analysed in this section, the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL 
SAs provide a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations as to why an infringement for lack of 
appropriate legal basis is to be established, and adequately identify the risk posed by the Draft Decision if it was 
adopted unchanged (paragraphs 145-165 of this Binding Decision) .

processing of special categories of personal data in Instagram Terms of Use295. The NL SA argues that 
processing operations concerning location data and the use of tracking technologies on users devices 
should have investigated and assessed by the IE SA as well296. The AT, FI, FR and NL SAs consider that 
the IE SA should broaden the scope of its investigation and examine whether the conditions for the 
processing of special categories of personal data have been met by Meta IE in relation to the Instagram 
service297. The DE, FR and NL SAs argue that the data that Meta IE’s processes may include special 
categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR 298. They contend that nothing indicates that Meta IE 
excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes. The AT, DE, ES, FI and 
FR SAs highlight that the issue falls within the remit of the complaint since the complainant alleged a 
potential violation of Article 9 GDPR and should therefore be investigated and assessed by the LSA299. 
The AT, DE, ES, FI and FR SAs challenge the reasoning underling the conclusion reached by the LSA. 
This  assessment  could  lead  to  a different  conclusion  insofar  as  the IE SA  would  fully  cover the 
complaint and include facts and a legal assessment on the Instagram’s service processing operations 
to which Article 6(1)(a), Articles 7 and 9 GDPR may apply, which may reveal an infringement by Meta 
IE300.  

176.  Consequently, the EDPB finds that the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR and NL SAs objections relating to Finding 1, 
which states that Meta IE is not required to rely on consent to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use and 
its underlying reasoning, are relevant301. 

177.  The  AT, DE, FI, FR  and  NL  SAs  objections  are reasoned because  they  include  clarifications  and 
arguments on legal/factual mistakes in the LSA’s Draft Decision that require amending. The AT, DE, FI, 
FR and NL SAs consider that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing 
of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of  Instagram Terms of 
Use302.  In particular, the DE, FR and NL SAs argue that the data that Meta IE processes may include 
special categories of personal  data under Article 9 GDPR and that nothing indicates that Meta IE 
excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes303. The AT, DE, ES, FR 
and NL SAs recall that only consent may be used in this context among the exceptions that Article 9 
(2) GDPR lays down to the general prohibition of processing special categories of data 304. The FI SA 
recalls that EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR state that the WP29 has observed that 
Article 9(2) GDPR does not recognise “necessary for the performance of a contract” as an exception to 
the general prohibition  to process  special categories of  data 305. The NL SA  identifies  as another

indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation to seek consent the fact that 
the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has been collected through cookies 
for online advertising purposes and of location data 306. The NL SA also argues that the IE SA should 
have investigated more into the safeguards that are implemented by the controller to address the 
specific  interests of  children307. Lastly, the NL SA  states that the information shared  by  users  on 
Instagram may contain personal data concerning the health of individual users and mentions the ruling 
of the CJEU in case C-136/17 stating that the mere indexing of certain data could already suffice to 
conclude that Article 9 of the GDPR applies308. 

178.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs explain that the IE SA’s Finding 
1 providing that consent is not required puts at risk the rights of data subjects and their control over 
their personal data 309. The AT SA mentions the risk that the data subject’s right to lodge a complaint 
with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because the IE SA 
does not handle it in its entire scope, including special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR310. The 
FR SA argues that the Draft Decision could set a precedent for accepting the use of the contractual 
performance legal basis to process users’ data for targeted advertising purposes, which it views as 
particularly massive and intrusive311. The NL SA specifies that the data subjects could be deprived of 
the following protections derived from the use of consent: the right to data portability (Article 20(1) 
GDPR); the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to 
the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 
7 GDPR) and the subsequent  right to be forgotten312. The AT, DE, FI and NL SAs also  note as an 
additional risk that special categories of personal data falling within the scope of Article 9 GDPR are 
processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9 (2) GDPR 313. The NL SA also underlines the 
data protection deficits that are foreseeable with a switch from consent to contract legal basis and 
the risk that this conclusion  would create legal uncertainty that hampers the free flow of personal 
data within the EU314. The NL SA further adds the risk that the decision  could  create by setting a 
precedent  for  controllers  to  exclude  from  their  privacy  policies  or  terms  of  service  processing 
operations based on consent, thus undermining the principle of transparency315. The ES SA does not 
describe any risk on this specific topic in their objection316. 

179.  On the basis of the above considerations, the EDPB finds that the objections raised by the AT, DE, FI, 
FR and NL SAs concerning the conclusions  in the Draft Decision about the fact that Meta IE is not 
obliged to rely on consent to process the complainant’s data, are relevant and reasoned objections 
under Article 4(24) GDPR.

180.  However, the part of the NL SA objection asking the IE SA to include in its Draft Decision the elements 
concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices 
under ePrivacy legislation falls outside the scope of the EDPB’s mandate317.  

181.  Finally, the EDPB considers that the objection raised by the ES SA regarding the potential infringement 
of Article 9 GDPR is not sufficiently reasoned with reference to the significance of the risks posed by 
the Draft Decision at stake and, therefore, the objection of the ES SA does not meet the threshold 
provided for by Article 4(24) GDPR. 

5.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

182.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB 
shall take a binding  decision  concerning all the matters which are the subject of the relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

183.  The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection318 require 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed on its Finding 1, which concludes 
that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use 
and (b) is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so. When assessing the merits of the 
objections  raised, the  EDPB also  takes into account Meta IE’s position  on  the objections  and  its 
submissions. 

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

184.  In its submissions,  Meta IE supports the IE SA’s conclusion that Meta IE does not rely on consent for 

the purposes of behavioural advertising and is not required to rely on it 319.  

185.  Meta IE states that it does not seek or rely on consent as its legal basis for purposes  of processing 
personal  data to provide  behavioural advertising, except in  limited circumstances where Meta IE 
separately obtains consent, yet not through users’ acceptance the Terms of Use320. Meta IE claims 
that it explains in its Data Policy to data subjects that Meta IE relies on consent under Article 6(1)(a) 
GDPR “[f]or using data that advertisers and other partners provide us about [users’] activity off of Meta 
Company  Products, so  we can personalise ads  we show [them] on Meta Company  Products and  on 
websites, apps  and devices that use our advertising services” and that it has a separate process for 
obtaining this consent in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Article 4(11) and Article 7 GDPR 
and which is “entirely separate from any interaction by users with the Terms of Use or Data Policy, is 
not part of the Complaint and has not been examined” in the IE SA’s inquiry321. Meta IE submits that 
the Complaint is limited to the question of whether Meta IE seeks forced consent to data processing 
through acceptance of the Terms of Use. Meta IE then asserts that since it does not seek, obtain, or 
rely on consent as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process user data via acceptance of the 

                                              
317 NL SA Objection, paragraphs 7-8. 
318 These objections being those of the AT, DE, FI, FR and NL SAs, disagreeing with the IE SA’s Finding 1, which 
states that Meta IE is not required to rely on consent to deliver the Instagram Terms of Use and its underlying 
reasoning.

Terms of Use, the inquiry should end there and all unrelated assertions in the objections should be 
disregarded322.  

186.  Meta IE alleges that some CSAs  suggest that behavioural advertising must in all cases be based on 
consent, and in doing so, the CSAs suggest an approach that mandates Meta IE to rely on consent for 
“its data processing for purposes of behavioural advertising (or any other purpose)”323. Meta IE agrees 
with the IE SA’s assertion that any approach limiting the legal basis on which a controller could rely 
would not be consistent with the principle of legal certainty324. Meta IE considers that the GDPR was 
drafted in  a way that protects data subjects  while affording  flexibility  to controllers  and  that its 
application is highly dependent on facts and circumstances underlying the relevant processing and the 
nature of the service providers325. Meta IE contends that the GDPR contains no express references to 
behavioural advertising and establishes no specific limitations on the available legal basis  for such 
processing; it is technology neutral and does not include specific derogations or rules for any one 
specific industry326. 

187.  With regard to the consideration that consent as a legal basis provides more extensive data protection 
rights, Meta IE argues that in defining the conditions  for lawful processing, the EU legislature has 
ensured that appropriate data protection rights would be afforded to data subjects no matter what 
legal basis is relied on and extensive data protection rights apply to all legal bases327. Meta IE supports 
the IE SA’s view that Article 6(1) GDPR does not require legal bases to be determined by reference to 
the applicable data subject rights for each basis328. 

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

188.  The EDPB notes that the IE SA’s Draft Decision submitted via the Article 60 GDPR procedure results 
from an inquiry that the IE SA conducted based on a complaint from a data subject and Instagram 
user329. The BE SA forwarded this complaint to the IE SA as LSA in the case, given Meta IE’s main 
establishment in Ireland.  

189.  In this complaint, the Complainant alleges that Meta IE violated Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 GDPR. The 
Complainant argues that it is unclear to what the data subject has consented when the data subject 
agreed to Instagram Terms of Use and Privacy Policy330. More specifically, the Complainant points out 
that it remains unclear which exact processing operations the controller chooses  to base on  each 
specific legal basis under Articles 6 and 9 GDPR 331. The Complainant argues that the Terms of Use and 
Privacy Policy also include special categories of data under Article 9(1) GDPR because the data subject, 
as an Instagram user, has interacted with various groups and individuals,  which would accordingly 
reveal  the  data  subject’s  political  affiliation,  sexual  orientation,  health  condition,  etc332.  The

Complainant claims that the controller also allows to target such information for advertisement333. 
The Complainant considers that it would be necessary for the SA to investigate the concrete subject 
of the alleged consent and the legal basis for all processing operations and to request the record of 
processing activities under Article 30(4) GDPR 334. 

190.  Based on the scope of the IE SA’s investigation into this complaint, the EDPB considers that the IE SA 

decided to limit the scope of its Draft Decision to the following legal issues: 

o 

o 

o 

Issue 1 – Whether clicking on the “Agree to Terms” button constitutes or must be 
considered consent for the purposes of the GDPR and, if so, whether it is valid consent 
for the purposes of the GDPR. 

Issue 2  – Whether Meta IE could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a lawful basis for 
processing of personal data in the context of Terms of Use and/or Data Policy.  

Issue 3 – Whether Meta IE provided the requisite information on the legal basis for 
processing  on foot  of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR and whether it did  so  in a transparent 
manner. 335   

191.  The IE SA argues that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry taking into account 
the scope  of the written complaint as lodged336. The IE SA considers  that it would not have been 
possible to undertake an assessment of each discrete processing operation by Meta IE without first 
resolving the fundamental dispute between the parties on the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR337. 
In relation to the processing of Article 9 GDPR categories of data, the IE SA considers that the inquiry 
has addressed the fundamental issue of principle on which the complaint depends, and this makes it 
unnecessary to conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of processing falling within the 
scope of this Article338. The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent in 
order to process personal data to deliver the Terms of Use and (b) is not legally obliged to rely on 
consent in order to do so, based on the submissions of the Parties and Instagram Terms of Use339. The 
IE SA warns CSAs on the legal risks derived from asking through the objections to expand the material 
scope of the inquiry and thus cover infringements outside of the complaint and Draft Decision that 
the IE SA has not investigated (pursuant to its own decision to limit the scope of the inquiry) and put 
to Meta IE340. 

192.  The EDPB notes that the Complaint makes plain the confusion of the Instagram user over which of the 

user’s special categories of data are processed, for which purposes and on which basis.  

193.  The  Instagram Terms  of  Use  themselves  note  in  general terms  “Providing  our  Service  requires 
collecting  and  using  your  information.  The  Data  Policy  explains  how  we  collect, use,  and  share

information  across  the  Facebook  Products”341  (service  which  includes  “Offering  personalized 
opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share” and “Connecting you with brands, 
products, and services in ways you care about”342). The Instagram Terms of Use include a reference to 
a separate document “the Data Policy”343, which lists under the heading “Things you and others do 
and provide”: “Data with special protections: You can choose to provide information in your Facebook 
profile fields or Life Events, about your religious  views, political views, who you are ‘interested in’ or 
your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical  beliefs or trade 
union membership) is subject to special protections under EU law”344. The Data Policy describes the 
purposes for which these data are processed in very general terms such as “Provide, personalize and 
improve our products” and “to select and personalize ads, offers and other sponsored content that we 
show you”345 with no specific reference to the specific processing operations and categories of data 
each purpose would cover. Meta IE thus seems to acknowledge in its Data Policy346 that it uses special 
categories of data for behavioural advertising purposes, without specifying the “special protections 
under EU law” that it would apply to such processing. Meta IE only includes a general reference to 
consent among other legal basis in the same page347, which includes a link to a separate facebook.com 
page mentioning the use of consent on data with special protection and referring to the Instagram 
Settings348. 

194.  The IE SA finds that the way in which Meta IE provides, in relation to processing for which Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR is relied upon, this information and the lack of information on the specific processing 
operations,  the  data  involved,  their  purposes  and  legal  basis  constitute  an  infringement  of 
transparency obligations under the GDPR (Article 5(1)(a), Article 12 (1), and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR)349. 
The IE SA considers the complaint in this case to be limited to the Terms of Use and the processing it 
entails once accepted350. In these circumstances, the IE SA accepts at face value Meta IE’s submission 
on its reliance on different “acts” of consent for discrete aspects of the service separately from the 
user’s acceptance of the Terms of Use351.  The IE SA does not engage into any further examination or 
verification on how consent is sought in the case of processing carried out to provide discrete aspects 
of the service.  The IE SA also does not examine or verify whether special categories of data under 
Article 9 GDPR are processed in the context of  the Instagram service and, if so, whether they are 
subject to these “acts” of consent and thus effectively treated outside the scope of the Terms of Use

Complaint even taken at  its  height quite  clearly  only concerns data  processing arising out of  the  act  of 
acceptance. On this basis, I do not accept that the processing of sensitive categories of personal data on the basis 
of Article 9 GDPR consent falls within the scope of this Inquiry. There is no evidence that Meta Ireland processes 
special category data at all in respect of the Instagram service”.

and the legal basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on which the Terms of Use purportedly rely, or whether 
some special categories of personal data, as defined by the GDPR and EU case-law352, are treated 
under the Instagram Terms of Use.  

195.  The CJEU asserted recently that the purpose of Article 9(1) GDPR is to ensure an enhanced protection 
of data subjects for processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is 
liable to  constitute a particularly serious  interference with  the fundamental rights to respect for 
private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter353. 
The CJEU adopts a wide interpretation of the terms “special categories of personal data” and “sensitive 
data”  that  includes  data  liable  indirectly  to  reveal  sensitive  information  concerning  a  natural 
person354. Advocate General Rantos reiterates the importance for the protection of data subjects of 
Article 9 GDPR and applies the same interpretation to the data processing in social network services 
for behavioural advertising by stating that “the prohibition on processing sensitive personal data may 
include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network consisting in the 
collection of a user’s data when he or she visits  other websites or apps or enters such data into them, 
the linking of such data to the user account on the social network and the use of such data, provided 
that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, make it possible to profile users 
on  the  basis  of  the  categories that emerge  from  the  listing  in  that  provision  of  types  of  sensitive 
personal data”355.  

196.  Therefore, the GDPR and the case-law pay especial attention to the processing or potential processing 
of  special categories of personal  data under Article 9 GDPR to ensure the protection of the data 
subjects. In this connection, the Complainant alleges in the Complaint, among others, a violation of 
Article 9 GDPR and expressly requests the IE SA to investigate Meta IE’s processing operations in the 
context of  the  Instagram service  covered  by  this  Article356. In  a  subsequent  submission  on  the 
Preliminary Draft Decision, the Complainant criticises the scope that the IE SA decided to give to the 
Complaint and its lack of investigation of Meta IE’s processing activities and alleges that the IE SA failed 
to give due consideration to processing under Article 9 GDPR and other cases in which it relies on 
consent 357.   

197.  In the present case, the IE SA limited its facts and legal assessment in the Draft Decision to the general 
question of whether Meta IE has (a) sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to 
deliver the Terms of Use and (b) if it is legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so. The IE SA 
categorically concludes on these questions. At the same time, the IE SA acknowledges a serious lack 
of transparency by  Meta IE, as regards the information provided  concerning the processing being 
carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and does not clarify which data categories are being 
processed for behavioural advertising, if Meta IE processes special categories of data, and if it does, if

Meta IE complies with the conditions of Article 9 GDPR and others relevant to the application of this 
provision (for example, Articles 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR). 

198.  By deciding  not  to  investigate, further to  the Complaint,  the processing  of  special  categories of 
personal data in the context of  the Instagram service, the IE SA leaves unaddressed the risks this 
processing  poses  for  the Complainant  and  for  Instagram users.  First,  there  is  the risk  that the 
Complainant’s special categories of personal data are processed within the Instagram service to build 
intimate profiles of them for behavioural advertising purposes without a legal basis and in a manner 
not compliant with the GDPR and the strict requirements of its Article 9(2) GDPR and other GDPR 
provisions  relevant thereto. Second, there is also the risk that Meta IE does not consider as special 
categories of personal  data (in line with the GDPR and the CJEU case-law358) certain categories of 
personal data it processes and consequently, that Meta IE does not treat them accordingly. Third, the 
Complainant and other Instagram users whose special categories of are processed may be deprived 
of certain special protections derived from the use of consent, such as the possibility  to specifically 
consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further processing of personal 
data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right 
to be forgotten359. Fourth, given the great size and dominant market share of Meta IE in the social 
media market, leaving unaddressed its current ambiguity in the processing of special categories of 
personal  data, and  its  limited  transparency  vis-à-vis  Instagram users,  may  set  a  precedent  for 
controllers to operate in the same manner and create legal uncertainty hampering the free flow of 
personal data within the EU.  

199.  The EDPB further considers, also in view of these risks to the Complainant and to other Instagram 
users, that the IE SA did not handle the Complaint with all due diligence360. The EDPB sees the lack of 
any further investigation into the processing of special categories of personal data as an omission, and 
in the present case finds it relevant that the Complainant alleged infringements of Article 9 GDPR in 
the Complaint 361. The EDPB contends that in the present case, the IE SA should have verified on the 
basis  of the contract and the data processing actually carried out on  which legal bases each data 
processing operation at issue relies. 

200.  The EDPB also highlights that by limiting excessively the scope of its inquiry despite the scope of the 
complaint in this cross-border case and systematically considering all the objections raised by CSAs 
not relevant and/or reasoned and thus denying their formal admissibility, the IE SA as LSA in this case, 
constrains the capacity of CSAs to act and tackle the risks to data subjects in sincere and effective 
cooperation. As ruled by the CJEU, the LSA must exercise its competence within a framework of close 
cooperation with other supervisory authorities concerned and cannot “eschew essential dialogue with

and sincere and effective cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned”362. The limited 
scope the IE SA gave to the inquiry and its consideration of all the objections made as inadmissible for 
being not relevant or reasoned also impairs the EDPB’s capacity to conclude on the matter pursuant 
to Article 65 GDPR and thus ensure a consistent application of EU data protection law, especially 
considering that the complaint was introduced more than four years ago.  

201.  As a result of the limited scope of the inquiry and the fact that the IE SA did not verify and assess in 
the Draft Decision Meta IE’s processing of special categories of personal data in its Instagram service, 
the EDPB does not have sufficient factual evidence on Meta IE’s processing operations to enable it to 
make a finding on any possible  infringement by Meta IE of its obligations under Article 9 GDPR and 
other GDPR provisions relevant thereto.  

202.  In conclusion, the EDPB decides that the IE SA cannot categorically conclude at this stage through its 
Finding 1 that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to carry out 
the personal  data processing  activities involved  in the delivery of the Instagram Service, including 
behavioural advertising as set out in the Instagram Terms of  Use without further investigating its 
processing operations, the categories of data processed  (including to identify  special categories of 
personal data that may be processed), and the purposes they serve.  

203.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB 
decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its 
Instagram service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and 
complies  with the relevant obligations under the GDPR, to the extent that this new investigation 
complements the findings  made in the IE SA’s Final Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding 
Decision, and based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft dDecision in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR 363.  

6  ON THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF THE 

PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS  

6.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

204.  The IE SA in its Draft Decision addresses the Complainant’s allegations that the unclear and misleading 
nature of the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, together with the mode of acceptance of the 
Terms of  Use, have  made Instagram users  believe  that all processing  operations  were based  on 
consent  under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and thus  constituted a breach of the Meta IE’s transparency 
obligations under Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR 364. The IE SA analyses the submissions provided 
by the Meta IE and, noting the Complaint’s focus on the alleged “forced consent”365, concludes that 
Meta IE has breached  Article 5(1)(a), Article 13(1)(c)  and Article 12(1)  GDPR due  to  the lack  of

transparency in relation to the processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has been relied on366. The IE 
SA explains that, while an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR does not necessarily or automatically 
flow  from findings  of  infringement under  Articles 12 and/or  13 GDPR, there is  an important link 
between these provisions367.  Nevertheless, the IE SA takes the view that “[t]he factual question  of 
whether the data subject was misled as to the legal basis  is therefore part of the broader question as 
to whether there was compliance with transparency requirements and should not be considered in 
isolation of this broader issue”368. The IE SA points out that Article 5(1)(a) GDPR links transparency to 
the overall fairness of the activities of the controller369 and concludes on the breach of this provision 
in relation to the infringement of the transparency obligations370. 

6.2  Summary of the objection raised by the CSA 

205.  The IT SA objects to the scope of Finding 3 of the Draft Decision and to the assessment leading up to 
it. The IT SA agrees to a large extent with the Draft Decision’s Finding 3 on the infringement of Article 
12(1), Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency371. However, the IT SA argues 
that Meta IE has also failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR, which, in the view of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically 
to transparency372.  

206.  According  to the  IT SA, the  relationship  between Meta IE and  Instagram users  is  markedly  and 
significantly unbalanced373 and an infringement of the fairness principle resulted, first of all, from the 
misrepresentation  of  the legal  basis  for  processing  by  the  controller374, considering  that “Meta 
presented its service to users in a misleading manner” and “without taking due account of users’ right 
to the protection of their personal data”375.  The IT SA argues that “the controller leaves its users in the 
dark as they are expected to tell or actually ‘figure out’, from time to time, the possible connections 
between purpose sought, applicable legal basis  and relevant processing activities”376.   

207.  Secondly, such infringement also stems from the “high-level and all-encompassing reference to Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as relied upon to enable the massive collection of personal data [...] and their reuse for 
multifarious, distinct purposes”, considering the “pervasive as well as prolonged analysis of [the users’] 
online behaviour” amounting to a disproportionate interference with their private lives compared to 
the pursuit of freedom of enterprise377.  

208.  The IT SA thus considers that the IE SA should  have found an infringement of the fairness principle 
under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to the infringement of the transparency obligations derived

from this provision,  without any need for supplementary investigations378. According to the IT SA, 
should the objection be followed, it would also impact the exercise of by corrective powers by the IE 
SA, i.e. the measures to be imposed on the controller in order to bring the processing into conformity 
with the GDPR 379. 

6.3  Position of the LSA on the objection 

209.  The IE SA does not consider the IT SA objection to be relevant and reasoned and does not follow it380. 
The IE SA examines it together with the other objections relating to the scope and conduct of the 
inquiry and contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to 
the parties would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry381.  

210.  The IE SA highlights the legal consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning 
infringements outside of the Complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would 
succeed in arguing before the Irish Courts that it has been denied an opportunity  to be heard on 
additional and extraneous findings that are adverse to it382. The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact 
that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE was never invited to be heard in response to an allegation that it 
had infringed the fairness principle set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The IE SA notes, in this regard, that 
a respondent has the right to be heard in response to the particulars of the case being made against 
it and that this is a core element of a fair procedure pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view 
that expanding the material scope of the inquiry is neither necessary, nor could be reconciled with the 
controller’s right to a fair procedure383. 

6.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

6.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

211.  The IT SA objection concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”384.  

212.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the objections categorised by the IE SA as relating to the 
scope and conduct of the inquiry, among which the IT SA objection regarding the infringement of the 
fairness principle, are “irrelevant to the resolution of  this Inquiry” and, if accepted, would seriously 
infringe Meta IE’s procedural rights under both Irish and EU law385. According to Meta IE, “the EDPB 
cannot expand the scope of the Inquiry in the manner suggested by the CSAs through Objections that 
are not relevant to the substance of the Complaint” and in relation to this Meta IE refers to the EDPB 
Binding Decision 2/2022386.

213.  Meta  IE  further  contends  that  the  IT  SA  objection  is  not  reasoned  as  it  provides  broad  and 
unsubstantiated allegations without presenting facts or evidence in this regard387 and fails to address 
the significance of the risk to fundamental rights and freedoms posed by the Draft Decision388. 

214.  As it was previously explained, the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree 
with the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection389.The EDPB recalls that an 
objection  could  go as  far as identifying  gaps in  the draft decision  justifying  the need  for further 
investigation by the LSA, for example in situations where the investigation carried out by  the LSA 
unjustifiably  fails to cover some of the issues raised by the complainant 390. In this regard, the EDPB 
observes that, in their complaint, the Complainant alleges that the information provided in Meta IE’s 
Privacy Policy “is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c) 
GDPR”391. In addition, the Complainant alleges that “Asking  for consent to  a processing  operation, 
when the controller relies in fact on another legal basis  is fundamentally unfair, misleading and non-
transparent within the meaning of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR”392. Therefore, the EDPB disagrees with 
the IE SA’s finding that assessing Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness would amount 
addressing matters “which fall outside of the scope of the underlying complaint”393. 

215.  The EDPB notes that the IT SA agrees with the IE SA’s finding with regard to the infringement of the 
principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 394. As this finding is not subject to a dispute, the 
EDPB will not examine this matter.  

216.  After analysing the IT SA objection, the EDPB finds  that the objection  is relevant, as it refers to a 
specific part of the Draft Decision (Finding  3395), and if followed would lead to the conclusion  that 
there is an infringement of the general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to 
the  breach  of  the  separate  requirements  relating  to  transparency  under  this  provision396.  The

395 IT SA Objection, p. 4-5. 
In respect of Meta IE’s arguments in paragraph 4.9 of its Article 65 Submissions on this objection not being 
relevant, the EDPB recalls that the analysis of whether a given objection meets the threshold set by Art. 4(24) 
GDPR is carried out on a case-by-case basis. Meta IE refers to the EDPB’s Binding Decision 2/2022 and specifically 
to the paragraphs where the EDPB established that specific objections raised by the DE SAs and NO SA in that 
case were not relevant and reasoned. There are several differences between those objections and the objection 
of the IT SA that is being analysed in this section.  
More specifically, in the Binding Decision 2/2022 the objections referred to by Meta IE did not “establish a direct 
connection with the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision” (Binding Decision 2/2022 paragraphs 
139, 147, 164) whereas the IT SA objection here makes several clear links with the content of the Draft Decision, 
by referring to the analysis carried out by the IE SA in respect of the breach of the transparency obligations and 
to specific observations made by the LSA and explains how the additional infringement of Art. 5(1)(a) could be 
established on that basis (see, for example, p. 6 of the IT Objection referring to paragraph 185 of the Draft 
Decision concerning users being left “in the dark”).  
396 IT SA Objection, p. 5-6. 

Adopted 

57 

objection, if followed, would also entail the exercise of corrective powers, i.e. the measures to be 
imposed on the controller in order to bring the processing into conformity with the GDPR 397. 

217.  The IT SA objection is also reasoned because it includes several specific legal and factual arguments in 
support of finding an additional infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR398. 
For example, the IT SA explains that “[t]ransparency and fairness are two separate notions” and that 
“transparency relates to clarity of the information provided to users via the ToS and the privacy policy”, 
while “fairness  relates to how the controller addressed the lawfulness  of the processing activities in 
connection with its  social  networking service”399. The IT SA contends that the “overall  relationship 
between Meta and Instagram users is markedly as well as  significantly unbalanced”400. According to 
the IT SA, the first way in which Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness is by misrepresenting 
the legal basis for processing in order to pursue its business  model “without taking due account of 
users’ right to the protection of personal data” and leaving “its users in the dark” 401. Further, in the IT 
SA’s view, Meta IE has breached the fairness principle, by justifying via the broad reference to the 
legal basis of performance of contract a massive collection of personal data and their reuse for a wide 
range of purposes, disproportionately interfering with users’ private life402.  

218.  The IT SA objection also identifies the risks posed by the absence in the Draft Decision of a finding on 
the infringement of the fairness principle, namely setting a dangerous precedent for future decisions 
concerning other digital platform operators - more generally, other controllers belonging to the same 
business sector - and markedly weakening the safeguards that must be provided through the effective 
implementation of the data protection framework on account of the comprehensive disregard of the 
fairness of the processing principle403. 

219.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that the IT SA objection  is relevant and reasoned (cf. Article 4(24) 

GDPR). 

6.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

220.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is 
an infringement of the GDPR.

400 IT SA Objection, p. 5.  
401 IT SA Objection, p. 6. 
402 IT SA Objection, p. 6. See also above, paragraphs 206-208. In respect of Meta IE’s arguments in paragraph 4.9 
of its Article 65 Submissions on this objection not being reasoned, the EDPB notes that the objections that were 
found to be not relevant and/or not reasoned in the Binding Decision 2/2022 did “not provide sufficiently precise 
and detailed legal reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in question”, did not explain 
sufficiently clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion proposed could be reached, or did 
not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms 
of the data subjects or the free flow of data within the EU (Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 140, 148, 165). 
The IT SA objection provides, instead, a number of legal and factual arguments and explanations as to why a 
breach of the fairness principle is to be established, and adequately identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision 
if it was adopted unchanged.  
403 IT SA Objection, p. 7.

221.  The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it contains no finding of 
infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the 
objection  raised, the  EDPB also  takes  into  account  Meta IE’s position  on  the  objection  and  its 
submissions. 

222.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection lacks merit as it goes beyond the scope 
of the inquiry404. The EDPB also notes that Meta IE links the issue of the potential infringement of the 
principle of fairness, raised in the IT SA objection, with the question of the competence of CSAs or the 
EDPB to assess the validity of contracts in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and, when responding 
to the merits of the IT SA objection, Meta IE refers to its submissions  on application of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR with respect to standard form contracts405. While taking note of Meta IE’s view on this matter, 
the EDPB considers the question of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR to be distinct from the question of the choice of the appropriate legal basis (although a 
connected one, as explained below) and proceeds with its respective assessment below.  

223.  Firstly, the EDPB recalls that the basic principles relating to processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as 
such,  be infringed406. This  is  apparent from  the text of  Article 83(5)(a)  GDPR which  subjects  the 
infringement of the basic principles for processing to administrative fines of up to 20 million euros, or 
in the case of undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial 
year, whichever is higher. 

224.  The EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined 
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that 
every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is 
evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Article 6(2) and Article 6(3)(b) GDPR 
refer to  lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Article 13(2), Article 14(2) 
and Article 40(2)(a) GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing. 

225.  On the basis of the above consideration, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s view that “Article 5(1)(a) 
links  transparency to  the overall fairness  of  the activities of  a  controller”407 but considers that the 
principle  of  fairness  has  an independent  meaning and  stresses  that an assessment  of  Meta IE’s 
compliance  with  the principle  of  transparency  does  not  automatically rule  out  the  need  for  an 
assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness too.

405 “To the extent the IT SA Objects to the lawfulness of Meta Ireland’s data processing based on the nature of 
the contract between Meta Ireland and users of the Instagram Service (i.e. a standard form contract), Meta 
Ireland submits that the validity of contract is not within the competence of CSAs or the EDPB. In any event, Meta 
Ireland respectfully asks the EDPB to  take into account its submission above with respect  to standard form 
contracts”. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraph 7.10.

226.  The EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights408. The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect 
of the principle  of fairness in the context of processing personal data. For example, the EDPB has 
previously opined in its Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “[f]airness is an 
overarching  principle which  requires  that personal  data  should  not  be processed  in  a  way  that  is 
unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject”409.  

227.  Among  the  key  fairness  elements  that controllers  should  consider  in  this  regard, the EDPB has 
mentioned autonomy of the data subjects, data subjects’ expectation, power balance, avoidance of 
deception, ethical and truthful processing 410. These elements are particularly relevant in the case at 
hand.  The principle  of  fairness  under  Article 5(1)(a)  GDPR underpins  the  entire data protection 
framework and seeks  to  address power  asymmetries between the data controllers  and the data 
subjects in  order to cancel out the negative effects of such  asymmetries and ensure the effective 
exercise of the data subjects’ rights. The EDPB has previously explained that “the principle of fairness 
includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible 
adverse  consequences  processing  may  have  on  them, and  having  regard  to  the  relationship  and 
potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller”411.  

228.  The EDPB recalls  that a fair balance must  be struck  between, on  the one  hand, the commercial 
interests of the controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of the data subjects 
under the GDPR 412. A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 
refers to pursuing “power balance” as a “key objective of the controller-data subject relationship”413, 
especially in the context of online services provided without monetary payment, where users are often 
not aware of the ways and extent to which their personal data is being processed414. Consequently, 
lack of transparency can make it almost impossible  in practice for the data subjects to exercise an 
informed choice over the use of their data 415 which is in contrast with the element of “autonomy” of 
data subjects as to the processing of their personal data 416.  

229.  Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is 
particularly  important to  ensure  that data subjects  are  protected from  any  form  of  abuse  and 
deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal 
                                              
408 Art. 8 EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states as follows: “1. Everyone has the right to the protection of 
personal data concerning him or her. 2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the 
basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law” (emphasis added).

data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative 
requirements under  Article 5(1)(a)  GDPR, taking into  account the particular service  that is  being 
provided  and  the characteristics of  their users,  serves as  a shield  from the danger of  abuse and 
deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries.  

230.  The EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to 
the principles of fairness and purpose limitation417. In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while 
finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users 
via the Instagram Terms of Use and Data Policy, compliance with the principle of fairness also relates 
to “how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with its social 
networking service”418. Thus the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by Meta IE with 
the  principle  of  fairness  requires  also  an  assessment  of  the consequences  that the  choice  and 
presentation  of  the  legal  basis  entail  for  the  users  of  the  Instagram service.  In  addition,  that 
assessment  cannot be made in the abstract, but has  to take into account the specificities  of the 
particular social networking service and of the processing of personal data carried out, namely for the 
purpose of online behavioural advertising 419.  

231.  The EDPB notes that in this particular case the breach of Meta IE’s transparency obligations is of such 
gravity that it clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of the Instagram users by confusing them 
on whether clicking the “Agree to Terms” button results in giving their consent to the processing of 
their personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance with the 
principle of fairness is avoiding deception i.e. providing information “in an objective and neutral way, 
avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design”420.  

232.  As outlined in the Draft Decision, the Complainant argues that Meta IE relied on “forced consent” as a 
result of being led to believe that the legal basis for processing the controller was relying upon was 
consent 421. The Complaint demonstrates the confusion suffered by the Complainant both due to the 
(lack of) information presented to Instagram users  in the context of their “agreement”422 and the 
circumstances of how the act of “agreement” was sought by Meta IE423. The EDPB considers that the 
LSA should  have taken into account such Meta IE’s practices in relation to the principle of fairness, 
regardless of its finding that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to process personal 
data to deliver the Terms of Use424.  

233.  In addition, and as recognised by the LSA itself, further to its assessment of the information provided 
concerning processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “it is impossible  for the 
user to identify with any degree of specificity what processing is carried out on what data, on foot of

the specified lawful  bases”425. Considering  this, in the EDPB’s view, there are clear indications that 
Instagram users’ expectations with regard to the applicable legal basis  have not been fulfilled426. 
Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Instagram users  are left “in  the dark”427 and 
considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful428 because it is 
confusing with regard to the type of data processed, the legal basis and the purpose of the processing, 
which ultimately restricts the Instagram users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ rights. 

234.  Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the extensive analysis by the IE SA with regard to the issue of 
legal basis and transparency in relation to the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR is closely linked to the issue of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness. Considering 
the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in 
the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with 
the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Instagram users in a misleading manner429, 
which adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of 
their data subjects' rights. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that the IE SA’s finding of breach of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to the principle of transparency430 should extend to the principle of 
fairness too.   

235.  This  is  all  the  more  supported  by  the  fact  that, in  the  circumstances  of  the  present  case  as 
demonstrated  above431, the  overall  effect of  the infringements  by  Meta IE of  the  transparency 
obligations under Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and the infringement of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR 432 further intensifies the imbalanced nature of the relationship between Meta IE and the 
Instagram users brought up by the IT SA objection. The combination of factors, such as the asymmetry 
of the information created by Meta IE with regard to the Instagram service users, combined with the 
“take it or leave it” situation that they are faced with due to the lack of alternative services in the 
market and the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular processing under 
the contract with Meta IE, systematically  disadvantages the Instagram service  users, limits  their 
control over the processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under 
Chapter III of the GDPR.  

236.  Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to include a finding of an infringement of the principle of 
fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE, in addition  to the infringement of the principle of 
transparency  under  the  same  provision,  and  to  adopt  the  appropriate corrective  measures,  by 
addressing, but without being limited to, the question of an administrative fine for this infringement 
as provided for in Section 9 of this Binding Decision.

7  ON THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF THE 

PRINCIPLES OF PURPOSE LIMITATION AND DATA MINIMISATION  

7.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

237.  The IE SA refers to Article 5(1)(b) GDPR433 and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR 434 when analysing the extent of the 
controller’s obligation under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and whether Meta IE has infringed this provision. 
More specifically, the IE SA highlights that Article 13 GDPR requires that the purposes and legal bases 
must be specified in respect of the intended processing and cannot just be cited in the abstract435. 
After explaining why Meta IE’s view that there is no specific obligation for the legal basis to be mapped 
to the purpose of processing cannot be reconciled with a literal reading of the GDPR, the IE SA, for 
completeness, also engages in a systemic reading based on the legislator’s objective and the contents 
of the GDPR as a whole436. 

238.  In this  context, the IE SA  points  out  that the six  principles  laid  down  under  Article 5  GDPR are 
interconnected and operate in combination to underpin the whole GDPR 437. However, the IE SA does 
not assess whether Meta IE’s processing activities entail a separate infringement of the principles of 
purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. 

7.2  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

239.  According to the IT SA, there is an additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on 
account of Meta IE’s failure to comply with the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles. It 
considers that such infringement should be found without the need for any further investigation and 
should result into a substantial increase of the proposed administrative fine438. 

240.  The IT SA puts forward several factual and legal arguments for the proposed  change to the Draft 
Decision. First, it points out that the IE SA confines its assessment to only one of the contracts purposes 
(the  provision  of  online  behavioural  advertising), while  the  Instagram service  would  actually be 
composed of several processing activities pursuing several purposes439. According to the IT SA, the 
fact that Meta IE inappropriately based its multifarious processing activities only  on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR entails an infringement of the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles440. The IT SA 
stresses the relevance of these principles in online services contracts, as they are not negotiated on 
an  individual  basis,  and  refers  to  pages  15  and  16  of  the  WP29  Opinion  03/2013  on  purpose 
limitation441. The IT SA also refers to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and recalls 
that, where the contract consists  of several separate services or elements of a service that can be

performed independently, the applicability of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be assessed for each of 
those services separately442.  

241.  On the risks posed  by the Draft Decision, the IT SA refers to the risk identified by the WP29 in its 
Opinion  03/2013  on  purpose  limitation443,  namely  that  “data  controllers  may  seek  to  include 
processing terms in contracts to maximise the possible collection and uses of data without adequately 
specifying those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations”444. In addition, in the IT SA’s 
view, the failure to specify  and communicate the purposes  of  the processing  to the data subject 
creates a risk  of  artificially expanding  the types of  processing  or the categories or personal  data 
considered  necessary for the performance of  a contract under Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR, which would 
nullify the safeguards afforded to data subjects under data protection law445. 

7.3  Position of the LSA on the objection 

242.  The IE SA does not consider that the IT SA’s objection is relevant and reasoned446. Categorising the 
objection as relating to the scope and conduct of the inquiry, the IE SA adopts the same approach as 
with regard to the alleged infringement  of  the principle  of  fairness.  More specifically,  the IE SA 
contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to the parties 
would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry447. It highlights the legal 
consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning infringements outside of the 
complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would succeed in arguing before the 
Irish Courts that it has been denied an opportunity to be heard on additional and extraneous findings 
that are adverse to it 448. The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE 
was never invited to be heard in response to an allegation that it had infringed the fairness principle 
set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The IE SA notes, in this regard, that a respondent has the right to be 
heard in response to the particulars of the case being made against it and that this is a core element 
of a fair procedure pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view that expanding the material scope 
of the inquiry is not possible under Irish procedural law449. It further notes that a very significant risk 
of procedural unfairness, under Irish national law, would result from the proposal to assume, without 
any further factual examination, that Meta IE has infringed the purpose limitation principle450. 

7.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

7.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

243.  The IT SA’s objection concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”451.

244.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA’s objection does not meet the relevant and 
reasoned  thresholds  because  it  falls  outside  the  defined  scope  of  the  inquiry452.  As  previously 
explained, the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree with the scope of 
the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection453.  

245.  Meta IE points out that the objection concerns matters that have not been investigated and relates to 
theoretical findings on legal bases454. Meta IE further argues that even if the objection satisfied the 
abovementioned  thresholds,  it  should  be  disregarded because  otherwise  Meta IE’s right to  fair 
procedures under both Irish and EU law would be contravened455.  

246.  The EDPB considers  that the IT SA  objection is  relevant as it refers to specific parts of  the Draft 
Decision,  namely  Finding  2  and  Finding  3456, and  argues that  the  IE  SA  should  have  found  an 
infringement  of  Article  5(1)(b)  and  Article 5(1)(c)  GDPR  which  lay  down  the  principles  of  data 
minimisation and purpose limitation.  

247.  The objection also includes arguments on legal and factual mistakes in the IE SA’s Draft Decision that 
require amending. According to the IT SA, the IE SA’s reasoning is inconsistent because the high-level, 
rather unclear information provided to the data subjects is a major criticality that should have led the 
IE SA not only  to question the features of the information notice, but also to verify, in detail, the 
application  of  the  principles  of  purpose  limitation  and  data  minimisation  from  a  substantive 
perspective457. More specially, the IT SA takes the view that the IE SA should have had regard to the 
actual configuration of the processing operations performed in order to assess whether the controller 
had abided by the obligation to process personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes 
both when collecting those data and thereafter458. 

248.  As regards the risk  posed  by  the Draft Decision, the EDPB takes note of  the IT SA’s reference to 
paragraph 16 of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR and reiterates the particular 
relevance of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1) (c) GDPR in the context of contracts for online services, in 
view of the risk that data controllers may seek to include general processing terms in contracts in 
order to  maximise the possible  collection  and uses  of  data, without  adequately specifying  those 
purposes or considering data minimisation obligations459. Nevertheless, the EDPB stresses that a mere 
reference to the EDPB Guidelines is not sufficient to demonstrate the risks posed by the Draft Decision 
in this specific case and in these specific circumstances.  

249.  The  IT  SA  also  considers  that  the  purposes  for  the  processing  “must  be  clearly  specified  and 
communicated to the data subject, in  line with the controller’s purpose limitation and transparency 
obligations”, otherwise there is “a  risk  that other data  protection obligations  might be  evaded by 
artificially expanding the types of processing or the categories of personal data that are considered to

be ‘necessary’ for performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR - which would in turn nullify 
the safeguards afforded to data subjects by personal data protection law”460. 

250.  The EDPB recalls that the objection  must put  forward arguments or justifications  concerning the 
consequences of issuing the decision without the changes proposed in the objection, and how such 
consequences would pose significant risks for data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms461. The 
CSA  needs  to advance sufficient  arguments to explicitly  show  that such  risks  are substantial and 
plausible462. In addition, the demonstration of the significance of the risks cannot be implied from the 
legal and/or factual arguments provided by the CSA, but has to be explicitly identified and elaborated 
in the objection463.  

251.  The  EDPB considers  that the  IT  SA’s  objection  fails  to  meet  these  requirements  as  it  does  not 
demonstrate the significance of the risk stemming from an omission in the Draft Decision of a finding 
that the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation have been infringed by Meta IE. The 
risk, as described by the IT SA objection, is not substantial and plausible enough. Moreover, the risk 
relates to the IE SA’s decision not to conclude on the inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a 
legal basis for Meta IE’s processing activities but fails to establish a clear link with the LSA’s decision 
not to make a finding on the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.   

252.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that the abovementioned objection by the IT SA is not reasoned (cf. 

Article 4(24) GDPR) and will not assess it on the merits.  

8  ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES OTHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE FINES 

8.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

253.  The IE SA considers that an order to bring processing into compliance (Art. 58(2)(d) GDPR) should be 
imposed on Meta IE, requiring them to bring their Data Policy and Terms of Service into compliance 
with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards processing carried out on the 
basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR within three months of the date of notification of any final decision  464.  

254.  The LSA considers an order is necessary and proportionate, contrary to the controller’s position465. 
Regarding the necessity, the IE SA explains that this order is the only way to guarantee that Meta IE 
amends the infringements outlined in the Draft Decision, which is essential for the protection of data 
subjects’ rights466. Concerning the proportionality, the LSA points out that the proposed measure is 
the minimum action required to ensure the future compliance of the controller. Further, the IE SA

subject’s rights concerned to conclude that such measure is proportionate467. 

8.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

255.  The NL SA objects to the choice of the corrective measures of the LSA in their Draft Decision468. The 
NL SA notes that the IE SA is proposing to impose an order pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR alongside 
an administrative fine, and that this  objection  concerns the first of these two measures469. More 
specifically, the NL SA objects to the order to bring processing into compliance (Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) 
within  three months  proposed  by  the LSA, arguing that it is  not appropriate, not necessary, nor 
proportionate to ensure compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR, as 
well as the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR raised in its objection470. 
The NL SA takes the view that the proposed  order is insufficient  to remedy the serious situation of 
non-compliance  arising  from  these  infringements, since  it does  not  remedy  the  illegality of  the 
conduct carried out during the transition period (i.e. the time between the issuance of the decision 
and the expiration date of the order), bearing in mind that every day the service continues operations 
as described in the Terms of Use and Data Policy, it does so in an illegal way harming the rights and 
freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA471. According to the NL SA, the Draft Decision should 
be modified  to include a temporary ban on Meta IE’s processing of personal data for the duration 
necessary for the controller to bring its processing into compliance with the GDPR (Article 58(2)(f) 
GDPR),  as  this  would  be  appropriate,  necessary  and  proportionate  taking  into  account  the 
circumstances of the case472, and would be the only measure suitable to make sure that the expansive 
violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects is not continued473. The NL SA also 
argues that the breaches of the GDPR established by the LSA, combined with the additional breaches 
put forward by the NL SA, are of a very grave nature and justify halting processing operations during 
the time the controller  needs  to remedy its  severe lack of  compliance474. In essence, the NL  SA 
identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision in that it allows the company to resume operations as 
usual  while  amending  the  compliance  deficits  (with  regard to  transparency), which  they  argue 
essentially deprives data subjects of their rights during a transition period475. 

256.  The FI SA also argues that the IE SA should “exercise effective, proportionate and dissuasive corrective 
powers” and order Meta IE to “bring its processing operations into compliance with the provision of 
Article 6(1) GDPR and prohibit to process users’ personal data for behavioural advertising by relying 
on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as  laid  down  in  Article 58(2)(d)  GDPR”476. The HU SA  reaches the same 
conclusion, proposing to apply the legal consequences under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR and to instruct the 
controller to indicate a different legal basis477. On the risks, both the FI and the HU SAs state that the 
absence of appropriate and necessary corrective powers would amount to a dangerous precedent,

sending  a deceiving  message to the market and to  data subjects  whose  fundamental rights and 
freedoms would ultimately jeopardise478. Moreover, the FI SA notes that the Draft Decision affects all 
data subjects within the EEA and that, therefore, the consequences of not making use of the corrective 
measures pursuant Article 58(2) would be enormous479.  

257.  The AT SA requests that the LSA makes use of its corrective measures pursuant to Article 58(2) GDPR 
in relation to the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 480, in order to bring the processing 
operations of the controller in line with the GDPR 481 and remedy the infringement 482. According to the 
AT SA, the IE SA should exercise ‘’corrective powers’’ so as to ensure that Meta IE could not continue 
to unlawfully  rely on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for the processing of users’ personal data for behavioral 
advertising 483. More specifically, the AT SA suggests that the IE SA prohibits Meta IE “the processing 
of a user’s data for behavioural advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR”484. In the absence of 
additional corrective measures, the AT SA considers that if corrective measures are not imposed, there 
is a risk “that [Meta IE] continues to unlawfully  rely on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR for  the processing  of a 
user’s  data  for  behavioural  advertising  and  continues  to  undermine  or  bypass  data  protection 
principles’’  485,  which  would  affect  millions  of  data  subjects  within  the  EEA  and  bear  vast 
consequences486.  

258.  The FR SA notes that reversing the findings  concerning the infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR also 
affects the scope of the corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative 
fine487 

259.  Finally, according to the NO and DE SAs, the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures in relation 
to the additional infringement of Meta IE with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely to order Meta IE to delete 
personal data that has been unlawfully processed on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and to prohibit the use of 
this legal basis for such processing activities488.

during a complaint-based procedure, the SA  is under an obligation to take appropriate action by exercising 
corrective powers, and it cites C-311/18, paragraph 111. Additionally, the AT SA clarifies that although it takes 
the position that a complainant does not have a subjective right to request from the respective supervisory 
authority the exercise of a specific corrective power and it is up to the authority only to decide which action is 
appropriate and necessary (referring to C-311/18, paragraph 112), it finds the exercise of corrective powers to 
be necessary in the current case.

8.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

260.  The IE SA does not consider the objections above to be relevant and/or reasoned and does not follow 
them489.  Given that these objections were premised upon the requirement for the Draft Decision to 
include  a  finding  of  infringement  of  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  on  which  the  IE  SA  expressed  its 
disagreement, the IE SA does not consider the objections requesting the exercise of a corrective power 
in response to a finding of infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as being relevant and reasoned490.  

8.4  Assessment  of the EDPB 

8.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 
 

261.  The objections raised by the AT, DE, FI, FR, HU, NL and NO SAs concern “whether the action envisaged 

in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”491.  

262.  In addition to the primary argument levelled against all CSA’s objections, Meta IE provides additional 

arguments on whether these are relevant and/or reasoned492.  

263.  Meta IE argues  the  AT  and  NL  SAs’  objection  cannot  be  considered  relevant  because  they  are 
dependent on another objection, which Meta IE deems inadmissible  and without merit 493. On the 
same basis, Meta IE refutes that the AT SA’s objection is adequately reasoned494.  As stated above, in 
Section 4.4.1, the EDPB finds the AT and NL SAs’ objections  on the subject of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
relevant and reasoned495.  

264.  Additionally, Meta IE argues that the AT and NL SAs’ objections fail to set out how the Draft Decision 
would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms. First, Meta IE refers to 
their arguments put forward in response to the AT and NL SAs’ objections on the matter of compliance 
with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 496. The EDPB has taken this line of reasoning into consideration above in 

                                              
489 Composite Response, paragraphs 103-104 (in response to the AT and FI SAs), paragraph 105 (in response to 
NL SA), paragraph 106 (in response to DE SAs), paragraph 107 (in response to NO SA) and paragraph 108 (in 
response to HU SA).  
490 Composite Response, paragraphs110.  
491 EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 32.  
492 Meta IE argues that “the EDPB cannot expand the scope of the Inquiry in the manner suggested by the CSAs 
through Objections that are not relevant to the substance of the Complaint.” and “such objections ought to be 
disregarded in their entirety by the EDPB”. The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. 
See Section 4.4.1. 
493 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 71: “The AT SA’s Objection fails to satisfy the Sufficiently Relevant 
Threshold, because it is itself based on an Objection grounded in a mistaken allegation of infringement of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR, which does not satisfy the Thresholds and lacks merit. Therefore, this Objection is not sufficiently 
relevant as it has no direct connection to the substance and reasoning of the Draft Decision.” Analogous wording 
is used in response to the NL SA’s objection in Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 110. 
494 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 71: “The AT SA’s Objection fails to satisfy the Adequately Reasoned 
Threshold because it  is  premised on its  Objection that Meta Ireland infringed Article 6(1) GDPR, which, as 
analysed in the previous section, does not satisfy the Thresholds and lacks merit”. Analogous wording is used in 
response to the NL SA’s objection in Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 110.

Section 4.4.1497. Second, Meta IE puts forward that the AT and NL SAs appear to consider that the 
Draft Decision provides “a mandate for Meta Ireland to unlawfully  process data”498. Meta IE points 
out that no such inference can be drawn from the Draft Decision, going on to draw the conclusion that 
“as the Draft Decision does not in any way give a blanket approval for any unlawful processing based 
on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR,  there  is  no  direct  and  significant  risk  to  the  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms”499. As to this second line of reasoning, the EDPB fails to see wording by which the AT SA or 
NL SA might have suggested it understands  the Draft Decision  as a mandate for Meta Ireland to 
unlawfully process data, thus limiting future investigations.  

265.  The NL SA disagrees with the corrective measure chosen by the IE SA in addition to the administrative 
fine, arguing a temporary ban on processing (Article 58(2)(f) GDPR) should have been included in the 
Draft Decision  instead of an order to bring processing into compliance. If followed, this objection 
would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures. In consequence, the EDPB 
considers the objection to be relevant.  

266.  The NL SA  argues that an order to  bring processing  into  compliance  entails  that Meta IE would 
maintain its illegal conduct while they amend their compliance deficits500. Conversely, a temporary 
ban on Meta IE’s processing of  data would ensure  that data processing  is halted during the time 
needed for the company to change its practices to comply with the GDPR 501. In terms of risk, the NL 
SA puts forward that ‘’not temporarily banning  this processing would undermine the effectiveness of 
the GDPR’’, and would continue to deprive data subjects of their rights during the transition period502. 
The NL SA considers the risk significant, as the controller provides the Instagram service to hundreds 
of millions of users across Europe and because the processing involves special categories of personal 
data 503. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned and to clearly demonstrate the 
significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. 

267.  The AT SA disagrees with a specific part of the IE SA’s Draft Decision, namely Chapter 8 ‘’Order to bring 
processing into compliance’’, arguing that the LSA should have included corrective measures in order 
to remedy an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 504. More specifically, the AT SA suggests that the IE 
SA prohibits  Meta IE from relying on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 505. Therefore, if followed, this objection 
would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures506.  In consequence, the 
EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.  

268.  Furthermore, the AT SA argues that when an infringement is found - notably in light of other objections 
raised in the current case in relation to additional infringement of Articles 6(1)(b) - the supervisory 
authority is under an obligation to issue  appropriate corrective measures pursuant to Article 58(2)

GDPR. In terms of risk, the AT SA argues that without this amendment of the Draft Decision, Meta IE 
“could simply  continue to unlawfully  rely on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR and to undermine data protection 
principles” which would continue to affect millions of data subjects within the EEA507. Therefore, the 
EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned and to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks 
posed by the Draft Decision. 

269.  Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional 
and/or alternative specific corrective measures to be imposed are relevant and reasoned pursuant to 
Article 4(24) GDPR.   

270.  In addition, the EDPB recalls the analysis made in Section 4.4.1 above concerning the objections in 
relation to the additional breach by Meta IE of its lawfulness obligation made by the FR SA (requesting 
to take appropriate corrective measures), and by the FI and HU SAs (asking the LSA to take corrective 
measures under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR), which were found to be relevant and reasoned.  

271.  The EDPB recalls that the DE and NO SAs called on the LSA to take specific corrective measures in the 
event the EDPB followed their objection on compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The EDPB considers 
these  to  be  reflections  upon  how,  in  their view,  the  LSA  should  give full  effect  to  the binding 
direction(s) as set out in the EDPB’s decision508. In the absence of legal or factual arguments that would 
justify including these specific corrective measures in the Draft Decision as opposed to others, the 
EDPB does not consider this aspect of the DE and NO SAs’ objections to meet the requirements of 
Article 4(24) GDPR as they are not sufficiently reasoned.     

8.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

Preliminary matters  

272.  The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the Draft Decision  needs  to  be changed  in  respect of  the corrective 
measures proposed.  More specifically, the EDPB needs to assess  the request to impose  a ban of 
processing  for  both the infringements  of  the transparency obligations  found  by  the LSA and the 
additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR established above in Section 4.4.2, and the connected 
issue  of  the corrective measure to be  imposed  for  the infringement of  Article 6(1)  GDPR. When 
assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on 
the objection and its submissions.  

273.  By way of introduction, the EDPB highlights that the analysis carried out in this section does not refer 
to the content of the Draft Decision and of the objections in respect of the imposition of administrative 
fines, which are covered below in Section 9.

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

274.  Meta IE considers the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures in the 
event of a finding  of infringement 509 and that the EDPB lacks  competence to determine or adopt 
decisions on appropriate corrective measures510.  

275.  While Meta IE acknowledges that “Article 65(1) GDPR allows the EDPB to consider reasoned objections 
as  to  whether the envisaged  corrective measures  comply  with the GDPR”, it argues that CSAs  are 
strictly limited to criticism of the corrective measures already put forward in the Draft Decision by the 
LSA. Therefore, according to Meta IE, “should the EDPB find an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR [...], 
the appropriate course would be to refer the matter back to the LSA (i.e. the DPC) to determine whether 
to impose any appropriate corrective measures. To do otherwise, including direct the DPC to make a 
specific order in the terms proposed by certain Objections, would exceed the EDPB’s competence under 
Article 65 GDPR”511.  

276.  With respect to the issue of the corrective measure to be imposed for the infringement of Article 6(1) 
GDPR, if any, Meta IE argues that a temporary ban is neither necessary, nor proportionate to achieve 
the objective of ensuring compliance with the GDPR, as there exists alternative, less onerous measures 
to bring its processing operation into compliance with the GDPR 512. In addition, Meta IE contends that 
it would be both unfair and disproportionate to order an immediate ban given that it relied upon a 
good  faith understanding  as  to  what it considered  to be  a valid  legal basis513. Further, Meta IE 
considers there is no urgent necessity for a ban based on other decisions taken under the Article 60 
GDPR cooperation mechanism in similar circumstances514. Finally, Meta IE puts forward the significant 
impact of a temporary ban not only on its activities but also on third parties’ business, such as small 
and medium sized businesses across Europe, relying on the platform for behavioural advertising 515. 

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

277.  First of all, according to the EDPB, the views of Meta IE amount to a misunderstanding of the GDPR 
one-stop-shop  mechanism and of the shared competences of the CSAs. The EDPB recalls that the 
GDPR requires  supervisory  authorities  to  cooperate  pursuant  to  Article  60  GDPR  to  achieve  a 
consistent interpretation of the Regulation516. The fact that the LSA will be the authority that can 
ultimately exercise the corrective powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR cannot neither limit the role of 
the CSAs within the cooperation procedure nor the one of the EDPB in the consistency procedure517.

517 See  Art. 63 and 65 GDPR. In this regard it should be noted that Recital 11 GDPR stresses that ‘effective 
protection of personal data throughout the Union requires [...] equivalent sanctions for infringements in the 
Member States’. Therefore, in order to ensure this ‘consistent monitoring and enforcement’ of the GDPR, the 
legislator has decided to provide supervisory authorities with the ‘same corrective powers’ (Recital 129 GDPR).

278.  More specifically, when raising an objection on the existing or missing corrective measure(s) in the 
Drafting Decision, the CSAs should  indicate which action they believe would be appropriate for the 
LSA to undertake and include in the final decision518. In case of disagreement on these objections, the 
dispute resolution competence of the EDPB covers ‘’all the matters which are subject of the relevant 
and reasoned objection’’ (emphasis added)519. Therefore, contrary to Meta IE’s views, the consistency 
mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application by the supervisory  authorities of 
their corrective powers, taking into account the range of powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR 520, when 
a relevant and reasoned objection questions the action(s) envisaged by the Draft Decision vis-a-vis the 
controller/processor, or the absence thereof.  

279.  In addition, the EDPB finds that Meta IE misunderstands the AT SA’s objection when it argues that it 
does acknowledge that it is for the LSA alone to decide which corrective measures are appropriate 
and necessary, by citing paragraph 112 of the Schrems II CJEU judgment 521. In fact, the AT SA does no 
such thing: in its objection it stated ‘’a complainant does not have a subjective right to request from 
the respective supervisory authority (in this case: the DPC) the exercise of a specific corrective power 
and it is for the supervisory authority alone to decide which action is  appropriate and necessary (see 

C‑311/18, point 112)’’ 522 and did not engage in an interpretation of how Article 58(2) GDPR is to be 

understood  in  cross-border  cases  in  the  sections  referred  to. The  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanism of the GDPR is not addressed in CJEU ruling C-311/18 (Schrems II) either.  

280.  Moving on to the analysis of the issue of corrective measures as required by the objections found to 
be  relevant and reasoned  above, the  EDPB recalls that when  a violation  of  the  GDPR has  been 
established, competent supervisory  authorities are required to react appropriately to remedy this 
infringement in accordance with the means provided to them by Article 58(2) GDPR 523. Article 58(2) 
GDPR provides a wide choice of effective tools for the authorities to take action against infringements 
of the Regulation and which can be imposed in addition to or instead of a fine. According to Recital 
129 GDPR, every corrective measure applied  by a supervisory  authority under Article 58(2) GDPR 
should  be  ‘‘appropriate, necessary  and  proportionate  in  view  of  ensuring  compliance  with  the 
Regulation’’ in light of all the circumstances of each individual case. Recital 148 GDPR shows the duty 
for supervisory authorities to impose corrective measures that are proportionate to the seriousness 
of  the infringement 524.   This highlights the need  for the corrective measures and any  exercise of 
powers by supervisory authorities to be tailored to the specific case525. 

281.  Considering the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR established above in 
Section 4.4.2, as well as the number of data subjects affected, the EDPB shares the view of the AT, FI,

would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine”. 
The EDPB confirmed that “the indications provided by this Recital can be relevant for the imposition of corrective 
measures in general and for the  choice of the combination of corrective  measures that is  appropriate and 
proportionate to the infringement committed”. EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 256.

FR, HU and NL SAs that it is particularly important that appropriate corrective measures be imposed, 
in addition to a fine, in order to ensure that Meta IE complies with this provision of the GDPR.   

282.  In respect of which measure should be imposed, as stated, the NL SA argues that the IE SA's proposal 
to order Meta IE to comply with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within a period 
of three months is not appropriate, considering these breaches in conjunction with the gravity of the 
additional breaches of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR identified in its objection526. Instead, the 
NL SA is of the opinion  that only a temporary ban imposed in respect of all these infringements can 
effectively protect the rights of the data subjects during the transition period in which the controller 
remedies  to  these  violations527.  The  FI  SA  considers  that  the  IE  SA  should  “exercise  effective, 
proportionate  and  dissuasive  corrective  powers”  and,  taking  into  account  the  nature  of  the 
infringement, order Meta IE to “bring its processing operations into compliance with the provision of 
Article 6(1) GDPR and prohibit to process users’ personal data for behavioural advertising by relying 
on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as  laid down in  Article 58(2)(d)  GDPR”528. The HU SA proposes  to apply the 
legal consequences under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR in relation to violation of Article 6(1) GDPR by Meta 
IE and to instruct the controller to indicate a another alternative legal basis529. In addition, the AT SA 
calls on the IE SA to use its corrective powers under Article 58(2) GDPR in order to bring the processing 
operations of Meta IE into line with the GDPR, and suggests ‘’that the DPC prohibits Facebook  the 
processing  of  a  user’s  data  for  behavioural  advertising  by  relying  on  Article 6(1)(b)’  stating that 
‘otherwise, Facebook could simply continue to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR’’ 530.  

283.  Meta IE argues that a temporary ban would not be necessary as less onerous measures could be 
imposed  and  that it  would  be  unfair  and disproportionate,  also  considering  its  impact  on  third 
parties531.  

284.  The EDPB agrees with the observations made by the NL SA that the infringement found in the case at 
hand  constitutes  a  “very  serious  situation  of  non-compliance”532  with  the  GDPR, in  relation  to 
processing of “extensive amounts of [...] data, which is essential to the controller’s business mode”’533, 
thus harming “the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA”534. As a result, the EDPB 
shares the NL SA’s concern that the corrective measure chosen in the circumstances of this case should 
aim to bring the processing into compliance with the GDPR thus minimising the potential harm to data 
subjects created by the violations of the GDPR.  

                                              
526 NL SA Objection, paragraph 57. In this respect, the EDPB recalls that, as stated in Sections 4.4.2 and 5.4.2 
above, while the EDPB finds that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR in its Draft 
Decision, it does not have sufficient factual evidence allowing it to find a possible infringement by Meta IE of its 
obligations under Art. 9(2) GDPR.

285.  In addition, the EDPB recalls that contrary to Meta IE’s contention, it is not necessary to establish an 
‘urgent necessity’ 535 for imposing a temporary ban, in that nothing in the GDPR limits the application 
of Article 58(2)(f) GDPR to exceptional circumstances536. 

286.  At the same time, the EDPB notes that in assessing the appropriate measure to be applied, Recital 129 
GDPR provides that consideration  should  be given to ensuring that the measure chosen does not 
create ‘’superfluous costs’’ and ‘’excessive inconveniences’’ for the persons concerned in light of the 
objective pursued.  When  choosing the appropriate corrective measure, there is a need to assess 
whether the chosen measure is necessary to enforce the GDPR and achieve protection of the data 
subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data, which is the objective being pursued537. 
Compliance with the principle of proportionality requires ensuring that the chosen measure does not 
create disproportionate disadvantages in relation to the aim pursued. 

287.  The EDPB takes note of the elements raised by the objections, particularly the NL SA, to justify the 
need for imposing a temporary ban, consisting in essence in the need to halt the processing activities 
that are being undertaken in violation of the GDPR until compliance is ensured in order to avoid further 
prejudicing  data  subject  rights.  However,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  objective  of  ensuring 
compliance and bringing the harm to the data subjects to an end  can, in this  particular case, be 
adequately met also by amending the order to bring processing into compliance envisaged in the Draft 
Decision to reflect Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR identified in Section 4.4.2 of this Binding 
Decision. In addition to the fines that will be imposed, this measure would require Meta IE to put in 
place the necessary technical and operational measures to achieve compliance within a set timeframe.  

288.  In respect of the imposition of an order to bring processing into compliance, Meta IE submits that any 
such order should ‘’afford a reasonable opportunity’’ to Meta IE to comply538. When determining the 
transition period for bringing Meta IE’s processing into compliance with GDPR, the EDPB requests that 
the IE SA gives due regard to the harm caused to the data subjects by the continuation of Meta IE’s 
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR during this period. More specifically, the order should require Meta 
IE to restore compliance within a short period of time. In this respect, the EDPB notes that, in response 
to Meta IE’s submission,  the IE SA  considered  the  three-month deadline  for  compliance  for the 
infringements of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR necessary and proportionate 
in light of the potential for harms to the data subjects rights that such a measure entails, considering 
that the interim period for compliance ‘’will involve a serious ongoing deprivation of their rights’’539. 
The LSA also points out the significant financial, technological, and human resources, as well as the 
                                              
535 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 8.28.

537 C-311/18, Schrems II, paragraph 112: ‘’Although the supervisory authority must determine which action is 
appropriate and necessary and take into consideration all the circumstances [...]  in that determination, the 
supervisory authority is nevertheless required to execute its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully 
enforced with all due diligence’’. 
538 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, point 8.31.  
539 Draft Decision, paragraph 202. In this regard, Meta IE argues that this was not a reasonable period of time 
within which to make the necessary changes, as the changes would be resource-intensive and would require 
“sufficient lead in time for preparing, drafting, designing and engineering the relevant changes, conducting and 
taking account of user testing of the proposed changes, internal cross-functional engagement as well as of course 
engagement with the Commission, and localisation and translation of the  information for countries in  the 
European Region’’. Draft Decision, paragraph 201.

clear instructions provided to Meta IE to comply with GDPR 540. The EDPB considers that this line of 
reasoning  applies  all  the  more  to  the  corrective  measures  imposed  in  relation  to  Meta  IE’s 
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

289.  Finally, the EDPB recalls that non-compliance with an order issued by a supervisory authority can be 
relevant both in terms of it being subject to administrative fines up to 20 million euros or, in the case 
of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year in 
line with Article 83(6) GDPR, and in  terms of  it being an aggravating factor for the imposition of 
administrative fines541. In addition, the investigative powers of supervisory authorities allow them to 
order the provision of all the information necessary for the performance of their tasks including the 
verification of compliance with one of their orders542.  

290.   The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its 
processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Instagram 
services into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months. 

291.  In addition,  the EDPB notes that the current wording of the order “to bring the Data Policy and Terms 
of  Use  into  compliance  with  Article  5(1)(a),  Article  12(1)  and  Article 13(1)(c)  GDPR  as  regards 
information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”’ should be modified in order 
to reflect the EDPB’s findings in Section 4.4.2 that Meta IE is not allowed to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
for the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising. Therefore, the EDPB 
instructs the LSA to adjust its order to Meta IE to bring its Instagram Data Policy and Terms of Use into 
compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months, to refer 
not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also on data 
processed for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of Instagram services (to reflect 
the finding of the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 that for this processing the controller cannot rely on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR).

infringements 

9.1.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 
 

The application of the criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR 

293.  In its Draft Decision, the IE SA explains how it considered the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR in deciding 
whether to impose an administrative fine and to determine its amount in the circumstances of this 
case 544. The most pertinent criteria for the present dispute are summarised below. 

The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature scope or purpose 
of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage 
suffered by them (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) 

294.  The IE SA explains that it assesses the infringements of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) 
GDPR identified  in  the  Draft Decision  simultaneously  in  the  context  of  the  Article  83(2)  GDPR 
criteria 545. Further, the IE SA explains that ‘’the processing concerned’’ refers to “all of the processing 
operations that [Meta IE] carries out in the context of the Instagram service on the personal data under 
its  controllership for  which  it  relies on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR”, in line with the scope of  the inquiry 
(permissibility in principle of processing personal data for behavioural advertising)546.  

295.  In terms of the nature of the infringements, the IE SA explains that they concern a cornerstone of 
data subject  rights, namely the right to  information. The IE SA  argues that ”the provision  of  the 
information concerned goes to the very heart of the fundamental right of the individual to protection 
of personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to share their personal 
data in a voluntary situation such as this. If the required information has not been provided, the data 
subject has been deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision as to whether they wish to 
use a service that involves the processing of their personal data and engages their associated rights. 
Furthermore, the extent to which a data controller has complied with its transparency obligations has 
a direct impact on the effectiveness of the other data subject rights. If data subjects have not been 
provided with the prescribed information, they may be deprived of the knowledge they need in order 
to consider exercising one of the other data subject rights”547. Further, the IE SA points out that the

545 “While I emphasise that each is an individual and discrete “infringement” of the GDPR, I am proposing to 
assess all three infringements simultaneously as all concern transparency and, by reason of their common nature 
and purpose, are likely to generate the same, or similar, outcomes in the context of some of the Article 83(2) 
GDPR assessment criteria”. Draft Decision, paragraph 209.

breach of the transparency principle by Meta IE has the potential to undermine other fundamental 
data protection principles sur as the principles of fairness and accountability548. Finally, the IE SA notes 
that the European legislator included infringements on the right to information and Article 5 GDPR in 
Article 83(5) GDPR, which carries the highest maximum fine549. 

296.  In terms of the gravity of the infringements, the IE SA explains that Meta IE is found to also have 
infringed Article 12(1) and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR because the company has not provided the required 
information in the required manner under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. The IE SA adds that this “represents 
a significant level of non-compliance, taking into account the importance of the right to information, 
the consequent impact on  the data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects potentially 
affected”550.  

297.  With regards to the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, the IE SA considers that 
the “processing carried out by [Meta IE] in the context of the Instagram service pursuant to Article 
6(1)(b)  GDPR is extensive. [Meta IE] processes a  variety of data in  order to provide Instagram users 
with  a  ‘personalised’  experience, including  by  way  of  serving  personalised  advertisements.  The 
processing is central to and essential to the business model offered, and, for this reason, the provision 
of compliant information in relation to that processing becomes even more important. This, indeed, 
may include location and IP address data”551.  

  monthly  active accounts  and,  as  of  December 2021, it  had  approximately 

298.  With  reference to the  number of data subjects affected, the IE SA  points  out  that, as Meta IE 
confirmed, ’’as of the date of the commencement of the Inquiry, i.e. 31 August 2018, [Meta IE] had 
 
approximately 
 monthly active users in the European Economic Area” 552. While noting the figures provided by 
Meta IE incorrectly excluded the number of UK active accounts to which the GDPR was applicable at 
the date of the Complaint, the LSA considered that, when measuring these figures by reference to the 
total population of the EEA (including the UK), a ‘’significant portion of the population of the EEA seems 
to have been impacted by the infringements’’ 553. 

299.  In terms of damages suffered by affected data subjects, the IE SA finds that “failure to provide all of 
the prescribed information undermines the effectiveness of the data subject rights and, consequently, 
infringes the rights and freedoms of  the data subjects concerned. A core element of transparency is 
empowering data subjects to make informed decisions about engaging with activities that cause their 
personal data to be processed, and making  informed decisions about whether to exercise particular 
rights, and whether they can do so. This right is undermined by a lack of transparency on the part of a 
data controller”554.   

300.  On Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, the IE SA concludes that “[the] infringements are serious in nature. The lack 
of transparency goes to the heart of data subject rights and risks  undermining their effectiveness by 
not providing transparent information in that regard. While the infringements considered here relate

to one lawful basis, it nonetheless concerns vast swathes of personal data impacting millions  of data 
subjects.  When  such  factors  are considered,  it  is  clear  that  the infringements  are  serious  in  their 
gravity”555. The IE SA further notes the impact of the infringement on a ‘’significant portion of the 
population  of  the EEA’’, as well as on  ‘’data subject’s ability  to be  fully  informed  about their data 
protection rights, or indeed about whether in their view they should exercise those rights’’ 556. 

301.  The IE SA does not attach significant weight to the duration of the infringements557, considering that 
the complaint - and therefor the Inquiry - was made against a specific set of documents (Instagram’s 
Data Policy and Terms of Use) and that more recent versions of the relevant documents are outside 
the scope of the Inquiry558.  

The intentional or negligent character of the infringements (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) 

302.  The IE SA notes the complainants view that the infringement arose from ‘’[Meta IE] made a deliberate 
and  calculated decision to  present the information  in  a particular manner such  as  to mislead  data 
subject’’ 559 but states that there is no evidence that Meta IE ‘’made a deliberate decision to present 
the  information  to  data  subject  in  a  particular  way’’ 560. The  IE SA  further  notes  that the  EDPB 
Guidelines on Administrative Fines ‘’recognise that an intentional breach generally only occurs where 
there is a deliberate act to infringe the GDPR’’, and that, in this regard, ‘’a finding  of intentionality is 
predicated on knowledge and wilfulness as to characteristics of an offence’’. The IE SA finds there was 
no evidence of an intentional and knowing breach of a provision of the GDPR.  The IE SA however finds 
that the infringement was negligent, taking into account ‘’the failure of an organisation of this size to 
provide sufficiently transparent materials in relation to the core of its business mode”561. 

The  action  taken by  the controller or  processor  to mitigate the  damage suffered  by  data  subjects 
(Article 83(2)(c) GDPR) 

303.  The IE SA notes Meta IE’s position that “has discharged its transparency obligations in respect of the 
Instagram service and, accordingly, complies  fully  with the GDPR in this  respect.” Notwithstanding 
their disagreement with this position, the IE SA “accept[s] that it represents a genuinely held belief on 
[Meta IE’s] part’’. On that basis, the IE SA notes that ‘’there has not been an effort to mitigate the 
damage  to data  subjects, as  it  was  [Meta IE’s] position  that data  subjects  were incurring  no  such 
damage”562. The IE SA is not swayed by Meta IE’s argument that their efforts to comply with the GDPR

556 Draft Decision, paragraph 253. 
557 Draft Decision, paragraph 253. 
558 Draft Decision, paragraphs 218 and 253. The IE SA notes, however, that “In imposing corrective powers [...] 
the GDPR requires that the broader impact of infringements be considered” (Draft Decision, paragraph 218).  
559 Draft Decision, paragraph 231. 
560 Draft Decision, paragraph 232. In its analysis, the IE SA takes into consideration the EDPB Guidelines on 
Administrative Fines on the notions of ‘intentional’ and ‘negligent’. Draft Decision, paragraphs 230-232. 
561 In this regard, the IE SA notes that ‘’Meta Ireland should have been aware of its transparency requirements, 
especially in light of the transparency guidelines and should have provided clarity about the precise extent of the 
processing operations carried out pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Meta Ireland further should have ensured 
that it adhered strictly to its transparency obligations when choosing the lawful bases on which they rely and 
should have used these obligations as a guide as to the information to be conveyed to data subjects’’ (Draft 
Decision, paragraph 253).  
562 Draft Decision, paragraph 234.

should be taken into consideration, as - in general - compliance with the GDPR is a duty imposed on 
each controller. In the present case, the IE SA finds this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating 
insofar as “beyond simply  complying with the GDPR, there are no obvious mitigating steps that could 
have  been  taken”563. Notwithstanding  this,  the  IE SA  identifies  a  mitigating factor in  Meta IE’s 
willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the 
conclusion of the inquiry564. 

The  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  taking  into  account  technical  and  organisational 
measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR) 

304.  The IE SA does mention this factor as an aggravating factor in the Draft Decision. The IE SA takes the 
view that, considering that guidance on transparency was available to Meta IE at the date of the 
complaint, it ’’should have been aware of the appropriate standards – albeit at a general level – and, 
having made a deliberate decision to present the information in a manner which fell significant below 
the standard required, has a high degree of responsibility for the lack of compliance with the GDPR’’565. 

Any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR) 

 

305.  The IE SA does not mention this factor as an aggravating or mitigating factor in the Draft Decision 566, 
taking into consideration that ‘’the Commission  has not made any findings  of infringements by Meta 
Ireland  in  the  context  of  the  Instagram  service  which  could  be  considered  relevant  for  [this] 
assessment’’ 567. 

The categories of personal data affected by the infringements (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR) 

306.  The IE SA notes that “[the] lack of transparency concerned broad categories of personal data relating 
to users who sign up to the Instagram service”568. Although acknowledging that the assessment made 
by the IE SA in  this Inquiry  “was rather generalised in  nature” the LSA points out that the lack of 
transparency by Meta IE contributed to the “lack of  clarity as to the precise categories of personal 
data relevant for this Inquiry”569.  

307.  Nonetheless, the IE SA concludes that, in the absence of evidence that these personal data are of a 
particularly sensitive nature, this factor should be regarded as neither aggravating nor mitigating 570.

The manner in which the infringements became known to the supervisory authority (Article 83(2)(h) 
GDPR) 

308.  The IE SA  notes  that “[the]  subject  matter became known  to  the  Commission  due  to  an  Inquiry 
conducted  on  foot  of  the Complaint.  The  subject  matter did  not  give  rise  to  any  requirement of 
notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief 
is that no infringement is/was occurring”571. The IE SA does not mention this factor as an aggravating 
or mitigating factor in the Draft Decision572.  

Any other aggravating or mitigating factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

309.  The IE SA considers whether the “lack of transparency has the potential to have resulted in financial 
benefits for [Meta IE]” based on the view that a “more transparent approach to processing operations 
carried out on foot of that contract would represent a risk to [Meta IE]’s business model”, which would 
be the case “if existing or prospective users were dissuaded from using the Instagram service by clearer 
explanations of the processing operations carried out, and their purposes”. The IE SA concludes that 
this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating, arguing that “any general consideration of this [factor] 
ultimately involves an element of speculation on both [Meta IE]’s and the Commission’s part”573.  

The application of the criteria under Article 83(1) GDPR 

310.  Based on these circumstances, the IE SA considers that administrative fines pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) 
GDPR and Article 83 GDPR, totaling an amount not less than €18 million and an amount not more than 
€23 million should be issued on Meta IE for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 
13(1)(c) GDPR in the context of Instagram service574.  

311.  The LSA considers that the proposed administrative fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive 
taking into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry575. Regarding the effectiveness, the IE SA 
argues that the “infringements are  serious,  both  in  terms  of  the  extremely large  number  of  data 
subjects potentially affected, the categories of personal data involved, and the consequences that flow 
from  the  failure  to  comply  with  the  transparency  requirements  for  users”576.  Concerning  the 
dissuasiveness,  the LSA states that the fine must “dissuade both the controller/processor concerned 
as well as other controllers/processors carrying out similar processing operations from repeating the 

                                              
571 Draft Decision, paragraph 248. 
572 Draft Decision, paragraph 253. 
573 Draft Decision, paragraphs 251-252. 
574 Draft Decision, sections 9 and 10. 
More specifically, the IE SA proposes the following administrative fines (Draft Decision, paragraph 254):  
- a fine of between €11.5 million and €14 million for the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to 
the processing operations carried out on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 
13(1)(c) GDPR; 
- a fine of between €6.5 million and €9 million for the failure to provide the information that was provided on 
the processing operations carried out in foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and 
easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Articles 5(1)(a) and 12(1) GDPR. 
The proposed administrative fines are to be applied cumulatively, as they do not surpass the maximum provided 
for in Art. 83(5) GDPR. See Draft Decision, paragraphs 264, 295 and 296. 
575 Draft Decision, paragraph 258. 
576 Draft Decision, paragraph 255.

conduct concerned”577. As regards the proportionality, the IE SA considers that the fines proposed “do 
not exceed what is necessary to enforce compliance with the GDPR, taking into account the size of 
Instagram user base, the impact of the infringements on the effectiveness of the data subject rights 
enshrined in Chapter III of the GDPR and the importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR as 
a whole”578.  

312.  The IE SA refers to the need to take into account the undertaking’s turnover in the calculation of the 
maximum possible  fine  amounts579. The notion  of  “undertaking” is  determined to  refer to Meta 
Platforms, Inc. 580. The IE SA takes into consideration the revenue reported by Meta Platforms, Inc. for 
the year ending 31 December 2020 ($85.965 billion)581.  

 Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

9.1.2 
 

313.  The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs 582 object to the envisaged action taken by the LSA with regard to the 
administrative fine proposed in the Draft Decision concerning the infringements of the transparency 
obligations by asking the IE SA to impose a (significantly)583 higher administrative fine with reference 
to the established infringements.  

314.  The  dispute  arising  from  these  objections  concerns  whether  the  proposed  fine  is  effective, 
proportionate  and  dissuasive  pursuant  to  Article  83(1)  GDPR 584. With  reference  to  these  three 
criteria, the above mentioned CSAs, specifically, argue as follows.  

315.  According to the DE SAs, the fine proposed by the LSA in the Draft Decision is not proportionate with 
regard to the  financial position  of  the undertaking. More specifically,  the DE SAs  argue that the 
envisaged fine of at most 23 million euros is not proportionate compared to the worldwide annual 
turnover on Meta Platforms, Inc585. The DE SAs point out that the proposed fine ‘’represents only about 
0.03% of the turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc. and about 0.72% of the maximum fine“ 586. With respect 
to dissuasiveness,  the DE SAs consider that the fine proposed by the LSA “weakens the position  of 
supervisory  authorities  and  endangers compliance with  the GDPR’’ as this would leave controllers 
under the impression that “enforcement of the GDPR will not be felt economically’’ 587.  

316.  The FR SA argues that the amount of the envisaged fine “seems low and hardly compatible with the 
objective set by Article 83(1) GDPR of ensuring to impose dissuasive  fines” taking into account “the

number of  data subjects concerned, the particularly intrusive nature of  the processing operations in 
question, the breaches observed, the position of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited as a quasi-monopolist 
and its financial situation”588. In this respect, the FR SA notes that the fine proposed by the IE SA is no 
proportionate since “the cumulative amount of the two breaches of the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) 
and 13-1-c) of the GDPR, on the one hand, and the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) and 12-1 of the GDPR, 
on the other hand, represents only about 0.03% of the turnover of Meta Platforms Inc. and less than 
1% of the maximum fine”589.  

317.  The IT SA argues that  ‘’by having regard to the controller, in particular the nature and size of Meta 
Platforms  Inc. [...] the range at issue  would appear to be overly  low and  neither proportionate nor 
dissuasive’’ 590. 

318.  The NL  SA  doubts,  also referring to  the EDPB Guidelines  on  Administrative Fines,  that the  fines 
proposed by the IE SA meet the objective to be effective, “particularly considering the strong financial 
position of the controller and the finding that the identified lack of transparency likely has had financial 
benefits  for  the  controller”591. As  regard  to  dissuasiveness,  the  NL  SA  argues,  also  referring  to 
established CJEU case-law, that Meta IE “generates a turnover of over 86 billion dollars (approximately 
79 billion euros) per annum, therefore it would be able to generate a daily  revenue of approximately 
235 million dollars. Instead of dissuading  future behaviour, the penalty would be simply  regenerated 
in a  few hours” (specific deterrence)592. With reference to proportionality, the NL SA questions the 
lack of reasoning in the Draft Decision as to why the amounts proposed  are commensurate to the 
seriousness of the infringements593. 

319.  The NO SA argues that the envisaged amount of the fine is not effective nor dissuasive neither to Meta 
IE nor to other controllers, considering the financial benefits accrued because of the violation and 
worldwide annual turnover of Meta Platform, Inc. for 2020594 In particular, the NO SA points out that 
Meta IE “would likely have no issue paying the proposed fine, and the amount of the fine it is not likely 
to affect [it] in such a way that it would see a need to substantially  change its practices” 595. The NO 
SA illustrates this by the fact that in 2020, Meta IE set aside one billion euro of provisions to address, 
inter alia, the risk of fines for infringement to the data protection rules596. 

320.  In addition, these objections  raise arguments with regards to the weight afforded to some of the 

criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.  

321.  The IT SA objects to the LSA's decision not to consider WhatsApp's previous infringements in the case 
IN-18-12-2 as an aggravating circumstance under Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, insofar as it is part of the same 
group of companies of Meta IE. According to the IT SA “even though  the WhatsApp  case did  raise 
additional, more specific issues, one can hardly question that the relevant decision sets a key precedent

in assessing  controller’s repetitive conduct’’ as ‘’not only did the controller in question clearly stick to 
the same business  model in offering its different social networking services, it also did not change its 
assessment  as  to  how  to  manage  users’  data  with  particular  regard  to  its  information  and 
transparency obligations’’ 597. 

322.  According to the DE, FR, NL and NO SAs, the fine proposed by the LSA in the Draft Decision is not 

proportionate with regard to the seriousness of the infringement 598.  

323.  The NL  SA  argues that the  fine  is  not  commensurate with  the  seriousness  of  the infringements 
established (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) and is inconsistent with the IE SA's qualifications as such599. The FR 
SA also argues that the fine is in contradiction with the seriousness of the violations identified and the 
nature of the processing (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)600 .  

324.  The DE, FR, and IT SAs state that the fine proposed is not consistent with the amount retained by the 
IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against the company WhatsApp Ireland Limited (case IN-18-
12-2), in which the IE SA imposed an administrative fine of 225 million euros, including a fine of 30 
million euros for the infringement of Article 12 and 13 GDPR and a fine of 90 million on account of the 
infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 601. Moreover, the FR and IT SAs state that the amount proposed 
appears low also in comparison with the one retained by the LU SA in its decision  of 15 July 2021 
against the company Amazon Europe Core, where an administrative fine of 746 million euros has been 
imposed for the infringements of Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR, and which was also  based on a complaint 
that the  processing  operations  carried out  by  the  companies  of  the  Amazon  group  relating to 
behavioural advertising did not have a valid legal basis602. In addition, the FR SA notes that the amount 
of the fine proposed by the IE SA “seems to be underestimated in comparison with the amount retained 
in the deliberation of the CNIL’s restricted committee No. SAN-2019- 001 of 21 January 2019 imposing 
a  penalty  of  50  million  euros  on  the company  Google  LLC” 603. The  FR SA  considers  this  case as 
comparable because it is also  based on  a referral “filed  by  the association  ‘NOYB’ with  the CNIL, 
relating  to  a  similar  issue  and  formulated  against  Google, and  that  the restricted committee has 
identified a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR and a breach of the provisions  of Articles 12 and 13 of the 
GDPR” 604. However, the FR SA notes that “the amount retained against  Google LLC is  close to that 
proposed by  the Irish data protection authority, even though the processing operations  in question 
concern all European users, [...] which was not the case in the above-mentioned CNIL’s decision, for 
which only French users were taken into account”605.

325.  The NO SA argues that “the suggested fine is not proportionate to the seriousness of the violations and 
the aggravating  factors  identified”, the “number of  data  subjects  affected in  the EEA amounts  to 
hundreds of millions” and agrees with the LSA that the controller’s “level of responsibility is high”606.  

326.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs consider that, if adopted, the 
Draft Decision  would  lead to  a significant  risk  for  the  protection of  the fundamental  rights and 
freedoms of the data subjects607. The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs explain that it would not ensure an 
effective enforcement of the GDPR, as the proposed fine is unable to create a deterrent effect (either 
specifically towards the controller, or in general towards other controllers)608. The NO SA considers 
this would mean, “that the complainant and the affected data subjects would in practice be denied 
the level of data protection set out in the GDPR”609. The FR SA argues the Draft Decision as it stands 
would  “lead  to  a  levelling  down  of  the  level  of  administrative  fines  imposed  by  European  data 
protection authorities, thereby reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability 
to ensure effective compliance with the protection of the personal data of European residents”610. The 
DE SAs add that “the Draft Decision does not ensure a consistent application of administrative fines”611.  

9.1.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

327.  The LSA considers none of the objections relating to the quantum of the proposed administrative fine 

as relevant and reasoned612.   

328.  In relation to objections calling for an increase of the amount of the fine set out in the Draft Decision, 
the LSA states that notwithstanding the variance between the views of the CSAs on the calculation of 
the fine that the IE SA has “fully  taken into account the criteria at Article 83(2)  GDPR, and that the 
proposed administrative fines meet the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR, taking into account all the 
circumstances of this matter and as set out Part 9 of the Draft Decision” 613. The IE SA also argues that 
the IE SA considers  “the proposal  as  to  the  fine  to  be  meaningful  in  terms  of  both  the financial 
significance  of  it  on  any  view,  as  well  as  the  significant  publicity  that  a  fine  in  this  region  will 
attract’’ 614.  

329.  With reference to the objections relating to the mode of calculating the proposed administrative fine 
(assessment of the Article 83(2) GDPR criteria), the LSA does not accept that these objections  are 
relevant 615.  The  LSA  recalls  that  it  has  already  examined  in  its  Draft  Decision  whether  the 
infringements were intentional and whether Meta IE obtained a financial benefit as a result of the 
infringements, questions to which it answered in the negative616. Furthermore, the LSA takes the view

that “it would be contrary to a literal interpretation of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR to take the decision made 
by the IE SA in respect of WhatsApp Ireland Limited (i.e. IN-18-2-1) in the calculation of the fine for this 
Draft  Decision  in  circumstances  where  the  infringements  do  not  concern  the  same  controller or 
processor’’ 617.  

9.1.4  Assessment of the EDPB 
 
9.1.4.1 Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 
 

330.  The objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs concern ‘’whether the action envisaged in the 

Draft Decision complies with the GDPR’’ 618.  

331.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 

threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR 619.  

332.  With  specific  regard to these  objections  on  the  determination of  the administrative fine  for the 
transparency infringements,  Meta IE acknowledges  that the  objections  as to  whether envisaged 
corrective  measures  comply  with  the  GDPR  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  dispute  resolution 
mechanism620, however in their view, objections that solely object to the amount of a fine are outside 
the scope of this mechanism621. Meta IE argues that ‘’the DPC, as the LSA, has  the sole competence 
and discretion to impose an  administrative fine’’ 622. Moreover, Meta IE claims that the EDPB is not 
competent to determine whether the administrative fine is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive623. 
The EDPB does not share this reading of the GDPR, as explained above (see Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 
277-279 of this Binding Decision) and considers that CSAs may object to the fine amount proposed by 
an LSA in its draft decision624.

620 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 8.5 
621 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2 
622 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2. 
623 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2. Meta IE argues that “The GDPR does not confer any power on 
the EDPB to consider objections solely challenging the amount of a fine, and the EDPB may not give instructions 
as to whether a fine ought to be imposed, or as to its amount’’.  
624 In this regard, Recital 150 GDPR can be recalled, as it states that the consistency mechanism may also be used 
to  promote a consistent application  of administrative fines. Consequently, an objection  can  challenge the 
elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine, and if the assessment of the EDPB within this context 
identifies shortcomings in the reasoning leading to the imposition of the fine at stake, the LSA will be instructed 
to re-assess the fine and remedy the identified shortcomings (EDPB Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), para 91; EDPB 
RRO Guidelines, paragraph 34).  The EDPB found several objections on this subject matter admissible in the past, 
see inter alia Binding Decision 1/2020, paragraphs 175-178 and 180-181, Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraphs 
310-314,  Binding  Decision  1/2022  paragraphs  53-55,  Binding  Decision  2/2022,  paragraphs  186-190. 
Consequently, within its mission of ensuring a consistent application of the GDPR, the EDPB is fully competent 
to resolve the dispute arisen among supervisory authorities and remedy the shortcomings in the Draft Decision 
concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which will in any event be quantified and imposed by the 
LSA in its national decision adopted on the basis of the EDPB’s binding decision.

333.  The EDPB takes note of further arguments put forward by Meta IE, aiming to demonstrate the lack of 
relevance of the objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs625. Meta IE disagrees with the 
content of these objections, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility.   

334.  The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs disagree with specific parts of the IE SA’s Draft 
Decision, namely the assessment made by the LSA in Chapter 9 ‘’Administrative fine’’ and Chapter 10 
‘’Other relevant factors’’ in setting the administrative fine applicable to the violations of transparency 
identified626. If followed, these objections would lead to a different conclusion in terms of corrective 
measures imposed. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections raised by the DE, FR, IT, NL, 
and NO SAs to be relevant. 

335.  Meta IE further considers that the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs’ objections have not created “reasonable 
doubt’’ as to the validity of the LSA’s calculation of the fine and do not explain why the fine envisaged 
in the Draft Decision is incompatible with Article 83 GDPR 627. In this respect, Meta IE claims that the 
objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL and NO SAs are not sufficiently reasoned as they focus on hypothetical 
“preventive effects” of the fine on other controllers in future proceedings628. In addition, Meta IE puts 
forward that the comparison  made by  the DE, FR, and IT SAs in their objections with other fines 
imposed  in  other cases  is  not  relevant  to the  extent that fines  should  result  in  a  case-by-case 
assessment 629. Meta IE also  objects  to the FR SA’s  objection  that the fine  should  be  tied to the 
turnover, considering that Meta IE’s  turnover is only relevant for determining the  maximum fine 
amount under Articles 83(4)-(6) GDPR and not the fine amount 630. Finally, in response to the NO SA’s 
objection,  Meta  IE  argues  that  controller’s  financial  provisions  for  potential  regulatory-related 
expenses cannot be considered as a relevant factor under Article 83(2) GDPR 631. It follows from the 
above arguments that Meta IE disagrees with the reasoning provided in these objections, which thus 
concerns the merits and not the admissibility of the objection.  

336.  The EDPB finds  that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs argue why they  propose  amending the Draft 
Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed, i.e. why 
they propose to impose a higher fine for the transparency breaches632.  

                                              
625 Meta IE argues that these objections are “a direct criticism of the amount of the DPC’s proposed fine (i.e. an 
area within the DPC’s sole discretion as LSA) rather than the lawfulness of the DPC’s reliance on the relevant 
factors to calculate the fine (which would be the Draft Decision’s relevant legal and factual content to which 
the [CSAs] could object)’’. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.17 - 2.19, 5.13, 7.12, 8.23, and

627 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.21, 5.15, 5.17-18, 7.14, 8. 25, and 9.22. In this regard 
Meta IE submits that ‘’a fine proposed by the LSA is effective, proportionate, and dissuasive as long as the criteria 
laid down in Article 83(2) GDPR are duly taken into account (which is clearly the case here). Indeed, the calculation 
of fines is subjective, and there is significant variance amongst objecting CSAs as to what the appropriate fine 
should be’.

337.  In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk 
to fundamental rights and argues the objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs fail to demonstrate 
the contrary, as required633. 

338.  In particular, Meta IE considers that the DE, FR SA and IT SAs’ objections appear to focus on increasing 
the “punitive impact” of the fine on Meta IE, instead of demonstrating any significant risks  to the 
fundamental rights of data subjects634. Meta IE further claims that the NL and NO SAs’ objections does 
not set out how the proposed fine would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights and 
freedoms635.  In  addition,  Meta  IE  argues  the  DE,  FR,  IT,  NL  and  NO  SAs’  objections  rest  on 
unsubstantiated possible effect the Draft Decision could have on future behaviour of other controllers, 
without demonstrating how  this  Decision  would  lead to  significant risks  in  the case at hand636 . 
Therefore, Meta IE claims that, in doing so, the assessment made by the DE, FR, IT and NL SAs is 
incorrect as they do not consider the reputational costs generated by such a fine637.  

339.  First, the EDPB notes that any risk assessment addresses future outcomes which are to some degree 
uncertain, and finds there is no basis in the GDPR to limit the notion of risks to the boundaries of the 
particular case at hand.  Article 4(24) GDPR refers to the risks posed to the "fundamental rights and 
freedoms of data subjects" and “where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union”. 
Both of these aspects are phrased in a general way. The wording of this provision does not in any way 
limit the demonstration of the risks to showing the risks posed to the data subjects affected by the 
concrete processing carried out by the specific controller, in light of the objective of guaranteeing a 
‘’high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals’’ 638. Therefore, the risks 
posed by a draft decision to be demonstrated by a relevant and reasoned objection might also concern 
data subjects whose personal data might be processed in the future, including by other controllers.   

340.  The EDPB also notes that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs639 considered both of the aspects that are 

entailed by dissuasiveness  of the fine, i.e. specific deterrence and general deterrence640.

not to comply with the GDPR’’.

640 The CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive fine is one that has a genuine deterrent effect, encompassing 
both specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again) 
and general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future). See, inter

341.  The EDPB finds  that the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs articulate an adverse effect on the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee 
a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals641. 

342.  Therefore, the EDPB considers the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs objections to be reasoned. 

9.1.4.1  9.1.4.2. Assessment on the merits 

343.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject  of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR. 

344.  The  EDPB recalls  that  the  consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent 
application of  administrative fines642. A fine  should  be  effective, proportionate and dissuasive,  as 
required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the case643. In addition, when deciding 
on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. 

345.  The  EDPB  responds  to  Meta IE’s  argument that  the  LSA  has  sole  discretion  to  determine  the 
appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above (see Section 8.4.2,  
paragraphs 277 -279 as well as footnote 624).  

346.  The finding in the Draft Decision of a transparency infringement for the processing concerned still 
stands.  The EDPB recalls that, on  substance,  no  objections  were raised on  this  finding. Meta IE 
infringed its general transparency obligations by being unclear on the link between the purposes of 
processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved644, irrespective of 
the validity of the legal basis relied on for the ‘processing concerned’. It remains the case that, for the 
transparency infringements, ‘‘the processing concerned’’ should be understood as meaning all of the 
processing operations that Meta IE carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which 
Meta IE indicated  it relied  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR 645, including  for  the purposes  of  behavioural 
advertising. This is without prejudice to the fact that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR as a legal basis to process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising as part of 
the delivery of  its Instagram service under the Terms of Use. Whether or not Meta IE appropriately 
chose its legal basis for processing, the transparency infringement as assessed in the Draft Decision 
still  stands.  Therefore, the  IE SA  must  not  modify  this  description  retro-actively in  light  of  the 
assessment of the validity of the legal basis, including for the purpose of carrying out any reassessment 
of the administrative fines originally proposed  by the Draft Decision, as might be required by this 
Binding Decision.

347.  In light of the objections found relevant and reasoned, the EDPB addresses whether the Draft Decision 
proposes a fine for the transparency infringements that is in accordance with the criteria established 
by Article 83(2) GDPR and the criteria provided for by Article 83(1) GDPR. In doing this, the EDPB will 
first assess the disputes arisen in respect of the analysis of specific criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR 
performed by  the LSA, and  then examine whether the proposed  fine  meets the requirements of 
effectiveness, dissuasiveness  and proportionality  set in Article 83(1) GDPR, including by  affording 
adequate weight to the relevant factors and to the circumstances of the case.  

On any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor (Article 83(2)(e) GDPR)  

348.  Article 83(2)(e) GDPR requires supervisory  authorities to give due regard to any previous  relevant 
infringement of the GDPR by the controller or processor as one of the circumstances that justifies an 
increase in the basic amount of the fine. As similar reference can be found in Recital 148 GDPR. 

349.  For the purposes  of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, both previous infringements of the same subject matter 
and infringements of a different subject  matter but committed in a manner similar to that under 
investigation, should  be  considered  as relevant. Furthermore, the EDPB recalls that the scope  of 
assessment of infringements may include not only previous decisions by the investigating supervisory 
authority, but also infringements found by other authorities, provided that they are relevant to the 
case under investigation646.   

350.  The  EDPB  first  notes  that, contrary  to  Meta  IE’s  views647,  substantial  similarities  exist  in  the 
infringements  found  by  the LSA  in  its draft decision  and in  its  decision  IN-18-12-2 in  relation to 
WhatsApp  Ireland Limited and  in  which  breach of  GDPR obligations  were established.  As rightly 
pointed out by the IT SA, the LSA indeed considered in both decisions  that the controller had not 
provided transparent information on the legal basis and purposes of the processing operations or sets 
of processing operations carried out, thereby infringing Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) 
GDPR 648.  

351.  The IT SA contends that, to the extent that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are part of the same 
corporate group, the previous decision concerning WhatsApp Ireland Limited “sets a key precedent in 
assessing  a controller’s repetitive conduct”, as “not only did the controller in question clearly stick to 
the same business  model in offering its different social networking services, it also did not change its 
assessment  as  to  how  to  manage  users’  data  with  particular  regard  to  its  information  and 
transparency obligations”649. The IE SA disagrees with this objection, considering that Article 83(2)(e) 

                                              
646 EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, paragraph 93.  
647 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 10.3. According to Meta IE’s the DPC Final Decision IN-18-12-2 
against WhatsApp Ireland Limited concerns ‘’wholly separate proceeding involving wholly separate allegations 
and claims’’.

GDPR cannot apply in the circumstances of this case insofar as its decision against WhatsApp Ireland 
Limited was addressed to a different controller650.  

352.  In this respect, the EDPB notes that Meta IE and WhatsApp Ireland Limited are both subsidiaries of 
Meta Platforms, Inc. 651. Nonetheless, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR draws a distinction between on 
the one hand the “controller” or “processor”652, which are responsible for complying with the rules of 
the GDPR, and on the other hand the “undertaking”653  to which the controller or processor is part of, 
and that may be found jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine654. In this context, Article 
83(2)(e) GDPR explicitly refers to the need to consider previous relevant infringements committed ‘’by 
the controller or processor’’ (emphasis added).  

353.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that the Final Decision does not need to refer to the infringements by 
WhatsApp Ireland Limited, as established in Decision IN-18-12-2, as an aggravating factor under Article 
83(2)(e) GDPR for the calculation of the fine.  

The effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness  of the administrative fine (Article 83(1) GDPR) 

354.  With regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the corrective 
measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour, or 
both655. In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is 
one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general 
deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific 
deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again)656. 
Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages both the 
controller or  processor  concerned  as well  as other  controllers or  processors  carrying out  similar 
processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct. Proportionality of the 
fine needs also to be ensured as the measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that 
objective657. In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s views that there is no basis to conclude 
that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive effect 658. 

                                              
650 Composite Response, paragraph 125. According to the IE SA, this stems directly from the wording of Article 
83(2)(e) GDPR, which ‘’expressly states that only relevant previous infringements by the same controller or 
processor must be taken into consideration’’.

653 According to Recital 150, ‘’where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should

to settled case-law of the CJEU, the  term ‘undertaking’ “encompasses every entity engaged in an economic 
activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed’’ (see, in this regard, EDPB 
Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 292).

355.  The EDPB reiterates that it is  incumbent  upon  the supervisory  authorities to  verify  whether the 
amount  of  the  envisaged  fines  meets  the  requirements  of  effectiveness,  proportionality  and 
dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety 
of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple 
infringements, 
increases  and  decreases  for  aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances  and 
financial/socio-economic  circumstances659. Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is not 
an arithmetically precise exercise660, and supervisory  authorities have a certain margin of discretion 
in this respect 661. 

356.  The DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs , object to the level  of the fine envisaged  in the Draft Decision as  they 

consider  the proposed fine not effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR)662.  

357.  These CSAs argue that the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR are not weighed correctly by the LSA when 
calculating the administrative fines in the present case, in light of the requirements of Article 83(1) 
GDPR 663. Specifically, the DE, FR, IT,  NL and NO SAs argue that the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision 
is not proportionate with IE SA’s findings in relation to the nature and seriousness of the infringements 
and the number of data subjects concerned664. 

358.  In addition, these CSAs argue that the fine is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive taking into 

account the financial position of Meta Platform, Inc. 665. 

359.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s disagreement with the fine proposed by the IE SA666 and their view 
that the LSA already considers all factors it considered to be relevant to Article 83(2) GDPR and that 
‘’none of the CSAs have created any reasonable doubt as to the validity of the DPC’s calculation’’ 667.  

360.  The EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA indicates being satisfied the proposed fines are 
effective, proportionate  and  dissuasive,  taking  into  account all  the  circumstances of  the  IE SA’s 
inquiry668. The IE SA assessed the different criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR in relation to the transparency

infringements found669. The IE SA considered the infringements as serious in nature670, and in terms 
of gravity of the infringements found a significant level of non-compliance671. Furthermore, the EDPB 
underlines  that, as established  by the IE SA, the infringements affect a significant number of data 
subjects672  and are extensive673. The EDPB also observes  that the IE SA  considered  the negligent 
character of the infringement 674, as well as the high level of responsibility of Meta IE for the lack of 
compliance with the GDPR 675 as aggravating factors under  Article 83(2) GDPR. Further, the IE SA 
qualified the level of damage suffered by data subjects as significant 676. In addition, the IE SA identified 
only  one  mitigating factor, without indicating, however,  whether this  should  lead  to  a slight  or 
substantial reduction of the fine range677. 

361.  Meta IE argues that reputation costs should also be taken into consideration, citing the IE SA’s remark 
on  “the significant publicity that a fine in this  region will  attract”678.  On principle, the EDPB agrees 
that reputation costs could be taken into consideration to some extent, if credible arguments are put 
forward about the grave detriment that would ensue. Meta IE does not present such arguments679. 
The EDPB is of the view that in this case other incentives would offset any reputational costs. As far as 
advertisers are concerned, Meta IE puts  forward that “The  personalised  nature  of  the  Instagram 
Service is  also  the reason  why  it  has  been instrumental  in  the success  of  small  and  medium  sized 
businesses  (“SMBs”) worldwide, including across  the EU. Personalisation  on  social media  and other 
digital technologies, including the Instagram Service, enables SMBs to compete for customers through 
“customizing [sic] products and services, [...] building a unique brand image, tailoring marketing to a 
specific audience and developing a strong one-to-one connection with a community of customers’’ 680. 
As far as users of the Instagram service are concerned, there are network effects at play which leads 
to incentives to join  - or not leave  - the platform, so  as not to be excluded from participating in 
discussions, corresponding with and receiving information from others681. 

362.  According to the DE, FR, and IT SAs, the proposed fine is not consistent with the fine of 225 million 
euros decided upon by the IE SA in its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited

675  Draft Decision, paragraph 240. The IE SA  considers that ‘’Meta Ireland should have been aware of the 
appropriate standards –  albeit at  a general level –  and, having made a  deliberate decision to present  the 
information in a manner which fell significant below the standard required, has a high degree of responsibility 
for the lack of compliance with the GDPR’’.  
676 The IE SA finds it sufficiently shown that “rights have been damaged in a significant manner, given the lack of 
an opportunity to exercise data subject rights while being fully informed”, Draft Decision, paragraph 229  
677 Draft Decision, paragraphs 234 - 236. 
678 Composite Response, paragraph 119. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, paragraphs 2.26, 5.24,

679 Meta IE states that “even if Meta Ireland or other companies could ever consider that multi-million fines are 
negligible from a financial point of view (a statement that is unsubstantiated and disputed), such companies 
would obviously be concerned by the reputational cost of such fines.” Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1,

for the same transparency infringements (breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR)682. In particular, the 
DE SAs point out that ‘’the facts  and  the seriousness  of  the infringements  in the two cases  are no 
sufficiently  different to  justify  a  difference of  85% in  the  fine imposed’’ 683. The FR and  IT SAs also 
compare with the fine of 746 million euros decided by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against 
the company Amazon Europe Core for carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis 
and for transparency infringements (Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR)684. While the EDPB agrees with both 
the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR685, 
the EDPB notes that the cases cited by the DE, FR and IT SAs do show marked similarities with the 
current case, as they both refer to large internet platforms run by data controllers with multi-national 
operations and significant resources available to them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. 
Moreover,  there  are  similarities  with  regards  to  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  infringements 
involved686. Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter. 

363.  The DE, FR, IT and NO SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine range is about 0.03 %687 
of the global annual turnover of Meta Platforms, Inc., which the DE SAs note is about 0.72% of the 
maximum ceiling provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR 688.  For illustrative purposes also, is the amount 
of time it would take Meta Platforms, Inc. on average to generate 23 million euros in turnover in 2020, 
which was about 2 hours and 33 minutes689. 

364.  The EDPB agrees with the objections  raised that - if the proposed fine was to be imposed  for the 
transparency infringements  -  there would  be  no  sufficient  special  preventive  effect towards the 
controller, nor a credible general preventive effect690. The proposed fine amount, even where a final 
amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, 
in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of 
doing business691. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model692, the risk of 
this occurring is all the greater693. By bearing the cost of the administrative fine, the undertaking can 
avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future 
losses that would follow from the adjustment.

365.  Though the IE SA touches upon  the notions  of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness  in 
relation to the proposed  fine694, there is no justification based on elements specific to the case to 
explain the modest fine range chosen.  Moreover, the EDPB notes that while the IE SA takes into 
consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the 
maximum amount of the fine provided for in Article 83(5) GDPR 695, the IE SA does not articulate how 
and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the administrative 
fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness696. In this regard the 
EDPB recalls that, contrary to Meta IE’s views697, the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not 
exclusively relevant for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 
83(4)-(6) GDPR, but should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, 
to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR698. 
The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in 
which the turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of 
the fine.  

366.  In light of  the above, the EDPB considers  that the proposed fine  does  not adequately reflect the 
seriousness  and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the 
fine does not fulfil  the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive  in accordance 
with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly 
higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit 
for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line 
with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness  enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR 
in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine. 

9.2  On the determination of an administrative fine for further infringements  

9.2.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

367.  The IE SA in the Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to 
process personal data to deliver its service as outlined in the Instagram Terms of Use and is not legally 
obliged to rely on consent in order to do so (Finding 1)699. Alongside, the IE SA concludes that Meta IE 
can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to carry out the personal data processing activities 
involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as that forms 
a core part of  the service (Finding 2)700. In these terms, the IE SA did not propose to establish an 
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.

scope of the dispute as no CSAs raised an objection on the consideration of turnover under this provision (Meta

368.  In addition, no infringement of Article 9(1) GDPR has been found as the IE SA has not identified and 
separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data by Meta IE in the context of 
Instagram Terms of Use. 

369.  The IE SA in its Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has infringed Article 5(1)(a), Article 13(1)(c) and 
Article 12(1) GDPR due to the lack of transparency in relation to the processing for which Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR has been relied on (Finding 3)701.   

9.2.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

370.  The AT, DE, FR, IT,  NO, and SE SAs702 object to the LSA’s failure to take action with respect to one or 
more specific infringements they deem should have been found and ask the IE SA to impose a higher 
administrative fine as a result of these additional infringements.   

Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR or 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 

371.  The DE and FR SAs ask for the administrative fine to be increased703 as a consequence of the proposed 
finding of an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 704. The AT, NO and SE SAs argue that the fine should 
be increased following the finding of an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 705.    

372.  The DE SAs state that the fact that Article 6(1) GDPR was infringed is not properly reflected in the 
calculation of the fine in the Draft Decision706. The DE SAs argue that in the current case the processing 
of  personal  data was performed  without a legal basis  as  consent of  the data subjects  would  be 
required, which was not given, and that the “Draft Decision is insofar not in compliance with Article 83 
GDPR as  it  does  not  consider  the additional  infringement  of  Articles  5(1)(a),  Art. 6(1),  9(1)  when 
calculating  the  amount  of  the  administrative fine”707. The DE SAs  state that it is a highly  serious 
infringement  under  Article 83(2)(a)  GDPR considering  that personal  data of  at least 
 
individuals were affected708. The DE SAs also highlight that the fine imposed needs to aim to prevent 
further infringements of the GDPR; first, it should have “special preventive” effects, meaning that the 
amount imposed needs to be such that “it is not to be expected that the specific controller will commit 
similar infringements again” by having “such a noticeable impact on the profits of the undertaking that 
future infringements of data protection law would not be ‘discounted’ into the processing performed

by  the undertaking lightly”; secondly, it should  have  ‘’general preventive” effects by leading other 
controllers to “make a significant effort to avoid similar violations”709.  

373.  The FR SA considers that some violations are wrongly not included in the Draft Decision710 and argues 
that “since it considers  that breach of  Articles 6  has  been committed, which is  added  to the other 
breaches found  by the Irish data protection authority, the amount proposed by the latter should be 
accordingly increased” 711. The FR SA recalls that the same approach of cumulating the amounts of the 
fine has been adopted by the EDPB in points 324 to 327 of its Binding Decision 1/2021712. 

374.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs explain that the shortcoming of the Draft Decision 
would cause significant risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, “because 
an effective enforcement  of the GDPR, which  is the precondition for the protection of the fundamental 
rights  and  freedoms of  the data  subjects, cannot  be ensured’’713.  The DE SAs  also point  out that 
administrative fines shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and both 
special and general preventive since these two “concepts aim to protect the fundamental rights and 
freedom of the data subjects by preventing further infringements of the GDPR”714. Moreover, the DE 
SAs raise that “the non-compliance with one of the central provisions of the GDPR would not have any 
negative financial impact on the undertaking and therefore, from an economical point of a view could 
be a reasonable option for controllers’’ 715. The FR SA considers that adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision 
as it stands “presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in accordance 
with Article 4(24) of  the GDPR”716 and “would lead to a levelling down of  the level of administrative 
fines  imposed  by  European data  protection authorities, thereby reducing  the  authorities' coercive 
power  and,  consequently, their  ability  to  ensure  effective compliance  with  the  protection  of  the 
personal data of European residents”717.  

*** 

375.  The AT, NO and SE SAs, which considered that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR 718, ask for the administrative fine to be increased as a consequence of that infringement.  

376.  The AT SA argues that “the additional infringement [of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] is not properly reflected 
in  the  envisaged  amount  of  the administrative  fine” and that the IE SA’s Draft Decision  is not  in 
compliance with Article 83 GDPR insofar as it does not consider the additional infringement of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR when calculating the amount of the administrative fine719.

377.  The NO SA states that an administrative fine should be imposed for Meta IE’s processing of personal 
data in the context of online behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis720. The NO SA analyses 
several of the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR in order to prove the need of the imposition of an 
administrative fine721. Specifically,  the NO  SA  argues that an administrative fine  of  a  substantial 
amount is needed, in light of the nature and gravity of the infringement (given that “the principle of 
lawfulness  [...] is a  fundamental pillar  of  the GDPR” and “processing personal  data without a legal 
basis  is  a clear violation of  the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection because no one 
should  have  to  tolerate processing  of  their  personal  data  save  for  when  it  is  legitimised  by  the 
legislators”722), as well  as the  scope  of  the processing  (“wide”, as ‘’all  data  subject  activity  may 
potentially be used for OBA purposes”), the number of data subjects affected in the EEA (“hundreds of 
millions”)  and the intangible damage suffered by  them (Article 83(2)(a)  GDPR), the high  level  of 
responsibility of Meta IE (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR), the categories of personal data involved (“of a very 
personal and private nature”, able to “reveal intimate details of the data subjects’ lifestyle, mindset, 
preferences, psychological wellbeing et cetera”) (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR) and an additional aggravating 
factor (high likelihood of contribution to development of ‘’targeting algorithms which may be harmful 
on an individual  and societal level’’, Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)723.  

378.  The SE SA argues that “the Draft Decision is not in compliance with Article 83 insofar as the additional 
infringement of  Article 6(1)(b)  is  not considered in calculating  the administrative fine” and that “an 
administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR cannot be regarded as ‘effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive’  when  the provision  that  the processing  is  based  on, namely  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR, was 
infringed  and  when  this  infringement  is  not  properly  reflected in  the  envisaged  amount  of  the 
administrative fine”724. The SE SA takes the view that that the intentional character of the infringement 
(Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) and the financial benefits gained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 
must be found as aggravating factors725. As to intentionality, the SE SA argues that the switch from 
consent to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in 2018 suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing 
the new rights afforded to users by the GDPR when the processing relies upon consent, and that in 
any way the infringement needs to be considered as intentional at least as of the moment of adoption 
of  the EDPB Guidelines  on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR which  “clearly  gives  doubt  to  the  legality  of  the 
processing”726. As to the financial benefits gained, the SE SA argues “Meta Ireland has made significant 
financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it 
offer for its social media platform service” and that due to the unclear information provided to data 
subjects it can be reasonably assumed that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to 
the processing 727. Lastly, the SE SA considers it would be appropriate to take into account Meta IE’s 
turnover for the calculation of the fine in order to make it effective and dissuasive728.

379.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT SA argues that “should the Draft Decision be approved in 
its current version, the risks  for the fundamental rights and freedoms of  data subjects lie in the fact 
that the action envisaged in relation to the controller is likely to fall short of the proportionality and – 
above all – dissuasiveness requirements set forth in Article 83 GDPR” and that “ignoring infringements 
of the GDPR when calculating fines would lead to lesser compliance with the GDPR and ultimately to 
lesser protection of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data”729. The NO SA explains 
that not imposing a fine for the lack of legal basis creates the risk that the violated provisions  are not 
respected by Meta IE or other controllers and the LSA would not be able to effectively safeguard the 
data  subjects’  rights, and  that  “in  absence  of  corrective  measures  that  create  the  appropriate 
incentives for [Meta IE] and other controllers to change their behaviour, the same or similar violations 
are likely to reoccur to the detriment of the complainant and other data subjects” 730. The SE SA argues 
the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR “is  not  properly reflected in the envisaged  amount of  the 
administrative fine, it shows controllers (Meta Ireland included) that enforcement of the GDPR and its 
provisions is not effective. This threatens compliance with the GDPR on a general level, seeing as how 
non-compliance could  be a viable option  for controllers when the costs  for compliance are greater. 
Given  the  proposed  changed  findings  regarding  legal  basis,  there  are  significant  risks  to  the 
fundamental rights  of  data subjects  if these does  not also  merits a  substantive increase in  fines to 
dissuade Meta Ireland and other controllers”731.  

Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 9 GDPR 

380.  The DE and  FR SAs  argue that, as  the IE SA  should  have identified  and  separately assessed  any 
processing of special categories of personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of the Instagram 
Terms  of  Use  and  that Meta IE processes  the entire  amount  of  data  it  holds,  including  special 
categories of data in breach of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR 732, the amount of the fine should be increased 
accordingly733.  

381.  The DE SAs state that “the infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 6(1) and Article 9(1) GDPR [...] also 
entails an administrative measure and a fine according to Art. 83(2)(5) GDPR”734, and argue that these 
infringements are “serious”735. The FR SA considers that a breach of Article 9 GDPR is wrongly not 
included  in the Draft Decision736 and that the amount of the fine proposed  by the LSA should  be 
increased in light of the addition of such infringements to those already established737. The FR SA 
recalls that the same approach of cumulating the amounts of the fine has been adopted by the EDPB 
in points 324 to 327 of the Binding Decision 1/2021738.  

382.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs explain that the shortcoming of the Draft Decision 
would cause significant risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, “because 
an effective enforcement  of the GDPR, which  is the precondition for the protection of the fundamental

rights  and  freedoms of  the data  subjects, cannot  be ensured’’ 739.  The DE SAs  also point  out that 
administrative fines shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and both 
special and general preventive since these two “concepts aim to protect the fundamental rights and 
freedom of the data subjects by preventing further infringements of the GDPR”740. Moreover, the DE 
SA raises that “the non-compliance with one of the central provisions of the GDPR would not have any 
negative financial impact on the undertaking and therefore, from an economical point of a view could 
be a reasonable option for controllers’’ 741. The FR SA considers that adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision 
as it stands “presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in accordance 
with Article 4(24) of  the GDPR”742 and “would lead to a levelling down of  the level of administrative 
fines  imposed  by  European data  protection authorities, thereby reducing  the  authorities' coercive 
power  and,  consequently, their  ability  to  ensure  effective compliance  with  the  protection  of  the 
personal data of European residents”743.  

Objections requesting the imposition  of a  fine for the additional  infringement of Article 5(1)(a) and 
5(1)(b)-(c) GDPR 

383.  The IT SA argues that the fine should be increased following the finding of an infringement of Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR 744, and of Article 5(1)(b)  and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR 745. As stated in Section 6.2 of this 
Binding  Decision, the  IT SA  agrees to  a large extent with  the Draft Decision’s  Finding  3  on  the 
infringement of Article 12(1), Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency746 but 
it argues that Meta IE has also failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR, which, in the view  of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from  those relating 
specifically to transparency747. Moreover, as analysed in Section 7.2, the IT SA states that there is an 
additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on account of Meta IE’s failure to 
comply with the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles748. The IT SA asks for a fine to be 
issued for those two additional infringements. With regard to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the IT SA argues 
that the finding of such infringement “should result into the imposition of  the relevant administrative 
fine as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR” as far as “the infringement of the fairness principle  in addition to the 
transparency one [...]  should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having 
regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive.  Indeed, the gravity 
of the infringement would be factually compounded”749. With reference to Article 5(1)(b) and Article 
5(1)(c) GDPR, the IT SA considers that “the infringement of purpose limitation and data minimisation 
principles (...) should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having regard 
to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive.  Indeed, the gravity of the 
infringement would be factually compounded”750.

384.  On the significance of risks posed by the Draft Decision, the IT SA argues that “the failure to find an 
infringement of Article 5(1)(a)  GDPR as for the fairness principle may become a dangerous precedent 
with a view to future decisions concerning other digital  platform operators – more generally, other 
controllers that rely on the same business model – and markedly weaken the safeguards to be provided 
by way  of the effective, comprehensive implementation of the data protection framework including 
the fairness of processing principle” 751. With reference to Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the 
IT SA adds that, should the Draft Decision be approved in its current version, the infringement of two 
key  principles  of  the  whole  data protection  framework  as  introduced  by  the  GDPR will  not  be 
punished, “which would seriously jeopardise the safeguards  the data subjects (Instagram users) are 
entitled to”752.  

9.2.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

385.  The  LSA  considers  none  of  the  objections  requesting the  imposition  of  a fine  for  the  proposed 
additional infringements  as meeting the threshold  set by  Article 4(24) GDPR 753. Given  that these 
objections  were  premised  upon  the  requirement  for  the  Draft  Decision  to  include  findings  of 
infringement of Article 6(1)(b), Article 9, Article 5(1)(a), 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) GDPR, on which the IE SA 
expressed its disagreement – the IE SA does not consider the objections  requesting exercise of a 
corrective power in response to these findings of infringement as being relevant and reasoned. 

9.2.4  Analysis of the EDPB 
9.2.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

386.  The objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, IT, NO, and SE SAs concern “whether the action envisaged in 

the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”754.  

387.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 
threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR 755.  Meta IE rejects the objections in this section based on its view 
that the LSA has sole discretion to determine corrective measures756. The EDPB responds  to these 
arguments above (see  Section 8.4.2) and is  of  the view  that CSAs  may ask for specific  corrective 
measures to be taken by the LSA, whether this concerns infringements already identified in the Draft 
Decision  or  as  a result  of  the one  identified  by  the CSA  in  its  objection757. Meta IE refutes the 
allegations of  additional  infringements  put  forward  in  the  objections,  and  by  consequence,  any 
demands  for  increasing  the  administrative  fine  in  relation  them758.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the 
assessment of admissibility of objections and the assessment of the merits are two distinct steps759.  

388.  The EDPB finds that the objections concerning the increase of the administrative fine in connection 
with the additional infringement of Article 6(1)/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR raised by the AT,

DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs stand in direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, as they 
concern the imposition of a corrective measure for an additional infringement, which would be found 
as a consequence of reversing the conclusions  in the Draft Decision also in scope of this dispute760. 
Clearly, the  decision  on  the  merits of  the  demands  to take corrective measures  for  a  proposed 
additional infringement is affected by the EDPB’s decision on whether to reverse the findings in the 
Draft Decision and whether to instruct the LSA to establish additional infringements.  

389.  The EDPB takes note of further arguments put forward by Meta IE aiming to demonstrate the lack of 
relevance of  these  objections,  specifically  with  regard to  the  objections  raised  by  the  AT SA761. 
However, the EDPB notes that Meta IE disagrees with the content of these objections, which concerns 
its merits and not its admissibility.  

390.  If followed, these objections  would lead to a different conclusion  in terms of corrective measures 
imposed762. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE 
SAs in  connection to imposing  an administrative fine for the alleged breach of Article 6(1)/6(1)(b) 
GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR to be relevant. 

391.  Meta IE argues that the AT, NO, and SE SAs objections in relation to the need to increase the fine 
amount because of the alleged infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR lacks adequate reasoning as they 
fail to demonstrate why Meta IE could not rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 763. According to Meta IE, the 
SE SA’s objection is also based on the unfounded claim that Meta IE intentionally sought to circumvent 
data subject rights by switching from consent to contractual necessity as the legal basis in May 2018764. 
Furthermore, Meta IE takes the view that the objections from the AT, DE, FR and NO SAs are not 
sufficiently reasoned as they refer to the use of administrative fine as ''general preventive measures'' 
on  controllers,  thus  speculating  on  potential  future  behaviour  or  intentions  of  unidentified 
controllers765. The EDPB understands  that Meta IE disagrees with  the reasoning  provided  in  the 
objections, which thus concerns their merits and not their admissibility.  

392.  In addition, Meta IE argues that the FR SA’s objection is not reasoned because it does not substantiate 
“how a fine for the additional purported infringements would be calculated, whether this fine would 
need to be added to the proposed fine and how this would affect the overall fine”766. Meta IE further 
takes issue with the AT SA’s objection and argues it has not put forward a sufficiently reasoned basis 
for its objection to challenge the LSA’s calculation of the criteria laid down in Article 83(2) GDPR767.  In 
this respect, the EDPB recalls that CSAs are not required to engage in a full assessment  of all the

explain how this relates to any specific factual and legal content of the Draft Decision’’.

other controllers will take note of this in such circumstances’’.

aspects of Article 83 GDPR in  order for  an objection  on the appropriate administrative fine to be 
considered reasoned. It is sufficient to lay out which aspect of the Draft Decision that, in their view, is 
deficient/erroneous and why. Second, the EDPB recalls that the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR 
are not  exhaustive,  thus  it  is  entirely possible  to  argue an  administrative fine  is  not  “effective, 
proportionate and  dissuasive”  in the meaning of Article 83(1) GDPR without referring to a specific 
criterion listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. 

393.  The EDPB finds that the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs adequately argue why they propose amending the 
Draft Decision768  and  how  this  leads  to  a  different  conclusion  in  terms  of  administrative  fine 
imposed  769. 

394.  In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk 
to  fundamental  rights,  and  argues  the  objections  of  the  AT,  DE ,FR, NO  and  SE SAs770  fail  to 
demonstrate the contrary, as required. 

395.  More specifically,  Meta IE considers  that the  DE and  FR SAs’  objections  focus  on  increasing the 
‘’punitive impact’’ of  the fine  on  Meta IE rather than  demonstrating any  significant risks  to the 
fundamental rights of data subjects771. In this regard, Meta IE argues the AT, DE, NO, and SE SAs’ 
objections rest on unsubstantiated possible  effect of the Draft Decision on the future behaviour of 
other controllers, instead of doing a case by case assessment under Article 83 GDPR 772. In particular, 
Meta IE claims that, in doing so, the assessment made by these supervisory authorities is incorrect to 
the extent it only takes into account financial costs and does not consider reputational costs773.  

396.  The EDPB recalls that any risk  assessment addresses  future outcomes  which are to some degree 
uncertain774. Contrary to  Meta IE’s views, the  objections  reflect specifically  on  Meta IE’s future 
approach in the event the Draft Decision is adopted as it stands and go beyond providing “speculative 
argument based on the putative lack of a general preventive impact on other controllers” 775.  The EDPB 
also notes that the DE, FR, NL, NO and SE SAs776 considered both of the aspects that are entailed by 
dissuasiveness of the fine, i.e. specific deterrence and general deterrence777.

freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee 
a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals  778.   

398.  Therefore, the EDPB considers the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs objections concerning the imposition of 
a  fine  for  the  alleged additional  infringements  of  Article 6/6(1)(b)  and/or  Article  9  GDPR to  be 
reasoned. 

*** 

399.  With respect to the objection raised by the IT SA concerning the imposition of an administrative fine 
for  the infringement  of  the fairness  principle  enshrined  in  Article 5(1)(a)  GDPR, the EDPB finds, 
contrary to Meta IE’s views779,  that it stands in connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, 
as it concerns the imposition of a corrective measure for an additional infringement, which would be 
found as a consequence of incorporating the finding put forward by the objection. Clearly, the decision 
on the merits of the demand to take corrective measures for a proposed additional infringement is 
affected by the EDPB’s decision on whether to instruct the LSA to include an additional infringement. 

400.  If  followed,  the  IT  SA’s  objection  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  in  terms  of  corrective 
measures imposed  780. Taking note of Meta IE’s position781, the EDPB finds the objections raised by 
the IT SA to be relevant. 

401.  Meta IE argues the IT SA’s objection does not put forward reasonable doubt as to the validity of the 
LSA’s  calculation  of  the  fine  and  claims  there  is  no  basis  in  the  GDPR for  suggesting  that an 
administrative fine must have a ‘’general deterrent effect’’782.The EDPB finds that the IT SA adequately 
argues why they propose amending the Draft Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in 
terms of administrative fine imposed783.

the future). See, inter alia, C-511/11, Versalis, paragraph 94.

12;  SE SA Objection, p. 5. See also EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 37.  
779 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.13. According to Meta IE, the IT SA objections is not relevant 
given that the LSA has not found any infringement of the fairness, purpose limitation and data minimisation 
principles (Article 5(1)(a)-(c) GDPR).  
780 IT SA Objection, p. 7.  
781 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 7.13. According to Meta IE, given the IE SA has not found any 
infringement of the fairness principle, there is no basis for the imposition of a fine on this ground. EDPB already 
responded to this line of reasoning above in Section 8.4.2. 
782 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 7.15-16. 
783 The IT SA argues that the finding of such infringement “should result into increasing the amount of the said 
fine substantially by having regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive’’ 
insofar as ‘’the gravity of the infringement would be factually compounded.” (IT SA Objection, pp. 6-7).  

Adopted 

104 

402.  Meta IE argues the objection of the IT SA fails to demonstrate the risk posed by the Draft Decision, as 
required 784 and, in doing so, Meta IE dismisses the concerns articulated by the IT SA on the precedent 
the Draft Decision sets for other controllers785.  

403.  The EDPB finds that the IT SA articulates an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection 
in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals786.   

404.  Therefore, the EDPB considers  the IT SA’s  objection  concerning  the imposition  of  a fine  for the 
additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be reasoned. 

*** 

405.  The EDPB recalls its analysis of whether the objection raised by the IT SA in respect of the proposed 
additional infringements of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR meets the threshold set by Article 
4(24) GDPR (see Section 7.4.1 above). In light of the conclusion that such objection is not relevant and 
reasoned, the EDPB does not need to further examine this linked objection.     

9.2.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

406.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a Binding Decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject  of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR. More specifically, 
the  EDPB needs  to  assess  whether  an  administrative  fine  should  be  imposed  for  the  additional 
infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR and the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. However, 
in light of its findings in Section 5.4.2 above, the EDPB does not need to examine the merits of the 
objections of the DE and FR SAs requesting the imposition of a fine for the alleged additional breach 
of Article 9 GDPR. 

407.  The  EDPB recalls  that  the  consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent 
application  of  administrative fines  787  and  that the  objective  pursued  by  the corrective measure 
chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules or to punish unlawful behaviour (or both)788. 
The EDPB responds above to Meta IE’s position that the LSA has sole discretion to determine which 
corrective measures are appropriate (see Section 8.4.2).

408.  The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 789 
and that the objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs found to be relevant and reasoned 
requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose an administrative fine 790.  

409.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that, even if an infringement is found, the appropriate course 
would  be to  refer the matter back  to the LSA to determine whether to impose  any  appropriate 
corrective measures791, and that the LSA has sole competence and discretion regarding the amount of 
the fine792. The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s argument that the LSA has sole discretion to determine 
the appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above in Section 8.4.2.    

410.  The EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one793. In the case at hand, however, 
the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in their objections. 
The EDPB reiterates that lawfulness  of  processing  is  one  of  the  fundamental pillars  of  the data 
protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a 
clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection 794.  

411.  Several of the factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR speak strongly in favour of the imposition  of an 

administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) 

412.  As mentioned above and outlined below795, the nature and gravity of the infringement clearly tip the 

balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine.  

413.  With respect to the scope of processing, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data 
processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that “Meta 
Ireland processes a variety of data in order to provide Instagram users with a ‘personalised’ experience, 
including by way of serving personalised advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to 
the business model offered [...]’’ 796.

what is effective, proportional and dissuasive in each case will have to also reflect the objective pursued by the 
corrective  measure  chosen, that is  either  to  re-establish compliance with the rules,  or  to  punish unlawful 
behaviour (or both)”), p.  7  (“The Regulation requires assessment of  each case  individually”; “Fines are  an 
important tool that supervisory authorities should use in appropriate circumstances. The supervisory authorities 
are encouraged to use a considered and balanced approach in their use of corrective  measures, in order to 
achieve both an effective and dissuasive as well as a proportionate reaction to the breach. The point is to not 
qualify the fines as last resort, nor to shy away from issuing fines, but on the other hand not to use them in such 
a way which would devalue their effectiveness as a tool.”).

414.  In this respect, the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal 

data of a significant number of people 797 and that the impact on them has to be considered.   

415.  Though the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that 
data subjects  have  been  faced with  data  processing  that  should  not  have  occurred  (by  relying 
inappropriately on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR as a legal basis  as established  in Section  4.4.2). The data 
processing  in  question  -  behavioural  advertising  -  entails  decisions  about  information  that data 
subjects are exposed to or excluded from receiving. The EDPB recalls that non-material damage is 
explicitly regarded as relevant in Recital 75 and that such damage may result from situations “where 
data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over 
their personal data”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, a risk 
of damage caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the 
infringement itself.  

The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) 

416.  The SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be considered intentional on Meta 

IE’s part, which is an aggravating factor 798.  

417.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the aim to infringe the 
GDPR, nor was negligent - but “has relied on what it has consistently considered in good faith to be a 
valid legal basis  for the purpose of processing of personal data for behavioural advertising and which 
now requires escalation to the EDPB for resolution”799. Before addressing each of the elements of this 
claim, the EDPB first  notes that establishing  either intent or  negligence is  not a requirement for 
imposing  a fine, but deserves  “due regard”. Second, contrary to what Meta IE implies,  the mere 
circumstance that a dispute between the LSA and the CSAs has escalated to the EDPB does not serve 
as evidence that a controller acted in good faith with respect to the disputed issues. First, the dispute 
arises only (long) after the controller has decided on its course of action, and therefore cannot inform 
it. Second,  a dispute  may simply  bring  to light  that an  LSA  has  decided  to challenge  a  position 
commonly held by (a majority of) the CSAs.   

418.  The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the 
basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the 
willfulness in relation to such act 800. By contrast, an infringement is “unintentional” when there was a 
breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement.  

419.  The characterisation of an infringement as intentional or  negligent shall be  done on  the basis  of 
objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case801. It is worth noting the broader 
                                              
797 Draft Decision, paragraph 253, the Instagram service is provided to a significant portion of the population of 
the EEA. This aspect was also highlighted by the objections raised by the NO SA (NO SA Objection, pp. 10-11)

Administrative Fines: “in general, ‘intent’ includes both knowledge and wilfulness in relation to the characteristics 
of an offence, whereas ‘unintentional’ means that there was no intention to cause the infringement although the 
controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the law”.

approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in 
which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain 
degree  of  knowledge  about  a  potential  infringement802.  This  provides  an  indication  that  non-
compliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential 
breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence. 

420.  The SE SA argues that Meta IE “has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the 
aforementioned [EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] – which clearly gives doubt to the 
legality of the processing – which were first adopted on 9 April 2019 and made final on 8 October 2019. 
The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date”803.  

421.  The EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
there were clear indicators that spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in WP29 Opinion 
02/2010 on online behavioural advertising, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy 
Directive - is put forward as possible legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 
of the Data Protection Directive to a large extent, WP29 Opinion 02/2010 remained a relevant source 
on this matter for controllers preparing for the GDPR to enter into application. Second, WP29 Opinion 
06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing 
is  covered  by  a  contract  does  not  automatically  mean  that  the  processing  is  necessary  for  its 
performance. For example, Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s 
tastes and lifestyle  choices based on  his click-stream on  a website and the items purchased. This  is 
because  the  data  controller  has  not  been  contracted to  carry  out  profiling,  but  rather  to  deliver 
particular  goods  and  services,  for  example.  Even  if  these  processing  activities  are  specifically 
mentioned in the small  print of  the contract, this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the 
performance of the contract”804. 

422.  It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR. However,  this  mere  element  is  not  sufficient  to  consider  an infringement 
intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated.   

423.  The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the 
“will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines  on 
calculation of  fines  and WP29 Guidelines  on Administrative Fines,  where the knowledge and the 
“wilfulness”  are considered  two  distinctive  elements of  the  intentionality805. While  it may  prove 
difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need 
to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality806.  

424.  The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. 
In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”, 
                                              
802  The  EDPB  Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraph 56 (Example 4) quote the  EDPB Guidelines on 
Administrative Fines, which mention, among the circumstances indicative of negligence, “failure to adopt 
policies (rather than simply failure to apply them)”.

rather than “intentionality” when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care 
which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and 
individual  situation”807.  In  this  regard, while  the  EDPB confirms  that  a company  for  whom  the 
processing  of  personal data is at the core of its  business  activities is expected to have sufficient 
measures in place for the safeguard of personal data 808, this does not, however, per se change the 
nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional.  

425.  In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement 
on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch 
suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under Article 
6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that “[the]  proposed finding  of  infringement concerning information 
deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this conclusion, 
since it goes to show that Meta Ireland was aware of the questionable legality of that basis  and tried 
to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects”809.   

426.  The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Instagram Terms of Use as an 
objective element, however this alone does not indicate intention. Around  this time period, many 
controllers  updated their data protection policies.  The objection  suggests that the conclusion  on 
intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations. In the EDPB’s view, 
the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient 
to indicate intention either.  

427.  Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE 
to act in breach of the law as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its 
legal obligations. 

428.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SA do not meet the threshold 
to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of the view 
that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.  

429.  At the same time, the EDPB notes  that, even  establishing  that the infringement was  committed 
negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities 
should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR 810.   

430.  The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly 
seriously  negligent in  not taking adequate action, within  a reasonable  time period,  following the 
adoption of the EDPB Guidelines  2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR on 9 April 2019. Even before that 
date, the EDPB considers there was at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the 
contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on 
the notion of legitimate interests (see paragraph 421 of this Binding Decision), which means Meta IE 
had (or should  have had) knowledge about the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, given the fact

that processing of personal data is at the core of its business practices, and the resources available to 
Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with data protection legislation.  

The  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  taking  into  account  technical  and  organisational 
measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR) 

431.  The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same 

grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regards to the transparency infringements811. 

The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

432.  The SE SA argues Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract as legal basis 
for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Instagram812. While not 
providing an estimate of  its size, the SE SA considers  the existence of financial benefit sufficiently 
proven on the basis of “the self-evident fact that Meta Ireland has made significant financial gain from 
being able to provide personal advertisement as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social 
media platform service, as opposed to establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear 
in the information to data subjects, it is a reasonable assumption that more data subjects have been 
misled  into  being  subject  to the  processing, thus  increasing  the  financial  benefits  gained  by  Meta 
Ireland pursuant to personal advertisement” 813.  

433.  As explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k)  GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from the 
infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. The aim of 
Article 83(2)(k) GDPR is to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive 
in each individual case814.  

434.  In particular, in view of ensuring fines that are effective, proportionate and deterrent, and in light of 
common accepted practice in the field of EU competition law815, which inspired the fining framework 
under the GDPR, the EDPB is of the view that, when calculating the administrative fine, supervisory 
authorities could take account of the financial benefits obtained from the infringement, in order to 
impose a fine that aim at “counterbalancing the gains from the infringement”816. 

435.  When applying this provision, the supervisory  authorities must “assess  all the facts of  the case in a 
manner  that  is  consistent  and  objectively  justified”817.  Therefore,  financial  benefits  from  the 
infringement could  be  an aggravating circumstance if the case provides  information  about profit 
obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR 818. 

                                              
811 Draft Decision, paragraph 240. In this respect, the EDPB notes that the high degree of responsibility of Meta 
IE for the non-compliance with the GDPR was considered as an aggravating factor by LSA for the calculation of 
the fine.

436.  In the present case, the EDPB considers  that it does  not  have sufficiently  precise  information to 

evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.  

437.  Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they 
are  disproportionally  low  compared  to  the  benefits  obtained  with  the  infringement. The  EDPB 
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement 
is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, 
the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.   

Competitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

438.  The NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “that the unlawful processing of personal data in all 
likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual or 
societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to [Meta IE]. The algorithms may 
have contributed to giving [Meta IE] a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors”819. 

439.  On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case 
provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR820. 
In the present case, the EDPB considers  that it does  not  have sufficiently  precise  information to 
evaluate  the  existence  of  a  competitive  advantage resulting  from  the  infringement.  The  EDPB 
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from 
the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of 
the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed. 

*** 

440.  Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance 
with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers  that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an 
additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line 
with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency 
infringements  relating to processing  carried out in  reliance on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR 821. The EDPB 
underlines  that, in  order to  be  effective, proportionate  and  dissuasive,  a fine  should  reflect the 
circumstances  of  the  case.  Such  circumstances  not  only  refer  to  the  specific  elements  of  the 
infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely 
its financial position. 

9.2.4.2.2  Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of the 

fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR  

441.  The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness 
principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 822 and that the objection raised by the IT SA, which was found to

be relevant and reasoned,  requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose  an administrative 
fine823. 

442.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that it would not be appropriate for the EDPB to instruct the 
LSA to take corrective measures in relation to the additional infringement of the fairness principle 
under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR considering that this issue does not fall within the scope of the Inquiry. The 
EDPB responds to these arguments above in Section 6.4.2824.   

443.  The EDPB recalls that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one825. In the same vein, the EDPB’s 
assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness is carried out by taking into account 
the specificities of the case, of the particular social networking service at hand and of the processing 
of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising 826.  

444.  As previously  established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically 
linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent 
meaning 827. It underpins  the whole data protection framework and plays a key role for securing a 
balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship828. 

445.  Considering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6.4.2 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements 
of the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects 
as to the processing of their personal data, fulfilling data subjects’ reasonable expectation, ensuring 
power balance, avoiding deception and ensuring ethical and truthful processing, as well as the overall 
effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR, the 
EDPB reiterates its view that Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 
and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into account by the IE SA 
in the calculation of the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed following the conclusion of 
this inquiry. 

446.  Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness 
principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when re-assessing the administrative 
fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. 
If, however, the IE SA considers  an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an 
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any 
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it 
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.

10 BINDING DECISION 

447.  In light of the above, and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue 
binding  decisions  pursuant  to Article 65 GDPR, the EDPB issues  the following  Binding Decision  in 
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. 

448.  The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, in 

accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR.  

On  the  objections  concerning  whether  the  LSA  should  have  found  an  infringement  for  lack  of 
appropriate legal basis 

449.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, HU , NL, NO, and SE SAs regarding Meta 
IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Instagram Terms of Use meet 
the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

450.  On the parts of the DE SAs’ objection requesting the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, 
and the parts of the DE and NO SAs objections requesting specific corrective measures under Article 
58  GDPR  for  the  infringement  of  Article  6(1)  or  6(1)(b)  GDPR, namely  the  imposition  of  an 
administrative  fine,  a  ban  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and an order to 
identify  a valid  legal basis  for future  behavioural  advertising or  to abstain  from  such  processing 
activities, the EDPB decides that these parts of their objections do not meet the threshold of Article 
4(24) GDPR. Similarly, the part of the FI SA objection concerning the imposition of a specific corrective 
measures, namely an administrative fine is not reasoned and does not meet the threshold of Article 
4(24) GDPR. 

451.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE 
may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of Instagram Terms of Use, and to include 
an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified in this 
Binding Decision. 

On the objections concerning whether the LSA’s Draft Decision includes sufficient analysis and evidence 
to conclude that Meta IE is not obliged to rely on consent to process the Complainant’s personal data 

452.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FI, FR, and NL  SAs regarding the LSA’s Finding 1 
that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Instagram 
Terms of Use meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

453.  On the part of the NL SA objection asking  the IE SA to include  in its Draft Decision  the elements 
concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices 
under  ePrivacy legislation, the EDPB decides  that this  part falls  outside  the  scope of  the  EDPB’s 
mandate. The objection raised by the ES SA regarding the potential infringement of Article 9 GDPR is 
not sufficiently reasoned and, therefore, the EDPB decides that the objection of the ES SA does not 
meet the threshold provided for by Article 4(24) GDPR. 

454.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB 
decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its 

Adopted 

113 

Instagram service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and 
complies  with  the  relevant  obligations  under  the  GDPR  to  the  extent  that  the  investigation 
complements the findings  made in the IE SA’s Final Decision adopted on the basis of this  Binding 
Decision; and, based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft decision in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR. 

On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness  

455.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the infringement by Meta IE of the principle 

of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

456.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision an additional infringement of the principle of 

fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE. 

On  the  objection  concerning  the  potential  additional  infringement  of  the  principles  of  purpose 
limitation and data minimisation 

457.  On the objection by the IT SA concerning the possible  additional infringements of the principles  of 
purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the EDPB decides this 
objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

On the objections concerning corrective measures other than administrative fines 

458.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional and/or alternative 

specific corrective measures to be imposed meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

459.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing 
of personal data for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of the Instagram service 
into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months. 

460.  The EDPB also instructs the LSA to adjust its order to Meta IE to bring Instagram Data Policy and Terms 
of  Use  into  compliance  with Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and Article 13(1)(c)  GDPR within  three 
months, to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
but also to data processed for the purposes  of behavioural advertising in the context of Instagram 
service (to reflect the finding of the EDPB that for this processing the controller cannot rely on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR).   

On  the  objections  concerning  the  determination  of  the  administrative  fine  for  the  transparency 
infringements 

461.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE, FR, IT, NL, and NO SAs regarding the determination of 
the administrative fine for the transparency infringements, meet the requirements of Article 4(24) 
GDPR. 

462.  The EDPB considers that the Final Decision does not need to refer to the infringements by WhatsApp 
Ireland Limited, as established in Decision IN-18-12-2, as an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(e) 
GDPR for the calculation of the fine. 

463.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the 
turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine, as 

Adopted 

114 

appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive  in accordance with Article 
83(1) GDPR.  

464.  The EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity 
of the infringements nor has a dissuasive  effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the 
requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) 
GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for the 
transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative fine 
envisaged  in  the  Draft Decision.  In doing  so,  the  IE SA  must  remain in  line  with  the criteria of 
effectiveness,  proportionality,  and  dissuasiveness  enshrined  in  Article  83(1)  GDPR  in  its  overall 
reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.  

On the objections concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis 

465.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs regarding the imposition of an 
administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR meet the requirements 
of Article 4(24) GDPR.  

466.  In relation to intentionality under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the arguments put 
forward by the SE SA in their objection do not contain sufficient objective elements to demonstrate 
the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE.  

467.  Regarding the possible  financial benefit obtained from the infringement as well as the competitive 
advantage (Article 83(2)(k)  GDPR), the EDPB instructs the IE SA to ascertain if an estimation of the 
financial benefit from the infringement is possible  in this case. Insofar as further estimation of the 
financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the 
amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.  

468.  The EDPB instructs  the IE SA  to  cover the  additional  infringement of  Article 6(1)  GDPR with an 
administrative fine which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive  in accordance with Article 83(1) 
GDPR. In determining the fine amount, the IE SA must give due regard to all the applicable factors 
listed in Article 83(2) GDPR, in particular the nature and gravity of the infringement, the number of 
data subjects affected and the seriously negligent character of the infringement. 

On  the objection  concerning  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the infringement  of  the 
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 

469.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for 

the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.  

470.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to factor the additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined 
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR into its adoption of appropriate corrective measures. In this respect, the IE SA 
is instructed to take due account of this infringement when re-assessing the administrative fines for 
the transparency infringements  and  the determination  of  the fine  for  the  lack of  legal basis.  If, 
however, the IE SA  considers  an  additional  fine  for the  breach of  the principle  of  fairness  is  an 
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any 
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it 
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.   

Adopted 

115 

On the objection concerning the imposition  of an administrative fine  for the infringement of Article 
5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR 

471.  The EDPB decides that it does not need to examine the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition 

of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.
