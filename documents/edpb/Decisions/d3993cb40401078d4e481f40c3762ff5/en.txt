The European Data Protection Board 

Having  regard  to  Article  63  and  Article  65(1)(a)  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC 
(hereinafter, “GDPR”)1, 

Having regard to the  European Economic Area (hereinafter, ‘’EEA’’)  Agreement and in particular to 
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  Joint  Committee 
No 154/2018 of 6 July 20182, 

Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure (hereinafter, “EDPB RoP”)3, 

Whereas: 

(1)  The  main  role  of  the  European  Data  Protection  Board  (hereinafter,  “EDPB”)  is  to  ensure  the 
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To that effect, it follows from Article 60 GDPR 
that  the  lead  supervisory  authority  (hereinafter,  “LSA”)  shall  cooperate  with  the  other  supervisory 
authorities concerned (hereinafter, “CSAs”) in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs 
shall  exchange  all  relevant  information  with  each  other,  and  that  the  LSA  shall,  without  delay, 
communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other CSAs. The LSA shall without delay 
submit a draft decision to the other CSAs for their opinion and take due account of their views. 

(2)  Where  any  of  the  CSAs  expressed  a  reasoned  and  relevant  objection  on  the  draft  decision  in 
accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR and Article 60(4) GDPR and the LSA does not intend to follow the 
relevant and reasoned objection or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA 
shall submit this matter to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR. 

(3) In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall issue a binding decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is 
an infringement of the GDPR.  

(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the 
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) EDPB RoP, within one month 
after  the  Chair  of  the  EDPB  and  the  competent  supervisory  authority  have  decided  that  the  file  is 
complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of 
the subject-matter upon decision of the Chair of the EDPB on own initiative or at the request of at least 
one third of the members of the EDPB. 

(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able 
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of 
the extension by a simple majority of its members. 

(6) In accordance with Article 11(6) EDPB RoP, only the English text of the decision is authentic as it is 
the language of the EDPB adoption procedure.

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING BINDING DECISION 

1  SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE 

1.  This  document  contains  a  binding  decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 

in  accordance  with 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.  This  Binding  Decision  concerns  the  dispute  arisen  following  a  draft  decision 
(hereinafter,  “Draft  Decision”) 
issued  by  the  Irish  supervisory  authority  (“Data  Protection 
Commission”,  hereinafter  the  “IE  SA”,  also  referred  to  in  this  document  as  the  “LSA”)  and  the 
subsequent  objections  expressed  by  several  CSAs,  namely  the  German  supervisory  authority  for 
Hamburg  (“Der  Hamburgische  Beauftragte  für  Datenschutz  und  Informationsfreiheit”)  representing 
the views of itself and the other German supervisory authorities, including the German supervisory 
authority for Berlin (“Der Berliner Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit”), the German 
supervisory authority for Bremen (“Der Landesbeauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit 
der Freien Hansestadt Bremen”) and the German supervisory authority for North Rhein-Westphalia 
(“Der Landesbeauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit Nordrhein-Westfalen”), hereinafter 
referred  to  collectively  as  the  “DE  SAs”;  the  Finnish  supervisory  authority  (“Tietosuojavaltuutetun 
toimisto”),  hereinafter  the  “FI  SA”;  the  French  supervisory  authority  (“Commission  Nationale  de 
l'Informatique et des Libertés”), hereinafter the “FR SA”; the Italian supervisory authority (“Garante 
per  la  protezione  dei  dati  personali”),  hereinafter  the  “IT  SA”;  the  Dutch  supervisory  authority 
(“Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”), hereinafter the “NL SA”; and the Norwegian supervisory authority 
(“Datatilsynet”), hereinafter the “NO SA”.  

2.  The  Draft  Decision  related  to  an  “own-volition  inquiry”  which  was  commenced  by  the  IE  SA  on  21 
September 2020 regarding processing activities of Facebook Ireland Limited, a company established 
in  Dublin,  Ireland.  The  company  has  subsequently  changed  its  name  to  “Meta  Platforms  Ireland 
Limited” and hereinafter it is referred to as “Meta IE”. Any reference to Meta IE in this Binding Decision 
means  a  reference  to  either  Facebook  Ireland  Limited  or  Meta  Platforms  Ireland  Limited,  as 
appropriate.  

3.  The  Draft  Decision  concerned  Meta  IE’s compliance with  Article 5(1)(a) and  (c),  Article  6(1),  Article 
12(1), Articles 13, 24, 25 and 35 GDPR in respect of certain processing of child users4 personal data in 
the  context  of  the  “Instagram”  social  media  networking  service  (hereinafter,  “Instagram”).  In 
particular, it concerned the personal data processing by Meta IE in relation to public disclosure of email 
addresses  and/or  phone  numbers  of  child  users  of  the  Instagram  business  account  feature  and  a 
public-by-default setting for personal accounts of child users on Instagram. 

4.  The IE SA stated in its Draft Decision that it was satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning 
of the GDPR, for Meta IE, as controller in respect of the cross-border processing of personal data in 
the context of the Instagram service5. 

5.  The following table presents a summary timeline of the events part of the procedure leading to the 

submission of the matter to the consistency mechanism: 

21 September 2020 

The  IE  SA  commenced  the  inquiry  and  requested  information  from 
Meta IE. The scope and legal basis of the inquiry were set out in the 

                                                           
4 Instagram registered users aged between 13 and 17 years old. A person must be at least 13 years old to register 
as an Instagram user. See Draft Decision, paragraph 9.  
5 Draft Decision, paragraphs 47-57.

27 November 2020 

11 June 2021 

Notice of Commencement of the inquiry that was sent to Meta IE on 
21 September 2020. The temporary scope of the inquiry was set to 
cover a period between 25 May 2018 and 21 September 2020. 

On 27 October 2020, Meta IE provided replies to preliminary queries 
by the IE SA. 
The IE SA provided Meta IE with a Statement of Issues, where it set 
out the factual summary of relevant issues and described the matters 
for determination under the GDPR.  

On 10 December 2020, Meta IE made submissions in response to the 
Statement of Issues and on 29 January 2021, provided the IE SA with 
an updated Legitimate Interest Assessment. 
The  IE  SA  issued  a  Preliminary  Draft  Decision  against  Meta  IE 
regarding  its  processing  activities  within  the  scope  of  the  inquiry 
(“Preliminary  Draft  Decision”).  The  IE  SA  invited  Meta  IE  to  make 
submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision. 

August-September 2021  On  9  August  2021,  Meta  IE  provided  its  submissions  on  the 
Preliminary Draft Decision to the IE SA  (“Meta IE Preliminary Draft 
Submissions”). On 16 August 2021 Meta IE provided to the IE SA an 
additional expert report. On a separate request from the IE SA, on 23 
September 2021 Meta IE provided additional submissions regarding 
Article 83(3) GDPR (“Meta IE Submissions on Article 83(3) GDPR”). 
On 3 December 2021, the IE SA shared its Draft Decision with the CSAs 
in accordance with Article 60(3) GDPR.

13 May 2022 

Several  CSAs  (DE  SAs,  FI  SA,  FR  SA,  IT  SA,  NL  SA  and  NO  SA)  raised 
objections in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR. Several comments 
were also exchanged. 
The  IE SA issued  a Composite  Response  setting out  its  compromise 
proposals (“Composite Response”) and shared it with the CSAs. The 
IE SA requested the relevant CSAs to provide an indication of whether 
the IE SA’s compromise proposals could be satisfactory for the CSAs 
as a possible way forward. 
In  light  of  the  proposals  in  the  Composite  Response,  further 
exchanges  took  place  between  the  IE  SA  and  the  CSAs.  During  the 
exchanges, several CSAs confirmed to the IE SA that its compromise 
proposals  were  not  sufficient  and  they  intended  to  maintain  their 
objections.  
On 25 February 2021 Meta IE was invited to exercise its right to be 
heard in respect of all the material that the IE SA proposed to refer to 
the EDPB and on 6 April 2022 Meta IE provided its submissions (“Meta 
IE Article 65 Submissions”). 
The IE SA referred the matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 
60(4) GDPR, thereby initiating the dispute resolution procedure under 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.

6.  Following the submission by the IE SA of this matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR 
in the Internal Market Information system (hereinafter, “IMI”)6 on 13 May 2022, the EDPB Secretariat 
assessed the completeness of the file on behalf of the Chair of the EDPB in line with Article 11(2) EDPB 
RoP.  

7.  The  EDPB  Secretariat  contacted  the  IE  SA  on  20  May  2022,  asking  for  information  and  additional 
documents to be submitted in the IMI. The IE SA provided the information and documents on 24 May 
2022.  

8.  A matter of particular importance that was scrutinized by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be 
heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Further details on this 
are provided in Section 2 of this Binding Decision. 

9.  On 1 June 2022, after the IE SA and the Chair of the EDPB confirmed the completeness of the file, the 

EDPB Secretariat circulated the file to the EDPB members. 

10. The Chair of the EDPB decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) 
EDPB RoP, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on account of 
the complexity of the subject-matter. 

2  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

11. The EDPB is subject to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular Article 41 (the right to good 

administration). This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB RoP.    

12. The EDPB’s decision “shall be reasoned and addressed to the lead supervisory authority and all the 
supervisory authorities concerned and binding on them” (Article 65(2) GDPR). It is not aiming to address 
directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possible need for the 
EDPB to offer the right to be heard at the EDPB level to Meta IE7, the EDPB assessed if Meta IE was 
offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the procedure led by the LSA 
and the subject matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB, and in particular if all the documents 
containing  the matters  of facts  and  law  received  and  used  by the EDPB  to  take  its  decision  in  this 
procedure have already been shared previously with Meta IE.  

13. The EDPB notes that Meta IE has received the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard regarding 
all the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered by the EDPB in the context of 
this decision and provided its written observations8, which have been shared with the EDPB by the 
LSA9. 

                                                           
6 The Internal Market Information (IMI) is the information and communication system mentioned in Art. 17 EDPB 
RoP. 
7 See EDPB Guidelines 03/2021 on the application of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, adopted on 13 April 2021 (version for 
public consultation) (hereinafter, “EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a)”), paragraphs 98-99. 
8 In particular, Meta IE Preliminary Draft Submissions dated 9 August 2021, Meta IE Submissions on Article 83(3) 
GDPR dated 23 September 2021, Meta IE Article 65 Submissions dated 6 April 2022. 
9 The EDPB notes that Meta IE recognised that it “was afforded the opportunity to make written submissions in 
respect of the Draft Decision, the Composite Response, and the objections of the CSAs to the [IE SA]” (Meta IE’s 
Letter to the EDPB dated 17 May 2022). The IE SA also confirmed that Meta IE was invited to exercise its right to 
be heard “in respect of all of the material that IE SA proposed to refer to the EDPB” (Letter from the IE SA to the 

Adopted

14. Considering  that  Meta  IE  has  been  already  heard  by  the  IE  SA  on  all  matters  of  facts  and  of  law 
addressed by the EDPB in its decision, the EDPB is satisfied that the Article 41 of the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights has been respected. 

3  CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION 

15. The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4) 

and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR10. 

3.1.  Objections expressed by CSAs in relation to a draft decision 

16. The EDPB notes that several CSAs (DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and NO SA) raised objections to 
the Draft Decision via IMI in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR. Each of the objections was submitted 
within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR. 

17. The Portuguese supervisory authority (“Comissão Nacional de Proteção de Dados”)  and the Danish 
supervisory authority (“Datatilsynet”) provided comments on the Draft Decision. As these comments 
are not objections within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR, they cannot trigger the dispute resolution 
mechanism of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR and therefore are not part of the scope of this Binding Decision11.  

3.2. 

The LSA does not follow the relevant and reasoned objections to the draft 
decision or is of the opinion that the objections are not relevant or reasoned 

18. According to the IE SA, the responses received from the CSAs in relation to the Composite Response 
showed that there was no single proposed compromise that was agreeable to all of the relevant CSAs. 
In accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR, the IE SA submitted the matter to the consistency mechanism 
for dispute resolution by the EDPB pursuant to Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. The IE SA clarified in its Letter to 
the EDPB Secretariat concerning the Article 65 GDPR referral of the dispute to the EDPB that it does 
not  propose  to “follow”  the  objections that were  raised by the  CSAs and/or does  not consider the 
objections to be relevant and reasoned12. 

3.3.  Admissibility of the case 

19. As a preliminary remark, the EDPB takes note of the views of Meta IE that an escalation by the IE SA to 
the EDPB was premature and that the Article 60 GDPR process had not been fully exhausted in the 
present case13. The EDPB however finds that the case at issue fulfils, prima facie, all the elements listed 

                                                           
EDPB  Secretariat  dated  12  May  2022).  Finally,  as  Meta  IE  recognised  in  its  Article  65  Submissions  “[t]hese 
submissions are directed only to those matters which are the subject of an objection and matters [Meta IE] has 
been  informed  will  be  referred  by  the  [IE SA]  to  the  dispute  resolution  mechanism”  (Meta  IE  Article  65 
Submissions,  p.  1).  The  EDPB  Secretariat  checked  and  confirmed  that  the  EDPB  was  provided  with  the  same 
documents, which contained the relevant matters of fact and of law. The only additional documents included 
were the different submissions of Meta IE.  
10 According to Art. 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority has raised 
a relevant and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the objection or 
the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.

12 The IE SA letter to the EDPB Secretariat dated 12 May 2022. The submission of the dispute on the IMI occurred 
on 13 May 2022.

Adopted

in Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, since several CSAs raised objections to a draft decision of the LSA within the 
deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, and the LSA has not followed objections or rejected them as 
not relevant or reasoned.  

20. The EDPB further takes note of Meta IE’s position that the current Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution 
should be suspended due to pending preliminary ruling proceedings before the Court of Justice of the 
EU (hereinafter, “CJEU”) in Case C-252/2114. In addition, on 17 May 2022, Meta IE sent a letter to the 
EDPB15, in which Meta IE further asked for stay of proceedings before the EDPB in the procedure at 
issue in light of pending CJEU cases: C-446/2116 and C-252/2117. Following its assessment, the EDPB 
considers that the scope of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB in the present procedure does not 
overlap  with  the  scope  of  the  aforementioned  pending  preliminary  ruling  proceedings,  given  the 
different processing operations at stake. Therefore, the EDPB does not need to evaluate further the 
possibility to stay its proceedings on this Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution pending the determination 
of the preliminary rulings by the CJEU. 

21. Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the EDPB is 
competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of 
the relevant and reasoned objections, i.e. whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether 
the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR18.  

22. The EDPB recalls that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may 
be  called  upon  to  make  in  other  cases,  including  with  the  same  parties,  taking  into  account  the 
contents of the relevant draft decision and the objections raised by the CSAs.  

4  STRUCTURE OF THE BINDING DECISION 

23. For  each  of  the  objections  raised,  the  EDPB  assesses  first  whether  they  are  to  be  considered  as 
“relevant and reasoned” within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR as clarified in the EDPB Guidelines 
on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection19.   

24. Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the 
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this 
specific case20. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the  substantial issues raised by all objections it 
deems to be “relevant and reasoned”.  

                                                           
14 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 30: according to Meta IE, in Case C-252/21 the CJEU has been asked 
“to  address  the  scope  of  the  legal  bases  of  Article  6(1)(b)  and  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR,  and  as  a  result  may  be 
instructive in application to this matter”.

18 Art. 4(24) GDPR and Art. 65(1)(a) GDPR. Some CSAs raised comments and not per se objections, which were, 
therefore, not taken into account by the EDPB.   
19 EDPB Guidelines 9/2020 on the concept of relevant and reasoned objection, version 2 adopted on 9 March 
2021, (hereinafter, “EDPB Guidelines on RRO”). The Guidelines (version 2) were adopted on 9 March 2021, after 
the commencement of the inquiry by the IE SA relating to this particular case.

5  ON LEGAL BASIS FOR CONTACT INFORMATION PROCESSING 

5.1.  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

25. In 2016, a new type of Instagram account was introduced, called a “business account”. Instagram users 
who switched from a “personal account” to a “business account” were shown additional information 
about their profile and followers. Until September 2019, users, including child users, who switched to 
a “business account” were required to display additional public-facing contact details in the form of 
an email address and/or a phone number (hereinafter, “contact information”), which were published 
on the user’s profile21. On 4 September 2019 Meta IE removed the mandatory requirement to publicly 
display the contact information22. 

26. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA considered whether Meta IE could rely alternatively on Articles 6(1)(b) 
and 6(1)(f) GDPR as legal bases for the public disclosure of the contact information of child users of 
Instagram business accounts (hereinafter, “contact information processing”). In particular, the IE SA 
found that the following processing operations by Meta IE were concerned23:  

(1)  Meta IE permitted child users of Instagram to switch from personal accounts to business 

accounts. 

(2)  Until  4  September  2019,  when  switching  to  a  business  account,  child  users  were 
presented  with  an  option  screen  (titled  “Review  Your  Contact  Info”)  as  part  of  the 
switching process. This screen was automatically populated with the user’s information, 
as obtained by Meta IE at the time of user registration, which the user had the opportunity 
to  modify.  In  order  to  complete  the  business  account  switching  process,  the user  was 
required to supply either an email address or a phone number. Users who had private 
Instagram accounts were prompted to switch to a public account as part of the account 
switching process. 

(3)  As of 4 September 2019, when switching to a business account child users were presented 
with  a  revised  option  screen  (still  titled  “Review  Your  Contact  Info”)  automatically 
populated with the user’s information obtained at the time of registration. At this stage, 
users could either modify their contact details or opt not to provide contact information 
by pressing the “Don’t use my contact info” button at the bottom of the page.  

(4)  Where a child user associated an email address and/or phone number with a business 
account (whether as a mandatory requirement of switching prior to September 2019, or 
on  an  optional  basis  after  September  2019),  this  phone  number  and/or  email  address 
were published on the user’s Instagram profile page, in the form of a “contact button”. 

(5)  Email addresses and/or phone numbers made public in the context of Instagram business 

accounts are not encrypted, and are visible as plain text. 

(6)  Email addresses and/or phone numbers made public in the context of Instagram business 

accounts are visible to registered Instagram users on the Instagram mobile application.  

(7)  Additionally,  prior  to  March  2019,  email  addresses  and/or  phone  numbers  associated 
with  Instagram  business  accounts  were  visible  (including  to  persons  not  registered  as

Instagram users) as plain text  in the HTML source code  of the web-browser version of 
Instagram profile pages; and  

(8)  For a period between August 2020 and November 2020, email addresses associated with 
Instagram  business  accounts  were  visible  (including  to  persons  not  registered  as 
Instagram users) as plain text  in the HTML source code  of the web-browser version of 
Instagram profile pages.  

27. The IE SA found that  by  registering for a personal Instagram account,  a data  subject  agreed to the 
Instagram Terms of Use24. Section 1 of the Instagram Terms of Use (titled the “The Instagram Service”) 
listed nine service areas stating25:  

“…[t]he [Instagram] Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):  

Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share. 
People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you 
actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others 
care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences 
that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might 
be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and 
others do on and off Instagram.” 

28. In the light of Meta IE’s submissions, the IE SA found in the Draft Decision that Meta IE relied on Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR for the contact information processing only to the extent that a child user had capacity 
to  enter  into  an  enforceable  contract  under  the  applicable  Member  State  law26.  Meta  IE  relied on 
Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as an alternative legal basis with regard to child users who did not have capacity 
under the applicable Member State law to enter into a contract with Meta IE27.  

29. When assessing Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the contact information processing, the 
IE SA first observed that, as explained above, a data subject agreed to the Instagram Terms of Use, 
when registering for a personal Instagram account and referred to Section 1 of the Instagram Terms 
of  Use28.  The  IE  SA  considered  that  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  does  not  require  the  inclusion  of  express 
contractual provisions pertaining to processing in order to provide a legal basis and it is sufficient that 
processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject29. The Draft Decision 
further stated that “the publication of contact information in the context of business accounts may be 
regarded as necessary processing for the purpose of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”30. The Draft Decision found 
that “the contact information processing could be necessary for the performance of [Meta IE’s] Terms 
of Service with its users” and that no infringement by Meta IE occurred “to the extent that it relied on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data of certain child users”31.  

30. When  assessing  Meta  IE’s  reliance  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the  contact  information  processing 
relating to child users  unable to enter  into an enforceable contract, the IE SA first  noted that “the

processing  meets  the  requirements  of  Article  6(1)(f)  to  the  extent  that  the  interests  pursued  in 
connection  with  the  contact  information  processing  are  legitimate  interests  of  [Meta  IE]  and  other 
Instagram  users,  insofar  that  publication  of  contact  details  to  the  public  may  be  a  reasonable  and 
lawful mode by which to promote a professional undertaking or other public initiative”32. With regard 
to  the  necessity  of  the  contact  information  processing  for  the  purpose  of  the  legitimate  interests 
pursued, the Draft Decision stated that: “such processing may have been, to an extent, a reasonable 
means for Instagram users to publish off-platform contact details in some circumstances. In particular, 
such processing could be regarded as necessary for those business account users who wished to be 
publicly contactable by email or phone in connection with their professional activities”33.  

31. Regarding the balancing test, the IE SA concluded in the Draft Decision that: “in some circumstances, 
where the contact information processing occurred in the context of the well-considered professional 
activities, it is possible that the legitimate interests at issue would not be overridden by the interests or 
fundamental rights and freedoms of the child user”34. The IE SA further concluded that the contact 
information processing could be lawful on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR “in respect of some of the 
child users at issue” and therefore no infringement by Meta IE occurred “to the extent that it relied on 
Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for processing personal data of certain child users”35. 

5.2. 

Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

32. The DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and NO SA raised objections regarding the conclusions by the 
LSA in the Draft Decision that no infringement occurred to the extent Meta IE relied on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR and alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the contact information processing.   

33. The NL SA first considered that reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR required clarity on what  purposes 
were to be regarded in the context of the assessment and a valid contract between the controller and 
the data subject36. The NL SA considered that it is a legal requirement for the IE SA to establish “what 
the  contract  is  and  whether  that  contract  is  suitable  to  serve  as  a  legal  basis  under  Article  6(1)(b) 
GDPR”37. Considering the serious lack of transparency on behalf of the controller established by the IE 
SA in the Draft Decision, the NL SA had a reasonable doubt as to whether data subjects had indeed 
been able to enter into a contract with the Meta IE both willingly and sufficiently informed. Therefore, 
the NL SA questioned whether such valid contract existed between Meta IE and the data subjects in 
the case at hand38.  Second, the NL SA questioned whether the data processing activities in question 
were  actually  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the  contract39.  The  NL  SA  stressed  that  the  Draft 
Decision of the IE SA did not address the question of whether Meta IE made the assessment regarding 
necessity and if any such assessment met the strict necessity standard that reliance on this legal basis 
requires40. According to the NL SA, other evidence in the Draft Decision, in particular referred to in the 
last sentence of paragraph 115 of the Draft Decision, as well as the IE SA’s assessment of  the data

minimisation, indicated that the necessity criterion of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR would actually not be met 
in this case41.  

34. The NL SA stated that the contact information processing also did not fulfil the requirements of Article 
6(1)(f)  GDPR42.  Concerning  the  requirement  of  the  pursued  interest  being  legitimate,  the  NL  SA 
observed that the Draft Decision did not include an assessment on why the interest pursued by Meta 
IE were sufficiently clarified and precise or exactly whose interests were pursued43. The NL SA further 
noted that the IE SA left unassessed if the interests were lawful44 and real and present45. Regarding 
the requirement of necessity of the processing, the NL SA stated that IE SA did not clearly express why 
there was a link between the processing and interests pursued. Rather, the NL SA was of the view that 
the  IE  SA’s  statement  that  the  processing  may  have  been  a  reasonable  means  to  achieve  the 
publication of off-platform contact details was circular reasoning46. In addition, according to the NL 
SA, in the Draft Decision the IE SA did not appropriately consider whether any other means to achieve 
the objectives were available to the controller. In particular, the fact that as from 4 September 2019 it 
was no longer mandatory to publish the contact information of child users indicated that it was likely 
that there were less intrusive means available for the controller to reach its objective47. Furthermore, 
according to the NL SA, by using phrases like “in some circumstances” and “it is possible that” in the 
Draft Decision, the IE SA only addressed those particular situations and possibilities48. Such a wording 
led  to the Draft  Decision not  addressing  questions  relating  to the  necessity of  contact  information 
processing in other situations, such as where child users did not wish to be publicly contactable by 
email or phone in connection to their professional activities49. According to the NL SA, in the context 
of the balancing of interests, the wording of the Draft Decision suggested that only in those situations 
where  the  users  were  well-informed  or  digitally  literate  children  who  used  Instagram  for  well-
considered professional activities, the legitimate interests pursued would not be overridden by the 
interests or fundamental rights of those children. Leading from this, the NL SA suggested that the IE 
SA had acknowledged that in other situations, the interests of the data subjects could override the 
interests of Meta IE. However, such situations were not addressed in the Draft Decision50. The NL SA 
also argued that without analysing and concluding how evident the legitimate interest pursued was 
and  if  Meta  IE’s  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  processing  on  the  data  subjects’  interests  or 
fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  was  appropriate,  the  IE  SA  could  not  have  concluded  that  the 
interests of Meta IE were not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
data subjects51. 

35. Further, the NL SA asked the LSA to take appropriate corrective measures to address the infringement 
and, moreover, the compliance order to the controller, as described in paragraph 627 of the  Draft 
Decision, should include the obligation to remedy the breach of Article 6 GDPR52. Finally, the NL SA 
stated that the Draft Decision, if unchanged, would lower the lawfulness threshold for processing and

undermine  the  protection  of  personal  data  of  individuals  that  enter  into  contracts  that  entail 
processing  of  personal  data;  it  would  also  deprive  data  subjects  of  the  protection  mechanisms 
envisaged in the GDPR and posed the risk that the choice, agency and protection  of data subjects – 
particularly children – is undermined53.  

*** 

36. The DE SAs stated that the prerequisites for relying on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR were not fulfilled in the 
present  case.  First,  based  on  the  information  delivered  by  the  IE  SA,  no  sufficient  proof  of  a  valid 
contract between Meta IE and the child users was provided, although a valid contract is a prerequisite 
for controllers to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as made clear in the EDPB Guidelines 2/201954. The IE SA 
should also have examined or at least obtained an explanation of the validity of the contract on which 
the controller relies55. Moreover, according to the DE SAs, if the controller did not clearly communicate 
in a transparent manner that the publication of the contact information would be based on a contract 
(as observed in Findings 1 and 2 of the Draft Decision), then no contract with this content could come 
into existence for which the particular processing could be based on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR56. Regarding 
necessity, the DE SAs did not agree with the LSA’s analysis in the Draft Decision and stated that Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR can only be used to legitimise data processing that constitutes an essential element of 
the contract57. Accordingly, only the data processing that was actually necessary for the corresponding 
contractual purpose – the operation of an Instagram business account – can be justified on the basis 
of  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR.  In  this  respect,  according  to  the  DE  SAs,  it  was  not  comprehensible,  nor 
explained by Meta IE, why a publication of contact data in plain text or the use of this data for the 
HTML source text should be necessary for the operation of such an account. The DE SAs considered 
that such necessity did not exist in the present case58. 

37. The DE SAs stated that the contact information processing did not fulfil the requirements of Article 
6(1)(f)  GDPR. Firstly, according to the  DE  SAs, the interest pursued by Meta  IE was  not legitimate. 
More precisely, the DE SAs argued that promoting a professional business or other public initiative 
could not be a legitimate interest of Meta IE as the business-holders, being children, could not express 
their legally binding commitment to the terms of use of Instagram. According to the DE SAs, treating 
children as professional undertakings in circumstances where national contract law protects children 
by  requiring  parental  consent  would  undermine  the protection of  children59.  Secondly,  the  DE  SAs 
argued  that  the  processing  did  not  fulfil  the  requirement  of  necessity  in  relation  to  the  pursued 
interest. Here, the DE SAs based its view on the same arguments provided in the context of Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR, as referred in the preceding paragraph. In addition, the DE SAs observed that Meta IE 
later changed its practice to no longer require the publication of the contact information of business 
accounts. Thirdly, the DE SAs stated that the balancing of interests should be based on the protection 
of child users in general rather than the specific technical and economic abilities of each child user.

According to the DE SAs, based on their mental vulnerability, the protection of children should prevail 
over the interests referred by Meta IE60.  

38. Finally, the DE SAs considered that the Draft Decision posed a significant risk for the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of child users of Instagram and other data subjects. In particular, since it would result in 
the data subjects having no control over their personal data, the LSA’s wide understanding of Articles 
6(1)(b)  and  (f)  GDPR  would  generally  render  ineffective  the  protection  afforded  by  the  GDPR  and 
Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and would undermine effective enforcement of the 
GDPR,  which  is  a  precondition  for  guaranteeing  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data 
subjects61. 

*** 

39. The  IT  SA  stated  that  with  respect  to  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  the  assessment  of  whether  a  certain 
processing activity is necessary should be factually based on the purposes of the service being offered 
and the data subject should be made aware of those purposes through the appropriate information. 
In the case at hand, very high level information on the purposes of the processing was available and 
the arrangements to inform users, especially underage users, were all but unambiguous62. According 
to the IT SA, Meta IE failed to demonstrate the necessity of the processing. The subsequent change, 
when the publication became optional, proved that the processing was not necessary. The publication 
of data at large in the HTML page source code in the web-based version of Instagram could hardly be 
regarded as necessary63. The IT SA also observed that Meta IE’s Privacy Policy available in Italy showed 
no reference to the applicable national law, making it accordingly impossible to understand on which 
legal basis it relied to legitimise the processing of data relating to child users for opening and managing 
business accounts64. 

40. The IT SA pointed out that with respect to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR the IE SA drew conclusions only on 
digitally skilful child users. Furthermore, the IT SA stated that the balancing exercise as required under 
Article 6(1)(f) GDPR was flawed65. In this context, the IT SA noted the conflict between Meta IE’s claims 
that the risks which child users were exposed to by the contact information processing were potential 
rather than actual and that  appropriate safeguards had been adopted, and the IE SA’s finding that 
Meta IE had not implemented appropriate security measures and therefore infringed Articles 24 and 
25 GDPR. Moreover, the IT SA observed that Meta IE chose not to carry out a data protection impact 
assessment,  which  indicated  a  flawed  risk  assessment.  According  to  the  IT  SA,  the  inaccurate  risk 
evaluation  undermined  the  balancing  of  interests  and  left  the  arguments  of  the  IE  SA  without 
substance  but  instead  with  inconsistencies66.  Furthermore,  the  IT  SA  stated  that,  where  national 
contract law prevented child users to conclude contracts due to their incapacity to fully understand 
the  consequences  thereof,  it  was  unlikely  that  a  balancing  test  could  result  in  the  interests  of  the 
controller overriding the protection of the rights and freedoms of child users67.

41. Further, the IT SA asked the LSA to amend the Draft Decision “in respect of the action envisaged in 
relation to the controller. In particular, the amount of the administrative fine should be re-calculated 
by having regard to the criteria set out in Article 83(2)  GDPR”68. Finally, the IT SA stated that, if left 
unchanged, the Draft Decision would result in a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data 
subjects, because there would be no effective deterrence for the infringement of data subjects’ rights 
and the approach adopted by the LSA regarding the legal bases would jeopardise the data subjects’ 
rights  in  general,  as  it  may  be  construed  as  an  endorsement  of  the  controller’s  approach  to  the 
processing of child users’ personal data69. 

*** 

42. The  FI  SA  stated  that  in order  to  rely  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  there  needed  to  be  a  valid contract 
between  the  controller  and  the  data  subjects  but  the  Draft  Decision  left  this  issue  unsettled. 
Furthermore, according to the FI SA, the Instagram Terms of Use or the Data Policy were not provided 
in a particularly clear and plain language that would allow a child to sufficiently understand and be 
genuinely informed in order to enter into a contract, also considering the severe issues identified by 
the  Draft  Decision  concerning  the  controller’s  failure  to  meet  the  transparency  requirements70.  In 
addition, the FI SA raised the potential issues of children being considered as a legitimate party of a 
contract in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and considered that, in any case, the assessment on 
whether  the  requirements  of  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  have  been  met  should  be  made  particularly 
thoroughly71.  Regarding  whether  the  processing  was  necessary,  the  FI  SA  considered  that  the 
processing cannot be regarded as necessary for the purpose of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, when it was found 
that the same processing breached the necessity requirement set by Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. Finally, the 
FI SA questioned whether the publication of the contact information could be seen as necessary at all 
given that it was no longer mandatory72. 

43. The FI SA objected to the conclusion in the Draft Decision regarding Article 6(1)(f) GDPR and stated 
that the assessment of the legitimate interest pursued was insufficient. According to the FI SA, the IE 
SA did not adequately assess and reason the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party73. 
Neither did the IE SA assess if such interests were expressed in a sufficiently clear and precise manner. 
The FI SA argued that the IE SA did not substantiate the particular extent to and circumstances under 
which  the  processing  was  necessary  to  protect  the  legitimate  interests  and  expressed  that  certain 
processing operations did not fulfil the necessity requirement74. In addition, the FI SA found that the 
IE SA did not correctly assess the balancing of the legitimate interests and the rights of data subjects. 
For example, according to the FI SA, the IE SA left unclear in which circumstances it was possible that 
the legitimate interests would not be overridden by the interests and rights of the data subjects, in 
particular when they were children and considering the related risks as identified in other parts of the 
Draft  Decision75.  Also,  the  FI  SA  stated  that  as  the  IE  SA  found  infringements  of  the  transparency 
obligations under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 12 GDPR, most likely the data subjects could not upon the

collection  of  their  personal  data  had  reasonably  expected  that their contact  information  would  be 
published76. 

44. Further, the FI SA considered that the conclusions in the Draft Decision led to a considerable risk for 
the  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects,  in  particular,  as  the  publication  of  contact  information 
resulted in risks to child users and the approach regarding legal bases adopted in the present case 
would undermine the level of protection afforded to them, also in other similar situations77. Finally, 
the FI SA requested to take “appropriate corrective measures” to address the infringements78.  

*** 

45. The FR SA noted a contradiction in the Draft Decision insofar as the LSA considered that the display of 
contact information was necessary for the performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
and yet, the LSA found that such display violated the principle of data minimisation. In the FR SA’s 
view,  the  mandatory  display  of contact  information  was  not  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the 
contract, for the reasons set out by the IE SA in paragraphs 221 to 456 of the Draft Decision and the IE 
SA did not fully draw the conclusions from its own analyses and positions79. Also, according to the FR 
SA, the fact that Meta IE itself changed its position on the mandatory nature of the display of contact 
details as of September 2019 proved that it was not essential in the context of business accounts80. 
The FR SA further observed that in the absence of clear information given to the user on the terms of 
contract, the specific contract can hardly be viewed as valid and in this respect the IE SA failed to draw 
conclusions  from  its  own  analysis81.  With  regard  to  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR,  the  FR  SA  observed  the 
contradiction between the IE SA’s findings that, on the one hand, the contact information processing 
may have been necessary for business account holders and, on the other hand, that such processing 
went beyond what was necessary and thereby did not satisfy the data minimisation principle82. The FR 
SA noted that certain risks identified by the IE SA, such as harassment and child grooming, were not 
appropriately taken into account in the balancing test under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. According to the FR 
SA, if such risks had been considered, the rights and freedoms of the child users would have prevailed 
over the interests of the controller83. Moreover, the FR SA stated that the balancing of interest also 
should  have  included  the  finding  of  the  IE  SA  that  Meta  IE  had  not  informed  its  child  users  of the 
contact  information  processing  in  an  appropriate  manner84.  In  the  view  of  the  FR  SA,  such  lack  of 
information deprived the child users of control over their personal data and, therefore, was likely to 
lead to the child users’ interests prevailing over those of the controller85. Finally, the FR SA noted that 
the use of legitimate interest as a basis for processing offered less protection to child users compared 
to  processing  based  on  a  contractual  obligation.  Therefore,  according  to  the  FR  SA,  basing  the 
processing on legitimate interest deprived the child users of protection in the Member States where 
national  contract  law  did  not  allow  the  legal  basis  of  contract  to  be  used  in  such  context86.  As  a 
consequence, the FR SA asked the LSA to observe a breach of Article 6 GDPR, impose an administrative

fine for this additional breach and order Meta IE to comply within three months87. Finally, the FR SA 
stated  that  the  Draft  Decision  posed  risks  to  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  persons 
concerned, as the approach suggested by the LSA regarding the legal bases in the present case would 
significantly reduce the protection that minors should merit regarding their data and expose them to 
an increased risk of harassment and grooming88. In addition, it would create a precedent for other 
organisations and would therefore impact other similar cases89. 

*** 

46. The NO SA first considered that the LSA’s findings and assessment in the Draft Decision logically led to 
the conclusion that the requirement of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR was not met90. 
The NO SA noted that the LSA found that Meta IE carried out processing beyond what was necessary 
for the purposes of the processing and identified considerable risks for child users91. Based on these 
findings,  the  NO  SA  concluded  that  Meta  IE  did  not  fulfil  the  necessity  requirement  under  Article 
6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR and suggested that the LSA should have carried out a corresponding legal analysis 
on the processing in the context of Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR92.  

47. Specifically  concerning  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR,  the  NO  SA  referred  to  the  EDPB  Guidelines  2/201993 
stating  that,  when  processing  is  based  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR,  the  controller  must  assess  what  is 
necessary to fulfil the fundamental and mutually agreed contractual purpose. The NO SA noted that 
the LSA found in its Draft Decision that the processing violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. Therefore, the NO 
SA considered that  the  same  processing  could not  be  necessary  for the fundamental and mutually 
agreed contractual purpose94. The NO SA also considered that since, according to the LSA, the contact 
information processing went beyond what was necessary for the specific purpose of processing under 
Article  5(1)(c)  GDPR,  the  processing  also  must  have  gone  beyond  what  was  necessary  for  the 
performance of the contract95. Specifically concerning Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, the NO SA stated that the 
balancing test could not be fulfilled for child users96. More specifically, the NO SA noted, first, that the 
legitimate interests pursued by Meta IE were not specified in the Draft Decision. Secondly, Meta IE did 
not  demonstrate  that  the  contact  information  processing  was  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  the 
legitimate interests pursued. Thirdly, the NO SA also considered that since, according to the LSA, the 
contact  information  processing  went  beyond  what  was  necessary  for  the  specific  purpose  of 
processing under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, the processing also must have gone beyond what was necessary 
for the legitimate interests pursued97. 

48. Finally, the NO SA asked the LSA to conclude that the legal bases under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR 
were not applicable for the contact information processing and to exercise the following corrective 
powers  under  Article  58(2)  GDPR:  (1)  to  order  the  controller  to  identify  a  valid  legal  basis  for  the 
processing in question, or from now on abstain from such processing activities; and (2) to impose an

administrative fine for unlawfully processing personal data, erroneously relying on Article 6(1)(b) and 
(f) GDPR98. The NO SA further stated that an administrative fine of a substantial amount should be 
imposed to ensure effectiveness and dissuasiveness under Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR for the unlawful 
processing of personal data, considering the nature and gravity of the infringement, as well as the 
number of data subject affected and the damage suffered99. Finally, according to the NO SA, if left 
unchanged in this respect, the Draft Decision would pose significant risks to the protection of data 
subjects’  rights.  In  particular,  the  NO  SA  argued  that  by  allowing  the  processing  of  personal  data 
without a legal basis, the Draft Decision would violate the data subject’s fundamental right to data 
protection and would set a dangerous precedent100. In addition, the NO SA stated that, if a fine is not 
imposed for the infringements, the rights of the data subjects would not be effectively safeguarded, 
thus  creating  an  incentive  for  the  controller  and  other  companies  to  continue  or  engage  in  such 
violations101. 

5.3.  Position of the LSA on the objections 

49. The IE SA confirmed that it does not propose to “follow” the objections that were raised by the CSAs 
and/or does not consider the objections to be relevant and reasoned102. Regarding the objections of 
the DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and NO SA concerning Meta IE’s compliance with Article 6(1)(b) 
and  (f)  GDPR  in  relation  to the  contact  information processing,  the  IE  SA  further  stated  that  these 
objections constituted “relevant and reasoned” objections. However, with respect to “the corrective 
action element” in the FI SA, FR SA, IT SA and NL SA objections, the IE SA considered that it was not 
adequately rationalised and the significance of the risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
was  not  addressed103.  Regarding  the  NO  SA  objection  requiring  to  reassess  the  administrative  fine 
taking  into  account  the  potential  additional  infringement,  the  IE  SA  stated  that  this  objection 
constituted a “relevant and reasoned” objection104. 

5.4.  Analysis of the EDPB 

5.4.1.  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

50. In this section the EDPB assesses whether the objections of the DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and 
NO SA, regarding Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 
for the contact information processing, meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.   

51. The EDPB first takes note of Meta IE’s views that the objections of the DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL 
SA and NO SA regarding Meta IE’s compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR failed to meet the threshold of 
Article 4(24) GDPR. According to Meta IE, all the objections at issue were not relevant and reasoned 
as the LSA’s observations in the Draft Decision were provisional in nature105. Further, Meta IE provided 
reasoning, referring to all the objections, whereby they were not reasoned as the significance of the

risks was not clearly demonstrated by the objections106. The EDPB recalls that Meta IE’s compliance 
with Article 6(1) GDPR in relation to the contact information processing was within the scope of the IE 
SA’s inquiry in the case at hand107 and that in the Draft Decision the IE SA drew conclusions on Meta’s 
IE reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the specific processing 
within  the  scope  of  its  inquiry,  i.e. the  contact  information  processing108.  Thus  there  is  a  clear  link 
between  the  objections  and  the  Draft  Decision109.  The  relevant  conclusions  in  the  Draft  Decision 
assessed the lawfulness of the specific processing by Meta IE and provided for an interpretation of the 
conditions for relying on the legal bases under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR. The EDPB reiterates that 
conclusions on the lawfulness of the personal data processing have significant impact on the effective 
protection  of  the  data  subjects’  rights,  since  the  lawfulness  of  processing  of  personal  data  is  a 
fundamental  pillar  of  the  EU  data  protection  law110.  As  a  consequence,  and  as  further  shown  and 
elaborated  by  the  analysis  of  the  EDPB  below,  the  EDPB  disagrees  with  these  arguments  brought 
forward by Meta IE. 

52. The  EDPB  further  analyses  whether  each  of  the  objections  at  issue  is  a  “relevant  and  reasoned 

objection” as required under Article 4(24) GDPR. 

53. The EDPB considers that the objection of the NL SA concerns “whether there is an infringement of the 
GDPR”, as the NL SA opposed the IE SA’s conclusions that no infringement occurred to the extent Meta 
IE relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the contact information 
processing. If followed, the NL SA’s objection would lead to a different conclusion with regard to the 
findings on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR.  The objection would also entail a change in the compliance 
order to the controller and possibly additional “appropriate corrective measures”111. Therefore, as it 
demonstrated a direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, the objection is “relevant”. 
The  objection  is  also  “reasoned”  since  it  put  forward  several  factual  and  legal  arguments  for  the 
proposed change in the legal assessment as to why the requirements of Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR 
are  not  met  in  the  case  at  hand  and  why  Meta  IE  cannot  lawfully  rely  on  those  provisions  and, 
therefore, the infringement must be remedied112. Accordingly, the EDPB is not persuaded by Meta IE’s 
submissions that the objections are neither relevant nor reasoned113. In addition, the EDPB recalls that 

                                                           
106 In particular, Meta IE stated with respect to all the objections at issue that, “there are no significant risks to 
data subjects because: (i) the Draft Decision relates only to historic processing, given the time period within scope 
is between 25 May 2018 to the date of commencement of this Inquiry on 21 September 2020; (ii) Meta Ireland 
has made significant changes to the manner in which the Instagram Service operates as to both Business Accounts 
and  its  audience  setting  for  Teen  Users;  and  (iii)  in  any  event,  any  Article  6  GDPR  concerns  arising  from  the 
processing of the personal information of Teen Users fall within the scope of the concurrent Legal Bases Inquiry 
and involve issues that will be considered by the CJEU in separate proceedings” (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, 
paragraph 41). Regarding the matter on the pending proceedings before the CJEU, the EDPB refers to section 3.3 
(paragraph 20) of this Binding Decision.

111 See paragraph 35 of this Binding Decision. 
112 See paragraphs 33-35 of this Binding Decision. The NL SA argued, inter alia, that the necessity requirement 
under Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and the three cumulative requirements under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR were not met. 
113 Meta IE argues that “the objections are not relevant as they are grounded on the incorrect premise that they 
relate to a conclusive finding from the Draft Decision on Article 6 GDPR” (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 
A, p. 33 and 35). It also considers that they are not reasoned since “the NL SA’s objection ignores the [IE SA’s] 
preliminary assessment of Teen Users’ interests in maintaining contact information buttons in Business Accounts” 
(Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, p. 35). In this respect, see also paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision.

the assessment of the merits of the objection is made separately, after it has been established that 
the objection satisfies the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR114. 

54. Concerning  the  requirement  to  demonstrate  the  significance  of  the  risks  posed  for  the  rights  and 
freedoms of data subjects, contrary to Meta IE’s views115, the EDPB finds that the objection raised by 
the NL SA meets the required standard by pointing out several consequences that the Draft Decision 
would have for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects116.  

55. Finally,  contrary  to  the  views  of  the  LSA,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  qualification  of  the  NL  SA’s 
objection as relevant and reasoned also applies to the part thereof related to the compliance order 
and other “appropriate corrective measures”. In this respect, the EDPB underlines that the arguments 
put forward by the NL SA, as addressed in the paragraphs 33-34 above, clearly demonstrated why the 
Draft Decision should be changed in order to include an infringement regarding the lack of legal basis 
for  the  contact  information  processing  and  the  consequent  need  to  ensure  that  such  processing 
complies  with  the  GDPR,  by  amending  the  compliance  order  to  the  controller  and  adopting  the 
appropriate corrective measures. Likewise, the NL SA’s objection clearly set out the significance of the 
risks for the data subjects if the Draft Decision remained unchanged and the infringement was not 
remedied. 

*** 

56. In their objection, the DE SA disagreed with the finding of the IE SA that there was no infringement to 
the  extent  Meta  IE  relied  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  and  alternatively  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the 
contact information processing, thus also concerning “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR” 
within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR. As it demonstrated a direct connection with the substance 
of  the  Draft  Decision  and that,  if  followed,  the objection would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion,  the 
objection is “relevant”. The objection is also “reasoned” since it put forward several factual and legal 
arguments  for the  proposed  change  in the  legal assessment  as  to why  the  requirements of  Article 
6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR are not met in the case at hand117. Accordingly, the EDPB is not swayed by Meta 
IE’s submission that the objections are neither relevant nor reasoned118.  

                                                           
114 See EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a), paragraph 63. 
115 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, p. 34 and 36. See paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision.  
116 For example, the NL SA argued that, if the Draft Decision is kept unchanged and therefore the controller is 
allowed to rely on Article 6(1)(b) or (f) GDPR for the processing at stake, it would lower the lawfulness threshold 
for processing and would deprive data  subjects of the protection mechanisms envisaged in the GDPR (NL SA 
objection, paragraphs 22 and 44-47). The NL SA also considered that the Draft Decision does  not address the 
risks for the data subjects, but rather allows them to continue (NL SA objection, paragraph 45).  
117 Regarding Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, the DE SAs argued that the IE SA’s assessment of the validity and necessity of the 
contract between Meta IE and child users is incorrect, and provided for an alternative reasoning (see paragraph 
36 of this Binding Decision). With regard to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, the DE SAs considered that the three cumulative 
conditions are not met (see paragraph 37 of this Binding Decision). 
118 Meta IE argued that the objections are not relevant since the IE SA did not make a formal finding in the Draft 
Decision regarding Article 6 GDPR, but rather made preliminary observations (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, 
paragraphs 26-27). In this respect, see paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision. It also considered that the DE SAs 
objection on the element of “necessity” was not reasoned since it is “contrary to CJEU case law and applicable 
guidance (including from the EDPB), apply the wrong legal standard” (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 38 and 
40). The EDPB recalls that the merits of the objection are dealt with separately from the assessment of whether 
the objection fulfils the requirements under Art. 4(24) GDPR.

57. The EDPB also considers that the DE SA demonstrated the significance of the risk for the fundamental 

rights and freedoms of data subjects119.  

*** 

58. Similarly, the objection of the IT SA also concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”. In 
the  IT  SA’s  view,  the  contact  information  processing  cannot  “be  regarded  as  necessary  for  [the] 
operation of the service”120, hence resulting in the “unlawfulness of the processing based on Article 
6(1)(b) [GDPR]”121 and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR122. As the objection demonstrated a direct connection with 
the substance of the Draft Decision and, if followed, it would  lead to a different  conclusion123,  the 
objection is “relevant”.  

59. As the IT SA presented arguments on the factual and legal mistakes in the Draft Decision regarding the 
analysis on Article 6(1)(b) and (f)  GDPR124, the objection is “reasoned”  inasmuch as it concerns the 
additional infringement related to the lack of legal basis for the contact information processing.   

60. The EDPB is not swayed by Meta IE’s submissions to the contrary125, as the IT SA explained how its 
objection, if followed, would result in a different conclusion and put forward several factual and legal 
arguments for the proposed change in the legal assessment.  

61.  Finally, the EDPB finds that the objection of the IT SA clearly demonstrated the significance of the risks 
that  the  Draft  Decision  presented  to the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of the  data  subjects  by 
laying out how there would be no proportionate and dissuasive measures regarding the infringements 
and how the Draft Decision may be construed as an endorsement of the controller’s approach to the 
processing of children’s personal data, thus jeopardising their rights126.  

62.  With regard to the relevant parts of the IT SA’s objection related to the imposition of an administrative 
fine  for the possible additional infringement  related to Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR, it concerns “whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR”. 

                                                           
119 The DE SAs argued, inter alia, that the IE SA’s wide understanding of Art. 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR would allow for 
the processing of personal data without an actual legal basis, thereby rendering the protection afforded by the 
GDPR ineffective (DE SAs objection, p. 9).  
120 IT SA objection, p. 1. 
121 IT SA objection, p. 2. 
122 IT SA objection, p. 4. 
123 The IT SA requested a change in the Draft Decision regarding the infringement on the legal basis for the contact 
information  processing  and  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  as  a  consequence  of  this  additional 
infringement. 
124 For example, the IT SA considered that the processing was not necessary for the performance of a contract 
(see paragraph 39 of this Binding Decision) and that the balancing test under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR tipped the balance 
in favour of the data subject (see paragraph 40 of this Binding Decision). 
125 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, p. 49-52. Regarding Meta IE’s arguments on the lack of conclusive 
findings in the Draft Decision, the EDPB refers to paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision. Meta IE also argued, inter 
alia, that the IT SAs’ objection on the element of “necessity” regarding Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was not reasoned 
since “it is contrary to CJEU case law and applicable guidance (including from the EDPB), by applying the wrong 
legal standard” (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 50). Regarding Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, Meta IE argued that the 
IT SA did not  link the objection with a  specific infringement  and omits relevant  elements of the file (Meta IE 
Article 65 Submissions, p. 51-52).  The EDPB disagrees with these arguments, since the IT SA provided sufficient 
factual and legal elements supporting the objection and reached logical conclusions. The EDPB recalls that the 
merits  of  the  objection  are  dealt  with  separately  from  the  assessment  of  whether  the  objection  fulfils  the 
requirements under Article 4(24) GDPR. 
126 IT SA objection, p. 2 et seq. The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s submissions in this regard (Meta IE Article 65 
Submissions, p. 50 and 52). Nevertheless, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE (see paragraph 51 above).

The objection is linked to the IT SA’s objection on the findings in the Draft Decision on Article 6(1)(b) 
and (f) GDPR for the contact information processing. There is a direct connection with the substance 
of the Draft Decision and, if followed, the objection would lead to a different conclusion. Thus, it is 
“relevant”. However, the EDPB considers that the objection did not sufficiently elaborate the legal or 
factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision in this regard to specifically increase 
the  level  of  the  fine.  Likewise,  the  significance  of  the  risks  for  the  data  subjects  related  to  the 
imposition of an administrative fine is not sufficiently explained. Therefore, the IT SA’s objection with 
regard  to  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the  possible  additional  infringement  is  not 
“reasoned”.   

63. The EDPB therefore considers that the objection of the IT SA, inasmuch as it concerns the additional 
infringement related to the lack of legal basis for the contact information processing, is both “relevant” 
and  “reasoned”  and  meets  the  threshold  set  by  Article  4(24)  GDPR.  While,  insofar  it  concerns  the 
imposition of the administrative fine for the possible additional infringement, the objection of the IT 
SA is not “reasoned” and thus does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

 

*** 

64. In its objection, the FI SA disputed the IE SA’s finding that the contact information processing met the 
requirements of Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR. Therefore, the FI SA’s objection concerns “whether there 
is  an  infringement  of  the  GDPR”.  The  objection  of  the  FI  SA  would  also  possibly  entail  additional 
“appropriate  corrective measures”127.    As the objection demonstrated a direct  connection with the 
substance of the Draft Decision and, if followed, it would lead to a different conclusion, the objection 
is “relevant”. For the same reasons explained above with regard to the other objections in this section, 
the EDPB is not swayed by Meta IE’s arguments regarding the lack of relevance of this objection128. In 
addition, the EDPB considers the objection “reasoned” since the FI SA put forward legal and factual 
arguments explaining why the requirements of Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR are not met in the case at 
hand,  and  explained  why  the  IE  SA  did  not  assess  the  application  of  Article  6  GDPR  properly  and, 
therefore, the infringement must be remedied129.  

65. Having  considered  Meta  IE’s  submissions  arguing  that  the  objection  of  the  FI  SA  “relies  on  vague 
assertions”130, the EDPB finds that the objection of the FI SA conclusively demonstrates the significance 

                                                           
127 See paragraph 44 above. The FI SA requested a change in the Draft Decision regarding the infringement on 
the legal basis for the contact information processing, and the adoption of “appropriate corrective measures” 
as a consequence of this additional infringement. 
128 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, pp. 53-55. Meta IE argued that the objection is not relevant since 
the IE SA did not make a formal finding in the Draft Decision regarding Art. 6 GDPR, but rather made preliminary 
observations. In this respect, see paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision. 
129 See paragraphs 42-43 of this Binding Decision. The FI SA argued, inter alia, that the assessment on the validity 
and necessity of the contract is insufficient and that the three cumulative conditions under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR are 
not met. In this respect, Meta IE argued, inter alia, that the FI SA merely concurs without the NL SA’s objection 
without providing sufficient details regarding Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 53). Regarding 
Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, Meta IE argued that the objection’s conclusion on the infringement  was divorced from the 
rationale it set forth (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 55). The EDPB disagrees with both claims, since the FI SA 
provided  sufficient  factual  and  legal  elements  supporting  the  objection  and  reached  logical  conclusions.  The 
EDPB  recalls  that  the  merits  of  the  objection  are  dealt  with  separately  from  the  assessment  of  whether  the 
objection fulfils the requirements under Art. 4(24) GDPR.

of  the  risks  that  the  Draft  Decision  poses  to  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data 
subjects131.  

66. Finally, contrary to the views of the LSA, the EDPB considers that the qualification of the FI SA objection 
as relevant and reasoned also applies to the part thereof related to the additional corrective measures. 
In this respect, the EDPB underlines that the arguments put forward by the FI SA, as addressed in the 
paragraphs 42-43 above, clearly demonstrate why the Draft Decision should be changed in order to 
include an infringement regarding the lack of legal basis for the contact information processing and 
the  consequent  need  to  ensure  that  such  processing  complies  with  the  GDPR,  by  adopting  the 
“appropriate corrective measures”. Likewise, the FI SA objection clearly set out the significance of the 
risks for the data subjects if the Draft Decision remained  unchanged and the infringement was not 
remedied. 

*** 

67. As  laid  down  in  its  objection,  the  FR  SA  disagreed  with  the  IE  SA’s  conclusions  that  the  contact 
information processing could be based on Article 6(1)(b)GDPR and alternatively on 6(1)(f) GDPR and 
considered  that  the  IE  SA  erred  in  its  legal  assessment  as  it  should  have  reached  a  different 
conclusion132.  Hence, the objection of the FR SA also concerns “whether there is an infringement of 
the GDPR” and, if followed, it would lead to a different conclusion with regard to the findings on Article 
6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR and the corrective measures to the controller133. As the objection demonstrated 
a direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, it is “relevant”. For the same reasons 
explained above with regard to the other objections in this section, the EDPB is not swayed by Meta 
IE’s arguments regarding the lack of relevance of this objection134.  

68. The EDPB also considers that, inasmuch as the objection concerns the additional infringement related 
to the lack  of  legal basis for the  contact information processing  and the change  in the compliance 
order, the objection is “reasoned”, since the FR SA clearly set out a disagreement as to the conclusions 
reached by the IE SA in the Draft Decision by highlighting contradictions in the IE SA’s own analyses 
and put forward several factual and legal arguments for the proposed change in the legal assessment, 
including why the controller could not lawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR in this case and, 
therefore, the infringement must be remedied135. Therefore, the EDPB is not convinced by Meta IE’s 

                                                           
131 The FI SA explained, inter alia, that the Draft Decision would lead to an insufficient protection of the interests 
of children, thereby setting a dangerous precedent (FI SA objection, paragraph 8). The FI SA also considered that 
the lack of legal basis poses a high risk for data subjects, considering the risks identified in the Draft Decision 
itself (FI SA objection, paragraphs 8 and 18).  
132 FR SA, objection p. 3. 
133 The  FR  SA requested a  change in the Draft Decision regarding the infringement  on the legal  basis  for the 
contact information processing, and a change in the compliance order and the imposition of an administrative 
fine as a consequence of this additional infringement. 
134 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, pp. 56 and 58. Meta IE argued that the objection is not relevant since 
the IE SA did not make a formal finding in the Draft Decision regarding Art. 6 GDPR, but rather made preliminary 
observations. In this respect, see paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision. 
135 See paragraph 45 of this Binding Decision. The FR SA considered, inter alia, that the IE SA’s conclusions on the 
necessity of the processing under Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR are contradictory with the findings on the infringement of 
the data minimisation principle. The FR SA also argued that the balancing exercise is contradictory with the IE 
SA’s findings on the serious risks for child users.  

Adopted

argument that the FR SA “merely raise[s] abstract and broad (and irrelevant) concerns” and that  it 
“fails to link them to a conclusion as to infringement”136.  

69. The EDPB finds that the objection of the FR SA sufficiently substantiated the risks to the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of the data subjects  since it clearly explained the consequences that the Draft 
Decision would have for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects137.  

70. With regard to the relevant parts of the FR SA’s objection related to the imposition of an administrative 
fine  for the possible additional infringement  related to Meta IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR,  it  concerns  whether  the  envisaged  action  in  relation  to  the  controller  complies  with  the 
GDPR138. The objection is linked to the FR SA’s objection on the findings on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR 
for the contact information processing. Given that it concerns the imposition of a corrective measure 
for an additional infringement, which would be found as a consequence of reversing the findings of 
the  Draft  Decision,  there  is  a  direct  connection  with  the  substance  of  the  Draft  Decision  and,  if 
followed, the objection would lead to a different conclusion. Thus, it is to be deemed as “relevant”, as 
stated in paragraph 67 above. However, the EDPB considers that the objection does not sufficiently 
elaborate the legal or factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision with regard 
to the imposition of this specific corrective measure. Therefore, the FR SA’s objection is not “reasoned” 
with regard to the imposition of an administrative fine for the possible additional infringement related 
to the legal basis for the contact information processing. 

71. The EDPB therefore considers that the objection of the FR SA, inasmuch as it concerns the additional 
infringement related to the lack of legal basis for the contact information processing, is both “relevant” 
and  “reasoned”  and  meets  the  threshold  set  by  Article  4(24)  GDPR.  While,  insofar  it  concerns  the 
imposition of the administrative fine for the possible additional infringement, the objection of the FR 
SA is not “reasoned” and thus does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

 

*** 

72. The objection of the NO SA expressed disagreement with respect to the IE SA’s assessment in the Draft 
Decision on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR. If followed, the NO SA’s objection would lead to a different 
conclusion with regard to the findings on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR and would also have an impact 
on the compliance order to the controller. Therefore, as it demonstrated a direct connection with the 
substance of the Draft Decision, the objection is therefore “relevant”. For the same reasons explained 
above  The  EDPB  is  not  swayed  by  Meta  IE’s  arguments  regarding  the  lack  of  relevance  of  this 

                                                           
136 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A,  p. 56. See also Meta IE Article 65 Submission, Annex A, p. 59 in 
relation to the FR SA’s objection regarding Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Regarding Meta IE’s views that the objection of the 
FR SA is legally flawed (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 57 and 59), the EDPB recalls that the merits of the 
objection are dealt with separately from the assessment of whether the objection fulfils the requirements under 
Art. 4(24) GDPR. 
137 The FR SA argued that, by allowing reliance on Art. 6(1)(b) or (f), the Draft Decision would expose minors to 
an increase risk of harassment and grooming and thus would not protect them effectively. In addition, it would 
create a precedent for other organisations (FR SA objection, paragraphs 23-26). The EDPB takes note of Meta 
IE’s submissions in this regard (Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 57 and 59). Nevertheless, the EDPB disagrees 
with Meta IE and considers that the FR SA clearly and explicitly identified the significance of the risks. The EDPB 
further refers to paragraph 51 above.  
138 Art. 4(24) GDPR.

objection139. The objection is also “reasoned” since it put forward several factual and legal arguments 
for the proposed change in the legal assessment as to why the requirements of Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR are not met in the case at hand and why the controller cannot lawfully rely on those provisions 
and, therefore, the infringement must be remedied140.  

73. Regarding the requirement to demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision to 
the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the EDPB finds that the objection of the NO SA meets the 
criteria set forth by Article 4(24) GDPR141. Therefore, the EDPB is not swayed by Meta IE’s submissions 
to the contrary142. 

74. With  regard  to  the  NO  SA’s  objection  on  the  administrative  fine  to  be  imposed  for  the  additional 
infringements  regarding  the  lack  of  legal  basis  of  the  contact  information  processing,  the  EDPB 
considers that it concerned “whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with 
the GDPR”143. The objection is linked to the NO SA’s objection on the findings on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR for the contact information processing.  Given that it concerns the imposition of a corrective 
measure  for  an  additional  infringement,  which  would  be  found  as  a  consequence  of  reversing  the 
conclusions in the Draft Decision, there is a direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision 
and, if followed, the objection would lead to a different conclusion. Thus, it is “relevant”. The EDPB is 
not swayed by Meta IE’s arguments regarding the lack of relevance of this objection144, including with 
regard to the imposition of an administrative fine for the proposed findings on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR.  The  EDPB  also  finds  the  objection  “reasoned”  since  it  put  forward  several  factual  and  legal 
arguments  that  support  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the  alleged  infringement145. 
Regarding the significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision to the rights and freedoms of data 
subjects, the objection sufficiently demonstrated what would be the negative impact for data subjects 
should a fine for the infringement of the GDPR concerning the lack of legal basis not be imposed146. 

                                                           
139 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex A, p. 45 and 47. Meta IE argued that the objection is not relevant since 
the IE SA did not make a formal finding in the Draft Decision regarding Art. 6 GDPR, but rather made preliminary 
observations. In this respect, see paragraph 51 of this Binding Decision. 
140  See  paragraphs  46-48  of  this  Binding  Decision.  The  NO  SA  argued,  inter  alia,  that  the  processing  was  not 
necessary under Art. 6(1)(b) nor (f) GDPR and that the balancing test tipped the balance in favour of the data 
subject. The EDPB is therefore not swayed by Meta IE’s arguments that the objection is based on fundamental 
errors, is contrary to the principle of legal certainty and does not articulate any error regarding the IE SA’s analysis 
(Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 46 and 47). The EDPB recalls that the merits of the objection are dealt with 
separately from the assessment of whether the objection fulfils the requirements under Art. 4(24) GDPR. 
141 The NO SA argued that, by allowing the processing of personal data without a legal basis, the Draft Decision 
would violate the data subject’s fundamental right to data protection and would set a dangerous precedent (NO 
SA objection, p. 6-7). Thus, the EDPB considers that the NO SA’s objection clearly set out the significance of the 
risks for the data subjects if the Draft Decision remained unchanged and the infringement was not addressed in 
the compliance order.  
142 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 44 and Annex A, p. 46 and 47. In this respect, the EDPB refers to 
paragraph 51 above. 
143 Art. 4(24) GDPR. 
144 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, para. 44 and Annex A, p. 48. Meta IE argued that the objection arose from 
non-final observations of the IE SA and, therefore, it was not relevant. In this respect, see paragraph 51 of this 
Binding Decision 
145 NO SA objection p. 8-9 
146 The NO SA argued that, if a fine was not imposed, the Draft Decision would create a dangerous precedent, 
since there would not be sufficient incentives for Meta IE and other controllers to change their behaviour, thus 
leading to a reoccurrence of such infringements. This would affect the data subjects, as in practice the level of 
protection set out by the GDPR would be denied (NO SA objection, p. 9).  

Adopted

Therefore, the EDPB finds that the objection of the NO SA meets the criteria set forth by Article 4(24) 
GDPR. 

*** 

75. On the basis of the above considerations, the EDPB finds that the objections raised by the NL SA, DE 
SAs, IT SA, FI SA, FR SA and NO SA concerning the conclusions in the Draft Decision on Articles 6(1)(b) 
and  6(1)(f)  GDPR  regarding  the  contact  information  processing  qualify  as  relevant  and  reasoned 
objections under Article 4(24) GDPR, including with respect to the changes in the compliance order 
requested in the objections of the FR SA, NL SA and NO SA and the additional appropriate corrective 
measures requested by the FI SA and NL SA.  

76. The EDPB also finds that the NO SA objection regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for the 
findings  on Article 6(1)(b) and (f)  GDPR  is relevant and reasoned  under  Article 4(24) GDPR. On the 
contrary, with  regard to  the  relevant  parts of the  objections of the  FR  SA  and  IT  SA  regarding the 
imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the  possible  additional  infringement  related  to  Meta  IE’s 
reliance on Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR, the EDPB considers that they are not sufficiently reasoned 
and, therefore, do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.  

5.4.2.  Assessment on the merits 

77. The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection147 require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  needs  to  be  changed  in  respect  of  the  finding  on 
compliance  with  Article  6(1)  GDPR.  The  merits  of  the  objection  of  the  NO  SA,  with  regard  to  the 
imposition of an administrative fine for the proposed additional infringement, are assessed in section 
7.4 of this Binding Decision. 

78. When assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB takes into account the position of the IE 

SA on the objections and the submissions of Meta IE. 

79. The EDPB takes note that for the contact information processing Meta IE relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
(but  only  to  the  extent  that  a  child  user  has  capacity  to  enter  into  an  enforceable  contract)  or 
alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (with regard to child users who did not have capacity to enter into 
a contract with Meta IE)148.  

5.4.2.1 Regarding Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 

80. The EDPB recalls that personal data can be processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR when: (1) 
the processing takes place in the context of the performance of a contract with the data subject and 
(2) that processing is necessary for the performance of that particular contract with the data subject149. 

                                                           
147 These objections being those of the DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and NO SA on Meta IE’s reliance on legal 
bases under Art. 6(1)(b) and 6(1)(f) GDPR for the contact information processing.  
148 Draft Decision, paragraphs 105 and 108. Also, see Meta IE Response to Request for Information, Appendix 6 
to Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 17-19, where Meta IE explained that it relied on two primary legal 
bases for the purposes of providing, personalising and improving the Facebook products (including Instagram), 
which included provision of the Instagram Business Account and the display of a contact option in connection 
with an Instagram Business Account, those legal bases being Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR or alternatively Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 
149 Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

81. With respect to the existence of a contract, the EDPB takes note of the objections raised by the DE 
SAs150 and FI SA151, as well as the IT SA152 and FR SA153, which questioned the failure by the IE SA to 
assess and conclude on the existence of a valid contract between Meta IE and the child users insofar 
as it concerns the contact information processing. The NL SA argued that, first, the LSA did not assess 
adequately in the Draft Decision if a contract was in place between Meta IE and the data subjects for 
the  provision  of  the  Instagram  business  account  and,  second,  the  NL  SA  raised  doubts  about  the 
validity of such contract154. 

82. In the Draft Decision, the IE SA found that, when registering for a personal Instagram account, a data 
subject  agreed to the  Instagram Terms of Use155. The IE SA further found, in the light  of  Meta  IE’s 
submissions, that the performance of a contract legal basis could be invoked by Meta IE in relation to 
processing associated with the business account feature on the basis of the Terms of Use156. 

83. In its submissions, Meta IE argued that SAs do not have competence to assess validity of contracts157 
and anyway the Draft Decision clearly referred to a contractual relationship between Meta IE and each 
user based on the Terms of Use158. Meta IE also claimed that it had no legal obligation under the GDPR 
to include a specific reference to Business Accounts in the Instagram Terms of Use and thus the lack 
of such reference has no impact on the assessment of whether the processing is necessary for the 
performance of a contract159 and is not contrary to Article 12 GDPR160.  

84. As recalled above, one of the prerequisites for a controller to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as 
a legal basis for the processing of personal data is that the processing takes places in the context of 
the  performance  of  a  contract.  As  previously  stated  by  the  EDPB,  this  condition  more  specifically 
implies that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR, has to be 
able  to  demonstrate  that  (a)  a  contract  exists  and  (b)  the  contract  is  valid  pursuant  to  applicable 
national contract laws161. 

85. In  order  to  assess  whether  Meta  IE  could  have  relied  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  for  the  contact 
information processing, the EDPB analyses in the following paragraphs whether the processing at stake 
is necessary for the performance of the alleged contract with the data subjects in the case at hand.  

86. In  its  submissions,  Meta  IE  claimed  that  insofar  as  “necessity”  is  concerned,  the  CSAs  ignored  the 
relevant facts and considerations during the period when Business Accounts were first offered and 
erred in: (1) applying an overly strict view of the element of necessity for the purposes of Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR, and (2) improperly seeking to retroactively find a violation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR by virtue of 
a  subsequent  product  modification,  which  has  dangerous  implications  for  controllers  seeking  to 
develop and evolve their products over time in respect of user privacy and safety162. According to Meta

IE, “the Business Account was created for Instagram in 2016 and, as relevant for the time, it was built 
around the notion of a “traditional” business, which may have used Instagram to support its external 
(i.e.,  off-Instagram)  presence,  like  a  website  or  brick-and-mortar  establishment.  To  enable  the  off-
Instagram promotion of and contact with the business, the Business Account functionality included a 
“Contact”  button  to  allow  the  Instagram  community  to  communicate  with  the  business  through  a 
contact channel outside of Instagram (e.g., a business phone or email)” and “the EDPB must assess the 
element of necessity under the correct conceptual framework having regard to the specific purpose of 
the processing at issue at the time, in line with its prior guidance”163. In addition, according to Meta IE, 
compliance with Articles 5(1)(c) and 6(1)(b) GDPR must be considered separately, the LSA’s finding on 
Article  5(1)(c)  GDPR  was  narrow  in  scope,  and,  moreover,  Articles  5(1)(c)  and  6(1)(b)  GDPR  have 
distinct and separate meanings, thus a finding of non-compliance with Article 5(1)(c) GDPR does not 
and cannot equate automatically to a finding of non-compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR164. 

87. The EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has an independent meaning in Union law, which must 
reflect the objectives of data protection law165. In particular, as the CJEU has stated: “[a]s regards the 
condition  relating  to  the  necessity  of  processing  personal  data,  it  should  be  borne  in  mind  that 
derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as 
is strictly necessary”166. 

88. When  analysing  the  performance  of  a  contract  legal  basis,  the  necessity  requirement  has  to  be 
interpreted strictly. As stated earlier by the Working Party 29 (hereinafter “WP29”)167, this “provision 
must  be  interpreted  strictly  and  does  not  cover  situations  where  the  processing  is  not  genuinely 
necessary for the performance of a contract, but rather unilaterally imposed on the data subject by the 
controller”168.  

89. The EDPB recalls that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “[i]t is important to 
determine  the  exact  rationale  of  the  contract,  i.e.  its  substance  and  fundamental  objective,  as  it  is 
against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance”169. As 
the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of 
the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively 
necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject170.

paragraph 30. 
167 The Working Party 29 - a predecessor of the EDPB - was established under Article 29 of the Directive 95/46/EC 
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard 
to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter, “Directive 95/46/EC”) 
and had a role, inter alia, to contribute to uniform application of national measures adopted under the Directive. 
Many of substantive principles and provisions of the GDPR already existed in the Directive 95/46/EC, thus WP29 
guidance in this respect is relevant for the interpretation of the GDPR.

90. Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing 
by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only 
on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into 
the contract171. In this context, the EDPB recalls that children merit specific protection with regard to 
their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned 
and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data172. 

91. Regarding the objective and purpose of the specific contract, Meta IE claimed that, when the Business 
Account was created, it was built around the notion of a “traditional” business and was aimed to allow 
the Instagram community to communicate  with the business  through a contact  channel outside of 
Instagram173. The IE SA found that “the business account feature, on the basis that this social media 
tool allows users to ‘create, find, join, and share in experiences’ with other people (as described in the 
Terms of Use), and forms a central part of the Instagram service as offered”174.  

92. While the EDPB agrees that processing may be objectively necessary for the performance of a contract 
even  if  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  contract175,  it  should  be  possible  for  an  ordinary  user  to 
identify the “fundamental and mutually understood” contractual purpose based on the information 
presented by the controller176.  

93. Considering the high-level information provided to child users regarding the Instagram service in the 
Terms of Use177 and that no specific information about the Business Account feature was provided to 
the child users178, the EDPB considers that the publication of the contact details on their profiles could 
have  not  been  reasonably  expected  by  such  child  users  in  the  context  of  their  use  of  Instagram, 
including the business account feature. Further, the EDPB does not agree that the contact information 
processing, in respect of the child users, could be considered as “integral” or “central” to the Instagram 
service, including the business account feature. Moreover, as correctly noted by the IE SA, it is possible 
to operate a professional profile without also publishing contact information179.  

94. Furthermore,  the  EDPB recalls that the assessment of what is  necessary  involves a combined, fact-
based  assessment  of  the  processing  for  the  objective  pursued.  If  there  are  realistic,  less  intrusive 
alternatives, the processing is not necessary180. In this respect, the principle of proportionality should 
also be taken into account181.  

95. The EDPB observes that, if the publication of the contact details was indeed intended for traditional 
businesses only as Meta IE claims, it was technically possible to distinguish them from the child users

during the registration process based on age information182. It would have therefore been possible to 
avoid publishing child users’ contact information, even while maintaining the contact button option 
for “traditional” businesses. 

96. The EDPB further considers that in the present case the analysis of necessity should be supported by 
the above-mentioned  analysis of the existence of less intrusive means. However, the IE SA did not 
analyse in the Draft Decision whether other less intrusive means were available to effectively achieve 
the objective pursued. In this regard, the existing possibility to contact users directly through direct 
messaging within the platform should have been taken into consideration. In fact, it is clear from the 
Draft Decision that Meta IE was aware that certain business account users preferred to communicate 
with their audience through direct messaging on Instagram, rather than by e-mail or phone183. The 
Draft Decision clearly stated that “[Meta IE] acknowledges that publication of phone and email contact 
information  was  not  always  preferred  from  the  perspective  of  business  account  users”  because, 
according to Meta IE “[s]ome businesses also noted that they preferred [...] to communicate with their 
audience  or  customers  through  direct  messaging  on  Instagram  rather  than  traditional  means  (like 
phone  or  email)”184.  Despite  this,  the  IE  SA  failed  to  take  account  of  such  circumstances  in  its 
assessment of the  necessity  requirements  and erred  in  its  conclusion  that  the  contact  information 
processing was necessary for the performance of the contract in the present case.   

97. The  EDPB  recalls  that  within  the  “contact  information  processing”  there  was  also  a  processing 
operation (occurring for a specific timeframe) consisting in the publication in plain text of the contact 
information in the HTML source code on the Instagram website. Meta IE highlighted that “business 
contact  information  appeared  in  the  HTML  source  code  for  Business  Accounts  for  the  purpose  of 
providing a “Contact” button on the Web version of Instagram" since "in order for a web browser to 
render the relevant Instagram Web page, the browser must ‘speak’ to an Instagram Web server”185. 
The  IE  SA  found  an  infringement  (not  disputed  by  the  objections  raised)  of  the  principle  of  data 
minimisation limited to this “mandatory publication (prior to 7 March 2019) of contact information on 
the website version of Instagram (in HTML) for all business account users”, since this “had the result 
that the personal data at issue (i.e. contact information of child users on webpages) was not limited to 
what  was  necessary  in  relation  to  the  purposes  for  which  [Meta  IE]  processed  this  specific 
information”186.  As  noted  by  the  IE  SA,  the  HTML  publication  of  contact  information  was  not 
considered necessary by Facebook’s Security Team and was subsequently discontinued187. The EDPB 
considers that the analysis of the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) is relevant for

in  March  2019,  a  representative  with  the  Facebook  Security  Team  informed  Mr  Stier  ‘After  discussing  this 
functionality with the Instagram team we did take steps to remove the contact information from the HTML of the 
page, since it was not necessary to include in its current form’. As such, [Meta IE]’s submission that this HTML 
processing was necessary is directly contradicted by the actions and words of the Facebook Security Team. FB-I 
states that this processing was necessary to provide business accounts to child users, who would otherwise be 
impeded in  promoting their professional activities on Instagram; whereas the Facebook  Security Team  stated 
expressly that this processing was not necessary, and stopped this practice immediately when it was brought to 
its attention.”

the necessity assessment on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR188. Consequently, the EDPB further finds 
that such analysis should have complemented the LSA’s assessment on the necessity of the processing 
for the performance of the contract, with specific regard to the publication of the contact information 
in the HTML source code on the Instagram website. The EDPB considers that the IE SA could not have 
concluded that the publication of the contact information of child users in the HTML source code may 
be regarded as necessary for the performance of the contract between Meta IE and child users.  

98. Also, the EDPB takes note of the findings in the Draft Decision that the contact information processing 
could pose severe risks to the rights and freedoms of child users189. The existence of such risks could 
have also been considered in the assessment as to whether the processing of the child users’ contact 
information was necessary for the contract.  

99. Considering the above190 and in light of the specific circumstances of the processing, the EDPB finds 
that  the  IE  SA  could  not  have  concluded  in  paragraph  115  of  the  Draft  Decision  that  the  contact 
information  processing  may  be  regarded  as  necessary  for  the  performance  of  a  contract  between 
Meta IE and child users.  

100. 

As a consequence, the EDPB finds that Meta IE could not have relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 

as a legal basis for the contact information processing.  

5.4.2.2. Regarding Article 6(1)(f) GDPR 

101. 

The EDPB recalls that personal data can be processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR when 
the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third 
party,  inasmuch  as  those  interests  are  not  overridden  by  the  interests  or  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms of the data subjects concerned. In this regard, particular attention should be paid when the 
data subject is a child191.   

102. 

The EDPB recalls192 that Article 6(1)(f) GDPR is one of the legal grounds that controllers can rely 

on for the processing of personal data, as long as the conditions for relying on it are fulfilled193.  

103. 

As  the  CJEU  has  confirmed,  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  establishes  three  cumulative  conditions,  in 
order for the processing to be lawful: “first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller 
or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; second, the need to process personal 
data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of [the data subject] do not take precedence”194. 

a. Existence of a legitimate interest 

104. 

The EDPB recalls that a legitimate interest can have a legal, economic or non-material nature 
but needs to be real and present195, and not fictitious, for the entity in question: as clarified by the 
CJEU case law, the legitimate interest must be present and effective at the date of the data processing

and must not be hypothetical at that date196. The EDPB moreover considers that the interest pursued 
must be determined in a sufficiently clear and precise manner: the determination and perimeter of 
the legitimate interest pursued must be clearly identified in order to ensure that it will be properly 
balanced against the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. In addition, the 
legitimate  interest  must  also  be  lawful  (i.e.,  acceptable  under  the  law)197.  As  a  general  rule,  those 
interests which can be traced back to the law – a legislative measure or a legal principle – can amount 
to “legitimate” interest.  

105. 

As a preliminary matter, the EDPB notes that the DE SAs considered that a legitimate interest 
cannot exist when the controller relies on it only in case that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is not applicable to 
minors on the basis of national law. In the view of the DE  SAs, accepting reliance on Article 6(1)(f) 
GDPR in this situation would be a “circumvention of the corresponding child protection provisions” and 
“contradicts the purpose of these provisions”198. In this respect, the EDPB recalls that, as stated by the 
WP29, “[a]n appropriate assessment of the balance under [Article 6(1)(f)] (...) may in some cases be a 
valid alternative to inappropriate  use of, for instance, the ground of ‘consent’ or  ‘necessary for the 
performance of a contract’. Considered in this way, [Article 6(1)(f)] presents complementary safeguards 
compared  to  the  other  pre-determined  grounds”199.  Therefore,  it  does  not  seem  impossible  for  a 
controller  to  rely  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  if,  given the  specific circumstances of  the  processing, the 
requirements enshrined in the GDPR are met.  In order to determine whether processing of personal 
data may rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, data controllers must assess in detail whether the cumulative 
conditions aforementioned can be met so that the processing of personal data is lawful. 

106. 

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA considered that the legitimate interests pursued are those of 
Meta IE and other Instagram users, “insofar that publication of contact details to the public may be a 
reasonable  and  lawful  mode  by  which  to  promote  a  professional  undertaking  or  other  public 
initiative”200. The IE SA did not specify if it referred to all Instagram users or to a specific type of users. 
Considering the submissions of the controller, to which the Draft Decision referred in paragraph 109, 
it  appears  that  the  IE  SA’s  followed  the  former  interpretation  (i.e.,  looking  at  the  interests  of  all 
Instagram users).    

107. 

In its submission, Meta IE stated that “the display of business contact information served [Meta 
IE]’s legitimate interest of creating, providing, supporting, and maintaining innovative products and 
features  that  enable  people  under  the  age  of  majority  to  express  themselves,  communicate,  and 
engage with information and communities relevant to their interests and build community. The display 
of  business  contact  information  on  a  Business  Account  also  served  the  legitimate  interest  of  other 
Instagram users who sought to engage with such an account”201. Therefore, in accordance with Meta 
IE’s submission, the legitimate interests pursued are connected to the fundamental right to conduct a 
business and the fundamental right to freedom of expression of Instagram users202. The IE SA seemed 
to agree with such interpretation203, although the IE SA did not specify how it came to such conclusion.

108. 

The NL SA and the FI SA argued in their objections that the IE SA did not sufficiently assess 
whether the interests as formulated by Meta IE are sufficiently clear, precise, lawful (i.e., acceptable 
under the law) and of real existence204.   

109. 

As  described  above,  Meta  IE  described  the  different  interests  that  it  pursued  with  the 

processing of personal data at stake. More specifically, Meta IE pursued:  

-  the  legitimate  interest  of  the  controller  of  “creating,  providing,  supporting,  and 
maintaining  innovative  products  and  features  that  enable  people  under  the  age  of 
majority  to  express  themselves,  communicate,  and  engage  with  information  and 
communities relevant to their interests and build community”, and  

- the legitimate interest of a third party (i.e., other Instagram users) to be able to engage 
with Business Account owners.  

110. 

As stated above, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller must be sufficiently clearly 
articulated and be real and present, corresponding to current activities or to benefits that are expected 
in  the  near  future205.  The  aforementioned  interests  the  controller  claimed  to  be  pursuing  via  the 
processing activities at stake were identified and described in a vague fashion. This is especially the 
case for the second interest mentioned. Therefore, the EDPB has doubts that the legitimate interest 
argued by Meta IE meets the requirements of being sufficiently specific, despite Meta IE’s allegations 
on  the  contrary206.  Therefore,  due  to  the  lack  of  specificity,  the  EDPB  cannot  assess  whether  the 
interests argued are real and lawful (i.e., acceptable under the law). The EDPB also considers that the 
evaluation of the existence of the legitimate interest(s) pursued should have been more substantiated 
in the Draft Decision.      

111. 

In any case, the existence of a legitimate interest is only one of the three cumulative conditions 
that must be met in order to lawfully rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The EDPB analyses below the two 
other conditions having regard to the alleged legitimate interests, as described and identified by the 
controller,  in  case  they  were  to  be  considered  sufficiently  clear,  precise,  real  and  lawful  (i.e., 
acceptable under the law).   

b. The necessity of the processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests 

112. 

As stated above, the concept of necessity has an independent meaning in Union law, which 
must reflect the objectives of data protection law207. The assessment of what is necessary involves a 
combined, fact-based assessment of the processing for the objective pursued. If there are realistic, 
less intrusive alternatives, the processing cannot be considered as necessary208. 

113. 

With  regard  to  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR,  the  necessity  of  the  processing  requires  a  connection 
between the processing and the legitimate interest(s) pursued and should not lead to an unduly broad

208 EDPB Guidelines 2/2019, paragraph 25; Also C-92/09 and C-93/09 Schecke and Eifert, paragraph 86. The EDPB 
considers that the existence of other less intrusive means as part of the assessment of necessity is in line with 
the CJEU case law and the GDPR, inasmuch as such assessment takes account of the possibility to  effectively 
achieve the objectives via other means. In this respect, there is no contradiction between the objections (and 
the EDPB’s position) and the  Court of Justice judgement in C-524/06 Huber, contrary to what Meta IE argued 
(Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 78-79).

interpretation thereof209. In this context, the EDPB recalls that the principle of data minimisation is 
relevant210. The EDPB notes that the IE SA found an infringement of the principle of data minimisation 
limited to “the mandatory publication (prior to 7 March 2019) of contact information on the website 
version of Instagram (in HTML) for all business account users”, since it “had the result that the personal 
data  at  issue  (i.e.  contact  information  of  child  users  on  webpages)  was  not  limited  to  what  was 
necessary in relation to the purposes for which [Meta IE] processed this specific information”211. The 
EDPB considers that such analysis should have complemented the assessment on the necessity of the 
processing, with specific regard to the HTML publication processing operation, as stated above.  

114. 

In addition, it is relevant to highlight also in this context that when assessing the necessity of a 
given processing operation, the existence of less intrusive means that would contribute effectively to 
achieving the interests pursued should be analysed. In this respect, the principle of proportionality 
should also be taken into account212. However, the IE SA did not analyse in the Draft Decision whether 
other less intrusive means were available to effectively achieve the objectives pursued. In this regard, 
the existing possibility to contact business account users directly through direct messaging within the 
platform should have been taken into consideration. In fact, it is clear from the Draft Decision that 
Meta  IE  was  aware,  prior  to  4  September  2019,  that  certain  business  account  users  preferred  to 
communicate with their audience through direct messaging on Instagram, rather than by e-mail or 
phone213. The IE SA clearly stated that “[Meta IE] acknowledges that publication of phone and email 
contact information was not always preferred from the perspective of business account users” because, 
according to Meta IE “[s]ome businesses also noted that they preferred [...] to communicate with their 
audience  or  customers  through  direct  messaging  on  Instagram  rather  than  traditional  means  (like 
phone  or  email)”214.  The  IE  SA  also  considered  that  “it  is  possible  to  operate  a  professional  profile 
without also publishing contact information”215. Despite this, the IE SA failed to take account of such 
circumstances for the assessment of the necessity of the contact information processing.   

115. 

Finally, the EDPB notes that the IE SA considered that, in some circumstances, the publication 
of the contact details of minors may have been necessary in some cases, in particular with respect to 
those business account users who wished to be publicly contactable by email or phone in connection 
with their professional activities216.  

116. 

The EDPB considers that the approach adopted by the IE SA when assessing the necessity of 
the processing is substantially erroneous. As stated above, reliance on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR requires 
that the processing be necessary to achieve the legitimate interests pursued, which, in this case, Meta 
IE considers to be the interest to conduct its business and the interest of Instagram users to contact 
business account owners and engage with them217. The benefits that such processing may bring to the 
data subject (i.e., in this case, the child business account owners) are not a relevant element for the 
assessment  of  necessity  of  the  processing.  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  is  clear  when  it  states  that  the 
legitimate interests are those of the controller or of a third party (and not those of the data subject). 
Therefore, when assessing the necessity of the processing, the legitimate interests at stake have to be

considered with regard to the controller and, if relevant, the third parties concerned (i.e., Meta IE and 
all Instagram users, in this case).  

117. 

Due  to  the  approach  adopted  by  the  IE  SA,  it  failed  to  justify  in  the  Draft  Decision  why  it 
considered  the  publication  of  contact  details  necessary  for  the  attainment  of  the  purposes  of 
legitimate interests of Meta IE and other Instagram users. In fact, it is apparent from the Draft Decision 
that Instagram users  had other means of communication with business  account  users  that did not 
significantly diminish the possibility of engaging with those accounts. The availability of other means 
of communication with business account users is also shown by the fact that certain business account 
users even preferred to communicate with their audience via direct messaging within the platform 
and did not want their information to be public. As the IE SA acknowledged “[i]t is also clear that many 
business  account  users  did  not  require  the  publication  of  personal  contact  information  in  order  to 
pursue  their  professional  purposes  on  Instagram”218  and  that  “the  requirement  to  publish  contact 
information was clearly not ‘appropriate’ as of May 2018”219. This proves with significant certainty that 
Instagram users could have achieved the alleged legitimate interest of engaging with business account 
owners  even  if  their  contact  details were  not  public and,  therefore,  Meta  IE could  also  achieve  its 
alleged legitimate interest to create, provide, support and maintain innovative products that enable 
children to express themselves, communicate and engage with others.  

118. 

Therefore, in the view of the EDPB, the IE SA failed to take into account the relevant legitimate 
interests when performing the assessment of necessity of the processing and, therefore, it should have 
not concluded220 that the processing may have been necessary in some circumstances.  

119. 

For the reasons described above, the EDPB considers that there are sufficient elements to raise 
significant doubts on the necessity of the publication of the contact information of child users for the 
purposes of the legitimate interests pursued.  

120. 

In  any  case,  even  if  the  necessity  of  the  processing  could  be  established  under  some 
circumstances, in order to lawfully rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as a legal basis for the processing, there 
is a need to ensure that the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects do not 
override the legitimate interests pursued.  

c. The balancing exercise 

121. 

When a controller intends to rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, it has to evaluate the risks of intrusion 
on the data subject’s rights. In this respect, the decisive criterion is the intensity of the intervention 
for the rights and freedoms of the individual221. The EDPB has previously stated that intensity can inter 
alia be defined by the type of information that is gathered, the scope, the number of data subjects 
concerned, the situation in question, the actual interests of the group of data subjects, the existence 
of alternative means, as well as by the nature and scope of the data assessment222. The reasonable 
expectations  of  the  data  subject  at  the  time  and  in  the  context  of  the  processing  shall  also  be 
considered223. In this regard, the EDPB recalls that the age of the data subject may be one of the factors 
to take into account in the context of the balancing of interests224.

122. 

The objective of the balancing of interests is to understand the impact of the processing on the 
data  subjects,  in  order  to  properly  conclude  whether  their  interests  or  fundamental  rights  and 
freedoms  override  the  legitimate  interests  of  the  controller.  The  purpose  is  not  to  prevent  any 
negative  impact  on  the  data  subject,  but  to  prevent  a  disproportionate  impact225.  Such  impact 
encompasses the different ways in which an individual may be affected - positively or negatively - by 
the  processing,  and  should  address  any  possible  (potential  or  actual)  positive  and  negative 
consequences of such processing226. These consequences may include potential or future decisions or 
actions by third parties or fear and distress that the data subject may experience when losing control 
over  personal  information,  for  example  through  exposure  on  the  internet227.  The  key  elements  to 
assess the impact are the likelihood that the risk materialises, on one hand, and the severity of the 
consequences on the other one228. The EDPB underlines that safeguards play a special role in reducing 
any undue impact on the data subject. In order to ensure that the interests and fundamental rights 
and  freedoms  of  data  subjects  do  not  override  the  legitimate  interests  pursued,  the  safeguards  in 
question  must  be  adequate  and  sufficient,  and  must  unquestionably  and  significantly  reduce  the 
impact on data subjects229.  

123. 

 The assessment should also take into account the measures that the controller plans to adopt 
in order to comply with its obligations, including in terms of proportionality and transparency230. The 
relationship  between  the  balancing  test,  transparency  and  the  accountability  principle  has  already 
been underlined by the WP29, which considered it “crucial” in the context of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR231. In 
this regard, the EDPB recalls that, if the controller hides important information to the data subject, it 
will  not  fulfil  the  requirements  of  reasonable  expectations  of  the  data  subject  and  an  overall 
acceptable balance of interests232. 

124. 

In  the  Draft  Decision,  the  IE  SA  disagreed  with  Meta  IE’s  analysis  of  the  adequacy  of  the 
information provided to child users and the security and safety measures implemented, which, in the 
view of the IE SA, did not mitigate all relevant risks for child users233. In fact, the insufficiency of the 
measures led the IE SA to conclude that “there are possible and severe risks associated with the two 
forms of processing which are the subject of this Inquiry; these risks are primarily related to possible 
communication between child users and dangerous individuals, both on and off the Instagram platform 
(...). I am also satisfied that the measures and safeguards implemented by [Meta IE] (in the form of 
account  options,  tools  and  information)  were  not  adequate  with  regard  to  the  specific  processing 
operations  at  issue”  since  they  “did  not  adequately  mitigate  the  risk  of  communication  between 
dangerous individuals and child users. Accordingly, I do not share [Meta IE]’s view that the processing 
at  issue  did  not  result  in  high  risks  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  child  users”234.  The  IE  SA  also 
considered  that  the  changes  to  the  processing  in  July  and  September  2019  “reduced  but  did  not 
adequately mitigate the risks for child users in connection with the processing”235. Meta IE argued that 
neither the CSAs nor the IE SA gave “due weight to the other half of the balancing test to mitigate

and/or negate” the risks to the data subjects236. Therefore, the EDPB disagrees with the view of Meta 
IE and considers that the IE SA on the assessment of the risk is accurate. The EDPB also underlines that 
it is possible to accommodate the objective of effectively reducing the risk for children while ensuring 
their right to freedom of expression, by implementing appropriate safeguards and measures237.  

125. 

The IE SA also addressed the lack of transparency regarding the information on the publication 
of the contact details. In this respect, the IE SA stated in the Draft Decision that “[Meta IE] facilitated 
the publication of phone and email contact information for children as young as 13, using a streamlined 
account  switching process which automatically completed certain information for  the user,  without 
warning child users that publication of their personal contact information may result in high risks to 
their rights and freedoms” 238. Therefore, taking into account both the assessment of the risk and the 
mitigating measures, as well as the lack of information provided, the IE SA concluded that “the contact 
information processing by [Meta IE] (both before September 2019, and after) results in high risks to the 
rights and freedoms of child users, for the purposes of Article 35(1) GDPR”239. 

126. 

As  mentioned  above,  the  transparency  of  the  information  provided  has  an  impact  on  the 
reasonable expectations of the data subjects. Likewise, adequate and sufficient additional safeguards 
are  those  that  unquestionably  and  significantly  reduce  the  impact  on  data  subjects.  These  are 
important elements to take into account in the assessment of the balancing of interests. However, 
despite acknowledging the lack of proper measures and information,  and the severe risks that this 
creates for child users, when analysing the balancing exercise to verify whether Meta IE could rely on 
Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  the  IE  SA  only  concluded  that,  in  some  circumstances,  it  is  possible  that  the 
legitimate interests would not be overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of 
the  child  user240.  In  addition,  despite  the  lack  of  proper  information,  the  IE  SA  concluded  that 
technically literate users may have expected the publication, regardless of their age241. The EDPB finds 
particularly problematic that, despite the risks of the processing, recognised by Meta IE itself242, the 
publication of contact details of child users was mandatory until 4 September 2019. In fact, child users 
were not even informed of such publication, since the Option Screen only stated that “these contact 
options will be linked to your business profile”243. Even though the screen included a note at the end 
stating that “people will be able to email, call and get directions to your business [...]”, it did not specify 
that it was because of the publication of the information. In the view of the EDPB, it is not reasonable 
to expect that a normal user, let alone a child, even if technically literate, could deduce from such a 
vague statement that publication of their information would take place and that it would allow any 
type of person (including persons with whom they had had no contact or link) to contact them directly. 
In fact, as the IE SA noted, the term “will be able” may have been understood by the child users as a 
conditional indication that an additional contact-publication feature could be implemented optionally 
by the user244.

127. 

Taking the above into consideration, the EDPB is of the view that the IE SA did not properly 
assess the impact of the processing when performing the balancing exercise. In fact, the  IE SA only 
took  into  account  the  positive  consequences  of  the  processing245,  whereas  it  failed  to  give  proper 
weight to all the other relevant elements and the risks it had itself identified.  

128. 

Therefore, the EDPB considers that, regarding the publication of the contact information of 
child  users  prior  to  4  September  2019,  the  legitimate  interests  pursued  were  overridden  by  the 
interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of child users. The EDPB comes to this conclusion given 
the severe risks identified by the IE SA, the lack of appropriate measures to address those risks, the 
lack  of  proper  information  to  data  subjects  regarding  publication  and  its  consequences  and  the 
impossibility to opt-out from the publication. All these elements combined tip the balance in favour of 
the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.  

129. 

With regard to the processing of personal data of child users after 4 September 2019, the EDPB 
notes that the Option Screen stated that the contact information would be displayed publicly in the 
profile of the users “so people can contact you”246. This change in the wording could have allowed child 
users to understand that any person could contact them as their details would be publicly available247. 
In addition, child users were given the option to opt-out from the publication of their contact details.  
The availability of a well-designed opt-out option without the need for any justification to exercise it 
and the relationship between the balancing test and transparency are crucial for the balancing exercise 
under  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR.  In  fact,  in  those  cases  in which  the  balance  is  difficult  to  strike,  a  well-
designed and workable mechanism for opt-out could play an important role in safeguarding the rights 
and interests of the data subjects248. In this regard, it is relevant to bear in mind the finding of the IE 
SA in the Draft Decision that the information provided to child users by Meta IE after 4 September 
2019 in the course of the business account switching process was in compliance with Articles 12(1), 
13(1)(c) and 13(1)(e) GDPR (Finding 3 in the Draft Decision)249. 

130. 

This being said, the EDPB finds that these elements are not sufficient to change the outcome 
of the balancing test in light of the aforementioned considerations. This is especially the case because 
of the high risk resulting from the publication of contact details as explained above in paragraph 124 
and of the fact that children were not warned about such risks. These circumstances were not affected 
by the changes brought as of 4 September 2019 and thus these changes were not sufficient to change 
the outcome of the balancing test.   

131. 

On the basis of the above, the publication of the contact information of child users prior to and 
after 4 September 2019 did not meet the requirements under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, since the interests 
and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects overrode the alleged legitimate interests 
pursued.  

132. 

Considering the EDPB’s conclusion in paragraphs 118-119 and, especially, 131 above, it is the 
view of  the  EDPB  that  Meta  IE  could  not  rely  on  Article 6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the contact  information 
processing since the processing was either unnecessary or, if it were to be considered necessary, it 
did not pass the balancing test.   

                                                           
245 See Draft Decision paragraph 121, where the IE SA assessed the potential negative consequences if the 
processing didn’t take place.

5.4.2.3. Conclusion regarding the lack of legal basis 

133. 

Considering the conclusions in paragraphs 100 and 132 of this Binding Decision, i.e. that Meta 
IE could rely neither on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, nor on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the contact information 
processing,  and  bearing  in  mind  that  Meta  IE  relied  on  these  two  legal  bases  alternatively  for  the 
processing at  stake250,  the  EDPB finds that  Meta  IE processed  the  personal data unlawfully251.  As  a 
consequence, to that extent Meta IE infringed Article 6(1) GDPR. Accordingly, the EDPB instructs the 
IE SA to change its Draft Decision in order to establish the relevant infringement.  

134. 

Considering the nature and gravity of the infringement, as well as the number of data subjects 
affected, the EDPB further instructs the IE SA to re-assess its envisaged action in accordance with the 
conclusions reached by the EDPB in order to consider the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR. 
In this respect, the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR shall be considered in the compliance 
order, to the extent that the processing is ongoing, in order to ensure that full effect is given to Meta 
IE’s obligations under Article 6(1) GDPR.  

135. 

With  regard  to the  imposition of an  administrative  fine  for  the  infringement  of  Article  6(1) 

GDPR, the EDPB refers to section 7.4.2.4 of this Binding Decision for its assessment.

IDENTIFIED BY THE CSAs 

6.1.  On potential infringements of Article 6(1)(a), Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR 

regarding contact information processing 

6.1.1.  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

136. 

In its inquiry and the Draft Decision, with regard to the legal basis for the contact information 
processing, the IE SA solely considered whether Meta IE could rely on Articles 6(1)(b) and alternatively 
on  6(1)(f)  GDPR  as  the  legal  bases252  (as  summarized  above  in  paragraphs  25-31  of  this  Binding 
Decision). 

6.1.2.  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

137. 

The  DE  SAs  raised  an  objection  whereby  the  only  applicable  legal  basis  for  the  contact 
information processing is consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. According to the DE SAs, Meta IE should 
have additionally obtained parental consent for minor users under 16 years of age, unless the national 
legislator has regulated this differently253. The DE SAs also objected to the LSA having not found an 
infringements of Articles 7 and 8(1) GDPR regarding contact information processing as a consequence 
of the infringement of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In the view of the DE SAs, Meta IE should have complied 
with  the  requirements  for  consent  under  Article  7  GDPR  and  the  conditions  applicable  to  a  child’s 
consent under Article 8(1) GDPR. However, Meta IE had neither fulfilled the conditions under Article 7 
GDPR, nor obtained parental consent with regard to children below the age of 16 years as required

under  Article  8  GDPR254.  The  DE  SAs  also  requested  the  LSA  to  take  specific  additional  corrective 
measures as a consequence of the possible infringements255. 

6.1.3.  Position of the LSA on the objections 

138. 

The IE SA confirmed that it does not propose to “follow” the objections that were raised by the 

CSAs and/or does not consider the objections to be relevant and reasoned256. 

6.1.4.  Analysis of the EDPB 

139. 

The EDPB observes that in the Draft Decision the IE SA analysed if Meta IE could rely on Article 
6(1)(b)  and  alternatively  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the  contact  information  processing.  The  EDPB 
notes that the CSAs can raise a relevant and reasoned objection on additional infringements in relation 
the  conclusions  to  be  drawn  from  the  findings  of  the  investigation257,  or  on  whether  the  LSA  has 
sufficiently investigated the relevant infringements of the GDPR258. The DE SAs’ objection requests the 
LSA to find infringements of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and, consequently, of Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR. 
In this regard, the potential infringements of Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR is a consequence of the 
potential infringement of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. However, the EDPB firstly considers that the objection 
regarding  the  infringement  of  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR  fails  to  establish  a  direct  connection  with  the 
specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision, thus lacking relevance. As the EDPB finds that 
the  DE  SAs  objection,  insofar  it  concerns  Meta  IE’s  compliance  with  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR,  is  not 
relevant,  this  also  affects  the  relevance  of  the  DE  SAs  objection,  insofar  it  concerns  Meta  IE’s 
compliance  with  Article  7  and  Article  8(1)  GDPR.  Consequently,  the  EDPB  finds  that  the  DE  SAs 
objection  on  the  potential  infringements  Article  6(1)(a),  Article  7  and  Article  8(1)  GDPR  are  not 
“relevant”. 

140. 

The EDPB further observes that it remains unclear from the DE SAs objection if in the present 
case the infringements of Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR can be established on the basis of the findings 
in  the  Draft  Decision  or  the  LSA’s  inquiry.  Moreover,  the  EDPB  finds  that  the  DE  SAs  objection  in 
relation  to  Article  7  and  Article  8(1)  GDPR  does  not  provide  sufficiently  precise  and  detailed  legal 
reasoning regarding infringement of each specific provision in question. In addition, the objection does 
not put forward sufficient arguments to demonstrate the significance of the risk posed by the Draft 
Decision  for  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subjects  or  the  free  flow  of  data  within  the  EU. 
Therefore, the objection is also not sufficiently “reasoned” in light of the Guidelines on RRO259.  

141. 

Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the DE SAs objection, insofar it concerns Article 
6(1)(a), Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR does not meet the threshold of Article 4 (24) GDPR. With regard 
to  the  potential  infringement  of  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR,  the  DE  SAs  objection  is  not  “relevant”  and, 
regarding  Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR, the DE SAs objection is neither “relevant”, nor “reasoned”. 
Consequently, there is no need for the EDPB to further analyse the merits of this objection.

6.2.1.  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

142. 

In its Draft Decision, the IE SA considered whether Meta IE could rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
or alternatively on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the contact information processing260 (as summarized above 
in paragraphs 25-31 of this Binding Decision). 

6.2.2.  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

143. 

The DE SAs objected to the IE SA not finding that an infringement of Articles 5(1)(a) and (b) 
GDPR occurred. In the view of the DE SAs, the IE SA should have found an infringement of Articles 
5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR stemming from Meta IE’s lack of legal basis for the processing261.  

144. 

The DE SAs considered that as a consequence of Meta IE not validly relying on any of the legal 
bases of Article 6(1) GDPR, Meta IE violated the principle of lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. 
Moreover, by disregarding the special requirements for consent under Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR 
as proposed by the DE SAs (see section 6.1 of this Binding Decision), Meta IE processed personal data 
in an unlawful manner that breached Article 5(1)(a) GDPR262. 

145. 

In  the  context  of  Article  5(1)(b)  GDPR,  the  DE  SAs  argued  that  the  lack  of  legal  basis  for 
processing undermined the principle of purpose limitation. The DE SAs argued that Meta IE did not 
define specific purposes of processing for all groups of children, but rather expressed the performance 
of  a  contract  as  a  common  purpose  for  all  processing.  As  the  purpose  of  processing  was  the 
performance of a contract, Meta IE could not simultaneously claim that the purpose for certain groups 
of  minors  was  legitimate  interest  as  this  would  have  been  against  the  controller’s  duty  to  collect 
personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes263. 

6.2.3.  Position of the LSA on the objections 

146. 

The IE SA confirmed that it does not propose to “follow” the objections that were raised by the 

CSAs and/or does not consider the objections to be relevant and reasoned264.  

6.2.4.  Analysis of the EDPB 

147. 

The EDPB observes that in the Draft Decision the LSA analysed if Meta IE could rely on Article 
6(1)(b)  and  alternatively  on  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR  for  the  contact  information  processing.  As  noted 
above, the CSAs can raise a relevant and reasoned objection on additional infringements in relation 
the  conclusions  to  be  drawn  from  the  findings  of  the  investigation265,  or  on  whether  the  LSA  has 
sufficiently investigated the relevant infringements of the GDPR266. However, the EDPB considers that 
in this specific case the DE SAs objection insofar as it requests the IE SA to find the infringements of 
Article 5(1)(a) and Article 5(1)(b) GDPR fails to establish a direct connection with the specific legal and

factual content of the Draft Decision. Therefore, the EDPB finds that the DE SAs objection to the extent 
it concerns the potential infringements Article 5(1)(a) and Article 5(1)(b) GDPR is not “relevant”. 

148. 

The EDPB further finds that the DE SAs objection does not put forward sufficiently precise and 
detailed  legal,  as  well  as  factual  reasoning  in  relation  to  infringement  of  each  specific  provision  in 
question.  In  addition,  the  objection  does  not  provide  sufficient  arguments  to  demonstrate  the 
significance of the risk posed by the Draft Decision for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects or 
the free flow of data within the EU. Therefore, the objection is also not sufficiently “reasoned” in light 
of the Guidelines on RRO267.  

149. 

Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the DE SAs objection regarding the infringements 
of  Article 5(1)(a) and (b)  GDPR does  not meet  the  threshold of Article 4 (24) GDPR, as it is  neither 
“relevant”, nor “reasoned”. Consequently, there is no need for the EDPB to further analyse the merits 
of this objection. 

6.3.  On legal basis regarding public-by-default processing 

6.3.1.  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

150. 

In its Draft Decision, the IE SA considered whether the default account settings for child users 
by Meta IE were contrary to the GDPR, particularly Article 5(1)(c), Article 12(1), Article 24(2), Articles 
25(1)  and  (2)  GDPR.  As explained  by  the  IE  SA  in  its  Draft Decision268,  public-by-default  processing 
refers to Instagram having a default setting which allowed the social media content of an Instagram 
account to be viewed by any Instagram user, or by persons who had not registered as Instagram users 
if  the  latter  were  accessing  the  web-browser  version  of  Instagram  (hereinafter,  “public-by-default 
processing”). In contrast, if a user account was set as private, the content posted on the account could 
be  accessed  only  by  users  approved  by  the  account  holder  personally269.  To  make  a  user  account 
private,  the  account  holder  had  to  change  the  default  settings  after  registration  as  an  Instagram 
user270. 

151. 

The IE SA identified that Meta IE had two separate purposes for processing the personal data 
of its Instagram users in relation to the public-by-default setting. In case of a public profile, Meta IE 
processed  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  sharing  social  media  content  with  anyone,  including 
persons  who  had  not  registered  as  Instagram  users.  In  case  of  a  private  profile,  the  purpose  of 
processing was to share content only with Instagram users who had been approved by the account 
holder271. 

152. 

Meta IE informed its child users of the public-by-default account settings in its 2018 and 2020 
Data Policies  under  a  section  titled  “Sharing  on  Facebook  Products”,  which  stated  that “When  you 
share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share”. The section 
further stated the following272: 

“Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products,  including if they 
don't have an account. This includes your Instagram username; any information you

share  with  a  public  audience;  information  in  your  public  profile  on  Facebook;  and 
content you share on a Facebook Page, public Instagram account or any other public 
forum, such as Facebook Marketplace”. 

153. The Data Policy contained a hyperlink to a section titled “How do I set my Instagram account to private 
so that only approved followers can see what I share?” included in Instagram’s support webpage. The 
section stated the following273: 

“By default, anyone can see your profile and posts on Instagram. You can make your 
account  private  so  that  only  followers  you  approve  can  see  what  you  share.  If your 
account is set to private, only your approved followers will see your photos or videos 
on hashtag or location pages.” 

154. The instructions on how to switch the account from public to private were included in a section on the 
support webpage titled “How do I set my Instagram account to private so that only approved followers 
can see what I share?” and in additional informational resources created by Meta IE for its child users 
and their parents. In addition to the above contents, the Data Policy 2018 included another hyperlink 
to a support webpage titled “Controlling Your Visibility”. This webpage included information on how to 
switch to a private account274. 

155. 

With respect to the compatibility with Article 12(1) GDPR, the IE SA concluded that Meta IE 
infringed this provision because it did not inform the child users of Instagram of the purposes of the 
public-by-default processing in a clear and transparent manner275. 

156. 

Assessing  the  public-by-default processing in the context of  Article 5(1)(c)  and Article 25(2) 
GDPR, the IE SA noted that the public-by-default processing was not necessary or proportionate for 
the two purposes of this processing that were identified by the IE SA. In particular, the IE SA considered 
that child users may have a reduced ability to change the privacy settings of their account. Moreover, 
the public-by-default processing was global in extent276. The IE SA found that Meta IE had failed to 
implement technical and organisational measures to ensure that, by default, only personal data that 
was necessary for the relevant purpose of processing was collected. Particularly considering that the 
child users’ accounts were by default made visible to an indefinite number of natural persons, the IE 
SA found that the processing had infringed Article 5(1)(c) and Article 25(2) GDPR277. 

157. 

The  IE  SA  also  concluded  that  Meta  IE  infringed  Article  25(1)  GDPR  by  not  implementing 
appropriate technical and organisational measures to implement the data protection principles in an 
effective manner and integrate the necessary safeguards to protect child users from the severe risks 
that the public-by-default processing posed278. 

158. 

Further, the IE SA found that the safeguards and measures implemented by Meta IE did not 
properly take  into account the  specific  risks  to the rights  and freedoms of child users279.  The  IE SA 
concluded that Meta IE infringed Article 24(1) GDPR280.

The IE SA’s findings in the Draft Decision regarding Article 5(1)(c), Article 12(1), Article 24(1), 
Articles 25(1) and (2) GDPR in relation with public-by-default processing are not subject to the present 
dispute. 

6.3.2.  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

160. 

The  NO  SA  first  considered  that  the  IE  SA’s  findings  and  assessment  in  the  Draft  Decision 
logically led to the conclusion that the requirement of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) were not 
met281. The NO SA noted that the IE SA found that Meta IE carried out processing beyond what was 
necessary  for the  purposes  of  the  processing,  such  as  in  paragraph  450 of  the  Draft Decision,  and 
identified considerable risks for child users. Based on these findings, the NO SA concluded that Meta 
IE did not fulfil the necessity requirement under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR282. The NO SA suggested 
that the IE SA should have carried out a legal analysis on the processing to verify if it could rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) and (f)283. The NO SA suggested that the scope of the inquiry allowed the investigation 
of whether the lawfulness obligations under Article 6 GDPR were met. This was based on the fact that 
the Draft Decision included an assessment of Article 6 GDPR and conclusions that were relevant for 
the assessment of lawfulness284. 

161. 

Specifically on the public-by-default processing, the NO SA stated that the fact that the IE SA 
found that the public-by-default processing was not necessary or proportionate on several grounds 
indicated that there was a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR. Such grounds were that Meta IE’s child users 
may have had reduced ability to apply Instagram’s privacy settings, the processing of public accounts 
was global and the processing was not necessary for such child users who did not wish to have their 
Instagram  account  public.  The  NO  SA  concluded  that  the  public-by-default  processing  was  not 
necessary for the performance of a contract or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the 
controller285. 

162. 

Finally, the NO SA asked the IE SA to conclude that the legal bases under Article 6(1)(b) and (f) 
GDPR were not applicable legal bases for the public-by-default processing and to exercise corrective 
powers  under  Article  58(2)  GDPR:  (1)  to  order  the  controller  to  identify  a  valid  legal  basis  for  the 
processing in question, or from now on abstain from such processing activities; and (2) to impose an 
administrative fine for unlawfully processing personal data, erroneously relying on Articles 6(1)(b) and 
(f) GDPR286. 

6.3.3.  Position of the LSA on the objections 

163. 

The IE SA confirmed that it does not propose to “follow” the objections that were raised by the 

CSAs and/or does not consider the objections to be relevant and reasoned287.

6.3.4.  Analysis of the EDPB 

164. 

The EDPB observes that, although the public-by-default processing was examined by the  IE SA 
in the Draft Decision288, the question of compliance of the public-by-default processing with Article 6 
GDPR was neither within the scope of the inquiry of the IE SA, nor it was addressed by the IE SA in the 
Draft Decision. At the same time, the EDPB recalls that the CSAs can raise a relevant and reasoned 
objection on additional infringements in relation the conclusions to be drawn from the findings of the 
investigation289, or on whether the LSA has sufficiently investigated the relevant infringements of the 
GDPR290. However, the EDPB considers that in this specific case the NO SA objection fails to establish 
a  direct  connection  with  the  specific  legal  and  factual  content  of  the  Draft  Decision,  thus  it  is  not 
“relevant”.  

165. 

Furthermore, the EDPB considers that, given the legal and factual elements available  in the 
Draft Decision and the arguments presented by the NO SA, the objection does not explain sufficiently 
clearly, nor substantiate in sufficient detail how the conclusion regarding Meta IE’s compliance with 
Article  6  GDPR  in  relation  to  the  public-by-default  processing  could  be  reached  on  that  basis. 
Therefore, the EDPB finds that this NO SA objection is not “reasoned”.  

166. 

Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the NO SA objection regarding the public-by-default 
processing does not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR and consequently there is no need for 
the EDPB to further analyse the merits of this objection. 

7  ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINE 

7.1.  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

167. 

In the Draft Decision, the IE SA analysed the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR in deciding whether 
to  impose  an  administrative  fine  and  determine  its  amount291.  The  IE  SA  also  specified  that  the 
“decision  as  to  whether  to  impose  an  administrative  fine  in  respect  of  each  infringement,  and  the 
amount  of  that  fine  where  applicable,  is  independent  and  specific  to  the  circumstances  of  each 
particular  infringement”292.  As  regards  the  calculation  of  the  fine,  in  the  Draft  Decision  the  IE  SA 
considered the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, as per Article 83(2)(a) GDPR293. In 
terms  of  nature,  the  infringements  of  Article  12(1)  GDPR  in  respect  of  both  the  public-by-default 
processing and the contact information processing were found to be most serious in nature294. The IE 
SA found that the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR regarding the contact information processing 
was serious in nature295 and that the infringements of Article 35(1), 24(1), 25(1)296, 5(1)(c) and 25(2) 
GDPR297 were serious in nature in respect of both the public-by-default processing and the contact 
information processing. In terms of gravity, the LSA considered that the gravity of infringements of

Article 12(1)  GDPR  in respect of both the  public-by-default  processing and the contact information 
processing was highly serious298. The IE SA found that the gravity of the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR  regarding  the  contact  information  processing  was  serious299  and  that  the  gravity  of  the 
infringements of Articles 35(1), 24(1), 25(1)300, 5(1)(c) and 25(2) GDPR301 in respect of both the public-
by-default processing and the contact information processing was serious. In terms of duration of the 
infringement,  the  IE  SA  considered  that  the  period  of  infringement  was  the  period  between  the 
entering into application of the GDPR on 25 May 2018 and the commencement of the inquiry on 21 
September  2020302.  The  IE  SA  found  the  aforementioned  period  to  be  the  duration  of  the 
infringements  apart  from  the  infringement  of  Article  12(1)  GDPR  regarding  contact  information 
processing, which the IE SA found to have ended on 4 September 2019, the infringement of Article 
5(1)(a) GDPR concerning contact information processing, which the IE SA found to have commenced 
from 4 September 2019 and the infringement of Article 35(1) GDPR regarding both contact information 
and public-by-default processing, which the LSA found to have commenced on 25 July 2018. Moreover, 
the LSA found that the duration of the infringement of Articles 5(1)(c) and 25(2) GDPR concerning the 
contact information processing ended on November 2020 and did not include the period between July 
2019 to August 2020303. 

168. 

In  relation  to  the  intentional  or  negligent  character  of  the  infringements,  as  per  Article 
83(2)(b) GDPR, the IE SA concluded that certain Meta IE’s infringements were intentional and others 
negligent in character304. The LSA found that the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR regarding both 
public-by-default processing and contact information processing were negligent and the infringements 
of Articles 24(1) and 25(1) GDPR regarding both public-by-default processing and contact information 
processing  were  highly  negligent305.  As  for  the  other  infringements,  the  LSA  found  that  the 
infringements  of  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR  regarding  contact  information  processing  and  Articles  35(1), 
5(1)(c)  and  25(2)  GDPR  in  respect  of  both  public-by-default  processing  and  contact  information 
processing were intentional306.   

169. 

With regard to other aggravating or mitigating factors, as per Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, the Draft 
Decision assessed the financial benefit gained by Meta IE from the infringements. The IE SA concluded 
that the infringement of Article 12(1) GDPR resulted in a financial benefit to Meta IE and considered 
this to be an aggravating factor307. Regarding the infringement of Article 24 GDPR, the IE SA stated 
that this infringement was considered separately to other infringements and it was not considered to 
be an aggravating factor with regard to the other infringements at issue, or an issue which is pertinent 
to the calculation of the administrative fines308. 

170. 

The assessment by the IE SA of the criteria in Article 83(2)(a) and (c) to (j) GDPR is not subject 

to the present dispute.

171. 

In the  Draft  Decision,  the IE SA  considered the criteria outlined in Article 82(2)(a)-(k)  GDPR 
cumulatively in respect of each infringement, when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine 
and  when  deciding  the  amount  of  each  administrative  fine309.  The  IE  SA  concluded  that  an 
administrative  fine  for  each  of  the  infringements  was  appropriate  and  necessary  to  dissuade  non-
compliance in the case at hand and similar future cases of Meta IE and other controllers or processors 
carrying  out  similar  processing  activities.  Here,  the  IE  SA  considered  the  seriousness  of  the 
infringements in nature and gravity, the proportionality of the fines with regard to the nature, gravity 
and duration of the infringements, the intentional or negligent character of the infringements, the fact 
that  the  infringements  related  to  personal  data  of  children,  the  financial  benefit  gained  from  the 
public-by-default processing and the lack of previous relevant infringements of Meta IE310. Based on 
these  circumstances,  the  IE  SA  determined  a  range  for  each  of  the  fines  that  it  considered  to  be 
effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR311. 

172. 

The IE SA proposed in the Draft Decision to impose nine administrative fines within the total 

range of EUR 202 million to 405 million312.  

7.2. 

Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

173. 

The DE SAs objected to the amount and calculation of the administrative fine which the LSA 
proposed to impose in the Draft Decision. In the view of the DE SAs, the LSA’s Draft Decision did not 
ensure a consistent application of administrative fines, and the envisaged amount of the fines were 
not  effective,  proportionate  or  dissuasive313.  The  DE  SAs  argued  that  fines  could  only  be  effective, 
proportionate  and dissuasive  if  the  profitability of the  undertaking  was  taken into account  in their 
calculation. This was based on the argument that the undertaking’s sensitivity to administrative fines 
was significantly influenced by profitability, not only turnover. According to the DE SAs, the LSA did 
not  explain  in  its  Draft  Decision  how  the  element  of  profitability  was  taken  into  account  in  the 

                                                           
309 Draft Decision, paragraph 565. 
310 Draft Decision, paragraph 567. 
311 Draft Decision, paragraphs 570-572. 
312 Draft Decision, paragraphs 569 and 627(3). Specifically, on the basis of the LSA’s findings in the Draft Decision, 
the following fine amount ranges were envisaged in respect of the infringements:  

1)  For the infringement of Art. 12(1) GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 1), a fine of 

between EUR 55 million and 100 million;  

2)  For the infringement of Art. 12(1) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 2), a fine 

of between EUR 46 million and 75 million;  

3)  For the infringement of Art. 5(1)(a) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 4), a 

fine of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

4)  For the infringement of Art. 35(1) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 5), a fine 

5) 

of between EUR 28 million and 45 million;  
Infringement  of  Art.  35(1)  GDPR  regarding  the  public-by-default  processing  (Finding  6),  a  fine  of 
between EUR 28 million and 45 million;  

6)  For  the  infringement  of  Art.  5(1)(c)  and  25(2)  GDPR  regarding  the  contact  information  processing 

(Finding 7), a fine of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

7)  For the infringement of Art. 25(1) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 8), a fine 

of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

8)  For the infringement of Art. 5(1)(c) and 25(2)  GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 

10), a fine of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

9)  For the infringement of Art. 25(1) GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 11), a fine 

of between EUR 9 million and 28 million.

calculation of the fine314. The DE SAs also found that the envisaged amount of fines were too low to 
create special and general preventive effect and to be effective315. According to the DE SAs, in view of 
the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and the number of data subjects concerned, it 
was necessary to issue a fine that has noticeable impacts for the undertaking. Based on this, the DE 
SAs suggested that, in order to create a preventive effect and impose an effective fine, the amount of 
fine  should  generate  an  impact  of  approximately  one  percent  of  the  annual  profit  of  Meta  IE316. 
Furthermore, with regard to the Draft Decision, the DE SAs stated that: “the envisaged fine could not 
have a general preventive effect. Rather, it will likely have the opposite effect”317.  

174. 

Additionally,  the  DE  SAs  was  of  the  view  that  the  LSA  did  not  consider  appropriately  the 
financial benefit that Meta IE gained from the infringement. Based on publicly available data, the DE 
SAs  proposed  an  estimation  of  the  financial  benefit  gained  by  Meta  IE  from  the  public-by-default 
processing and argued that it should be further considered when calculating the fine318. 

175. 

Regarding  the  calculation  criteria  in  Article  83(2)  GDPR,  the  DE  SAs  argued  that  the  facts 
identified by the IE SA pointed towards intentional, not negligent behaviour and therefore disagreed 
with the  IE  SA’s assessment  in the Draft Decision in this respect.  According to the DE SAs,  Meta IE 
wilfully decided on the content of its switching process and their Data Policy and wilfully used language 
that was excessively general and made it difficult for children to understand the consequences of their 
choice; moreover, Meta IE as a global data processing company had enough resources to be aware of 
the problem beforehand319. 

176. 

As  for  aggravating  factors,  the  DE  SAs  stated  that  the  LSA  should  have  considered  the 
infringement of Article 24 GDPR as an aggravating factor in respect of the other infringements under 
Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. In the view of the DE SAs, although the infringement of Article 24 GDPR is not 
itself  subject  to  an  administrative  fine  under  the  GDPR,  it  must  be  reflected  in  the  decisions  of 
supervisory  authorities,  since  the  scope  of  Article  83(2)(k)  GDPR,  which  is  necessarily  open-ended, 
should include all the reasoned considerations, including the infringement of Article 24(1) GDPR320. 

177. 

Furthermore,  according  to  the  DE  SAs,  the  calculation  criteria  of  Article  83(2)  GDPR  were 
wrongly  weighted  resulting  in  a  fine  which  is  too  low.  The  DE  SAs  stated  that,  considering  the 
circumstances of the particular case, including the nature and gravity of the infringements, as well as 
the sensitivity of the data subjects affected, a fine in the upper range of the possible level of 4% of the 
turnover would be expected. However, the envisaged fines in the Draft Decision,  which amount to 
about 0.58% of the turnover, are significantly lower321.  

178. 

In addition, the DE SAs stated that the IE SA should use the turnover figure of 2021 instead of 

that of 2020322. 

179. 

Finally, the DE  SAs  elaborated on the  risks posed by the Draft Decision to  the fundamental 
rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subjects:  as  the  Draft  Decision  did  not  promote  a  consistent

application of administrative fines, this would result in a significant risk to the rights and fundamental 
freedoms of data subjects, since the undertaking and other controllers could orientate their abidance 
of  data  protection  law  on  such  a  barely  noticeable  fine323;  the  summed  up  proposed  fines  for  the 
infringements were not able to create a deterrent effect and thus would lead to a lesser protection of 
the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects; and the effective enforcement of the GDPR, 
which  is  the  precondition  for  the  protection  of  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data 
subjects, would not be ensured324. 

*** 

180. 

As already referred in section 5.2 of this Binding Decision, the NO SA in its objection asked the 
IE  SA to  change  its exercise  of  corrective  powers  in order  to  impose  an  administrative  fine  for  the 
additional infringement regarding the lack of legal basis for the contact information processing. The IT 
SA and FR SA also specifically requested an additional corrective measure in terms of an administrative 
fine for the additional infringement325. 

7.3.  Position of the LSA on the objections 

181. 

The IE SA confirmed that it does not propose to “follow” the objections that were raised by the 

CSAs and/or does not consider the objections to be relevant and reasoned326.  

182. 

The IE SA did not agree with the DE SAs’ view that Meta IE acted with knowledge and wilfulness 
taking into account the objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the inquiry, except 
in those parts of the Draft Decision where the IE SA found that Meta IE acted intentionally. In addition, 
the IE SA disagreed that Article 24 GDPR had to be taken into account as an aggravating factor pursuant 
to Article 83(2)(k) GDPR327. 

183. 

The IE SA further noted that the Draft Decision appropriately concluded that the infringement 
resulted  in  a  financial  benefit  to  Meta  IE, which  is  an  aggravating  factor  for the  purpose  of  Article 
83(2)(k) GDPR. The IE SA also reiterated that the Draft Decision took into account the undertaking’s 
turnover in the context of Article 83 GDPR, in the manner described in paragraphs 624 and 625 of the 
Draft Decision328.  

184. 

In view of the IE SA, paragraph 569 of the Draft Decision presented a thorough, detailed and 
specific formulation of the amount of each of the nine  fines which allows for the  CSAs to  properly 
consider whether  the fines are effective,  dissuasive and proportionate. According to the  IE SA, the 
overall  fining  range  reflected  a  number  of  smaller  and  larger  proposed  fines,  which  have  been 
calculated pursuant to the EDPB’s interpretation of Article 83(3) GDPR in Binding Decision 1/2021329, 
and that, when each of the proposed fines is considered on an individual basis, the proposed fining 
ranges are sufficiently clear to determine whether they are effective, dissuasive and proportionate330.

Finally, with respect to the determination of the year of turnover, IE SA agreed with the DE SAs 
that the relevant year is the year immediately preceding the date of the final decision and confirmed 
that this will be accounted for in the final decision331. 

7.4.  Analysis of the EDPB 

7.4.1.  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

 

186. 

In  its  objection  on  the  proposed  calculation  of  the  fine,  the  DE  SAs  considered  the  fine 
proposed in the Draft  Decision to be ineffective,  disproportionate  and non-dissuasive  and outlined 
several arguments why they disagreed with the Draft Decision in this respect332. The EDPB considers 
that  the  DE  SAs’  objection  related  to  the  content  of  the  Draft  Decision333  and  included  sufficient 
reasoning334 as to why, if accepted, it would lead to a different conclusion. The EDPB notes that this 
objection concerned “whether the action envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”335. 
Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be “relevant”.  

187. 

In its objection, the DE SAs set out legal and factual arguments in relation to each element 
raised in the objection, in particular its reasoning on how the Draft Decision should assess the criteria 
of Articles 83(1) and (2) GDPR considering the facts of the specific case and how this would lead to a 
different conclusion in the Draft Decision336. The DE SAs provided detailed reasoning that a higher fine 
ought  to  be  imposed,  considering  the  profitability  and  the  global  turnover  of  the  undertaking337. 
Furthermore,  the  DE  SAs  considered  that  without  amendment  the  Draft  Decision  would  set  a 
dangerous precedent with regard to deterrence and clearly demonstrated its view on the significance 
of  the  risks  posed  by  the  Draft  Decision338.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  the  objection  to  be 
“reasoned”.  

188. 

The EDPB is not swayed by Meta IE’s submission that the objection at issue is neither relevant, 
nor reasoned. In this regard, Meta IE failed to explain why the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR is not 
met in relation to this specific objection339. In addition, the EDPB recalls that the assessment of the 
merits340 of the objection is made separately, after it has been established that the objection satisfies 
the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR341.

risk (Meta IE Article 65 submissions, Annex A, p. 45, subparagraph ‘sixth’), no further reasoning in this respect 
was provided in Meta IE’s submissions. The EDPB notes that Meta IE’s reasoning in Meta IE Article 65 Submissions 
(paragraphs 8-10, 95-102 and Annex A, p. 43-45) relating to the DE SAs objection under sub-section “Objections 
in  relation  to  the  calculation  of  the  administrative  fines”  mostly  concerned  the  merits  of  the  objection,  i.e.

Considering  the  above,  the  EDPB  finds  that  the  DE  SA  objection,  insofar  it  concerns  the 
determination of the administrative fine, is a “relevant and reasoned” objection in accordance with 
Article 4(24) GDPR. 

*** 

190. 

With regard to the NO SA objection on the imposition of an administrative fine in relation to 
the findings on Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR on the contact information processing, the EDPB 
recalls that it is “relevant and reasoned” in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR342. On the contrary, the 
relevant parts of the objections of the IT and FR SAs on the specific matter of an administrative fine 
for the additional infringement do not meet the threshold under Article 4(24) GDPR, as analysed by 
the EDPB in section 5.4.1 of this Binding Decision343. 

7.4.2.  Assessment on the merits 

191. 

The EDPB recalls that the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent 
application  of  administrative  fines344:  where  a  relevant  and  reasoned  objection  challenges  the 
elements relied upon by the LSA to calculate the amount of the fine, the EDPB can instruct the LSA to 
engage in a new calculation of the proposed fine by eliminating the shortcomings in the establishment 
of causal links between the facts at issue and the way the proposed fine was calculated on the basis 
of the criteria in Article 83 GDPR  and of the common standards established by the EDPB345. A fine 
should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, as required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account 
of the facts of the case346. In addition, when deciding on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into 
consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.  

7.4.2.1. Preliminary matters: the relevant year for the turnover  

192. 

The DE SAs contested the turnover figure cited in the Draft Decision. Though the IE SA deemed 
the objection not relevant and/or not reasoned, in the Composite Response the IE SA agreed with the 
DE SAs on the determination of the year of the turnover when calculating the administrative fine347.  

193. 

On the notion of “preceding financial year”, the EDPB recalls the decision taken in its Binding 
Decision 1/2021348 and takes note of the IE SAs intention349 to take the same approach in the current 
case.  

194. 

The EDPB agrees with the approach taken by the IE SA for the present case to include in the 
Draft  Decision  a  provisional  turnover  figure  based  on  the  most  up  to  date  financial  information 
available at the time of circulation to the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. The EDPB recalls that 
when issuing its final decision in accordance with Article 65(6) GDPR, the IE SA shall take into account 
the undertaking’s annual turnover corresponding to the financial year preceding the date of its final 
decision, i.e. the turnover of Meta Platforms Inc. in 2021.

7.4.2.2. The application of the criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR 
a. The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)  

195. 

Article 83(2) GDPR considers, among the factors to be taken into account when deciding the 
imposition  and  amount  of  an  administrative  fine,  “the  intentional  or  negligent  character  of  the 
infringement”.  In  the  same  sense,  Recital  148  GDPR  states  that  “[i]n  order  to  strengthen  the 
enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines should be imposed 
for any infringement of this Regulation [...]. Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity 
and  duration  of  the  infringement,  the  intentional  character  of  the  infringement,  actions  taken  to 
mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility [...]” (emphasis added). 

196. 

The  characterisation  of  the  infringement  as  intentional  or  negligent  may  therefore  have  a 
direct impact on the amount of the fine proposed. The main elements to be taken into account in this 
regard  were  already  established  in  the  WP29  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines,  endorsed  by  the 
EDPB. The EDPB Guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR350 rely heavily 
on the WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines in this respect.  

197. 

As  the  EDPB  recalls  in  its  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines,  “intentional  infringements, 
demonstrating contempt for the provisions of the law, are more severe than unintentional ones”351 and 
therefore, the supervisory authority is likely to attribute weight to this circumstance. This is likely to 
warrant the application of a (higher) fine.  

198. 

As the IE SA noted in the Draft Decision, “the GDPR does not identify the factors that need to 
be present in order for an infringement to be classified as either ‘intentional’ or ‘negligent’”352. The 
EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, quoting the WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, refer 
to  the  fact  that  “in  general,  ‘intent’  includes  both  knowledge  and  wilfulness  in  relation  to  the 
characteristics of an offence, whereas ‘unintentional’ means that there was no intention to cause the 
infringement  although  the  controller/processor  breached  the  duty  of  care  which  is  required  in  the 
law”353.  In  other  words,  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines  confirm  that  there  are  two 
cumulative  elements  on  the  basis  of  which  an  infringement  can  be  considered  intentional:  the 
knowledge of the breach and the wilfulness in relation to such act. On the other hand, an infringement 
is “unintentional” when there was a breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused 
the infringement. The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the 
aim to infringe the GDPR354. 

199. 

The characterisation of an infringement as intentional or negligent shall be done on the basis 
of  objective  elements  of  conduct  gathered  from  the  facts  of  the  case355.  The  EDPB  Guidelines  on 
Administrative Fines refer to some examples of conduct that may demonstrate the existence of intent 
and negligence356. It is worth noting the broader approach adopted with respect to the concept of 
negligence, since it also encompasses situations in which the controller or processor has failed to adopt

the  required  policies,  which  presumes  a  certain  degree  of  knowledge  about  a  potential 
infringement357. 

200. 

In this case, the IE SA considered that the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR with regard to 
the contact information processing and with regard to the public-by-default processing were negligent 
as they fell “short of the standard required”358. Regarding the public-by-default processing, the IE SA 
took into consideration that at the relevant time, the information that the accounts were public by 
default and on how to switch to a private account was available in several sources and hyperlinked in 
the Data Policy. The IE SA considered that these objective elements suggested an intention to provide 
the  information  with  clarity  and  transparency359.  Considering  this,  the  IE  SA  concluded  that  the 
infringement was not intentional, even though Meta IE should have been aware that the information 
provided was not clear and transparent enough. Consequently, the IE SA considered that Meta IE was 
negligent360. Likewise, with respect to the contact information processing, the IE SA considered that 
the  language  used  did  not  suggest  a  deliberate  attempt  from  Meta  IE  to  avoid  its  transparency 
obligations361. Considering this, the IE SA concluded that the infringement was not intentional, but it 
considered it negligent since Meta IE should have been aware that the way in which the information 
was provided did not meet the standards362.   

201. 

It  stems  from  the  above  that  Meta  IE  had  (or  should  have  had)  knowledge  about  the 
infringement  of  Article  12(1)  GDPR.  However,  this  mere  element  is  not  sufficient  to  consider  an 
infringement  intentional,  as  stated  above,  since  the  “aim”  or  “wilfulness”  of  the  action  should  be 
demonstrated.  In  this  respect,  the  IE  SA  has  not  found  out  that  Meta  IE  wilfully  disregarded  its 
obligations.   

202. 

In this regard, the DE SAs argued that Meta IE had enough resources to identify the problem 
beforehand, and that it wilfully decided on the content of the switching process, using a language that 
was excessively general363. The DE SAs considered that Meta IE was in fact aware of the problem given 
that the information was provided in the Instagram Help Centre and other ancillary sources. Therefore, 
the DE SAs was of the view that Meta IE acted at least with “reckless disregard for the infringement”364. 
The DE SAs also argued that the level of care required must be determined taking into account the 
size, economic activities and data processing processes of the company365.  

203. 

The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply 
having the “will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the  EDPB and 
WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the “wilfulness” are considered 
two  distinctive  elements  of  the  intentionality366.  While  it  may  prove  difficult  to  demonstrate  a 

                                                           
357  The  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines,  paragraph  56  (Example  4)  quote  the  WP29  Guidelines  on 
Administrative Fines, which mention, among the circumstances indicative of negligence, “failure to adopt policies 
(rather than simply failure to apply them)”. This provides an indication that non-compliance in situations in which 
the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential breach (in the example provided, due to the 
lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence.

subjective  element  such  as  the  “will”  to  act  in  a certain  manner, there  need  to  be  some  objective 
elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality367.  

204. 

The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act 
intentional. In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious 
negligence”, rather than “intentionality” when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the 
duty of care which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, 
abilities and individual situation”368. In this regard, the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the 
processing  of  personal  data  is  at  the  core  of  its  business  activities  is  expected  to  have  sufficient 
measures in place for the safeguard of personal data369: this does not, however, per se change the 
nature of the infringement from negligent to intentional.  

205. 

It shall be underlined that, in the context of the assessment of Article 83(2)(c) GDPR, the IE SA 
noted that the provision of the information in the Instagram Help Centre and other ancillary sources, 
hyperlinked in the Data Policy, suggested that Meta IE did not intentionally intend to “deny child users 
of  Instagram  an  understanding  of  the  purposes  of  the  processing”370,  with  regard  to  the  public  by 
default  processing.  Regarding  the  contact  information  processing, the  IE  SA  considered  that  “older 
Instagram users may have understood the consequences of providing their contact information” and 
that  the  language  used “does  not  suggest  a  deliberate  attempt  on  the  part  of  Meta  IE  to  avoid  its 
obligations”371.  The  EDPB  notes  that,  with  respect  to  the  contact  information  processing,  the 
assessment  carried  out  by  the  IE  SA  is  general  and  could  have  been  more  nuanced  and  detailed. 
However, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA that the objective elements of the case would indicate the 
absence of wilfulness to act in breach of the law with regard to the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR. 
Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE 
to act in breach of the law as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent its 
legal obligations. 

206. 

Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the DE SAs fail to provide 
objective elements that indicate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB 
is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to be changed with respect to the findings on the 
character of the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR.  

b. Other aggravating factors - relevance of the infringement of Article 24(1) GDPR  

207. 

Article  83(2)(k)  GDPR  gives  the  supervisory  authority  room  to  take  into  account  any  other 
aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, in order to ensure that 
the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case372. The provision 
is open-ended and it entails that the socio-economic, legal and market contexts in which the controller 
or processor operates should be taken into account373.

208. 

In this regard, the DE SAs considered that, even though the infringement of Article 24 GDPR is 
not subject to the possibility of imposing an administrative fine, because it is not listed in Article 83(4)-
(6) GDPR, it should have been considered as an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, since 
it is part of the assessment of the legal context in which Meta IE operates374.  

209. 

The EDPB firstly notes the reference to other infringements in Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, which 
states that when considering whether to impose a fine and its amount, due regard should be given to 
“any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor”. However, the provision deals with 
previous  infringements,  but  does  not  make  any  reference  to  other  current  infringements  as 
aggravating factors. 

210. 

In this respect, the IE SA disagreed with the DE SAs and considered that Article 83(2)(k) GDPR 
does not aim at being a “catch all provision” but at requiring the LSA “to account for any special loss 
or damage which arose due to the conduct (or omission) of the controller”375.   

211. 

The EDPB disagrees with the IE SA on the nature of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR and underlines that 
this open-ended provision aims at ensuring that the considerations regarding the context (be it the 
socio-economic, legal, or market context) in which the controller or processor operates are taken into 
account, so as to impose a fine that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. At the same time, the 
EDPB  agrees  with  the  IE  SA  that  the  infringement  of  Article  24  GDPR  cannot  be  considered  an 
aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. In this respect, the EDPB notes that it seems to be a 
conscious choice by the legislator not to subject infringements of that provision to administrative fines 
under  the  GDPR376.  If  such  infringements  were  taken  into  account  under  Article  83(2)(k)  GDPR, 
infringements of Article 24 GDPR would indirectly be subject to an administrative fine, despite the fact 
that the co-legislators did not provide for the possibility of sanctioning this infringement by means of 
an administrative fine.  

212. 

The EDPB also notes that, albeit not subject to an administrative fine, infringements of Article 
24 GDPR can be subject to other corrective powers of the SA as per Article 58(2) GDPR or to other 
penalties, as established in Article 84 GDPR.  

213. 

Finally,  the  EDPB  emphasises  that  Article  24  GDPR  is  an  expression  of  the  accountability 
principle enshrined in Article 5(2) GDPR. In this respect, the accountability of the controller is taken 
into account by the supervisory authorities when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine 
and its amount, since Article 83(2) GDPR includes several provisions in that regard377.  

7.4.2.3. The effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness of the administrative fine 
a. Weighing of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement  

214. 

As explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from 
the infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. The EDPB 
considers this provision “of fundamental importance for adjusting the amount of the fine to the specific 
case” and that “it should be interpreted as an instance of the principle of fairness and justice applied 
to the individual case”378.

375 Composite Response, section 2.f.iii. 
376 Earlier draft versions of the proposal for the GDPR had included Article 24 GDPR among the provisions subject 
to administrative fines, but this was eventually removed in the version of the GDPR agreed by the co-legislators.

215. 

The scope of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR should include all the reasoned considerations regarding 
the socio-economic, legal and market contexts in which the controller or processor operates379. When 
taking account of these considerations, the supervisory authorities must “assess all the facts of the 
case in a manner that is consistent and objectively justified”380. Therefore, financial benefits from the 
infringement  could  be  an  aggravating  circumstance  if  the  case  provides  information  about  profit 
obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR381. 

216. 

The aim of Article 83(2)(k) is to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive  in  each  individual  case382.  With  regard  to  the  financial  benefits  obtained  from  the 
infringement,  the  EDPB  considers  that  when  there  is  a  benefit,  the  sanction  should  aim  at 
“counterbalancing  the  gains  from  the  infringement”  while  keeping  an  effective,  dissuasive  and 
proportionate fine383.  

217. 

The financial benefit obtained by Meta IE was considered by the IE SA in the Draft Decision 
with  regard  to  Finding  1  (i.e.  the  infringement  of  Article  12(1)  GDPR  for  the  public-by-default 
processing384).  In  particular,  the  IE  SA  considered  that  “the  objective  of  switching  new  accounts  to 
‘public’  was  clearly  also  intended  to  drive  the  creation  of  more  public  user-generated  content  for 
consumption, increasing engagement and creating favourable commercial conditions for the sale of 
targeted advertising by [Meta IE]”385 and, therefore, the IE SA concluded that Meta IE benefited from 
the infringement and considered this an aggravating factor386.  

218. 

In this respect, the DE SAs considered that the IE SA did not properly weigh this factor, since 
the fine proposed in the Draft Decision for the infringement of Article 12(1) GDPR was less than the 
DE SAs’ estimation of the financial benefit obtained with the infringement. The DE SAs engaged in a 
very detailed calculation to justify the estimation of the benefit, although they acknowledged that it 
was based on assumptions387. 

219. 

The relevance of the financial benefit gained with the infringement for the calculation of the 
fine amount has been addressed by the CJEU in competition law cases. In fact, the CJEU has stated 
that  the  benefits  obtained  from  the  infringement  are  among  the  factors  that  may  be  taken  into 
account in order to determine the amount of the fine, but there is no obligation to ensure that the 
fine is directly proportional to the benefits achieved by that undertaking or “that it does not exceed 
those  profits”388.  Nonetheless,  the  CJEU  has  made  clear  that  the  amount  of  the  fine  must  be 
proportionate  to  “the  duration  of  the  infringement  and  the  other  factors  capable  of  affecting  the 
assessment of the gravity of the infringement, including the profit that it was able to derive from those 
practices”389. In fact, the CJEU has clearly accepted that the amount of the fine can be increased on

the basis of the financial benefit obtained with the infringement, in order to reinforce the deterrent 
effect of such fine390. It is an accepted practice in EU competition law to increase the amount of the 
fine in order to exceed the amount of the gain obtained as a result of the infringement, where it is 
possible to estimate that amount391.  

220. 

Considering the need to have fines that are effective, proportionate and deterrent, and in light 
of common accepted practice in the field of EU competition law, which inspired the fining framework 
under the GDPR, the EDPB is of the view that, when calculating the administrative fine, the supervisory 
authority  could  take  account  of  the  financial  benefits  obtained  from  the  infringement,  in  order  to 
impose a fine that exceeds that amount.   

221. 

In the present case, the IE SA has explicitly considered the financial benefits obtained from the 
infringement  as  an  aggravating  factor.  However,  the  IE  SA  has  not  provided  any  estimation  of  the 
amount gained by Meta IE with the specific infringement and the DE SAs’ calculation is still largely 
based on assumptions. Due to this, the EDPB does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate 
the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.     

222. 

Therefore, the EDPB considers that it does not have objective elements to conclude whether 
the fine envisaged in relation to Finding 1 takes sufficient account of the  financial benefit obtained 
from the infringement and, therefore, has a deterrent effect.  

223. 

Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect 
if they are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB 
considers that the IE SA should have elaborated in more detail the weight given to this element in 
paragraphs 563, 564 and 567 of its Draft Decision. Therefore, the EDPB requests the IE SA to further 
elaborate  its  reasoning  on  this  aspect  and,  if  further  estimation  of  the  financial  benefit  from  the 
infringement  is  possible  in  this  case  and  results  in  the  need  to  increase  the  amount  of  the  fine 
proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.   

b. Weighing of other criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR and assessment of the fine in light of Article 

83(1) GDPR 

224. 

In its objection, the DE SAs claimed that the elements of Article 83(2) GDPR were not weighed 
correctly  by  the  LSA  when  calculating  the  administrative  fines  in  the  present  case,  in  light  of  the 
requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR. The DE SAs argued that the mitigating circumstances were few, 
therefore a fine in the upper range of the possible level would be expected. Also, according to the DE 
SAs, the amount of the proposed fines did not reflect the nature and gravity of the infringements, in 
particular, when it comes to the seriousness of the infringements, in light of the number and sensitivity 
of the data subjects (children) affected392. Furthermore, the DE SAs argued that the proposed fines 
were  ineffective,  disproportionate  and  non-dissuasive  and  they  provided  for  neither  special,  nor 
general preventive effect, especially considering the total profit and the total turnover of the specific 
undertaking393.

225. 

In this regard, the EDPB notes that the Draft Decision contained an assessment by the IE SA on 
the different elements in relation to each infringement394. The EDPB further notes that in the Draft 
Decision the IE SA explained why it considered the proposed fines to be effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive in relation to each infringement, taking into account all the circumstances of  the IE SA’s 
inquiry395. Finally, the EDPB observes the differences in the level of ranges of the envisaged fines by 
the IE SA, where the higher ranges are envisaged for the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR regarding 
both  the  public-by-default  processing  and  the  contact  information  processing,  as  well  as  for  the 
infringements of Article 35(1) GDPR regarding both the public-by-default processing and the contact 
information processing compared to the envisaged fines for the remaining infringements396. 

226. 

The EDPB takes note of the position of Meta IE that the fines set out in the Draft Decision are 
excessive and disproportionate and therefore any objections aiming to increase the quantum of fines 
are not compatible with Article 83 GDPR397. According to Meta IE, any calls by the objections to further 
increase  the  proposed  fines  would  need  to  be  supported  by  compelling  evidence  of  a  serious  and 
intentional infringement and consequential harm, however, no such evidence was ever provided by 
the LSA or the CSAs398. Furthermore, according to Meta IE, Article 83(2) GDPR does not identify annual 
profit as a factor to which the LSA should have regard in calculating the amount of the administrative 
fine  and  selecting  one  percent  of  annual  profit  would  be  arbitrary,  punitive  and  undermining  the 
discretion and independence of the LSA in making its fine assessment399. Also, it is the view of Meta IE 
that there is no basis in the  GDPR  for concluding that  the amount of the fine must have  a general 
preventive effect400. 

227. 

The EDPB reiterates that it is incumbent upon the supervisory authorities to verify whether the 
amount  of  the  envisaged  fines  meets  the  requirements  of  effectiveness,  proportionality  and 
dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety 
of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple 
infringements, 
increases  and  decreases  for  aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances  and 
financial/socio-economic circumstances401. Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is not an 
arithmetically precise exercise402, and supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in 
this respect403. 

228. 

The EDPB recalls that, when determining whether a fine fulfils the requirements of Article 83(1) 
GDPR, due account must be given to the elements identified on the basis of Article 83(2) GDPR404. In

the present case, the EDPB notes that in the Draft Decision the LSA considered all the infringements 
as serious in nature405, and that the gravity of infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR in respect of both 
the public-by-default processing and the contact information processing was highly serious, the gravity 
of the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR regarding the contact information processing was serious 
and  that  the  gravity  of  the  infringements  of  Articles  35(1),  24(1),  25(1),  5(1)(c)  and  25(2)  GDPR  in 
respect  of  both  the  public-by-default  processing  and  the  contact  information  processing  was 
serious406.  Furthermore,  the  EDPB  underlines  that,  as  established  by  the  IE  SA,  each  infringement 
related to processing of personal data of a significant number of vulnerable individuals (children) and 
related  to  significant  damage  to  those  vulnerable  individuals407.  The  EDPB  also  observes  that  each 
infringement  carried  either  an  intentional  or  negligent  character408.  In  addition,  the  IE  SA  did  not 
attribute significant weight to any mitigating factor409.  

229. 

The EDPB reiterates that all these elements need to be given due regard when determining 
the  proportionality of  the fine.  In other  words,  a  fine  must  reflect  the  gravity of the  infringement, 
taking into account all the elements that may lead to an increase (aggravating factors) or decrease of 
the amount (mitigating factors). The EDPB further assesses in the following paragraphs whether the 
envisaged  fines  in  the  Draft  Decision  meet  the  requirement  of  being  effective,  proportionate  and 
dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR.  

230. 

In  its  objection,  the  DE  SAs  argued  that  the  proposed  fines,  which  were  well  below  the 
envisaged maximum under Article 83 GDPR, would be insignificant to Meta IE, considering the global 
turnover of the undertaking, and they would be neither effective, nor sufficiently dissuasive410.  

231. 

The EDPB takes note that in its objection, the DE SAs also requested the IE SA to additionally 
consider  the  annual  profit  of  the  undertaking  at  hand  in  its  assessment  under  Article  83  GDPR411. 
Regarding  this  specific  issue,  the  EDPB  recalls  that,  when  it  comes  to  the  determination  of 
administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR, this determination is to be based on the total worldwide 
annual turnover of the undertaking, which  “gives an indication, albeit approximate and imperfect, of 
the size of the undertaking and of its economic power”412. Therefore, the EDPB does not find that in 
the case at hand the LSA should be requested to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the 
annual  profit  of  the  undertaking.  At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  reiterates  that  the  imposition  of  an 
appropriate fine cannot be the result of a simple calculation based on the total turnover413 and that as 
stated above all the circumstances of the specific case have to be considered in order to assess if the 
administrative fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive as required by Article 83(1) GDPR. 

232. 

With regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the 
corrective  measure  chosen  can  be  to  re-establish  compliance  with  the  rules  or  to  punish  unlawful 
behaviour (or both)414. In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive

penalty is one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between 
general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and 
specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement 
again)415. Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages 
both  the  controller  or  processor  concerned  as  well  as  other  controllers  or  processors  carrying  out 
similar processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct, while not going 
beyond what is necessary to attain that objective416. In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s 
views that there is no basis to conclude that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive 
effect417.  

233. 

Moreover, the size of the undertaking concerned and its financial capacity418 are elements that 
should  be  taken  into  account  in  the  calculation  of  the  amount  of  the  fine  in  order  to  ensure  its 
dissuasive  nature419.  Taking  into  consideration  the  size  and  global  resources  of  the  undertaking  in 
question is justified by the impact sought on the undertaking concerned, in order to ensure that the 
fine has sufficient deterrent effect, given that the fine must not be negligible in the light, particularly, 
of its financial capacity420. The EDPB recalls that a fine to be imposed on an undertaking may need to 
be  increased  to  take  into  account  a  particularly  large  turnover  of  the  undertaking,  so  the  fine  is 
sufficiently dissuasive421. In this respect, the EDPB further notes that in order to ensure a sufficiently 
deterrent  effect,  the  global  turnover  of  the  undertaking  can  be  considered  also  in  light  of  the 
undertaking’s ability to raise the necessary funds to pay its fine422. 

234. 

The EDPB takes note of the IE SA’s determination on the administrative fines in the present 
case423  and  of  the  proposed  amounts  of  the  fines  in  the  Draft  Decision424.  While,  in  this  Binding 
Decision, the EDPB does not address as such the use of fine ranges in draft decisions, it notes that the 
proposed ranges in the Draft Decision in the case at hand are wide425.

ECLI:EU:C:2014:2153), paragraph 85; C-413/08 P Lafarge, paragraph 104. In addition, the EDPB recalls that in 
some circumstances the imposition of a deterrence multiplier can be justified and that the exceptional financial 
capacity  of  an  undertaking  may  be  one  such  circumstance  (see  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines, 
paragraph  144;  and  Showa  Denko  v  Commission  (C-289/04  P,  judgement  delivered  on  29  June  2006, 
ECLI:EU:C:2006:431), paragraphs 29, 36-38). 
421  The  same  approach  is  suggested  in  the  European  Commission  Guidelines  on  the  method  of  setting  fines 
imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003, C210/02, 1.9.2006, paragraph 30.

423 See section 7.1 of this Binding Decision. 
424 Draft Decision, paragraphs 569 and 627. 
425  Draft Decision, paragraph 627(3).  Specifically, on the basis of the LSA’s findings in the Draft Decision, the 
following fine amount ranges were envisaged in respect of the infringements:  

1)  For the infringement of Art. 12(1) GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 1), a fine of 

between EUR 55 million and 100 million;  

Adopted 

 

61 

 

235. 

Taking into account the serious nature and gravity of the infringements, their duration, and 
that each of the infringements related specifically to children’s personal data, as well as the economic 
power and the global resources of the undertaking, the EDPB considers that in the present case each 
fine  should  fall  within  the  higher  segment  of  the  envisaged  fine  amount  ranges,  in  order  to  be 
sufficiently effective and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR.  

236. 

The EDPB therefore asks the IE SA to ensure that the final amount of the administrative fines 

in the IE SA’s final decision meets the requirements of Article 83(1) GDPR. 

7.4.2.4. Administrative fine for the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR 

237. 

The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the additional infringement of Article 
6(1)  GDPR  regarding  the  contact  information  processing426.  The  EDPB  also  recalls  that  the  NO  SA 
requested the IE SA to impose an administrative fine for this additional infringement427. 

238. 

The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that, even if an infringement is found, no additional 
fine is warranted given the significance of other administrative fines already imposed for the same 
processing. Moreover, Meta IE claimed that any additional fine would disregard Meta IE’s cooperation 
and mitigation efforts and would further make the totality of the administrative fine disproportionate 
and punitive428.  

239. 

The  EDPB  however  agrees  with  the  reasoning  of  the  NO  SA  in  its  objection429.  The  EDPB 
reiterates that lawfulness of processing is one of the fundamental pillars of the data protection law 
and considers that processing of personal data without a legal basis is a clear violation of the data 
subjects’ fundamental right to data protection430. Taking into account the nature and gravity of the 
infringement in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that an administrative fine 
should be imposed for this infringement. In this respect, the EDPB recalls that the infringement at issue 
relates to the processing of personal data of a significant number431 of children and that the level of 
damage  affecting  them432  has  to  be  considered.  Further,  the  EDPB  notes  that  the  identified 
                                                           

2)  For the infringement of Art. 12(1) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 2), a fine 

of between EUR 46 million and 75 million;  

3)  For the infringement Art. 5(1)(a) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 4), a fine 

of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

4)  For the infringement of Art. 35(1) GDPR regarding the contact information processing (Finding 5), a fine 

5) 

of between EUR 28 million and 45 million;  
Infringement  of  Art.  35(1)  GDPR  regarding  the  public-by-default  processing  (Finding  6),  a  fine  of 
between EUR 28 million and 45 million;  

6)  For  the  infringement  of  Art.  5(1)(c)  and  25(2)  GDPR  regarding  the  contact  information  processing 

(Finding 7), a fine of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

7)  For  the  infringement  Art.  25(1)  regarding  the  contact  information  processing  (Finding  8),  a  fine  of 

between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

8)  For the infringement Art. 5(1)(c) and 25(2)  GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 

10), a fine of between EUR 9 million and 28 million;  

9)  For the infringement of Art. 25(1) GDPR regarding the public-by-default processing (Finding 11), a fine 

of between EUR 9 million and 28 million.

infringement lasted at least from 25 May 2018 until the commencement of the IE SA’s inquiry in the 
present case on 21 September 2020433. Finally, the EDPB takes note of the position of the IE SA in the 
Draft Decision that administrative fines in respect of each of the other infringements envisaged in the 
Draft  Decision,  relating  to  the  contact  information  processing,  are  appropriate,  necessary  and 
proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with the GDPR434.  

240. 

Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to consider the identified infringement of Article 6(1) 
GDPR  in  its  determination  on  the  administrative  fines,  by  imposing  a  fine  for  the  additional 
infringement, which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) 
GDPR. 

8  BINDING DECISION 

241. 

In light of the above and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR 
to issue binding decisions pursuant to Article 65 GDPR, the EDPB issues the following binding decision 
in accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR:  

242. 

On the objections concerning legal basis for the contact information processing: 

1.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE SAs, FI SA, FR SA, IT SA, NL SA and NO SA regarding 
Meta  IE’s  reliance  on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  and  alternatively  Article  6(1)(f)  GDPR,  meet  the 
requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

2.  The EDPB finds that the objection of the NO SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine 
for the proposed additional infringement, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. On the 
contrary, the EDPB decides that the relevant parts of the objections of the FR SA and IT SA on the 
specific matter relating to an administrative fine for the additional infringement do not meet the 
threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

3.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision that there has been an infringement of 

Article 6(1) GDPR, on the basis of the conclusion reached by the EDPB in this Binding Decision.  

4.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to consider the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR in the 
compliance order, to the extent that the processing is ongoing, in order to ensure that full effect 
is given to Meta IE’s obligations under Article 6(1) GDPR. 

243. 

On the objections relating to the possible further (or alternative) infringements of the GDPR 

identified by the CSAs: 

5.  With regard to the objection by the DE SAs concerning the possible additional infringements of 
Article 6(1)(a), Article 7 and Article 8(1) GDPR in relation to the contact information processing, 
the  EDPB  decides  this  objection  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  Article  4(24)  GDPR  and, 
therefore, the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard. 

6.  With regard to the objection by the DE SAs concerning the possible additional infringements of 
Article 5(1)(a) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR in relation to the contact information processing, the EDPB 
decides this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR and, therefore, the 
IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard.

7.  With  regard to  the  objection  by the  NO  SA  concerning  the  legal  basis  for  the public-by-default 
processing, the EDPB decides this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR 
and, therefore, the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard. 

244. 

On the objections concerning the administrative fine: 

8.  The EDPB decides that the DE SAs objection regarding the calculation of the administrative fine 

meets the requirement of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

9. 

In relation to consideration of the infringement of Article 24 GDPR under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR as 
proposed in the DE SAs objection, the EDPB does not find that the infringement of Article 24 GDPR 
can be considered an aggravating factor under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR and, therefore, the IE SA is 
not required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard. 

10. In relation to intentionality under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the arguments 
put forward by the DE SAs in their objection fail to provide objective elements that indicate the 
intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the IE SA is not required to amend its Draft 
Decision with respect to the findings on the character of the infringements of Article 12(1) GDPR. 

11. Regarding the relevance of profit of the undertaking as argued in the DE SA objection, the EDPB 
finds that in the present case the IE SA does not have to amend its Draft Decision to additionally 
consider the annual profit of the undertaking pursuant to Article 83 GDPR. 

12. The  EDPB  instructs  the  IE  SA  to  re-assess  its  envisaged  corrective  measure  in  terms  of  the 

administrative fine in accordance with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR, namely: 

12.1.  to further elaborate its reasoning concerning the weight given to the financial benefit 
obtained by Meta IE from the infringement referred to in Finding 1 of the Draft Decision 
and, if further estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement is possible in 
this case and results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB 
requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.   

12.2.  to ensure that the final amounts of the administrative fines are effective, proportionate 

and dissuasive. 

12.3.  to consider the identified infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR in the IE SA’s determination 
on  the  administrative  fines  and  impose  an  administrative  fine  for  the  additional 
infringement, which is effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
