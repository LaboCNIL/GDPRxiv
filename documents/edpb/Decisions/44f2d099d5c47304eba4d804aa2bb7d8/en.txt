The European Data Protection Board 

Having  regard  to  Article 63  and  Article 65(1)(a)  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC 
(hereinafter “GDPR”)1, 

Having regard to the  European Economic Area (hereinafter “EEA”) Agreement and in particular to 
Annex  XI  and  Protocol  37  thereof,  as  amended  by  the  Decision  of  the  EEA  joint  Committee  No 
154/2018 of 6 July 20182, 

Having regard to Article 11 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure (hereinafter “EDPB RoP”)3, 

Whereas: 

(1) The main role of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter the “EDPB”) is to ensure the 
consistent application of the GDPR throughout the EEA. To this effect, it follows from Article 60 GDPR 
that  the  lead  supervisory  authority  (hereinafter  “LSA”)  shall  cooperate  with  the  other  supervisory 
authorities concerned (hereinafter “CSAs”) in an endeavour to reach consensus, that the LSA and CSAs 
shall  exchange  all  relevant  information  with  each  other,  and  that  the  LSA  shall,  without  delay, 
communicate the relevant information on the matter to the other supervisory authorities concerned. 
The LSA shall without delay submit a Draft Decision to the other CSAs for their opinion and take due 
account of their views. 

(2)  Where  any  of  the  CSAs  expressed  a  reasoned  and  relevant  objection  on  the  Draft  Decision  in 
accordance with Article 4(24) and Article 60(4) GDPR and the LSA does not intend to follow the RRO 
or considers that the objection is not reasoned and relevant, the LSA shall submit this matter to the 
consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 GDPR. 

(3)  Pursuant  to  Article 65(1)(a) GDPR,  the  EDPB  shall  issue  a  binding  decision  concerning  all  the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is 
an infringement of the GDPR.  

(4) The binding decision of the EDPB shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the 
EDPB, pursuant to Article 65(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) EDPB RoP, within one month 
after the  Chair of the  EDPB and the competent supervisory  authority have  decided that the  file  is 
complete. The deadline may be extended by a further month, taking into account the complexity of 
the subject matter upon decision of the Chair of the EDPB on own initiative or at the request of at 
least one third of the members of the EDPB. 

(5) In accordance with Article 65(3) GDPR, if, in spite of such an extension, the EDPB has not been able 
to adopt a decision within the timeframe, it shall do so within two weeks following the expiration of 
the extension by a simple majority of its members. 

(6) In accordance with Article 11(6) EDPB RoP, only the English text of the decision is authentic as it is 
the language of the EDPB adoption procedure.

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING BINDING DECISION 

1  SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE 

1. 

2. 

3. 

This  document  contains  a  binding  decision  adopted  by  the  EDPB 
in  accordance  with 
Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. The decision concerns the dispute arisen following a Draft Decision (hereinafter 
“Draft Decision”) issued by the Irish supervisory authority (“Data Protection Commission”, hereinafter 
the “IE SA”, also referred to in this context as the “LSA”) and the subsequent objections expressed by 
a  number  of  CSAs  (“Österreichische  Datenschutzbehörde”  hereinafter  the  “AT  SA”;  “Der 
Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit” also on behalf of other German 
SAs4, hereinafter the “DE SAs”; “Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman”, hereinafter the “FI SA”; 
“Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés", hereinafter the “FR SA”; “Garante per la 
protezione dei dati personali", hereinafter the “IT SA”; “Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens”, hereinafter the 
“NL SA” ; “Datatilsynet”, hereinafter the “NO SA”; “Urząd Ochrony Danych Osobowych”, hereinafter 
the  “PL  SA”;  “Comissão  Nacional  de  Proteção  de  Dados”,  hereinafter  the  “PT  SA”;  and 
“Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten”, hereinafter the “SE SA” ).  

The Draft Decision at issue relates to a “complaint-based inquiry” which was commenced by the IE SA 
on  20  August  2018  into  the  Facebook  social  media  processing  activities  (hereinafter  “Facebook 
service”) of Facebook  Ireland Limited, a company established in Dublin, Ireland. The  company has 
subsequently changed its name to “Meta Platforms Ireland Limited” and hereinafter it is referred to 
as “Meta IE”. Any reference to Meta IE in this binding decision means a reference to either Facebook 
Ireland Limited or Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, as appropriate.  

The complaint was lodged on 25 May 2018 with the AT SA by a data subject who requested the non-
profit  NOYB  -  European  Center  for  Digital  Rights  (hereinafter,  “NOYB”)  to  represent  her  under 
Article 80(1) GDPR (both hereinafter referred to as the “Complainant”). The Complainant alleged a 
violation of the right to data protection and especially “a violation of Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the GDPR 
and Article 8 of the CFR [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU]”5, by arguing that the controller 
relied on a “forced consent”6. The Complainant articulated its requests into a request to investigate7, 
a request to find a violation of data subject rights8, and a request to impose corrective measures9.  

                                                             
4  Objections  raised  by  the  Hamburg  Commissioner  for  Data  Protection  and  Freedom  of  Information  also  on 
behalf of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision, the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection 
and Freedom of Information, the Brandenburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, 
the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the State Commissioner for Data 
Protection in Lower Saxony and the State Commissioner for Data Protection North Rhine-Westphalia. 
5 Complaint, paragraph 1.2  
6 Complaint, paragraph 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2. 
7 Within its request to investigate, the Complainant requested that a full investigation be made to determine 
“which processing operations the controller engages in, in relation to the personal data of the data subject”, “for 
which purpose they are performed”, “on which legal basis for each specific processing operation the controller 
relies on”, and to acquire “a copy of any records of processing activities”. The complaint also requested “that the 
results of this investigation [be] made available to [her]”. Complaint, paragraph 3.1.  
8 Complaint, paragraph 3.2. The specific rights that the Complainant mentions as violated are Art. 5, 6, 7 and 9 
GDPR and Art. 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, Complaint, paragraph 1.2. 
9 More specifically, the complaint requested in paragraph 3.3 that the SA “prohibits all processing operations 
that are based on an invalid consent of the data subject”, and in paragraph 3.4 that an “effective, proportionate 
and dissuasive fine” be imposed.

4. 

On 30 May 2018, the AT SA transferred the complaint to the IE SA. The IE SA stated in its “Schedule to 
the Draft Decision”10 that it was satisfied that the IE SA is the LSA, within the meaning of the GDPR, 
for  Meta  IE,  as  controller,  for  the  purpose  of  the  cross-border  processing  of  personal  data  in  the 
context of the Facebook service.

The scope and legal basis of the inquiry were set out in the notice of 
commencement of inquiry  that  the IE SA  sent to the parties  on 20 
August  2018.  The  IE  SA  commenced  the  inquiry  and  requested 
information from this date. 
Inquiry Report stage: 

 

 

the IE SA commenced work on the draft inquiry report; 
the IE SA prepared a draft inquiry report and issued it to Meta 
IE and to the Complainant to allow them to make submissions 
in relation to the draft inquiry report; 

  Meta  IE  provided  its  submissions  in  relation  to  the  draft 

inquiry report;  

  The Complainant provided its submissions in relation to the 

draft inquiry report;

and the Complainant. 

  The IE SA issued a letter to Meta IE and to the Complainant to

The  IE  SA  issued  a  Preliminary  Draft  Decision  (hereinafter  “the 
Preliminary Draft Decision”) (including a Schedule) to Meta IE and to 
the Complainant.  
The  Complainant  provided  submissions  on  the  Preliminary  Draft 
Decision to the IE SA (“Complainant’s Preliminary Draft Submissions 
dated 11 June 2021”11). 
Meta IE made submissions on the Preliminary Draft Decision to the IE 
SA (“Meta IE’s Preliminary Draft Submissions dated 16 June 2021”). 
The IE SA shared its Draft Decision with the CSAs in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR.

PT  SA  and  SE  SA)  raised  objections 
in  accordance  with 
Article 60(4) GDPR. 
The IE SA issued a Composite Response setting out its replies to such 
objections  and  shared  it  with  the  CSAs  (hereinafter,  “Composite

Response”).  The  IE  SA  requested  the  relevant  CSAs  to  confirm 
whether,  having  considered  the  IE  SA’s  position  in  relation  to  the 
objections as set out in the Composite Response, the CSAs intended 
to maintain their objections. 
In light of the arguments put forward by the IE SA in the Composite 
Response, the AT SA12, DE SAs13, NO SA14, IT SA15, FR SA16 and NL SA17), 
confirmed to the IE SA that they maintain their remaining objections.  
The  FI  SA  informed  the  IE  SA  of  their  decision  to  withdraw  their 
objection due to procedural reasons related to their objection18. 
The IE SA invited Meta IE to exercise its right to be heard in respect of 
the objections (and comments) that IE SA proposed to refer to the EDPB 
under Article 65(1) GDPR along with the IE SA’s Composite Response and 
the communications received from the CSAs in reply to the Composite 
Response.  
Meta  IE  furnished  the  requested  submissions  (“Meta IE  Article 65

The  IE  SA  triggered  the  dispute  resolution  process  in  the  Internal  Market  Information  system 
(hereinafter “IMI”)19 on 25 July 2022. 

Following the submission by the LSA of this matter to the EDPB in accordance with Article 60(4) GDPR, 
the  EDPB  Secretariat  assessed  the  completeness  of  the  file  on  behalf  of  the  Chair  in  line  with 
Article 11(2) EDPB RoP.  

The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA on 27 July 2022, asking for the transmission via IMI of the 
original  complaint  and  any  document  attached  thereto,  such  as  the  “Gallup  survey”  to  which  the 
Complainant referred in its submissions. The IE SA provided the original complaint and its attachments 
and confirmed that it had been shared with Meta IE. The IE SA also provided an updated version of 
the memorandum it had sent to the Secretariat20 with a revised schedule. These additional documents 
did  not  include  the  “Gallup  survey”,  which  the  IE  SA  explained  was  not  attached  to  the  original 
complaint,  but  was  provided  by  way  of  correspondence  dated  20  November  2019,  sent  by  the

that the IE SA wished to refer to the EDPB for assessment and determination pursuant to the Article 65(1)(a) 
GDPR procedure.

Complainant to the AT SA, for onward transmission to the IE SA. This occurred over one week after 
the Complainant’s representative provided its observations on the investigator’s Draft Inquiry Report. 

The EDPB Secretariat contacted the IE SA on 23 and 27 September 2022, asking for the transmission 
via IMI of specified documents pertaining to the investigation conducted by the IE SA21. The request 
was made to allow the EDPB to come to a fully informed decision on the objections raised by some 
CSAs on the scope and conduct of the investigation. From the schedule to the Draft Decision, the EDPB 
Secretariat concluded that both Meta IE and the Complainant were given access to the documents 
requested and invited the IE SA to confirm this was indeed the case. With regard to the request for 
the  “Gallup  survey”,  the  EDPB  Secretariat  pointed  out  that  Meta  IE  specifically  included  counter-
arguments to this document in its Article 65 submissions22.  

The IE SA declined the request, as it considers that the material already provided as sufficient to enable 
the EDPB to determine the objections referred to it, as the Draft Decision provides information about 
the scope of the inquiry commenced for the purpose of examining the complaint, the procedural steps 
taken in the inquiry, the information that was collected during the course of the inquiry process, the 
allegations that were put to the data controller, the submissions made by the parties to the inquiry 
and  the  assessments  and  views  of  the  IE  SA.  Further,  the  IE  SA  expressed  its  concern  over  the 
possibility of the EDPB concluding its decision on the basis of material which was never put to the 
controller concerned as part of the formulation of any allegation of potential wrongdoing. Finally, the 
IE  SA  underlined  that,  in  accordance  with  Article 11(2)  in  fine  EDPB  RoP  they  would  also  provide 
documents the Board deems necessary.  

11. 

The  EDPB  considers  the  “Gallup  study”  part  of  the  file.  The  Gallup  study  is  a  publicly  available 
document to which the Complainant refers in its letter to the EDPB and CSAs, which is part of the file 
submitted by the IE SA23. The Complainant had previously submitted it to the AT SA on 20 November 
2019 for onward transmission to the IE SA. Some CSAs refer to this document in their objections and 
Meta IE provides  counter  arguments to its findings and challenges  its reliability with a report (the 
“Vanhuele Report”) that Meta IE appends to Annex 2 of its pre-Article 65 submission24. 

 

                                                             
21 The following documents were requested:  
Draft Inquiry Report (DRI) of 28 June 2019;  
Meta IE's submissions of 28 July 2019 to the DRI;  
Letter from Meta IE to the IE SA of 25 May 2018 whereby Meta IE confirmed it was the controller for the data 
processing in the EU; 
Meta IE's submissions of 27 Sept 2018 on the complaint;  
IE SA letter to NOYB on scope of the inquiry of 23 Nov 2018;  
NOYB’s submissions of 3 Dec 2018 on scope and procedure;  
IE SA letter to NOYB of 16 Jan 2019 (refusal);  
IE SA letter to Meta IE on scope of 25 Jan 2019;

12.  A matter of particular importance that was scrutinised by the EDPB Secretariat was the right to be 
heard, as required by Article 41(2)(a) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Further details on this are 
provided in Section 2 of this Binding Decision.  

13.  On 5 October, the decision on the completeness of the file was taken, and it was circulated by the 

EDPB Secretariat to all the members of the EDPB. 

14. 

The Chair of the EDPB decided, in compliance with Article 65(3) GDPR in conjunction with Article 11(4) 
EDPB RoP, to extend the default timeline for adoption of one month by a further month on account 
of the complexity of the subject-matter. 

 

2  THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION 

15. 

16. 

The EDPB is subject to Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular Article 41 (right 
to good administration). This is also reflected in Article 11(1) EDPB RoP. Further details were provided 
in the EDPB Guidelines on Article 65(1)(a) GDPR25.  

The  EDPB  decision  “shall be  reasoned  and addressed  to  the  lead  supervisory authority  and all  the 
supervisory  authorities  concerned  and  binding  on  them”  (Article 65(2) GDPR).  It  is  not  aiming  to 
address directly any third party. However, as a precautionary measure to address the possible need 
for the EDPB to offer the right to be heard at EDPB level to Meta IE, the EDPB assessed if Meta IE was 
offered the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard in relation to the procedure led by the LSA 
and the subject matter of the dispute to be resolved by the EDPB. In particular, the EDPB assessed if 
all  the  documents  received  containing  the  matters  of  facts  and  law  used  by  the  EDPB  to  take  its 
decision in this procedure had been previously shared with Meta IE.  

17. 

The EDPB notes that Meta IE has received the opportunity to exercise its right to be heard regarding 
all the documents containing the matters of facts and of law considered by the EDPB in the context of 
this decision and provided its written observations26, which have been shared with the EDPB by the 
LSA.  

18.  Considering that Meta IE has been already heard by the IE SA on all matters of facts and law addressed 
by the  EDPB  in  its decision,  the  EDPB is satisfied that Article 41 of the  EU Charter of Fundamental 
Rights has been respected. 

19. 

The EDPB considers that the Complainant is not likely to be adversely affected by this binding decision, 
and consequently does not meet the conditions to be granted a right to be heard by the EDPB in line

3  CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTING A BINDING DECISION 

20. 

The general conditions for the adoption of a binding decision by the EDPB are set forth in Article 60(4) 
and Article 65(1)(a) GDPR27. 

3.1  Objection(s) expressed by several CSA(s) in relation to a Draft Decision 

21. 

The EDPB notes that several CSAs raised objections to the Draft Decision via IMI. The objections were 
raised pursuant to Article 60(4) GDPR. 

3.2  The IE SA finds the objections to the Draft Decision not relevant or reasoned and 

does not follow them 

22.  On 28 January 2022, the IE SA provided to the CSAs an analysis of the objections raised by the CSAs in 

the Composite Response.  

23. 

The IE SA concluded that it would not follow the objections, as it did not consider them relevant and/or 
reasoned, within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR for the reasons set out in the Composite Response 
and below. 

3.3  Admissibility of the case 

24. 

25. 

The case at issue fulfils, prima facie, all the elements listed by Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, since several CSAs 
raised objections to a Draft Decision of the IE SA within the deadline provided by Article 60(4) GDPR, 
and  the  IE  SA  has  not  followed  objections  or  rejected  them  for  being,  in its  view,  not  relevant  or 
reasoned.  

The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that the current Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution should 
be suspended in light of the IE SA’s ongoing inquiry on Meta IE’s legal basis for processing data for 
behavioural advertising28. Additionally, Meta IE argues such suspension would be appropriate due to 
pending preliminary ruling proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU (hereinafter, “CJEU”)29. 
Meta IE refers in particular to cases C-252/2130 and C-446/2131. Following its assessment, the EDPB 
decides to continue its proceedings on this Article 65 GDPR dispute resolution, as there is no explicit 
legal basis for a stay of the dispute resolution procedure in EU law, nor are existing CJEU rulings on 
the matter conclusive for the situation of the EDPB32. Also, the EDPB takes into consideration the data 

                                                             
27 According to Art. 65(1)(a) of the GDPR, the EDPB will issue a binding decision when a supervisory authority 
has raised a relevant and reasoned objection to a Draft Decision of the LSA and the LSA has not followed the 
objection or the LSA has rejected such an objection as being not relevant or reasoned.

the Court of Justice of 14 December 2000, Masterfoods, C-344/98, ECLI:EU:C:2000:689. These cases concerned 
proceedings before the national courts, where the parties faced the risk of being confronted with a conflicting 
decision of the national judge that could be seen as de facto nullifying the Commission decision – a power which 
is retained by the CJEU. The current dispute resolution procedure concerns the adoption of an administrative 
decision, which can be subject to full judicial review.

subjects’ right to have their complaints handled within a “reasonable period” (Article 57(1)(f) GDPR), 
and to have their case handled within a reasonable time by EU bodies (Article 41 Charter). Moreover, 
ultimately there are remedies available to the affected parties in case of a discrepancy between the 
EDPB binding decision and CJEU rulings in the aforementioned cases33.  

26.  Considering the above, in particular that the conditions of Article 65(1)(a) GDPR are met, the EDPB is 
competent to adopt a binding decision, which shall concern all the matters which are the subject of 
the relevant and reasoned objection(s), i.e. whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether 
the envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR34. 

27. 

The EDPB recalls that its current decision is without any prejudice to any assessments the EDPB may 
be  called  upon  to  make  in  other  cases,  including  with  the  same  parties,  taking  into  account  the 
contents of the relevant Draft Decision and the objections raised by the CSA(s). 

3.4  Structure of the binding decision 

28. 

For each of the objections raised, the EDPB decides on their admissibility, by assessing first whether 
they  can  be  considered  as  a  “relevant  and  reasoned  objection”  within  the  meaning  of 
Article 4(24) GDPR as clarified in the guidelines on the concept of a relevant and reasoned objection35.  

29.  Where the EDPB finds that an objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR, the 
EDPB does not take any position on the merit of any substantial issues raised by that objection in this 
specific case. The EDPB will analyse the merits of the substantial issues raised by all objections it deems 
relevant and reasoned36.  

 

4  ON WHETHER THE LSA SHOULD HAVE FOUND AN INFRINGEMENT 
FOR  LACK  OF  APPROPRIATE  LEGAL  BASIS/UNLAWFUL  DATA 
PROCESSING 

4.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

30. 

The IE SA concludes that the GDPR, the jurisprudence and the EDPB guidelines do not preclude Meta 
IE  from  relying  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  as  a  legal  basis  to  carry  out  the  personal  data  processing 

                                                             
33 In case an action for annulment is brought against the EDPB decision(s) and found admissible, the General 
Court/CJEU has the opportunity to invalidate the decision of the EDPB. In addition, and if the General Court/CJEU 
were to deliver any judgment in the time between the adoption of the EDPB’s Art. 65 decision and the adoption 
of the IE SA’s final decision, the IE SA may ultimately decide to revise the final national decision it takes following 
the  EDPB's  binding  decision  -  if  the  CJEU’s  rulings  give  cause  to  do  so  -  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of 
cooperation as elaborated by the CJEU in the Kühne&Heitz NV case (Judgement of the Court of Justice of 12 
January 2004, Kühne & Heitz NV, C-453/00, ECLI:EU:C:2004:17.  
34  Art.  65(1)(a)  and  Art.  4(24)  GDPR.  Some  CSAs  raised  comments  and  not  per  se  objections,  which  were, 
therefore, not taken into account by the EDPB.

activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as 
that forms a core part of the service37. Finding 2 reads “I find the Complainant’s case is not made out 
that the GDPR does not permit the reliance by Facebook on 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering 
of Terms of Service”38.  

31. 

The  IE SA understands the  Complainant’s allegations as39:  being  that, firstly,  the  Complainant was 
given a binary choice: i.e. either accept the Facebook Terms of Service and the associated Data Policy 
by selecting the “accept” button, or delete her Facebook account40, lack of clarity on which specific 
legal basis Meta IE relies on for each processing operation41, and the Complainant’s concern on Meta 
IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service42.  

32.  While  the  IE  SA  acknowledges  that  the  EDPB  considers  in  its  EDPB  Guidelines 2/2019  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  that,  as  a  general  rule,  processing  for  online  behavioural  advertising  is  not 
necessary  for  the  performance  of  a  contract  for  online  service  under  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR,  in  this 
particular  case,  having  regard  to  the  specific  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  the  service 
provided  and  agreed  upon  by  the  parties,  IE  SA  concluded  that  Meta  IE  may  in  principle  rely  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its 
service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part of 
that service offered to and accepted by users 43.  

33. 

34. 

The IE SA disagrees with what it defines as a “strict threshold of ‘impossibility’ in the assessment of 
necessity”  proposed  by  the  Complainant  and  the  EDPB44.  By  “impossibility”,  IE  SA  refers  to  the 
argument  put  forward  that  a  particular  term  of  a  contract  (here,  behavioural  advertising)  is  not 
necessary  to  deliver  an  overall  service  or  contract45.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
cannot  be  interpreted  as  requiring  that  it  is  impossible  to  perform  the  contract  without  the  data 
processing operations in question46.   

The IE SA considers behavioural advertising a core part of the service offered to and accepted by the 
users, having regard to the specific terms of the contract and the nature of the service provided and 
agreed upon by Meta IE and the user47. The IE SA points out that the nature of the service being offered 
to Facebook users is set out in the first line of the Facebook Terms of Service: a personalised service 
that includes advertising. The IE SA argues that a distinguishing feature and commercially essential 
element of the contract between Meta IE and the user is that it funds its Facebook social media service 
with targeted and personalised advertising to the user48. 

35. 

The IE SA considers this information clearly set out and publicly available49. Moreover, the IE SA states 
that any reasonable user would expect and understand that this was the bargain being struck, even if

they might prefer that the market would offer them better alternative choices 50. The IE SA responds 
to the Complainant’s arguments that this analysis amounts to speculation by pointing out that the 
only evidence the Complainant put forward was the Complainant’s own statement and a Gallup poll 
and that the IE SA is obliged to consider all of the evidence before it and entitled to take notice of 
matters in the public domain51.  

The  IE  SA  considers  that  having  regard  to  what  it  described  as  the  “clear”  terms  of  the  contract, 
targeted advertising forms a core element of Meta IE’s business model and transaction with users52. 

The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of 
the processing of users’ data necessary for the provision of its Facebook social media service, including 
through  the  provision  of  behavioural  advertising  insofar  as  this  forms  a  core  part  of  that  service 
offered to and accepted by users53. 

The  IE  SA  clarified  that,  having  regard  to  the  scope  of  the  complaint  and  its  inquiry,  the  above 
conclusion ought not to be construed as an indication that all processing operations carried out on 
users’ personal data are necessarily covered by Article 6(1)(b) GDPR54.  

The IE SA also notes that other provisions of the GDPR such as transparency act to strictly regulate the 
manner in which this service is to be delivered and the information that should be given to users and 
decides  to  address  it  separately  in  its  Draft  Decision55.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  there  have  been 
significant failings of transparency in relation to the processing56.  

The IE SA considers that these failings of transparency do not change the “basic fact” that behavioural 
advertising forms part of the service offered by Facebook. The IE SA considers that information on 
which specific clauses of the “Terms of Service” are used by Meta IE to justify the specific purpose of 
its processing, the type of personal data processed and the applicable legal basis would not assist in 
deciding the question of principle as to whether Meta IE can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to provide a 
service that includes behavioural or targeted advertising57.  

4.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs

The  AT,  DE,  FR,  IT,  NL,  NO,  PL,  PT  and  SE  SAs  object  to  Finding  2  of  the  Draft  Decision  and  the 
assessment leading up to it58.

The  AT,  IT,  NL,  NO,  and  SE  SAs  consider  that  the  IE  SA  should  have  found  an  infringement  of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR59, in line with the EDPB’s interpretation of this provision60. The DE, FR and PL SAs 
argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR61. The PT SA contends 
that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR on the aspect of lawfulness62. 
The DE SAs in their objection, further argue that the IE SA should find an additional infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR63.  

The DE SAs consider that the IE SE should impose a temporary or definitive limitation of the respective 
processing without legal basis in accordance with Article 58(2)(f) GDPR, i.e. the erasure of unlawfully 
processed  personal  data  and  the  ban  of  the  processing  of  data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising until a valid legal basis is in place64. 

The FR SA notes  that reversing the findings concerning the infringements of Article 6(1) GDPR also 
affects the scope  of the  corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative 
fine65. The PT SA considers that the proposed additional infringement in relation to the breach of the 
lawfulness obligation (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR) should lead to the application of an additional corrective 
measure which is not now envisaged in the Draft Decision66.  

The  IT  SA,  in  its  objection,  also  argues  that  the  finding  of  an  infringement  of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
should result in the taking of appropriate corrective measures under Article 58(2)(d) (order to bring 
processing  operations  into  compliance)  GDPR  along  with  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine 
pursuant to Article 83(5)(a) GDPR67. 

The NO SA, in its objection, also argues that the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures. More 
specifically, the NO SA considers that the IE SA should order Meta IE to delete personal data processed 
under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, unless those data were also collected for other purposes with a valid legal 
basis, as well as order Meta IE to identify a valid legal basis for future behavioural advertising or from 
now on abstain from such processing activities68.  

47. 

The AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs put forward several factual and legal arguments for the 
proposed  change  in  legal  assessment69.  Specifically  they  argue  that  Meta  IE  cannot  rely  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to process a Facebook user’s data for behavioural advertising. 

48. 

In the context of their objection, the AT and FR SAs argue that the factual background of the Draft 
Decision does not include all relevant facts. They request amending the factual background to include

a  definition  of  “behavioural  advertising”70.  The  AT  SA  suggests  mentioning  also  the  technical 
possibilities Facebook uses to conduct it, such as collecting data from other group services, third-party 
websites, apps, cookies or similar storage technologies placed on the user’s computer or mobile device 
and linking that data with the user’s Facebook account71. The AT SA also suggests including the fact 
that on 28 May 2018 Meta IE switched its legal basis to process data for behavioural advertising from 
consent to contractual performance. The AT SA considers that the Gallup Institute study presented by 
the Complainant should also be included among the relevant facts72. The AT SA considers it as scientific 
evidence that shows that only 1.6% of Facebook users understood the request to accept the Facebook 
Terms of Service to be “a contract”  73. The AT SA states that this supports its arguments that data 
subjects do not have the “expectation” to receive personalised advertisements as “part of a contract”.  

The DE and NL SAs question the validity of a contract between Meta IE and the user to ground the 
processing on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR74, in light of the transparency issues identified by the IE SA75. The 
DE SAs question whether the parties reached an agreement if the user did not know that they would 
enter into a contract, because Meta IE did not clearly communicate in a transparent manner that the 
use of its Facebook service would in the future be based on a contract76. The NL SA argues that as a 
general rule, both parties must be aware of the substance of a contract, in order to willingly enter into 
it and considers that “the established serious lack of transparency on behalf of the controller, therefore 
leads to a reasonable doubt whether data subjects have indeed been able to enter into a contract with 
the  controller  both  willingly  and  sufficiently  informed”77.  The  NL  SA  compounds  its  doubts  on  the 
validity of the contract by arguing that the Terms of Use and the Data Policy documents are lengthy 
and unclear and that Meta IE presents a completely one-sided deal whereby an individual data subject 
has no influence on any of the terms78. The DE and NL SAs therefore consider that Meta IE’s statement 
that it relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for its Facebook Service, in combination with documents with 
general  descriptions  of  the  service  provided,  and  the  IE  SA’s  reference  to  the  controller’s  right  to 
choose its own legal basis to process data, are insufficient to accept that the performance of a contract 
can be used as a legal basis79.  

50. 

The DE and PT SAs contend that the IE SA is competent to assess the validity of contracts in the context 
of  the  GDPR,  which  is  a  prerequisite  for  controllers  to  base  the  processing  of  personal  data  on

75 In Finding 3, the IE SA states that “In relation to processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is relied on, Articles 
5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) have been infringed.” The IE SA considered, among others, that “Information on the 
specific processing operations (necessarily including the data processed) that will be carried out for the purposes 
specified and by reference to the lawful bases specified (the latter two being currently, in my view, set out in a 
disjointed  manner)  should  have  been  provided  to  the  data  subject.  To  the  extent  that  this  information  was 
provided  at  all,  it  was  not  clearly  linked  with  a  specific  purpose  or  lawful  basis,  and  was  described  in  an 
ambiguous manner (...)” (Draft Decision, paragraph 5.71).

Article 6(1)(b) GDPR80. The DE, NL, and PT SAs argue that the IE SA should assess whether a suitable 
contract is in place as required under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR81.  

51.  Without prejudice to any arguments made on the existence of a valid contract above, the AT, DE, FR, 
IT, NL, NO, PL, PT, and SE SAs are not satisfied by the assessment of necessity in the Draft Decision82. 
The AT, DE, FR, IT NL, NO, PL, PT, and SE SAs assert that behavioural advertising is objectively not 
necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s contract with the data subject to deliver the Facebook 
service and is not an essential or core element of it83. To highlight the unnecessity of behavioural 
advertising  to  perform  the  contract  with  the  Facebook  user,  the  AT,  DE,  and  SE  SAs  contrast  this 
contract  to  the  contract  of  providing  personalised  advertisement  between  Meta  IE  and  a  specific 
advertiser, in which Meta IE would presumably have this obligation towards the advertisers, yet not 
towards Facebook users that are not party to this contract84. The DE SAs support this assertion by 
pointing out that there is no obligation to offer personalised advertising to the user, and contractual 
sanctions for the failure to provide it, as it can be seen from the Facebook Terms of Service85. The AT, 
DE,  IT,  NO,  PL,  and  SE  SAs  consider,  while  referring  to  the  EDPB  Guidelines 2/2019  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, that the business models to offer “free” services and in return generate income 
by behavioural and personalised advertisement, inter alia, to support the service, cannot be necessary 
to perform a contract and fail to comply with data protection regulations86. The DE SAs also cite the 
EDPB  Guidelines  08/202087  to  underscore  that  processing  cannot  be  rendered 
lawful  by 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR simply because such advertising indirectly funds the provision of the service and 
that  while  personalisation  of  content,  may,  in  certain  circumstances,  constitute  an  intrinsic  and 
expected element of certain online services, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of targeting of social 
media  users  is  hardly  applicable88.  The  AT,  PL  and  SE  SAs  argue  that  advertisements  can  still  be 
displayed on Facebook using alternative methods to behavioural advertising not involving profiling 
and tracking89. The SE SA adds that some degree of targeting for increased relevance is possible, such 
as geography, language and context90.  

52. 

In addition, the AT, FR, NO, PT and SE SAs argue, also while referring to EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR91, that the IE SA should have considered the EDPB’s argument that behavioural 
advertising cannot be “necessary” within the meaning of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR while a data subject can

The  NL  SA  also  refers  to  the  EDPB  Guidelines 2/2019  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  to  state  that  “the 
reasonable understanding and expectations of all contract parties as to what the core of the service is 
play an important role in what determines the extent of personal data processing that is ‘necessary’ 
for  the  performance  of  a  contract”93.  The  AT,  NL,  and  SE  SAs  contend  that  data  subjects  do  not 
reasonably expect that their data is being processed for personalised advertising simply because Meta 
IE briefly refers to it in the Facebook Terms of Service94. The NO SA takes into account how Meta IE 
markets its Facebook platform towards potential users (“Connect with friends and the world around 
you on Facebook”’) and considers that Facebook users (including those with prior knowledge of data 
protection, technical means for profiling or the ad tech industry) should not be deemed to reasonably 
expect online behavioural advertising, especially to the extent as it is carried out by Meta IE95. The IT 
SA argues that users can be aware, at the very most, that the service is being funded by personalised 
advertising, but they are  not factually enabled to adequately know  the  features of  the  processing 
activities96.  The  FR  and  NO  SAs  consider  that  the  particularly  massive  and  intrusive  nature  of  the 
processing of the users’ data cannot meet the reasonable expectations of the users97. The AT, NL and 
SE  SAs  also  consider  that  the  Draft  Decision  is  inconsistent  in  finding  that  information  on  specific 
processing operations should have been provided, linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described 
in an unambiguous manner, while considering that data subjects had a perspective or expectation or 
were well informed that their data was being processed for behavioural advertising98.  

In addition to the arguments made above on the existence of a valid contract and the necessity of 
behavioural advertising for the performance of that contract, several SAs raise other considerations 
in their objections.  

The NO SA argues that the IE SA’s interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is contrary to the fairness 
principle,  since  data  subjects  face  the  dilemma  of  approving  contractual  terms  possibly  entailing 
intrusive and harmful processing practices, and being excluded from services on which they are de 
facto dependent, due to a lack of realistic alternatives to them99.  

56.  On the  risks  posed by the Draft Decision, the  AT,  DE, NL, NO, PL, PT,  and  SE SAs explain that the 
proposed interpretation of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR leads to a situation where data protection principles 
are either undermined or bypassed entirely with regard to data subjects using the Facebook service100.  

57. 

Specifically the AT, DE, NO, and PT SAs point to the conditions of consent pursuant to Article 7 GDPR 
as being bypassed101. The NL SA considers that the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to engage in online

behavioural  advertising  in  a  way  that  bypasses  informed  consent  of  data  subjects102.  The  NO  SA 
considers that users “would face a dilemma between approving (though not by way of valid consent) 
contractual terms possibly entailing intrusive and harmful processing practices, and being excluded 
from services”, which ultimately would also “adversely affect data subjects’ freedom of expression and 
information”103.  The  PT  SA  sees  users’  choice  reduced  to  “refusing  to  contract  in  order  to  protect 
his/her rights or accepting all data processing without the possibility of exercising the rights conferred 
on  him  by  the  GDPR  under  Article 7(3)  or  Article 21 GDPR”104.  The  FR  SA  considers  that  the  Draft 
Decision “does not allow the European users of the social network to have control over the fate of their 
data”105. The PL SA argues the Draft Decision significantly limits “the possibilities of data subjects to 
assert their rights, including pursuing claims”, adding that the lack of a proportionate, dissuasive and 
effective corrective measure may lead to Meta IE further infringing the rights or freedoms of data 
subjects protected under Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union106. 

58. 

59. 

Further, the AT SA sees the risk materialise as in its view Article 25(2) GDPR (privacy by default) is not 
applied, “since Facebook – at least in its contract – declares that behavioural advertising is ‘necessary’ 
for the contractual performance”107. 

The DE SAs argue the Draft Decision allows Meta IE to “bypass the requirements of a valid legal basis 
for the processing that cannot be based on contract performance” 108. The IT SA considers the Draft 
Decision would substantially undermine the users’ right “to freely determine the processing of their 
personal  data  for  online  behavioural  advertising”,  in  part  because  the  requirement  to  identify  a 
suitable legal basis would in many situations be reduced to adding a description of processing in a 
contract109. The NL SA considers the Draft Decision lowers the threshold for legality of data processing 
on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR severely110. The NO SA considers that the Draft Decision erodes 
the lawfulness principle, as in the Draft Decision “it is not the legislation which sets the boundaries for 
lawfulness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, but instead the individual contract”, which is incompatible with 
Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR111. 

60. 

Several SAs take the view that the Draft Decision, as it stands, sets a dangerous precedent contrary to 
the  GDPR.  The  FR  SA  notes  that  it  could  be  understood  as  reflecting  the  common  position  of  the 
European supervisory authorities on this matter, since it is issued following the cooperation procedure 
among  SAs112.  Specifically,  the  AT,  DE, 
interpretation  of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR could essentially be used by every controller and therefore endanger the rights 
of nearly every data subject within the EEA113.  

IT,  and  SE  SAs  raise  that  this

61.  Moreover,  the  AT,  DE,  IT,  NL,  NO,  and  PT  SAs  explain  that  the  Draft  Decision  creates  a  loophole, 
allowing Meta IE and any other controller to make lawful virtually any collection and reuse of personal 
data by, as long as they declare that it is processed for the performance of a contract114. 

4.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

62. 

63. 

64. 

The IE SA considers that the objections above are not relevant and/or not reasoned for the purpose 
of Article 60(4) GDPR and decides not to follow them115.  

The IE SA contends that a broad, direct competence in contract law to assess the validity of contracts 
cannot be  inferred from the GDPR  tasks  of supervisory  authorities116. It argues  that this inference 
would create a very extensive power for SAs to regulate private law, without an appropriate basis in 
EU law.  

The IE SA argues that the core or fundamental aspects of  the Facebook Terms of Service, including 
behavioural  advertising  processing,  reflects  the  mutual  expectations  of  the  parties  on  contractual 
performance117. The IE SA contends that a reasonable user would have had sufficient understanding 
that  the  Facebook  service  was  provided  on  the  basis  of  personalised  advertising,  based  also  on  a 
“recognised public awareness” of behavioural advertising as a form of processing. 

65.  On the necessity of the processing to perform the contract, the IE SA considers that it does not adopt 
a  merely  formal  approach  to  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  that  relies  only  on  the  textual  content  of  the 
Facebook Terms of Service118. The IE SA states that it does not take the view that all written contractual 
terms are necessary for the performance of the contract. The IE SA contends that it focuses in its Draft 
Decision  on  the  fundamental  purpose  or  core  function  of  the  contract  that  is  necessary  for  its 
performance.  

66. 

67. 

The IE SA argues that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not prohibit behavioural 
advertising processing under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR if it falls within the core or essential aspects of the 
service119. In relation to Meta IE’s processing of personal data, the IE SA differs from the SAs in that it 
considers  online  behavioural  advertising  as  necessary  for  the  performance  of  the  contract  (as 
described in the Facebook Terms of Service) between Facebook Ireland and the data subject.  

The IE SA also disagrees with the interpretation of Article 21 GDPR making behavioural advertising 
optional and not indispensable120. The IE SA argues that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is not limited to aspects 
of  contractual  performance  which  are  expressly  mandatory  and  unconditional  obligations  of  the 
parties. The IE SA contends that the CJEU has in the past held that processing which exceeds the most 
minimal level of processing possible may be regarded as necessary, where it renders a lawful objective 
“more effective”. The IE SA affirms that the necessity in the context of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR cannot be

assessed by reference to hypothetical alternative forms of the Facebook service and that it is not the 
role of SAs to impose specific business models on controllers121.  

The IE SA considers EDPB guidelines as not binding on supervisory authorities, yet it acknowledges 
that they should be  taken into account122. However, the  IE SA argues  that  the  EDPB has not been 
provided with the legal power to mandate  that certain categories of processing must be based on 
consent, to the exclusion of any other legal bases for processing. IE SA’s view is that such a power is 
properly  exercised  from  time  to  time  by  the  EU  legislator,  in  the  form  of  specific  legislative 
measures123.  The 
is  therefore  not  satisfied  that  the  EDPB  Guidelines 2/2019  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be construed as a binding and specific prohibition on processing for online 
behavioural  advertising  on  the  basis  of  Article 6(1)(b)GDPR.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  under  these 
Guidelines,  where  processing  for  behavioural  advertising  is  a  distinguishing  characteristic  of  the 
service in question, it can support the business objectives and interests of the controller and be based 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The IE SA considers that to be the case regarding Meta IE’s processing with 
reference to the Facebook service124.  

IE  SA 

The  IE SA argues  that compliance  with GDPR  transparency obligations under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR 
involves a separate and different legal assessment to that required in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR125. The IE 
SA  acknowledges  that  the  necessity  test  under  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  may  require  considering 
contractual  terms  and  other  relevant  information,  and  that  the  information  provided  under 
Article 13(1)(c) GDPR could, in some cases, inform a data subject’s expectations as to a contractual 
service.  However,  in  the  present  case,  the  IE  SA  considers  that  the  transparency  infringement  it 
proposes for its Draft Decision does not impact its findings on the legal basis, as it considers that the 
expectations and understanding of the parties on the Facebook Terms of Service include personalised 
advertising126.  

4.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

4.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

The objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs concern “whether there is an 
infringement of the GDPR”127.  

The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 
threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR128. Meta IE’s primary argument is that “Objections which raise matters 
which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry are not ‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning 
of Article 4(24) GDPR” and such objections “ought to be disregarded in their entirety by the EDPB”129. 
Contrary to Meta IE’s130 position on relevance, objections can have bearing on the “specific legal and

128 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 70. 
129 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 4.9 and 4.10. 
130 Meta IE cites the EDPB Guidelines on RRO, which state that “[a]n objection should only be considered relevant 
if it relates to the specific legal and factual content of the Draft Decision” (paragraph 14) to draw the conclusion 
that  any  objection  raising  matters  outside  the  scope  of  the  inquiry  is  not  relevant.  See  Meta IE  Article 65

factual content of the Draft Decision”, despite not aligning with the scope of the inquiry as defined by 
an LSA. Nor does the EDPB accept Meta IE’s narrowing the scope of “reasoned” to arguments on issues 
that  have  been  investigated  or  addressed  in  the  inquiry131,  as  no  such  limitation  can  be  read  in 
Article 4(24) GDPR. 

In essence, Meta IE argues that CSAs may not, under any circumstance, express disagreement with 
the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection. The EDPB does not share this 
reading of Article 65 GDPR, as is explicitly stated in the EDPB Guidelines on RRO132.  

Furthermore, Meta IE states that “it is not now open to the CSAs to seek to expand the scope of the 
Inquiry in the manner proposed and that, were the EDPB to do so, this would constitute a clear breach 
of Meta Ireland’s legitimate expectations and right to fair procedures, both as a matter of Irish law 
and in accordance with Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the EU (the 
‘Charter’)”133.  Despite  claiming  it  is  “clear”,  Meta  IE  does  not  demonstrate  in  which  manner  its 
procedural  rights  would  be  inevitably  breached  by  the  mere  fact  that  the  EDPB  finds  specific 
objections admissible. Admissibility determines the competence of the EDPB, but not the outcome of 
the dispute between the LSA and the CSAs. Likewise, Meta IE does not explain how the mere act of 
considering the  merits of admissible  objections inevitably and irreparably breaches  the  procedural 
rights cited by Meta IE134. Accepting Meta IE’s interpretation would severely limit the EDPB possibility 
to resolve disputes arising in the one-stop-shop, and thus undermine the consistent application of the 
GDPR.  

The objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs on the finding of an infringement all 
have a direct connection with the LSA Draft Decision and refer to a specific part of the Draft Decision, 
i.e. Finding 2. All of those objections concern “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR” as they 
argue that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Article 6(1), 6(1)(b) or 5(1)(a)(on the aspect 
of lawfulness) of the GDPR. As the  LSA considered that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was not breached, the 
objections  entail  a  need  of  a  change  of  the  LSA  decision  leading  to  a  different  conclusion. 
Consequently, the EDPB finds that the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs objections relating to 
the infringement of Article 6(1), 6(1)(b) or 5(1)(a)(on the aspect of lawfulness) GDPR are relevant.  

75.  As regards the  part  of the  DE SAs objection arguing that  the  IE  SA should find an infringement of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and impose the erasure of unlawfully processed personal data and the ban of the 
processing of data for the purpose of behavioural advertising until a valid legal basis is in place; the 
part  of  the  IT  SA  objection  related  to  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  pursuant  to 

                                                             
Submissions,  paragraph  4.11.  The  EDPB  notes  that  paragraph  14  of  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on  RRO  draws  a 
distinction  between  relevant  objections  and  “abstract  or  broad  concerns  or  remarks”  on  the  one  hand  and 
“minor disagreements” on the other. Moreover, this paragraph should be read in conjunction with paragraph 
27 of the EDPB Guidelines on RRO.  
131 Meta IE puts forward that “Objections which raise matters which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry” 
are “inadequately reasoned as they fail to explain how findings of infringement can be made on issues that have 
not been investigated or addressed in the Inquiry”. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.10 and 4.11. The 
EDPB  maintains  its  understanding  of  the  term  “reasoned”,  as  explained  in  paragraphs  16-19  of  its  EDPB 
Guidelines on RRO. 
132 “For instance, if the investigation carried out by the LSA unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised 
by the complainant or resulting from an infringement reported by a CSA, a relevant and reasoned objection may 
be raised based on the failure of the LSA to properly handle the complaint and to safeguard the rights of the data 
subject.” EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 27. 
133 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 4.5. 
134 The EDPB fails to see how, for instance, declaring an objection admissible but rejecting it on merits could 
impinge on the procedural rights of the controller involved in the underlying case.

Article 83(5)(a) GDPR for the additional infringement by Meta IE of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR; and the part 
of the NO SA objection arguing the IE SA should order Meta IE to delete personal data processed under 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR,  as  well  as  order  Meta  IE  to  identify  a  valid  legal  basis  for  future  behavioural 
advertising or from now on abstain from such processing activities, the EDPB notes that these parts 
of the objections concern “whether the envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the 
GDPR”.  These  parts  of  the  three  objections  are  linked  to  the  IE  SA’s  Finding  2  with  regard  to 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Therefore, they are directly connected with the substance of the Draft Decision 
and, if followed, would lead to a different conclusion. Thus, the EDPB considers that these parts of the 
DE, IT and NO SAs objections are relevant. 

The objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs on the finding of an infringement are 
also reasoned because they all include clarifications and arguments on legal/factual mistakes in the 
LSA’s Draft Decision that require amending. More specifically, the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE 
SAs  provide  detailed  arguments  to  challenge  the  Draft  Decision’s  consideration  of  behavioural 
advertising as a necessary, core or fundamental aspect of a contract leading to the need to change 
the decision and to find an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR135. Some of them provide detailed 
arguments challenging the validity of the contract on which the use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal 
basis depends and which the IE SA accepts136.  

Some SAs recall, while referring to the terms of the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR137, 
that  it  is  the  fundamental  and  mutually  understood  contractual  purpose,  which  justifies  that  the 
processing is necessary138. This purpose is not only based on the controller’s perspective but also on a 
reasonable  data  subject’s  perspective  when  entering  into  the  contract  and  thus  on  “the  mutual 
perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract”. The AT, NL, and SE SA contend that data 
subjects  do  not  reasonably  expect  that  their  data  is  being  processed  for  personalised  advertising 
simply because Meta IE briefly refers to it in the Facebook Terms of Service139. The FR, IT and NO SAs 
also support this finding and add that data subjects cannot be presumed to be aware of the particularly 
massive and intrusive nature of this processing140. Several SAs also consider that the Draft Decision is 
inconsistent in finding that information on specific processing operations should have been provided, 
linked with a specific or lawful basis, and described in an unambiguous manner, while considering that 
data  subjects  had  a  perspective  or  expectation  or  were  well  informed  that  their  data  was  being 
processed for behavioural advertising141.  

78. 

The AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs objections also identify risks posed by the Draft Decision, 
in particular an interpretation of Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  that could be  invoked by any  controller and 
would undermine or bypass data protection principles, and thus endanger the rights of data subjects 
within the EEA142.

79.  Meta IE’s contends that in terms of risk, the objections must “demonstrate the likelihood of a direct 
negative impact of a certain significance of the Draft Decision on fundamental rights and freedoms 
under  the  Charter  and  not  just  any  data  subject  rights”143.  Meta  IE  thus  adds  a  condition  to 
Article 4(24) GDPR, which is not supported by the GDPR144.  

80.  As  regards  the  parts  of  the  DE  SAs  objection  requesting  the  finding  of  an  infringement  of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and the parts of the DE, IT and NO SAs objections requesting specific corrective 
measures  under  Article 58 GDPR  for  the  infringement  of  Article 6(1)  or  6(1)(b) GDPR,  namely  the 
imposition  of  an  administrative  fine,  a  ban  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of 
behavioural advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and 
an  order  to  identify  a  valid  legal  basis  for  future  behavioural  advertising  or  to  abstain  from  such 
processing  activities,  the  EDPB  considers  that  these  parts  of  the  objections  do  not  sufficiently 
elaborate the legal or factual arguments that would justify a change in the Draft Decision leading to 
the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR or to the imposition of the specific corrective 
measures mentioned above. Likewise, the significance of the risk for the data subjects, which stems 
from  the  IE  SA’s  decision  not  to  conclude  on  the  infringement  of  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR  and  not  to 
impose the requested corrective measures, is not sufficiently demonstrated.  

81.  Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE 
SAs on the finding of an infringement of Article 6(1), 6(1)(b), or 5(1)(a) (on the aspect of lawfulness) 
GDPR are relevant and reasoned in accordance with Article 4(24) GDPR.  

82.  However,  the  parts  of  the  DE  SAs  objection  concerning  the  additional 

infringement  of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and the parts of the DE, IT and NO SAs objections concerning the imposition of 
certain corrective measures, namely the imposition of an administrative fine, a ban on the processing 
of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising,  an  order  to  delete  personal  data 
processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and an order to identify a valid legal basis for future behavioural 
advertising  or  to  abstain  from  such  processing  activities  are  not  reasoned  and  do  not  meet  the 
threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

4.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

83. 

84. 

In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB 
shall take  a binding decision concerning all the  matters which are the subject of the relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection145 require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  needs  to  be  changed  insofar  as  it  rejects  the 
Complainant’s  claim  that  the  GDPR  does  not  permit  Meta  IE’s  reliance  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  to 
process personal data in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service. When assessing 
the  merits  of  the  objections  raised,  the  EDPB  also  takes  into  account  Meta  IE’s  position  on  the 
objections and its submissions.

144 Art. 1(2) GDPR provides that the GDPR itself “protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons 
and in particular their right to protection of personal data”, which directly stems from Art. 8(1) of the Charter. 
Therefore, there is no reason to draw a distinction between the data subject rights protected by the GDPR and 
the fundamental rights protected under the Charter when interpreting Art. 4(24) GDPR. 
145 These objections being those of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs arguing that the IE SA should 
have found an infringement of Art. 6(1)(b), Art. 6(1) or Art. 5(1)(a)(on the aspect of lawfulness) GDPR.

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

85. 

In its submissions, Meta IE argues that the objections lack merit. Meta IE considers that they are based 
on  incorrect  factual  assumptions  and  are  legally  flawed146.  Meta  IE  states  that  its  reliance  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not “bypass” the GDPR. Nor would it, according to Meta IE, jeopardise data 
subject rights, be limited to individually negotiated agreements or be affected by Meta IE’s purported 
pre-GDPR legal basis for processing conducted pre-GDPR147.  

86.  Meta IE argues that there is a lack of factual material and evidence on the issues on which the CSAs 
raise objections, including on its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the specific processing operations 
it conducts in its Facebook service for the purposes of behavioural advertising148. Meta IE notes that 
the IE SA did not consider what processing operations would fall within the term “online behavioural 
advertising”  and  the  actual  processing  operations  that  Meta  IE  conducted  with  respect  to  the 
Complainant or with respect to advertising on the Facebook service more generally149. 

87.  At the same time, Meta IE contends that, to address the complaint, the IE SA did not have to reach 
any  conclusions  as  to  whether  the  actual  processing conducted  by  Meta  IE  to  deliver  behavioural 
advertising  based  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  was  lawful150.  Meta  IE  supports  the  IE’s  position  that  it 
would  not  “have  been  appropriate  to  undertake  an  open-ended  assessment  of  all  processing 
operations by the controller (having a general association with the Facebook Terms of Service) in order 
to  handle  the  complaint.  Such  an  approach  would  result  in  a  disproportionate  and  open-ended 
examination of processing by Facebook, without first resolving the actual issues which are disputed 
between the parties”151. 

88.  Meta IE thus agrees with the “general and principled in nature” finding the IE SA reached on Meta IE’s 
not  being  precluded  from  relying  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  for  the  processing  of  data  necessary  to 
deliver behavioural advertising152, upon the IE SA’s review of the Facebook Terms of Service and the 
nature of its products and features as described in those terms.  

89.  Meta  IE  defends  that  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  can  be  relied  on  as  a  legal  basis  for  behavioural 
advertising153. Meta IE argues that its application requires the assessment of whether a given data 
processing  operation,  when  properly  investigated  and  analysed,  is  actually  necessary  for  the 
performance of a contract154. Meta IE notes that personalisation, including in the form of behavioural 
advertising, is clearly central and objectively reasonable and necessary with regard to the essence of 
the Facebook service (as per the Facebook Terms of Service, which govern the contractual relationship 
between Meta IE and its users)155.  

90.  Meta IE argues that the Facebook Terms of Service make clear that users will be shown advertising 
personalised to their interests under the heading “Help you discover content, products and services

that may interest you”156. Meta IE supports the DPC’s finding, based on its review of the Facebook 
Terms of Service and a general reference to public debate on these issues, that an average user who 
accepts the Facebook Terms of Service would have the expectation that personalisation, including in 
the form of behavioural advertising, forms a core and integral part of the Facebook Terms of Service157. 
Meta IE backs this argument with a reference to a survey and a study conducted by a private entity 
and  a  digital  industry  association158.  Meta  IE  considers  that  its  compliance  with  the  GDPR’s 
transparency  obligations  involves  a  separate  and  different  legal  assessment  from  Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR159.  Meta  IE  considers  demonstrated  in  this  case  that  Meta  IE  and  its  users  have  a  mutual 
expectation that personalisation, including in the form of behavioural ads, is core to  the Facebook 
Terms of Service160.  

91.  Meta IE recalls that the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR do not categorically prohibit 
reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for behavioural advertising161. Meta IE further adds, referring to the 
CJEU’s  Huber  judgment162,  that  “processing  beyond  the  most  minimal  required  to  achieve  the 
processing purpose could still be deemed ‘necessary’ if it allowed the relevant processing purpose to 
be  ‘more  effectively’  achieved”163.  Meta  IE  submits  that  even  if  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  required  the 
processing to be absolutely essential to perform the contract, it would be impossible to provide the 
Facebook service in accordance with its Term of Service without providing behavioural advertising164. 
Meta IE states that the EDPB cannot compel it to change the nature of its service. Meta IE would view 
this as a violation of Article 16 of the Charter on the freedom to conduct business enabling service 
providers to determine what measures to take in order to achieve the result they seek, based on their 
resources, abilities, and compatibility with other obligations and challenges they may encounter in the 
exercise of their activity165.  

92.  Meta IE further argues that its reliance on the contractual necessity legal basis does not jeopardise 
data subject rights166. Meta IE considers that these would also be protected by contract and consumer 
protection legislations in the EU Member States and acknowledges that compliance with them is a 
necessary precondition  to the reliance  on this legal basis167. Meta IE defends  that the contractual 
necessity legal basis is not limited to individually negotiated agreements and can also be  used for 
standard form contracts168. Meta IE further adds that it would be improper for CSAs and the EDPB to 
analyse the validity of the Facebook Terms of Service under applicable laws of contract or to draw 
inferences  from  them169.  In  response  to  what  Meta  IE  considers  mischaracterisations  in  certain

objections of national contract law Meta IE provides expert reports on the validity of the Facebook 
Terms of Service in 22 Member States170.  

93.  Meta IE concludes its arguments in support of its reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR stating that its pre-
GDPR legal basis for data processing does not affect its flexibility to rely on other legal bases post GDPR 
if it complies with the relevant requirements171. Meta IE also distinguishes behavioural advertising on 
the Facebook service from direct marketing pursuant to Article 21(2) GDPR and thus considers this 
provision not applicable to behavioural advertising172.  

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

94. 

95. 

96. 

The EDPB considers it necessary to begin its assessment on the merits with a general description of 
the  practice  of  behavioural  advertising  carried  out  in  the  context  of  the  Facebook  service  before 
determining  whether  the  legal  basis  of  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  is  appropriate  for  this  practice  in  the 
present case, based on the Facebook Terms of Service and the nature of its products and features as 
described  in  those  terms.  The  requests  for  preliminary  rulings  made  to  the  CJEU  in  the  cases  C-
252/21173  and  C-446/21174  to  which  some  of  the  documents  in  the  file  refer175  contain  helpful 
descriptions of Meta IE’s behavioural advertising practices in the context of its Facebook service.  

These requests for preliminary rulings mention that Meta IE collects data on its individual users and 
their activities on and off its Facebook social network service via numerous means such as the service 
itself,  other  services  of  the  Meta  group  including  Instagram,  WhatsApp  and  Oculus,  third  party 
websites  and  apps  via  integrated  programming  interfaces  such  as  Facebook  Business  Tools  or  via 
cookies, social plug-ins, pixels and comparable technologies placed on the internet user’s computer 
or mobile  device. According to the  descriptions  provided, Meta IE links  these data with  the  user’s 
Facebook account to enable advertisers to tailor their advertising to Facebook’s individual users based 
on  their  consumer  behaviour,  interests,  purchasing  power  and  personal  situation.  This  may  also 
include the user’s physical location to display content relevant to the user’s location. Meta IE offers 
its services to its users free of charge and generates revenue through this personalised advertising 
that targets them, in addition to static advertising that is displayed to every user in the same way.  

The EDPB considers that these general descriptions signal by themselves the complexity, massive scale 
and intrusiveness of the behavioural advertising practice that Meta IE conducts through the Facebook 
service. These are relevant facts to consider to assess the appropriateness of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as 
a legal basis for behavioural advertising and to what extent reasonable users may understand and 
expect behavioural advertising when they accept the  Facebook Terms of Service and perceive it as 
necessary for Meta IE to deliver its service176. Accordingly, the EDPB further considers that the IE SA 
could have added to its Draft Decision a description of behavioural advertising that Meta IE conducts 
through the Facebook service to appropriately substantiate its reasoning leading to its acceptance of

Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis for that practice in accordance with the IE SA’s duty to state the 
reasons for an individual decision177.  

In  the  same  vein,  the  EDPB  also  finds  that  the  content  of  the  Gallup  Institute  poll,  which  the 
Complainant’s representative requested and subsequently submitted to the IE SA in its submission of 
20 November 2019, could have been part of the facts of the Draft Decision178. This poll provides a 
supplementary  and  useful  indication  on  the  perspective  of  Facebook  users,  which  helps  assessing 
whether they could expect being subject to behavioural advertising as part of a contract. The results 
of the poll allege, inter alia, that only 1.6% to 2.5% of the 1.000 respondents179, who are Facebook 
users,  understood  the  request  to  accept  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service  to  be  a  “contract”  that 
provides them with a contractual right to personalised advertisement. The IE SA acknowledges the 
Complainant’s  submission  of  this  poll  in  its  Draft  Decision  but  seemingly  dismisses  it  by  focusing 
primarily on what it considers as primary sources of factual evidence (primarily, the Facebook Terms 
of Service) and “matters in the public domain”180. Conversely, Meta IE seems to attach importance to 
this poll. Meta IE engaged an expert to produce a report (the “Vanhuele Report”) that Meta IE appends 
to Annex 2 of its pre-Article 65 submission to point to what Meta IE considers “serious flaws” in the 
report containing the poll and allege that the Complainant misinterpreted its results181. 

98.  Notwithstanding  the  EDPB’s  considerations  above,  the  EDPB  considers  that  there  is  sufficient 
information in the file for the EDPB to decide whether the IE SA needs to change its Draft Decision 
insofar  as it  rejects  the  Complainant’s claim that the GDPR does not permit Meta IE’s reliance  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process personal data in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of 
Service. 

99.  As  described  above  in  Section  4.1,  the  IE  SA  concludes  in  Finding  2  of  its  Draft  Decision  that  the 
Complainant’s  case  is  not  made  out  that  the  GDPR  does  not  permit  the  reliance  by  Facebook  on 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  in  the  context  of  its  offering  of  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service.  Neither 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  nor  any  other  provision  of  the  GDPR  precludes  Meta  IE  from  relying  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis to deliver a service, including behavioural advertising insofar as 
that forms a core part of the service182. The IE SA considers that, having regard to the specific terms 
of the contract and the nature of the service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE may 
in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a legal basis of the processing of users’ data necessary for

aimed at legal consequences needs to include a description of relevant facts, sound reasoning and a proper legal 
assessment.  These  requirements  essentially  serve  the  purpose  of  legal  certainty  and  legal  protection  of  the 
parties concerned. Applied to the area of data protection supervision this means that the controller, processor 
and complainant should be able to acknowledge all the reasons in order to decide whether they should bring the 
case  to trial.  Having  regard  to  the  decision  making  process  within  the  cooperation  mechanism,  CSAs likewise 
need to be in the position to decide on possibly taking actions (e.g. agree to the decision, provide their views on 
the subject matter)”). See also by analogy Judgement of the Court of Justice of 26 November 2013, Kendrion NV

the  provision  of  its  Facebook  service,  including  through  the  provision  of  behavioural  advertising 
insofar  as  this  forms  a  core  part  of  its  service  offered  to  and  accepted  by  its  users183.  The  IE  SA 
considers that a distinguishing feature and commercially essential element of the contract between 
Meta IE and the user is that the Facebook service is funded by targeted or personalised advertising to 
the user184. The IE SA considers this information clearly set out, publicly available and understandable 
by any reasonable user. Meta IE supports this conclusion of the IE SA185. 

100.  To assess these claims of the IE SA and Meta IE the EDPB considers it necessary to recall the general 
objectives that the GDPR pursues, which, must guide its interpretation, together with the wording of 
its provisions and its normative context186. 

101.  The GDPR develops the fundamental right to the protection of personal data found in Article 8(1) of 
the  EU  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  and  Article 16(1)  of  the  TFEU,  which  constitute  EU  primary 
law187. As the CJEU clarified, “an EU act must be interpreted, as far as possible, in such a way as not to 
affect its validity and in conformity with primary law as a whole and, in particular, with the provisions 
of the Charter. Thus, if the wording of secondary EU legislation is open to more than one interpretation, 
preference should be given to the interpretation which renders the provision consistent with primary 
law rather than to the interpretation which leads to its being incompatible with primary law”188. In the 
face of rapid technological developments and increases in the scale of data collection and sharing, the 
GDPR creates a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong 
enforcement, and built on the principle that natural persons should have control of their own personal 
data189. By ensuring a consistent, homogenous and equivalent high level of protection throughout the 
EU,  the  GDPR  seeks  to  ensure  the  free  movement  of  personal  data  within  the  EU190.  The  GDPR 
acknowledges that the right to data protection needs to be balanced against other fundamental rights 
and  freedoms,  such  as  the  freedom  to  conduct  a  business,  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of 
proportionality191 and has these considerations integrated into its provisions. The GDPR, pursuant to 
EU primary law, treats personal data as a fundamental right inherent to a data subject and his/her 
dignity, and not as a commodity data subjects can trade away through a contract192. The CJEU provided 
additional interpretative guidance by asserting that the fundamental rights of data subjects to privacy 
and the protection of their personal data override, as a rule, a controller’s economic interests193.  

102.  The principle of lawfulness of Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR is one of the main safeguards to the 
protection of personal data. It follows a restrictive approach whereby a controller may only process

the personal data of individuals if it is able to rely on one of the basis found in the exhaustive  and 
restrictive lists of the cases in which the processing of data is lawful under Article 6 GDPR194.  

103.  The  principle  of  lawfulness  goes  hand  in  hand  with  the  principles  of  fairness  and  transparency  in 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.  The  principle  of  fairness  includes,  inter  alia,  recognising  the  reasonable 
expectations of the data subjects, considering possible adverse consequences processing may have 
on them, and having regard to the relationship and potential effects of imbalance between them and 
the controller195.  

104.  The EDPB agrees with the IE SA and Meta IE that there is no hierarchy between these legal bases196. 
However, this does not mean that a controller, as Meta IE in the present case, has absolute discretion 
to choose the legal basis that suits better its commercial interests. The controller may only rely on one 
of the legal basis established under Article 6 GDPR if it is appropriate for the processing at stake197. A 
specific legal basis will be appropriate insofar as the processing can meet its requirements set by the 
GDPR198 and fulfil the objective of the GDPR to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons and 
in particular their right to the protection of personal data. The legal basis will not be appropriate if its 
application to a specific processing defeats this practical effect “effet utile” pursued by the GDPR and 
its Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6 GDPR199. These criteria stem from the content of the GDPR200 and the 
interpretation favourable to the rights of data subjects to be given thereto described in paragraph 101 
above. 

105.  The  GDPR makes  Meta IE, as a data controller  for the  processing  at stake, directly responsible  for 
complying  with  the  Regulation’s  principles,  including  the  processing  of  data  in  a  lawful,  fair  and 
transparent manner, and any obligations derived therefrom201. This obligation applies even where the 
practical  application  of  GDPR  principles  such  as  those  of  Article 5(1)(a)  and  Article (5)(2) GDPR  is 
inconvenient  or  runs  counter  to  the  commercial  interests  of  Meta  IE  and  its  business  model.  The 
controller is also obliged to be able to demonstrate that it meets these principles and any obligations 
derived therefrom, such as that it meets the specific conditions applicable to each legal basis202.  

106.  The  first  condition  to  be  able  to  rely  on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  as  a  legal  basis  to  process  the  data 
subject’s data is that a controller, in line with its accountability obligations under Article 5(2) GDPR,

controllers to comply with these principles if they have not first clearly identified the purposes of the processing, 
or if processing of personal data goes beyond what is necessary for the specified purposes. See also Section 6 of 
this Binding Decision on the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness.

has to be  able  to  demonstrate that  (a) a contract exists and (b) the  contract is valid  pursuant to 
applicable national contract laws203. 

107.  Both the IE SA and Meta IE consider that the Facebook Terms of Service make up the entire agreement 
between the Facebook user and Meta IE and that the Data Policy is simply a compliance document 
setting out information to fulfil the GDPR transparency obligations204. The IE SA thus considers that 
the contract for which the analysis based on Article 6(1)(b) must take place, is the Facebook Terms of 
Service only205.  

108.  The  IE  SA  and  Meta  IE  argue  that  the  GDPR  does  not  confer  a  broad  and  direct  competence  to 
supervisory authorities to interpret or assess the validity of contracts206. In its Draft Decision, the IE SA 
noted that the Complainant explicitly sought to have it investigate and make findings in respect of 
contract  and  consumer  law.  The  IE  SA  noted  that  this  falls  outside  of  the  remit  of  a  supervisory 
authority  under  the  GDPR  and  are  instead  within  the  competence  of  the  relevant  consumer  and 
competition authorities207.  

109.  The EDPB agrees that SAs do not have under the GDPR a broad and general competence in contractual 
matters. However, the EDPB considers that the supervisory tasks that the GDPR bestows on SAs imply 
a limited competence to assess a contract’s general validity insofar as this is relevant to the fulfilment 
of their tasks under the GDPR. Otherwise, the SAs would see their monitoring and enforcement task 
under  Article  57(1)(a) GDPR  limited to  actions such as  verifying  whether the  processing at stake  is 
necessary for the  performance  of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR), and whether a contract with a 
processor under Article 28(3) GDPR and data importer under Article 46(2) GDPR includes appropriate 
safeguards pursuant to the GDPR. Pursuant to the IE SA’s interpretation, the SAs would thus be obliged 
to always consider a contract valid, even in situations where it is manifestly evident that it is not, for 
instance because there is no proof of agreement between the two parties, or because the contract 
does not comply with its Member State’s rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in 
relation to a child208.  

110.  As the DE and NL SAs209 argue, the validity of the contract for the Facebook service between Meta IE 
and the Complainant is questionable given the strong indications that the Complainant was unaware 
of entering into a contract, and (as the IE SA establishes with its Finding 3 of its Draft Decision) serious 
transparency issues in relation to the  legal basis relied on.  In contract  law, as a general rule,  both 
parties  must be  aware  of the  substance  of  the  contract and  the  obligations  of both parties  to  the 
contract in order to willingly enter into such contract. 

111.  Notwithstanding the possible invalidity of the contract, the EDPB refers to its previous interpretative 
guidance  on  this  matter210  to  provide  below  its  analysis  on  whether  behavioural  advertising  is 
objectively necessary for Meta IE to provide its Facebook service to the user based on its Facebook 
Terms of Service and the nature of the service.

112.  The EDPB recalls211 that for the assessment of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, “[i]t is important 
to determine the exact rationale of the contract, i.e. its substance and fundamental objective, as it is 
against this that it will be tested whether the data processing is necessary for its performance”212. As 
the EDPB has previously stated, regard should be given to the particular aim, purpose, or objective of 
the service and, for applicability of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, it is required that the processing is objectively 
necessary for a purpose and integral to the delivery of that contractual service to the data subject213.  

113.  Moreover, the EDPB notes that the controller should be able to justify the necessity of its processing 
by reference to the fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. This depends not only 
on the controller’s perspective, but also on a reasonable data subject’s perspective when entering into 
the contract214. 

114.  The  IE  SA  accepts  the  EDPB’s  position215  that,  as  a  general  rule,  processing  of  personal  data  for 
behavioural  advertising  is  not  necessary  for  the  performance  of  a  contract  for  online  services216. 
However, the IE SA considers that in this particular case, having regard to the specific terms of the 
contract and the nature of the Facebook service provided and agreed upon by the parties, Meta IE 
may in principle rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to process the user’s data necessary for the provision of 
its service, including through the provision of behavioural advertising insofar as this forms a core part 
of that service offered to and accepted by users.  

115.  The  IE  SA  views  behavioural  advertising  as  a  “core”,  “fundamental”  and  “commercially  essential” 
element of the contract and the commercial transaction between Meta IE and the Facebook users217. 
In support of this consideration, the IE SA refers to the information provided in the Facebook Terms 
of Service under the headings: “Provide a personalized experience for you” and “Help you discover 
content, products, and services that may interest you”218. The information provided includes reference 
to ads and includes the statement that “[w]e use the data we have … to personalize your experience”. 
The IE SA further notes that the nature of the service being offered to Facebook users is set out in the 
first line of the Facebook Terms of Service,219 which reads textually: “Provide a personalized experience 
for  you:”.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  it  is  clear  that  the  Facebook  service  is  advertised  (and  widely 
understood) as one funded by personalised advertising and so, that any reasonable user would expect 
and understand and that this was the “bargain being struck, even if they [the users] might prefer that 
the market would offer them better alternative choices”220.  

116.  On this issue, the EDPB recalls that the concept of necessity has its own independent meaning under 
EU  law.  It  must  be  interpreted  in  a  manner  that  fully  reflects  the  objective  pursued  by  an  EU 
instrument, in this case, the GDPR221. Accordingly, the concept of necessity under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR

cannot be interpreted in a way that undermines this provision and the GDPR’s general objective of 
protecting the right to the protection of personal data222 or contradicts Article 8 of the Charter. On 
the  processing  of  data  in  the  Facebook  service,  Advocate  General  Rantos  supports  a  strict 
interpretation  of  the  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  among  other  legal  basis,  particularly  to  avoid  any 
circumvention of the requirement for consent223. 

117.  Meta IE promotes among its prospective and current users the perception that the main purpose the 
Facebook service serves and for which it processes its users’ data is to enable them to communicate 
with others. Meta IE presents its Facebook service in its landing website as a platform enabling users 
to “connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook” and at the beginning of its Facebook 
Terms of Service224 as being its mission “to give people the power to build community and bring the 
world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described 
below to you: (...)” which include in consecutive headings “Connect you with people and organizations 
you care about: (...)”; “Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you: 
(...)” and “Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you: (...)”.  

118.  The fact that the Facebook Terms of Service225 do not provide for any contractual obligation binding 
Meta IE to offer personalised advertising to the Facebook users and any contractual penalty if Meta 
IE fails to do so shows that, at least from the perspective of the Facebook user, this processing is not 
necessary to perform the contract. Providing personalised advertising to its users may be an obligation 
between  Meta  IE  and  the  specific  advertisers  that  pay  for  Meta  IE’s  targeted  display  of  their 
advertisements in the Facebook service to Facebook  users, but it is not presented as an obligation 
towards the Facebook users.  

119.  Nor does Meta IE’s business model of offering services, at no monetary cost for the user to generate 
income  by  behavioural  advertisement  to  support  its  Facebook  service,  among  others,  make  this 
processing necessary to perform the contract. Under the principle of lawfulness of the GDPR and its 
Article 6, it is the business model which must adapt itself and comply with the requirements that the 
GDPR sets out in general and for each of the legal bases and not the reverse. As the Advocate General 
Rantos  stressed  recently 
in  Facebook,  based  on 

in  his  opinion  on  Meta  IE’s  processing

223  C-252/21  Oberlandesgericht  Düsseldorf  request,  Opinion  of  the  Advocate  General  on  20  September  2022,

source of interpretation to underline the EDPB’s reasoning on the processing of data in the Facebook service, 
without prejudice to the case-law that the CJEU may create with its future judgments on the Cases C-252/21 and 
C-446/21).

Facebook and the products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer (the Facebook Products 
or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply.” While under Section 
1 of the Terms of Service Facebook announces that it “provides” the following services, Section 3 of the Terms 
of Service is overwritten with “Your Commitments to Facebook and Our Community”. While Facebook itself only 
“offers” various services, it makes clear that the Terms of Service unilaterally impose duties and obligations on 
the user. Otherwise, the user may face suspension or termination of her/his account pursuant to Section 4.2 of 
the Terms of Service. No (contractual) sanctions appear to apply in the event that Meta IE fails to provide or 
poorly performs one or more of these services.

Article 5(2) GDPR, it is the controller (Meta IE in this case) who is responsible for demonstrating that 
the personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR226.  

120.  As the EDPB provided in its guidance227 assessing what is “necessary” involves a combined, fact-based 
assessment of the processing “for the objective pursued and of whether it is less intrusive compared 
to other options  for achieving the same goal”. If there  are realistic, less  intrusive  alternatives, the 
processing is not “necessary”. Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  will not cover processing  that  is useful  but not 
objectively necessary for performing the contractual  service  or for taking relevant pre-contractual 
steps at the request  of  the  data  subject, even if it is necessary for the controller’s other business 
purposes. 

121.  On  the  question  of  whether  here  there  are  realistic,  less  intrusive  alternatives  to  behavioural 
advertising that make this processing not “necessary”228, the EDPB considers that there are. The AT, 
PL and SE SAs mention as examples contextual advertising based on geography, language and content, 
which do not involve intrusive measures such as profiling and tracking of users229. In his recent opinion 
on  Facebook,  Advocate  General  Rantos  also  refers  to  the  Austrian  Government’s  “pertinent” 
observation  that  in  the  past,  Meta  IE  allowed  Facebook  users  to  choose  between  a  chronological 
presentation and a personalised presentation of newsfeed content, which, in his view, proves that an 
alternative method is possible230. By considering the existence of alternative practices to behavioural 
advertising that are more respectful of the Facebook users’ right to data protection, the EDPB, as the 
Advocate  General,  aims  to  assess  if  this  processing  is  objectively  necessary  to  deliver  the  service 
offered, as perceived by the Facebook user whose personal data is processed, and not to dictate the 
nature of Meta IE’s service or impose specific business models on controllers, as Meta IE and the IE SA 
respectively argue231. The EDPB considers that Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not cover processing which 
is useful but not objectively necessary for performing the contractual service, even if it is necessary 
for the controller’s other business purposes232.  

122.  The EDPB considers that the absolute right available to data subjects, under Article 21(2)(3) GDPR to 
object  to  the  processing  of  their  data  (including  profiling)  for  direct  marketing  purposes  further 
supports  its  consideration  that,  as  a  general  rule,  the  processing  of  personal  data  for  behavioural 
advertising is not necessary to perform a contract. The processing cannot be necessary to perform a 
contract if a subject has the possibility to opt out from it at any time, and without providing any reason.

123.  The EDPB finds that a reasonable user cannot expect that their personal data is being processed for 
behavioural advertising simply because Meta IE briefly refers to this processing in the Facebook Terms 
of  Service  (which  Meta  IE  and  the  IE  SA  consider  as  constituting  the  entirety  of  the  contract),  or 
because  of the  “wider circumstances”  or “recognised public awareness of behavioural advertising” 
derived  from  its  “widespread  prevalence”  to  which  the  IE  SA  refers233.  Behavioural  advertising,  as 
briefly described in paragraph 95 above, is a set of processing operations of personal data of great 
technical  complexity,  which  has  a  particularly  massive  and  intrusive  nature.  In  view  of  the 
characteristics of behavioural advertising, coupled with the very brief and insufficient information that 
Meta provides about it in the Facebook Terms of Service and Data Policy (a separate document that 
the  IE SA and Meta IE do not even consider  part of  the  contractual obligations),  the  EDPB  finds it 
extremely difficult to argue that an average user can fully grasp it, be aware of its consequences and 
impact on their rights to privacy and data protection, and reasonably expect it  solely based on the 
Facebook  Terms  of  Service.  The  EDPB  recalls  its  Guidelines  2/2019  in  which  it  argues  that  the 
expectations of the average data subject need to be consider in light, not only of the terms of service 
but  also  the  way  this  service  is  promoted  to  users234.  Advocate  General  Rantos  expresses  similar 
doubts where he says in relation to Facebook behavioural advertising practices “I am curious as to 
what  extent  the  processing  might  correspond  to  the  expectations  of  an  average  user  and,  more 
generally, what ‘degree of personalisation’ the user can expect from the service he or she signs up 
for”235 and adds in a footnote that he does not “believe that the collection and use of personal data 
outside  Facebook  are  necessary  for  the  provision  of  the  services  offered  as  part  of  the  Facebook 
profile”236. 

124.  Based on the considerations above, the EDPB considers that the main purpose for which users use 
Facebook and accept the Facebook Terms of Service is to communicate with others, not to receive 
personalised advertisements. 

125.  Meta 

IE 

its 

infringed 

transparency  obligations  under  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and 
Article 13(1)(c) GDPR  by  not  clearly  informing  the  Complainant  and  other  users  of  the  Facebook 
service’s specific processing operations, the personal data processed in them, the specific purpose 
they serve, and the legal basis on which each of the processing operations relies, as the IE SA concludes 
in its Draft Decision237. The EDPB considers that this fundamental failure of Meta IE to comply with its 
transparency  obligations  contradicts  the  IE  SA’s  finding238  that  Facebook  users  could  reasonably 
expect online behavioural advertising as being necessary for the  performance of their contract (as 
described in the Facebook Terms of Service) with Meta IE.  

126.  The EDPB recalls that “controllers should make sure to avoid any confusion as to what the applicable 
legal  basis  is”  and  that  this  is  “particularly  relevant  where  the  appropriate  legal  basis  is 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and a contract regarding online services is entered into by data subjects”, because 
“[d]epending on the circumstances, data subjects may erroneously get the impression that they are 
giving their consent in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR when signing a contract or accepting terms of

service”239. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR requires the existence, validity of a contract, and the processing being 
necessary to perform it. These conditions cannot be met where one of the Parties (in this case the 
data subject) is not provided with sufficient information to know that they are signing a contract, the 
processing of personal data that it involves, for which specific purposes and on which legal basis, and 
how this processing is necessary to perform the services delivered. These transparency requirements 
are  not  only  an  additional  and  separate  obligation,  as  the  IE  SA  seems  to  imply240,  but  also  an 
indispensable and constitutive part of the legal basis. 

127.  The  risks  to  the  rights  of  data  subjects  derived  from  this  asymmetry  of  information  and  an 
inappropriate reliance on this legal basis are higher in situations such as in the present case, in which 
the  Complainant  and other  Facebook  users  face  a  “take  it  or leave it”  situation resulting from the 
standard contract pre-formulated by Meta IE and the lack of few alternative services in the market. 
The EU legislator has regularly identified and aimed to address with multiple legal instruments these 
risks and the imbalance between the parties to consumer contracts. For example, Directive 93/13/EEC 
on unfair terms in consumer contracts241 mandates, as the transparency obligations under the GDPR, 
the  use  of  plain,  intelligible  language  in  the  terms  of  the  contracts  offered  to  consumers242.  This 
Directive even provides that where there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation 
most favourable to the consumer shall prevail243. Processing of personal data that is based on what is 
deemed to be an unfair term under this Directive will generally not be consistent with the requirement 
under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR that the processing is lawful and fair244.  

128.  Advocate General Rantos concludes in reference to Meta IE that the fact that an undertaking providing 
a social network enjoys a dominant position in the domestic market for online social networks for 
private users “does play a role in the assessment of the freedom of consent within the meaning of that 
provision, which it is for the controller to demonstrate, taking  into account, where appropriate, the 
existence of a clear imbalance of power between the data subject and the controller, any requirement 
for consent to the processing of personal data other than those strictly necessary for the provision of 
the services in question, the need for consent to be specific for each purpose of processing and the 
need to prevent the withdrawal of consent from being detrimental to users who withdraw it”245. In line 
with the logic of this argument, the EDPB considers that the dominant position of Facebook also plays 
an important role  in the  assessment of Meta IE’s reliance  on Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  for its Facebook 
service  and  its  risks  to  data  subjects,  especially  considering  how  deficiently  Meta  IE  informs  the 
Facebook users of the data it strictly needs to process to deliver the service. 

129.  Given  that  the  main  purpose  for  which  a  user  uses  the  Facebook  service  is  to  communicate  with 
others246,  and  that  Meta  IE  conditions  its  use  to  the  user’s  acceptance  of  a  contract  and  the 
behavioural advertising it includes, the EDPB cannot see how a user would have the option of opting

out of a particular processing which is part of the contract as the IE SA seems to argue247. The users’ 
lack  of  choice  in  this  respect  would  rather  indicate  that  Meta  IE’s  reliance  on  the  contractual 
performance legal basis deprives users of their rights, among others, to withdraw their consent under 
Article 6(1)(a)  GDPR  and Article 7  GDPR  and/or  to object  to  the  processing of their data based on 
Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

130.  The EDPB agrees with the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT, and SE SAs248 that there is a risk that the Draft 
Decision’s failure to establish Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, pursuant to the IE SA’s 
interpretation of it, nullifies this provision and makes lawful theoretically any collection and reuse of 
personal data in connection with the performance of a contract with a data subject. Meta IE currently 
leaves the Complainant and other users of the Facebook service with a single choice. They may either 
contract away their right to freely determine the processing of their personal data and submit to its 
processing for the obscure and intrusive purpose of behavioural advertising, which they can neither 
expect, nor fully understand based on the insufficient information Meta IE provides to them. Or, they 
may decline accepting the Facebook Terms of Service and thus be excluded from a service that enables 
them  to  communicate  with  millions  of  users  and  for  which  there  are  currently  few  realistic 
alternatives.  This  exclusion  would  thus  also  adversely  affect  their  freedom  of  expression  and 
information.  

131.  This precedent could encourage other economic operators to use the contractual performance legal 
basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for all their processing of personal data. There would be  the risk that 
some  controllers  argue  some  connection  between  the  processing  of  the  personal  data  of  their 
consumers and the contract to collect, retain and process as much personal data from their users as 
possible  and advance  their economic interests at the  expense of  the  safeguards for data subjects. 
Some of the safeguards from which data subjects would be deprived due to an inappropriate use of 
Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  as  legal  basis,  instead  of  others  such  as  consent  6(1)(a)  GDPR  and  legitimate 
interest 6(1)(f) GDPR, are the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and 
not to others and to the further processing of their personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); their freedom 
to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR); their right to be forgotten (Article 17 GDPR); and the balancing 
exercise of the legitimate interests of the controller against their interests or fundamental rights and 
freedoms  (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).  As  a  result,  owing  to  the  number  of  users,  market  power,  and 
influence of Meta IE and its economically attractive business model, the risks derived from the current 
findings of the Draft Decision could go beyond the Complainant and the millions of users of Facebook 
service in the EEA and affect the protection of the hundreds of millions of people covered by the GDPR.  

132.  The EDPB thus concurs with the objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs249 to Finding 
2 of the Draft Decision in that the behavioural advertising performed by Meta IE in the context of the 
Facebook service is objectively not necessary for the performance of Meta IE’s alleged contract with 
data users for the Facebook service and is not an essential or core element of it.  

133.  In conclusion, the  EDPB  decides  that  Meta IE has inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  to 
process  the  Complainant’s  personal  data  in  the  context  of  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service  and 
therefore lacks a legal basis to process these data for the purpose of behavioural advertising. Meta IE

has not relied on any other legal basis to process personal data in the context of the Facebook Terms 
of  Service  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural  advertising.  Meta  IE  has  consequently  infringed 
Article 6(1) GDPR  by  unlawfully  processing  personal  data.  The  EDPB  instructs  the  IE  SA  to  alter  its 
Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the 
context  of  its  offering  of  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service,  and  to  include  an  infringement  of 
Article 6(1) GDPR based on the shortcomings that the EDPB has identified.  

 

5  ON  WHETHER  THE  LSA’S  DRAFT  DECISION  INCLUDES  SUFFICIENT 
ANALYSIS  AND  EVIDENCE  TO  CONCLUDE  THAT  META  IE  IS  NOT 
OBLIGED TO RELY ON CONSENT TO PROCESS THE COMPLAINANT’S 
PERSONAL DATA 

5.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

134.  The IE SA concludes, as a matter of fact, in its Draft Decision that Meta IE did not rely, or purport to 
rely, on the Complainant’s consent to process personal data to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service 
and is not legally obliged to rely on consent to do so250.  

135.  The IE SA accepts that Meta IE never sought to obtain consent from users through the clicking of the 
“Accept” button in the Facebook Terms of Service, based also on Meta IE’s confirmation thereto251.  

136.  The IE SA distinguishes between agreeing to a contract (which may involve the processing of data) and 
providing  consent  to  personal  data  processing  specifically  for  the  purposes  of  legitimising  that 
personal data processing under the GDPR. The IE SA observes that, as noted by the EDPB, these are 
entirely different concepts which “have different requirements and legal consequences”252. 

137.  The IE SA also emphasizes that there is no hierarchy between the legal bases that controllers may use 
to process personal data under the GDPR253. The IE SA further argues that neither Article 6(1) GPDR 
nor any other provision in the GDPR require that the processing of data in particular contexts must 
necessarily be based on consent under Article 6(1)(a)GDPR254. The IE SA argues the GDPR does not 
provide that the specific nature and content of a contract, freely entered into by two parties, requires 
a higher category or “default” legal basis. The IE SA includes reference to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR which assert that where data processing is necessary to perform a contract, 
consent is not an appropriate lawful basis on which to rely255.  

138.  The IE SA considers Article 7 GDPR and its conditions do not in and of themselves indicate the legal 
basis on which a controller should rely on in a particular context256. The IE SA contends that these

conditions would only be relevant where the controller relies upon consent as the legal basis for its 
processing, which it views as not being the case for the processing of data by Meta IE in question. 

5.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

139.  The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs object to the assessment in the Draft Decision on consent, leading to 
Finding 1 of the IE SA257. These SAs put forward several factual and legal arguments for the changes 
they propose to the Draft Decision.  

140.  The SE SA holds that if the EDPB were to find that the processing can rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the 
investigation  needs  to  encompass  whether  special  categories  of  personal  data  pursuant  to 
Article 9(1) GDPR are processed, since the performance of a contract is not an exemption pursuant to 
Article 9(2) GDPR. Since the SE SA presents its objection as being contingent on whether the EDPB 
finds  that  the  data  processing  in  Facebook,  based  on  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service,  can  rely  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR258 and the EDPB finds that Meta IE inappropriately relied on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
(see above in Section 4.4.2), the SE SA’s objection is no longer applicable.  

Arguments on the finding of the LSA that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent 

141.  The AT, DE, NL and PT SAs consider that the IE SA has not included enough analysis, evidence and 
research in the Draft Decision to conclude that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to 
process the Complainants’ data259.  

142.  The AT SA points out that the IE SA limits its facts and its legal assessment to the general question 
whether Article 6(1)(b) GDPR can be used as legal basis, specifically for behavioural advertising260. The 
Draft Decision does not clarify which data categories are being used for behavioural advertising and 
where  Meta  IE  relies  on  Article 6(1)(a)  and  on  6(1)(b) GDPR  for  behavioural  advertising.  Also 
unaddressed  is,  if  and  to  which  extent,  Meta  IE  relies  on  Article 9(2)(a)  GDPR  for  behavioural 
advertising as far as sensitive data are concerned and whether Meta IE respected the GDPR conditions 
(for  example  Article 7 GDPR)  when  obtaining  the  consent  pursuant  to  Articles 6(1)(a)  and 
9(2)(a) GDPR. The AT SA argues that the Draft Decision did not address the part of the complaint on 
the differences between “consent” and “contractual performance” and regarding Article 9 GDPR.  

143.  Even though the DE SAs share the IE SA’s finding that Meta IE did not rely on consent for the processing 
of data as described in the Facebook Terms of Service, the DE SAs object against the IE SA’s assessment 
that  in  the  specific  case  at  issue  Meta  IE  was  not  legally  obliged  to  obtain  consent  from  the 
Complainant261. The DE SAs further add, also in relation to the potential use of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as 
a legal basis, that further investigations on the specific processing activities, purposes and their risks 
for rights and freedoms of the Complainant would be necessary to conclude an assessment on the 
applicable legal basis262.

144.  The NL SA sees as a grave omission in the Draft Decision the lack of any substantive investigation into 
what  kind  of  personal  data  is  being  processed  besides  relying  on  information  submitted  by  the 
controller263. The NL SA considers that there are clear indications that consent is legally required for 
(parts of) the processing operations of the controller, and that the IE SA could thus draw a different 
conclusion on the basis of further inquiries and analysis264. The NL SA considers that the Draft Decision 
should be amended if a further inquiry by the IE SA establishes that  reliance on consent as a legal 
ground is mandatory265.  

145.  The PT SA agrees with the IE SA’s position in paragraph 3.18 in the Draft Decision on the need to always 
verify on the basis of the contract and the data processing actually carried out what legal bases each 
data processing at issue relies on, which may be on Article 6(1)(b), (a) and/or (f) GDPR266. The PT SA 
adds that it is precisely because a duly reasoned case-by-case verification is required that it cannot 
accept  the  IE  SA’s  conclusion  in  paragraph  3.26  of  the  Draft  Decision  that  the  legal  basis  for  the 
processing of data under  the  Facebook  Terms of Service  does  not, as a matter of law, have  to be 
consent without that analysis being expressed and substantiated in the Draft Decision267. The PT SA 
argues that it is not possible for the IE SA to draw proper legal conclusions on the need for consent, 
without having set out the relevant facts and the reasons given on the GDPR, which, in its view, the IE 
SA clearly did not do268.  

146.  In addition, the DE and FR SAs consider that even if Meta IE had relied on consent, it would not have 
met the requirements of Article 7(1) GDPR as being “freely given”, as the service is conditional on the 
use  of  the  Facebook  service  as  a  whole  (“take  it  or  leave  it”)269.  Nor  would  consent  meet  the 
requirements of Article 7(2) GDPR since, as the IE SA finds, information on the processing of data as 
described in the Facebook Terms of Service, is not provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and 
easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. 

Arguments on the possible breach of the obligation to rely on consent to process special categories of 
personal data (Article 9 GDPR) 

147.  The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs consider that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed 
any  processing  of  special  categories  of  personal  data  under  Article 9 GDPR  in  the  context  of  the 
Facebook Terms of Service270. The DE and FR SAs conclude that Meta IE processes the entire amount 
of  data  it  holds,  including  special  categories  of  data,  without  a  legal  basis,  and  thus  in  breach  of 
Articles 6 and 9 GDPR271. The AT, NL and PT SAs272 take the view that the IE SA should broaden the 
scope of its investigation and examine whether the conditions for the processing of special categories 
of personal data have been met by Meta IE. 

148.  The AT, FR, NL, and PT SAs consider that the factual background of the Draft Decision misses facts on 
whether Meta IE relies on Article 9(1)(a) GDPR to process special categories of personal data for the

purpose of behavioural advertising and whether Meta IE respects the requirements of the GDPR, such 
as those of its Article 7, in obtaining consent to that end273. 

149.  The FR, NL, and PT SAs argue that the data that Meta IE’s processing may include special categories of 
personal  data  under  Article 9 GDPR274.  The  DE  SAs  contend  that  nothing  indicates  that  Meta  IE 
excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes275.  

150.  The  FR SA states  that,  in a first analysis, informal verifications show  that when people  fill in their 
Facebook  profiles,  no  particular  method  is  made  available  to  them  to  ensure  that  they  explicitly 
consent, on the basis of clear information, to the collection and processing of sensitive data by Meta 
IE in its Facebook service276. The FR SA refers to previous decisions and corrective measures it took 
against Meta IE on this issue on 26 January 2016 and 27 April 2017277.  

151.  The FR SA considers that in view of the current conditions under which the company requests the 
consent of individuals for the  processing of their data, it cannot use  the  legal basis of contractual 
performance  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, 
consent 
Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and Article 9 GDPR and that breaches of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR should then be 
observed.

and 

152.  The  NL  SA  sees  strong  indications  on  the  processing  of  photographs  and  other  images  with  facial 
recognition technology 278. The NL SA is also concerned that the information shared among users of 
the platform may include personal data concerning their health. The DE, FR, NL, PT SAs recall that only 
consent may be used in this context among the exceptions that Article 9(2) GDPR lays down to the 
general prohibition of processing special categories of data279.  

Arguments on other types of data requiring consent 

153.  The NL SA identifies as another indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation 
to seek consent the fact that the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has 
been collected through cookies for online advertising purposes and of location data280.  

Risks 

154.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs consider that, as the subject of the complaint was 
the processing as described in the Facebook Terms of Service there is also a significant risk for the 
fundamental rights  and freedoms of all Facebook  users in the  European Union that  their personal 
data, including data of special categories  are processed without any legal basis281. The  AT SA also 
considers that the compliance of Meta IE with the GDPR rules on the processing of special categories

of data goes beyond the case at stake and affects hundreds of millions of data subjects within the EEA, 
as Meta IE is the provider of the biggest social media network in the world282.  

155.  The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs argue that the IE SA’s conclusion that consent is not required affects 

the rights of data subjects and their control over their personal data283.  

156.  The  AT  SA  argues  that  the  first  risk  is  that  the  data  subject’s  right  to  lodge  a  complaint  with  a 
supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because the IE SA did not 
handle the complaint in its entire scope, including sensitive data pursuant to Article 9 GPDR284. The AT 
SA argues that this is not in line with the CJEU ruling C-311/18, which provides that the supervisory 
authority must handle complaints with all due diligence285. 

157.  The FR SA argues that the Draft Decision poses a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
individuals  concerned,  according  to  Article 4(24) GDPR,  insofar  as  the  legal  basis  of  contractual 
performance to process the personal data of Facebook users to send them targeted advertising does 
not allow the European users to have control over the fate of their data286. The FR SA also notes that 
since the Draft Decision will be taken at the end of a cooperation procedure and made public, it could 
be  interpreted  as  reflecting  the  common  position  of  the  European  supervisory  authorities  on  this 
issue, and setting a precedent for accepting that a company may use the legal basis of the contract to 
process its users’ data for targeted advertising purposes when such processing is particularly massive 
and intrusive287.  

158.  The NL SA specifies the protections from which the data subjects would be deprived due to the IE SA’s 
conclusion that consent is not required, such as the right to data portability (Article 20(1) GDPR); the 
possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to others and to the further 
processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the  freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) 
and the subsequent right to be forgotten288.  

159.  The AT, DE, and NL SAs note as an additional risk that sensitive personal data falling within the scope 

of Article 9 GDPR is processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9(2) GDPR289.  

160.  The  NL  SA  underlines  the  risk  that  allowing  the  bypassing  of  legal  provisions  requiring  consent  to 

process data creates legal uncertainty that hampers the free flow of personal data within the EU290. 

161.  The NL SA also argues that not assessing the processing in a sufficiently thorough manner could create 
a  precedent  for  controllers  to  exclude  from  their  privacy  policies  or  terms  of  service  processing

operations that must be based on consent. This would risk leaving data subjects with a reduced degree 
of transparency291.  

5.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

162.  The IE SA considers the objections not reasoned and does not follow them292.  

163.  The IE SA argues that the scope of the inquiry is appropriate and relates to the issues raised in the 
complaint293. The IE SA also argues that finding of additional infringements which have not been fully 
investigated or put to the controller would impose a risk of procedural unfairness by depriving the 
controller of its right to be heard in response to a particularized allegation of wrongdoing294. 

164.  The IE SA notes that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry, taking into account 
the scope of the written complaint as lodged295. The IE SA argues that it would not have been possible 
to assess  each discrete  processing operation by Facebook, without first resolving the  fundamental 
dispute  between the  parties  on the  interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR. The  IE SA considers that it 
would have been inappropriate and disproportionate for it to undertake an open-ended assessment 
of all of Facebook’s processing operations related to  the  Facebook  Terms of Service  to handle  the 
complaint.   

165.  The IE SA argues that its analysis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR does not preclude the possibility that certain 
discrete processing operations by Facebook may fall outside the scope of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR296. The 
IE SA finds it reasonable and practical to set the scope of the inquiry, focusing on the principled issues 
of dispute, which it considers as not prejudicing the operation of more specific data protection rules.  

166.  The IE SA considers that the reference to Article 9 GDPR processing by Meta IE is an element of what 
it views as the Complainant’s fundamental allegation: that the agreement to the Facebook Terms of 
Service is a form of GDPR consent to processing of personal data, including consent to the processing 
of special categories of data297. The IE SA argues that since the scope of its inquiry addresses this issue, 
it is not necessary for it to also conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of Meta IE’s 
processing that may otherwise fall within the scope of Article 9 GDPR. 

167.  The  IE SA notes that under Irish national law, there  would be  a very significant risk  of  procedural 
unfairness  to  Meta IE  if the  IE SA assumed, without  any further  factual examination, that  Meta IE 
unlawfully processes special categories of personal data298. 

168.  According to the IE SA, the CSAs objecting to the Draft Decision intend to maximise the Complainant’s 
rights by requiring consent-based processing for certain processing operations and thus prioritising it 
over other legal basis299. The IE SA considers that very extensive data protection rights also apply under 
the GDPR where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(b) or (f) GDPR. The IE SA contends that the 
variation in the extent of data subject rights and protections, depending on the applicable legal basis,

is an inherent element of the legislative scheme of the GDPR. The IE SA considers that Article 6 GDPR 
does not provide that the “appropriate” data subject rights determine the legal basis for processing. 
The IE SA notes that separate to the user’s acceptance of the Facebook Terms of Service, Meta IE relies 
on different “acts” of consent for specific aspects of the service, including personalised advertising 
based on users’ off-Facebook activities, and to process their GPS location data. In this regard, the IE 
SA states that the complaint in this case was about the agreement to the Facebook Terms of Service 
and the processing it entails once accepted.  

169.  The IE SA argues that their objections are inconsistent with the principle of legal certainty, as cited in 
Recital 7 GDPR300. The IE SA indicates that it is not satisfied that the GDPR requires the limitation of 
processing for the purposes of behavioural advertising to situations where processing is based on data 
subject  consent301.  The  IE SA  contends that interpretative  approach of the CSAs raising objections 
would result in the arbitrary application of more restrictive data protection rules for reasons that are 
not found in the GDPR. The IE SA also argues that this approach does not take due account of the 
extensive data protection rights which apply to all legal bases under the GDPR. The IE SA asserts that 
it is not open to the supervisory authorities to create additional binding limitations on the applicable 
legal  basis  for  the  processing  of  data  for  behavioural  advertising.  The  IE  SA  states  that  it  is  the 
legislator, not the supervisory authorities, which has defined the conditions for lawful processing.  

5.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

5.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

170.  The EDPB responds to Meta IE’s primary argument to the contrary in Section 4.4.1 above302.  

171.  The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs objections all have a direct connection with the LSA Draft Decision and 
refer to a specific part of the Draft Decision, i.e. Finding 1. The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs argue that 
the IE SA has not included enough analysis, evidence and research in the Draft Decision to conclude 
that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process the Complainants’ data303. According 
to  these  CSAs,  the  IE  SA  should  have  identified  and  separately  assessed  any  processing  of  special 
categories of personal data in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service304. They consider that the 
IE  SA  should  broaden  the  scope  of  its  investigation  and  examine  whether  the  conditions  for  the 
processing of special categories of personal data have been met by Meta IE. The FR, NL, and PT SAs 
argue  that the  data that  Meta IE  processes may  include  special categories of personal data under 
Article 9 GDPR305. The DE SAs contend that nothing indicates that Meta IE excludes these categories 
of data from its processing for advertising purposes. The  AT, DE, FR, NL,  and  PT SAs challenge  the 
reasoning underlying the conclusion reached by the LSA. Following their assessment would lead to a

301 Composite Response, paragraph 40. 
302 Meta IE argues that “Objections which raise matters which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry are not 
‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR” and such objections “ought to be disregarded 
in their entirety by the EDPB”. The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See paragraphs 
71-73.

different conclusion insofar as the IE SA would fully cover the complaint and include facts and a legal 
assessment  on  processing  operations  subject  to  Article 6(1)(a),  Article 7  and  Article 9 GDPR,  which 
may reveal an infringement by Meta IE306.  

172.  Consequently, the  EDPB finds that  the  AT, DE, FR, NL,  and  PT SAs  objections relating to Finding 1, 
which states that Meta IE is not required to rely on consent to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service 
and its underlying reasoning, and referring to Meta IE’s possible infringements of Article 6(1)(a) and 
Article 9 GDPR are relevant. 

173.  The  objections  are  reasoned  because  they  include  clarifications  and  arguments  on  legal/factual 
mistakes in the LSA’s Draft Decision that require amending. The AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs consider 
that the IE SA should have identified and separately assessed any processing of special categories of 
personal data under Article 9 GDPR in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service307. In particular, 
the  FR,  NL,  PT  SAs  argue  that  the  data  that  Meta  IE  processes  may  include  special  categories  of 
personal  data  under  Article 9 GDPR308.  The  DE  SAs  contend  that  nothing  indicates  that  Meta  IE 
excludes these categories of data from its processing for advertising purposes309. The AT, DE, FR, NL, 
and  PT  SAs  recall  that  only  consent  may  be  used  in  this  context  among  the  exceptions  that 
Article 9(2) GDPR lays down to the general prohibition of processing special categories of data310. The 
NL SA identifies as another indicator contradicting the IE SA’s conclusion that there is no obligation to 
seek consent the fact that the controller processes a significant amount of personal data that has been 
collected  through  cookies  for  online  advertising  purposes  and  of  location  data311.  The  NL  SA  also 
argues that the IE SA should have investigated more into the safeguards that are implemented by the 
controller to address the specific interests of children312.  

174.  On the risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs313 explain that the IE SA’s 
Finding 1 - providing that consent is not required - puts at risk the rights of data subjects and their 
control over their personal data. The AT SA mentions the risk that the data subject’s right to lodge a 
complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR becomes ineffective because 
the  IE  SA  does  not  handle  it  in  its  entire  scope,  including  special  categories  of  data  under 
Article 9 GDPR. The FR SA argues that the Draft Decision could set a precedent for accepting the use 
of the contractual performance legal basis to process users’ data for behavioural advertising purposes, 
which it views as particularly massive and intrusive. The NL SA specifies that the data subjects could 
be deprived of the following protections derived from the use of consent: the right to data portability 
(Article 20(1) GDPR); the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing operations and not to 
others and to the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR); the freedom to withdraw 
consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right to be forgotten314. The AT, DE, and NL SAs also note

as an additional risk that special categories of personal data falling within the scope of Article 9 GDPR 
are processed without meeting the requirements of Article 9(2) GDPR315. The NL SA also underlines 
the  risk  that this conclusion creates  legal uncertainty that hampers the free  flow  of personal data 
within the EU316. The NL SA further adds the risk that the decision could create by setting a precedent 
for controllers to exclude from their privacy policies or terms of service processing operations based 
on consent, thus undermining the principle of transparency317.  

175.  The  EDPB  concludes  that  the  objections  mentioned  above  are  relevant  and  reasoned  (cf. 

Article 4(24) GDPR).  

176.  However, the part of the NL SA objection asking the IE SA to include in its Draft Decision the elements 
concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices 
under ePrivacy legislation falls outside the scope of the EDPB’s mandate318.  

5.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

177.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, in the context of a dispute resolution procedure the EDPB 
shall take  a binding decision concerning all the  matters which are the subject of the relevant and 
reasoned objections, in particular whether there is an infringement of the GDPR.  

178.  The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection319 require 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed on its Finding 1, which concludes 
that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Facebook 
Terms of Service and (b) is not legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so. When assessing the 
merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on the objections 
and its submissions. 

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

179.  In its submissions, Meta IE supports the IE SA’s conclusion that Meta IE does not rely on consent for 

the purposes of behavioural advertising and is not required to rely on it320.  

180.  Meta IE states that it does not seek or rely on consent as its legal basis for purposes of processing 
personal  data  to  provide  behavioural  advertising,  except  in  limited  circumstances  where  Meta  IE 
separately obtains consent, yet not through the Facebook Terms of Service321. Meta IE claims that it 
explains in its Data Policy to data subjects that Meta IE relies on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR 
“(f)or  using  data  that  advertisers  and  other  partners  provide  us  about  your  activity  off  of  Meta 
Company  Products,  so  we  can  personalise  ads  we  show  you  on  Meta  Company  Products  and  on 
websites, apps and Devices that use  our advertising services”  and that it has a specific process  for 
obtaining this consent that satisfies the requirements of Article 7 GDPR, “entirely separate from any 
interaction by users with the Terms of Service or Data Policy and which was not part of the Complaint

and was not examined” in the IE SA’s inquiry322. Meta IE submits that the Complaint is limited to the 
question  of  whether  Meta  IE  seeks  forced  consent  to  data  processing  through  acceptance  of  the 
Facebook Terms of Service. Meta IE then asserts that since it does not seek, obtain, or rely on consent 
as a legal basis under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR to process user data via the Facebook Terms of Service, the 
inquiry should end there and all unrelated assertions in the objections should be disregarded323.  

181.  Meta IE alleges that some CSAs suggest that behavioural advertising must in all cases be based on 
consent, and in doing so, the CSAs suggest an approach that prioritises consent-based processing over 
other legal basis thereby creating a binding limitation for the processing for the purpose of behavioural 
advertising324. Meta IE agrees with the IE SA’s assertion that any approach limiting the legal basis on 
which a controller could rely would not be consistent with the principle of legal certainty325. Meta IE 
contends that the GDPR contains no express references to behavioural advertising and establishes no 
specific limitations on the available legal basis for such processing326. Meta IE considers that the GDPR 
was drafted in a way that protects data subjects while affording flexibility to controllers and that its 
application is highly dependent on facts and circumstances underlying the relevant processing and the 
nature of the service providers327.  

182.  Meta  IE  contends  that  the  CSAs  have  failed  to  give  sufficient  consideration  to  extensive  data 
protection rights that apply to all legal bases328.  Meta  IE argues  that in defining the  conditions for 
lawful processing, the EU legislature has ensured that appropriate data protection rights would be 
afforded to data subjects no matter what legal basis is relied on and extensive data protection rights 
apply to all legal bases329. Meta IE supports the IE SA’s view that Article 6 GDPR does not require legal 
bases to be determined by reference to the applicable data subject rights for each basis330. 

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

183.  The EDPB notes that the Draft Decision that the IE SA submitted via the Article 60 GDPR procedure 
results  from  an  inquiry  that  the  IE  SA  conducted  based  on  a  complaint  from  a  data  subject  and 
Facebook user331. The AT SA forwarded this complaint to the IE SA as LSA in the case, given Meta IE’s 
main establishment in Ireland.  

184.  In  this  complaint,  the  Complainant  alleges  that  Meta  IE  violated  Articles 5,  6,  7  and  9 GDPR.  The 
Complainant argues that it is unclear to what the data subject has consented when the data subject 
agreed to  the  Facebook  Terms of  Service  and Privacy Policy332. More specifically,  the  Complainant 
points out that it remains unclear which exact processing operations the controller chooses to base 
on each specific legal basis under Articles 6 and 9 GDPR333. The Complainant argues that the Facebook 
Terms of Service  and Privacy Policy also include  special categories  of data under Article 9(1) GDPR 
because  the data subject, as a Facebook  user, has interacted with various groups and individuals,

which would inevitably reveal the data subject’s political affiliations, religious views, sexual orientation 
and health  conditions, even if  the  data subject has not directly  put them in  their  “profile”334.  The 
Complainant claims that the controller also allows to target such information for advertisement335. 
The Complainant considers that it would be necessary for the SA to investigate the concrete subject 
of the alleged consent and the legal basis for all processing operations and to request the record of 
processing activities under Article 30(4) GDPR336. 

185.  Based on the  scope  of  IE SA’s  investigation into this complaint, the  EDPB considers that  the  IE SA 

decided to limit the scope of its Draft Decision to the following legal issues: 

o 

o 

o 

Issue 1 – Whether clicking on the “accept” button constitutes or must be considered 
consent for the purposes of the GDPR  
Issue  2  –  Reliance  on  Article 6(1)(b)  GDPR  as  a  lawful  basis  for  personal  data 
processing  
Issue 3 – Whether Facebook provided the requisite information on the legal basis 
for processing on foot of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and whether it did so in a transparent 
manner337.  
 

 

186.  The IE SA argues that it has discretion to determine the framework of the inquiry taking into account 
the  scope  of  the  written  complaint  as  lodged338.  The  IE  SA  considers  that  it  would  not  have  been 
possible to undertake an assessment of each discrete processing operation by Meta IE without first 
resolving the fundamental dispute between the parties on the interpretation of Article 6(1) GDPR339. 
In relation to the processing of Article 9 GDPR categories of data, the IE SA considers that the inquiry 
has addressed the fundamental issue of principle on which the complaint depends, and this makes it 
unnecessary to conduct an indiscriminate and open-ended assessment of processing falling within the 
scope of this Article340. The IE SA thus concludes that Meta IE has (a) not sought to rely on consent in 
order to process personal data to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service and (b) is not legally obliged 
to rely on consent in order  to do so341, based on the submissions of the Parties and  the Facebook 
Terms of Service342. The IE SA warns CSAs on the legal risks derived from asking through the objections 
to expand the material scope of the inquiry and thus cover infringements outside of the complaint 
and Draft Decision that the IE SA has not investigated (pursuant to its own decision to limit the scope 
of the inquiry) and put to Meta IE343. 

187.  The EDPB notes that the complaint makes plain the confusion of the Facebook user over which of the 

user’s special categories of data are processed, for which purposes and on which basis.  

188.  The Facebook Terms of Service themselves note in general terms “We collect and use your personal in 
order  to  provide  the  services  described  above  to  you”344,  (services  which  include  “Provide  a 
personalized  experience  for  you”  and  “Help  you  discover  content,  products  and  services  that  may

interest  you”)345.  The  Facebook  Terms  of  Service,  which  are  considered  as  making  up  the  entire 
agreement346 include a reference to a separate document: Facebook’s “Data Policy”, which lists under 
the heading “Things you and others do and provide:” “Data with special protections: You can choose 
to provide information in your Facebook profile fields or Life Events, about your religious views, political 
views, who you are ‘interested in’ or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic 
origin,  philosophical  beliefs  or  trade  union  membership)  is  subject  to  special protections  under  EU 
law”347. The Data Policy describes the purposes for which these data are processed in very general 
terms such as “Provide, personalize and improve our products” and “to select and personalize ads, 
offers and other sponsored content that we show you”348 with no specific reference  to the specific 
processing  operations  and  categories  of  data  each  purpose  would  cover.  Meta  IE  thus  seems  to 
acknowledge in its Data Policy349  that it uses  special categories  of data for behavioural advertising 
purposes,  without  specifying  the  “special  protections  under  EU  law”  that  it  would  apply  to  such 
processing. Meta IE only includes a general reference to consent among other legal basis in the same 
page350, which includes a link to a separate page mentioning the use of consent on data with special 
protection and referring to the Facebook Settings351. 

189.  The IE SA finds that the way in which Meta IE provides this information, in relation to processing for 
which  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  is  relied  upon,  and  the  lack  of  information  on  the  specific  processing 
operations,  the  data  involved,  their  purposes  and  legal  basis  constitute  an  infringement  of 
transparency obligations under the GDPR (Article 5(1)(a), Article 12 (1), and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR)352. 
The IE SA considers the complaint in this case to be limited to the Facebook Terms of Service and the 
processing it entails once accepted353. In these circumstances, the IE SA accepts at face value Meta 
IE’s  submission  on  its  reliance  on  different  “acts”  of  consent  for  discrete  aspects  of  the  service 
separately from the user’s acceptance of the Facebook Terms of Service354. The IE SA does not engage 
into any further examination or verification on how consent is sought in the case of processing carried 
out  to  provide  discrete  aspects  of  the  service  and  whether  all  special  categories  of  data  under 
Article 9 GDPR that Meta IE processes355 in its Facebook service are subject to these “acts” of consent 
and thus effectively treated outside the scope of the Facebook Terms of Service and the legal basis of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  on  which  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service  purportedly  rely,  or  whether  some

contends,  a  contract  with  the  user  for  which  certain  data  processing  is  necessary  in  order  to  perform  that

of data subjects for processing, which, because of the particular sensitivity of the data processed, is 
liable  to  constitute  a  particularly  serious  interference  with  the  fundamental  rights  to  respect  for 
private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter357. 
The CJEU adopts a wide interpretation of the terms “special categories of personal data” and “sensitive 
data” that includes data liable indirectly to reveal sensitive information concerning a natural person358. 
Advocate  General  Rantos  reiterates  the  importance  for  the  protection  of  data  subjects  of 
Article 9 GDPR and applies the same interpretation to the data processing in the Facebook service for 
behavioural  advertising  by  stating  that  “the  prohibition  on  processing  sensitive personal data  may 
include the processing of data carried out by an operator of an online social network consisting in the 
collection of a user’s data when he or she visits other websites or apps or enters such data into them, 
the linking of such data to the user account on the social network and the use of such data, provided 
that the information processed, considered in isolation or aggregated, make it possible to profile users 
on  the  basis  of  the  categories  that  emerge  from  the  listing  in  that  provision  of  types  of  sensitive 
personal data”359. 

191.  Therefore, the GDPR and the case-law pay especial attention to the processing or potential processing 
of  special  categories  of  personal  data  under  Article 9 GDPR  to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  data 
subjects. In this connection, the Complainant alleges in the complaint, among others, a violation of 
Article 9 GDPR and expressly requests the IE SA to investigate Meta IE’s processing operations in the 
Facebook  service  covered  by  this  Article360.  In  a  subsequent  submission  on  the  preliminary  Draft 
Decision, the Complainant criticises the scope that the IE SA decided to give to the complaint and its 
lack  of investigation of  Meta IE’s processing activities and alleges that the  IE SA failed to give  due 
consideration  to  processing  under  Article 9 GDPR  and  other  cases  in  which  Meta  IE  relies  on 
consent361.   

192.  In the present case, the IE SA limited its facts and legal assessment in the Draft Decision to the general 
questions of whether Facebook has (a) sought to rely on consent in order to process personal data to 
deliver the Facebook Terms of Service and (b) if it is legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do 
so. The IE SA categorically concludes on these questions. At the same time, the IE SA acknowledges a 
serious lack of transparency by Meta IE as regards the information provided concerning the processing 
being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and does not clarify which data categories are 
being  processed  for  behavioural  advertising,  if  Meta  IE  processes  special  categories  of  data  for 
behavioural advertising , and if it does, if Meta IE complies with the conditions of Article 9 GDPR and 
others relevant to the application of this provision(for example Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7 GDPR). 

193.  By  deciding  not  to  investigate,  further  to  the  complaint,  the  processing  of  special  categories  of 
personal data in the Facebook service, the IE SA leaves unaddressed the risks this processing poses for

the  Complainant  and  for  Facebook  users.  First,  there  is  the  risk  that  the  Complainant’s  special 
categories of personal data are processed in the Facebook service to build intimate profiles of them 
for behavioural advertising purposes without a legal basis and in a manner not compliant with the 
GDPR and the strict requirements of its Article 9 and other GDPR provisions relevant thereto. Second, 
there is also the risk that Meta IE does not consider as special categories of personal data (in line with 
the GDPR and the CJEU case law362) certain categories of personal data it processes and consequently, 
that Meta IE does not treat them as required by EU law. Third, the Complainant and other Facebook 
users, whose special categories of data are processed, may be deprived of certain special protections 
derived from the use of consent, such as the possibility to specifically consent to certain processing 
operations and not to others and to the further processing of personal data (Article 6(4) GDPR), the 
freedom to withdraw consent (Article 7 GDPR) and the subsequent right to be forgotten363. Fourth, 
given  the  great  size  and  dominant  market  share  of  Meta  IE  in  the  social  media  market,  leaving 
unaddressed  its  current ambiguity in the  processing of special categories  of personal data, and its 
limited transparency vis-à-vis Facebook users, may set a precedent for controllers to operate in the 
same manner and create legal uncertainty hampering the free flow of personal data within the EU.  

194.  The  EDPB  further  considers, also in view of these risks  to the  Complainant and  to other  Facebook 
users, that the IE SA did not handle the complaint with all due diligence364. The EDPB sees the lack of 
any further investigation into the processing of special categories of personal data as an omission, and 
-in the present case- finds it relevant that the Complainant alleged infringements of Article 9 GDPR in 
the complaint365. The EDPB contends that, in the present case, the IE SA should have verified on the 
basis  of  the  contract  and  the  data  processing  actually  carried  out  on  which  legal  bases  each  data 
processing operation at issue relies.  

195.  The EDPB also highlights that in limiting excessively the scope of its inquiry despite the scope of the 
complaint in this cross-border case and systematically considering the objections made in this regard 
not relevant and/or reasoned and thus denying their formal admissibility, the IE SA as LSA in this case, 
constrains the capacity of CSAs to act and tackle the risks to data subjects in sincere and effective 
cooperation. As ruled by the CJEU, the LSA must exercise its competence within a framework of close 
cooperation with other supervisory authorities concerned and cannot “eschew essential dialogue with 
and sincere and effective cooperation with the other supervisory authorities concerned”366. The limited 
scope the IE SA gave to the inquiry and its consideration of all the objections made as inadmissible for 
being not relevant or reasoned also impairs the EDPB’s capacity to conclude on the matter pursuant 
to  Article 65 GDPR  and  thus  ensure  a  consistent  application  of  EU  data  protection  law,  especially 
considering that the complaint was introduced more than four years ago.  

196.  As a result of the limited scope of the inquiry and the fact that the IE SA did not assess in its Draft 
Decision Meta IE’s processing of special categories of personal data in its Facebook service, the EDPB 
does not have sufficient factual evidence on Meta IE’s processing operations to enable it to make a

finding on any possible infringement by Meta IE of its obligations under Article 9 GDPR and other GDPR 
provisions relevant thereto.  

197.  In conclusion, the EDPB decides that the IE SA cannot categorically conclude at this stage through its 
Finding 1 that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to carry out the personal data processing 
activities involved in the delivery of the Facebook service, including behavioural advertising, as set out 
in  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service,  without  further  investigating  its  processing  operations,  the 
categories of data processed (including to identify special categories of personal data that may be 
processed), and the purposes they serve.  

198.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB 
decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its 
Facebook service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and 
complies  with  the  relevant  obligations  under  the  GDPR,  to  the  extent  that  this  new  investigation 
complements the  findings made  in  the  IE SA’s Final  Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding 
Decision, and based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft decision in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR367.  

 

6  ON THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE 

OF FAIRNESS  

6.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

199.  The IE SA in its Draft Decision addresses the Complainant’s allegations that the unclear and misleading 
nature of Facebook’s updated Terms of Service and Data Policy, together with the mode of acceptance 
of the Facebook Terms of Service, have made Facebook users believe that all processing operations 
were based on consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR and thus constituted a breach of the controller’s 
transparency  obligations  under  Articles  5(1)(a)  and  13(1)(c)  GDPR368.  The  IE  SA  analyses  the 
submissions  provided  by  the  controller  and,  noting  the  Complaint’s  focus  on  the  alleged  “forced 
consent”369, concludes that Meta IE has breached Articles 5(1)(a), 13(1)(c) and 12(1) GDPR due to the 
lack of transparency in relation to the processing for which Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has been relied on370. 
The  IE  SA  explains  that,  while  an  infringement  of  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR  does  not  necessarily  or 
automatically  flow  from  findings  of  infringement  under  Articles  12  and/or  13  GDPR,  there  is  an 
important link between these provisions371. Nevertheless, the IE SA takes the view that “the factual 
question of whether Facebook ‘misled’ the data subject” is not “a separate legal question from whether 
Facebook complied with its transparency obligations in the context of processing allegedly carried out 
pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”372. It concludes  that “there is no distinct legal issue raised by the 
question whether, as a matter of fact, the Complainant did or did not believe that the processing was 
based  on  Article  6(1)(a)  GDPR  (i.e.  consent)  and  not on  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR  (i.e. necessity  for  the

performance of a contract)”373. The IE SA points out that Article 5(1)(a) GDPR links transparency to the 
overall fairness of the activities of the controller374 and concludes on the breach of this provision in 
relation to the infringement of the transparency obligations375. 

6.2  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

200.  The IT SA objects to the scope of Finding 3 of the Draft Decision and to the assessment leading up to 
it. The IT SA agrees to a large extent with the Draft Decision’s Finding 3 on the infringement of Article 
12(1), Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency376. However, the IT SA argues 
that Meta IE has also failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR, which, in the view of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically 
to transparency377.  

201.  According  to  the  IT  SA,  the  relationship  between  Meta  IE  and  Facebook  users  is  markedly 
unbalanced378  and  an  infringement  of  the  fairness  principle  resulted,  first  of  all,  from  the 
misrepresentation of the legal basis for processing by the controller379, considering that “Facebook 
presented its service to users in a misleading manner” and “without taking due account of users’ right 
to the protection of their personal data”380. The IT SA argues that “the controller leaves its users in the 
dark as they are expected to tell or actually ‘figure out’, from time to time, the possible connections 
between purpose sought, applicable legal basis and relevant processing activities”381.   

202.  Secondly, such infringement also stems from the “high-level and all-encompassing reference to Article 
6(1)(b) GDPR as relied upon to enable the massive collection of personal data [...] and their reuse for 
multifarious, distinct purposes”, considering the “pervasive as well as prolonged analysis of [the users’] 
online behaviour” amounting to a disproportionate interference with their private lives compared to 
the pursuit of freedom of enterprise382.  

203.  The IT SA thus considers that the IE SA should have found an infringement of the fairness principle 
under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to the infringement of the transparency obligations derived 
from this provision, without any need for supplementary  investigations383.  According to  the  IT SA, 
should the objection be followed, it would also impact the exercise of corrective powers by the IE SA, 
i.e. the measures to be imposed on the controller in order to bring the processing into conformity with 
the GDPR384.

6.3  Position of the LSA on the objection 

204.  The IE SA does not consider the IT SA objection to be relevant and reasoned and does not follow it385. 
The IE SA examines it together with the other objections relating to the scope and conduct of the 
inquiry and contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to 
the parties would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry386.  

205.  The IE SA highlights the legal consequences that would flow from making material changes concerning 
infringements outside of the complaint and Draft Decision, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would 
succeed in arguing before  the  Irish Courts that it  has been denied an opportunity to be heard  on 
additional and extraneous findings that are adverse to it387.The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact 
that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE was never invited to be heard in response to an allegation that it 
had infringed the fairness principle set out in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.  The IE SA notes, in this regard, that 
a respondent has the right to be heard in response to the particulars of the case being made against 
it and that this is a core element of a fair procedure pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view 
that expanding the material scope of the inquiry is not possible under Irish procedural law and that, 
considering the seriousness of the transparency infringements, it would not be appropriate to delay 
the resolution of the matter388. 

6.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

6.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

206.  The IT SA objection concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”389.  

207.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the objections categorised by the IE SA as relating to the 
scope and conduct of the inquiry, among which the IT SA objection regarding the infringement of the 
fairness principle, are not reasoned and relevant390. According to Meta IE, the requests to expand the 
defined scope of the inquiry are inappropriate in circumstances where the scope of the Inquiry has 
been confined to assessing the matter of “forced consent”, as opposed to a wider assessment of the 
lawfulness or fairness of Meta IE’s processing activities under other possible legal bases391.  

208.  Meta  IE  further  contends  that  the  IT  SA’s  justification  for  the  existence  of  an  infringement  of  the 
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR (rather than the transparency principle protected by the 
same  provision)  is  not  based  on  any  detailed  factual  or  legal  reasoning  and  fails  to  address  the 
significance of the alleged risks to fundamental rights posed by the Draft Decision392.  

209.  As it was previously explained, the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree 
with the scope of the inquiry as decided by the LSA by way of an objection393. The EDPB recalls that an 
objection  could  go  as  far  as  identifying  gaps  in  the  draft  decision  justifying  the  need  for  further 
investigation by the LSA, for example  in situations where  the investigation carried out by the LSA

unjustifiably fails to cover some of the issues raised by the complainant394. In this regard, the EDPB 
observes that, in their complaint, the Complainant alleges that the information provided in Meta IE’s 
Privacy Policy “is inherently non-transparent and unfair within the meaning of Articles 5(1)(a) and 13(c) 
GDPR”395.  This  is  also  noted  by  the  IE  SA396.  In  addition,  the  Complainant  alleges  that  “Asking  for 
consent  to  a  processing  operation,  when  the  controller  relies  in  fact  on  another  legal  basis  is 
fundamentally unfair, misleading and non-transparent within the meaning of Article  5(1)(a) of the 
GDPR”397. Therefore, the EDPB disagrees with the IE SA’s finding that assessing Meta IE’s compliance 
with the principle of fairness would amount to introducing “novel issues which have not been raised 
by the complainant”398. 

210.  The EDPB notes that the IT SA agrees with the IE SA’s finding with regard to the infringement of the 
principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR399. As this finding is not subject to a dispute, the 
EDPB will not examine this matter.  

211.  After  analysing the  IT SA objection, the EDPB  finds  that the objection is  relevant, as it refers to a 
specific part of the Draft Decision (Finding 3400), and if followed would lead to the conclusion that there 
is an infringement of the general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, in addition to the 
breach of the transparency obligations derived from this provision401. The objection, if followed, would 
also entail the  exercise  of corrective  powers, i.e. the measures  to be  imposed  on the  controller in 
order to bring the processing into conformity with the GDPR402. 

212.  The IT SA objection is also reasoned because it includes several specific legal and factual arguments in 
support of finding an additional infringement of the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR403. 
For example, the IT SA explains that “transparency and fairness are two separate notions” and that 
“transparency relates to clarity of the information provided to users via the ToS and the privacy policy”, 
while “fairness relates to how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in 
connection with its  social networking service”404. The  IT SA  contends that  the  “overall relationship 
between Facebook and its users is markedly unbalanced”405. According to the IT SA, the first way in 
which  Meta  IE  has  infringed  the  principle  of  fairness  was  by  misrepresenting  the  legal  basis  for 
processing  “without  taking  due  account  of  users’  right  to  the  protection  of  personal  data”406  and 
leaving “its users in the dark”407. Meta IE has also breached the fairness principle, in the IT SA’s view, 
by justifying via the broad reference to the legal basis of performance of contract a massive collection 
of personal data and  their reuse for a wide  range  of purposes, disproportionately interfering with 
users’ private life408.

213.  The IT SA objection also identifies the risks posed by the absence in the Draft Decision of a finding on 
the infringement of the fairness principle, namely setting a dangerous precedent for future decisions 
regarding other controllers relying on the same business model and weakening the safeguards that 
must  be  provided  through  the  effective,  comprehensive  implementation  of  the  data  protection 
framework, including the fairness of the processing principle409. 

214.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  IT  SA  objection  is  relevant  and  reasoned  (cf.  Article  4(24) 

GDPR). 

6.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

215.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters which are the subject of the relevant and reasoned objections, in particular whether there is 
an infringement of the GDPR. 

216.  The EDPB considers that the objection found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection requires 
an assessment of whether the Draft Decision needs to be changed insofar as it contains no finding of 
infringement of the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. When assessing the merits of the 
objection  raised,  the  EDPB  also  takes  into  account  Meta  IE’s  position  on  the  objection  and  its 
submissions. 

217.  As previously mentioned, the EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection is not relevant 
and  reasoned410.  The  EDPB  also  notes  that  Meta  IE  does  not  provide  further  submissions  on  the 
content of the IT SA objection411.  

218.  Before  proceeding  with  the  assessment,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  the  basic  principles  relating  to 
processing listed in Article 5 GDPR can, as such, be infringed412. This is apparent from the text of Article 
83(5)(a) GDPR which subjects the infringement of the basic principles for processing to administrative 
fines of up to 20 million euros, or in the case of undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual 
turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 

219.  The EDPB underlines that the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency, all three enshrined 
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, are three distinct but intrinsically linked and interdependent principles that 
every controller should respect when processing personal data. The link between these principles is 
evident from a number of GDPR provisions: Recitals 39 and 42, Articles 6(2) and 6(3)(b) GDPR refer to  
lawful and fair processing, while Recitals 60 and 71 GDPR, as well as Articles 13(2), 14(2) and 40(2)(a) 
GDPR refer to fair and transparent processing. 

220.  On the basis of the above consideration, the EDPB agrees with the IE SA’s view that “Article 5(1)(a) 
links transparency to the overall fairness  of the activities  of a controller”413  but  considers that  the 
principle  of  fairness  has  an  independent  meaning  and  stresses  that  an  assessment  of  Meta  IE’s 
compliance  with  the  principle  of  transparency  does  not  automatically  rule  out  the  need  for  an 
assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness too.

221.  The EDPB recalls that, in data protection law, the concept of fairness stems from the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights414. The EDPB has already provided some elements as to the meaning and effect 
of the  principle  of fairness  in the context of processing personal data. For example, the  EDPB has 
previously opined in its Guidelines on Data Protection by Design and by Default that “Fairness is an 
overarching  principle  which  requires  that  personal  data  should  not  be  processed  in  a  way  that  is 
unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject”415. 

222.  Among  the  key  fairness  elements  that  controllers  should  consider  in  this  regard,  the  EDPB  has 
mentioned autonomy of the data subjects, data subjects’ expectation, power balance, avoidance of 
deception, ethical and truthful processing416. These elements are particularly relevant in the case at 
hand.  The  principle  of  fairness  under  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR  underpins  the  entire  data  protection 
framework  and  seeks  to  address  power  asymmetries  between  the  data  controllers  and  the  data 
subjects in  order  to  cancel out  the  negative  effects  of such asymmetries  and ensure the effective 
exercise of the data subjects’ rights. The EDPB has previously explained that “the principle of fairness 
includes, inter alia, recognising the reasonable expectations of the data subjects, considering possible 
adverse  consequences  processing  may  have  on  them,  and  having  regard  to  the  relationship  and 
potential effects of imbalance between them and the controller”417.  

223.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  a  fair  balance  must  be  struck  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  commercial 
interests of the controllers and, on the other hand, the rights and expectations of the data subjects 
under the GDPR418. A key aspect of compliance with the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 
refers to pursuing “power balance” as a “key objective of the controller-data subject relationship”419, 
especially in the context of online services provided without monetary payment, where users are often 
not aware of the ways and extent to which their personal data is being processed420. Consequently, 
lack of transparency can make it almost impossible in practice for the data subjects to exercise an 
informed choice over the use of their data421, which is in contrast with the element of “autonomy” of 
data subjects as to the processing of their personal data422.  

224.  Considering the constantly increasing economic value of personal data in the digital environment, it is 
particularly  important  to  ensure  that  data  subjects  are  protected  from  any  form  of  abuse  and 
deception, intentional or not, which would result in the unjustified loss of control over their personal 
data. Compliance by providers of online services acting as controllers with all three of the cumulative 

                                                             
414  Art.  8 EU  Charter  of  Fundamental Rights  states  as  follows:  “1.  Everyone has  the  right  to the protection of 
personal data concerning him or her. 2. Such data must be processed  fairly for specified purposes and on the 
basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law” (emphasis added).

requirements  under  Article  5(1)(a)  GDPR,  taking  into  account  the  particular  service  that  is  being 
provided  and  the  characteristics  of  their  users,  serves  as  a  shield  from  the  danger  of  abuse  and 
deception, especially in situations of power asymmetries.  

225.  The EDPB has previously emphasised that the identification of the appropriate lawful basis is tied to 
the principles of fairness and purpose limitation423. In this regard, the IT SA rightly observes that while 
finding a breach of transparency relates to the way in which information has been provided to users 
via the Facebook Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, compliance with the principle of fairness also 
relates to “how the controller addressed the lawfulness of the processing activities in connection with 
its social networking service”424. Thus, the EDPB considers that an assessment of compliance by Meta 
IE with the principle of fairness requires also an assessment of the consequences that the choice and 
presentation  of  the  legal  basis  entail  for  the  Facebook  service  users.  In  addition,  that  assessment 
cannot be made in the abstract, but has to take into account the specificities of the particular social 
networking service  and of  the  processing of personal data carried out,  namely for  the  purpose  of 
online behavioural advertising425.  

226.  The EDPB notes that in this particular case the breach of Meta IE’s transparency obligations is of such 
gravity that it clearly impacts the reasonable expectations of the Facebook users by confusing them 
on  whether  clicking  the  “Accept”  button  results  in  giving  their  consent  to  the  processing  of  their 
personal data. The EDPB notes in this regard that one of the elements of compliance with the principle 
of fairness is avoiding deception i.e. providing information “in an objective and neutral way, avoiding 
any deceptive or manipulative language or design”426.  

227.  As  the  IE  SA  itself  notes,  the  Complainant  argues  that  Meta  IE  relied  on  “forced  consent”  for  the 
processing simply because it did in fact believe that the legal basis for processing the controller was 
relying  upon  was  consent427.  This  is  illustrated  by  the  multiple  arguments  that  the  Complainant 
presents in order to demonstrate the “forced consent”, including the reference to the use by Meta IE 
of “additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users”428. For example, the Complainant refers to the inclusion in 
the  user  interface  page  of  “two  fake  red dots  (violation  against Article  5(1)(a)  –  neither  ‘fair’,  nor 
‘transparent’), that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot 
access without consenting – even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality”429. 
The EDPB considers that the LSA should have taken into account the use of such practices by Meta IE 
in relation to the principle of fairness, regardless of its finding that Meta IE has not sought to rely on 
consent in order to process personal data to deliver the Facebook Terms of Service430.  

228.  In addition, and as previously mentioned in paragraph 97 of this Binding Decision, the Complainant 
presents the results of a poll according to which only 1.6% to 2.5% of the 1000 Facebook users who 
responded  to  the  poll  understood  the  request  to  accept  the  Facebook  Terms  of  Service  to  be  a

contract431. In the  EDPB’s view, there  are clear indications that Facebook  users’ expectations with 
regard to the applicable legal basis have not been fulfilled432.  

229.  As recognised by the IE SA itself, “the user is left to guess as to what processing is carried out on what 
data”433. Therefore, the EDPB shares the IT SA’s concern that Facebook users are left ”in the dark"434 
and considers that the processing by Meta IE cannot be regarded as ethical and truthful435 because it 
is  confusing  with  regard  to  the  type  of  data  processed,  the  legal  basis  and  the  purpose  of  the 
processing, which ultimately restricts the Facebook users’ possibility to exercise their data subjects’ 
rights. 

230.  Furthermore, the EDPB considers that the extensive analysis by the IE SA with regard to the issue of 
legal basis and transparency in relation to the processing being carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) 
GDPR is closely linked to the issue of compliance by Meta IE with the principle of fairness. Considering 
the seriousness of the infringements of the transparency obligations by Meta IE already identified in 
the Draft Decision and the related misrepresentation of the legal basis relied on, the EDPB agrees with 
the IT SA that Meta IE has presented its service to the Facebook users in a misleading manner436, which 
adversely affects their control over the processing of their personal data and the exercise of their data 
subjects' rights. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that the IE SA’s finding of breach of Article 5(1)(a) 
GDPR with regard to the principle of transparency437 should extend to the principle of fairness too.   

231.  This  is  all  the  more  supported  by  the  fact  that,  in  the  circumstances  of  the  present  case  as 
demonstrated  above438,  the  overall  effect  of  the  infringements  by  Meta  IE  of  the  transparency 
obligations under Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1), 13(1)(c) GDPR and the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR439 
further intensifies the imbalanced nature of the relationship between Meta IE and the Facebook users 
brought  up  by  the  IT  SA  objection.  The  combination  of  factors,  such  as  the  asymmetry  of  the 
information created by Meta IE with regard to Facebook service users, combined with the “take it or 
leave it” situation that they are faced with due to the lack of alternative services in the market and 
the lack of options allowing them to adjust or opt out from a particular processing under the contract 
with  Meta  IE,  systematically  disadvantages  Facebook  service  users,  limits  their  control  over  the 
processing of their personal data and undermines the exercise of their rights under Chapter III of the 
GDPR.  

232.  Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA  to include  a  finding of an infringement of the  principle  of 
fairness  under  Article  5(1)(a) GDPR  by  Meta IE, in addition to  the  infringement of the principle  of 
transparency  under  the  same  provision,  and  to  adopt  the  appropriate  corrective  measures,  by

7  ON  THE  POTENTIAL  ADDITIONAL 

INFRINGEMENT  OF  THE 

PRINCIPLES OF PURPOSE LIMITATION AND DATA MINIMISATION  

7.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

233.  The  IE  SA  refers  to  Article  5(1)(b)440  and  Article  5(1)(c)  GDPR441  when  analysing  the  extent  of  the 
controller’s obligation under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR and whether Meta IE has infringed this provision. 
More specifically, the IE SA highlights that Article 13 GDPR requires that the purposes and legal bases 
must be specified in respect of the intended processing and cannot just be cited in the abstract442. 
After explaining why Meta IE’s view that there is no specific obligation for the legal basis to be mapped 
to the purpose of processing cannot be reconciled with a literal reading of the GDPR, the IE SA, for 
completeness, also engages in a systemic reading based on the legislator’s objective and the contents 
of the GDPR as a whole443. 

234.  In this context, the IE SA’s points out that both Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR focus quite closely on the 
purposes for processing and further stresses that the six principles laid down under Article 5 GDPR are 
interconnected and operate in combination to underpin the whole GDPR444. However, the IE SA does 
not assess whether Facebook’s processing activities entail a separate infringement of the principles of 
purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. 

7.2  Summary of the objection raised by the CSAs 

235.  According to the IT SA, there is an additional infringement of points (b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on 
account of Meta IE’s failure to comply with the purpose limitation and data minimisation principles. It 
considers that such infringement should be found without the need for any further investigation and 
should result into a substantial increase of the proposed administrative fine445. 

236.  The  IT  SA  puts  forward  several  factual  and  legal  arguments  for  the  proposed  change  to  the  Draft 
Decision.  First,  it  points  out  that  the  IE  SA  confines  its  assessment  to  only  one  of  the  contract’s 
purposes (the provision of online behavioural advertising), while Facebook’s service would actually be 
composed of several processing activities pursuing several purposes446. According to the IT SA, the fact 
that Meta IE inappropriately based its multifarious processing activities only on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
entails  an  infringement  of  the  purpose  limitation  and  data  minimisation  principles447.  The  IT  SA 
stresses the relevance of these principles in online services contracts, as they are not negotiated on 
an  individual  basis,  and  refers  to  pages  15  and  16  of  the  WP29  Opinion  03/2013  on  purpose

limitation448. The IT SA also refers to the EDPB Guidelines 2/2019 on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and recalls 
that, where the contract consists of several separate  services or elements of a service  that can be 
performed independently, the  applicability of Article  6(1)(b) GDPR should be assessed for each of 
those services separately449.  

237.  On the  risks  posed by the  Draft Decision, the  IT SA refers to the  risk  identified by the  WP29 in its 
Opinion 03/2013  on purpose limitation450, namely that “data controllers seek to include processing 
terms in contracts to maximise the possible collection and uses of data without adequately specifying 
those purposes or considering data minimisation obligations”451. In addition, in the IT SA’s view, the 
failure to specify and communicate the purposes of the processing to the data subject creates a risk 
of  artificially  expanding  the  types  of  processing  or  the  categories  or  personal  data  considered 
necessary  for  the  performance  of  a  contract  under  Article  6(1)(b)  GDPR,  which  would  nullify  the 
safeguards afforded to data subjects under data protection law452. 

7.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

238.  The IE SA does not consider that the IT SA’s objection is relevant and reasoned453. Categorising the 
objection as relating to the scope and conduct of the inquiry, the IE SA adopts the same approach as 
with  regard  to  the  alleged  infringement  of  the  principle  of  fairness.  More  specifically,  the  IE  SA 
contends that introducing novel issues not raised by the Complainant or otherwise put to the parties 
would represent a significant departure in terms of the scope of the inquiry454 and highlights the legal 
consequences thereof, namely the likelihood that Meta IE would succeed in arguing before the Irish 
Courts that it has been denied an opportunity to be heard on additional and extraneous findings that 
are adverse to it455. The IE SA’s concern arose from the fact that, according to the IE SA, Meta IE was 
never invited to be  heard in response  to an allegation that it had infringed Articles  5(1)(b) and (c) 
GDPR.  The IE SA notes, in this regard, that a respondent has the right to be heard in response to the 
particulars  of  the  case  being  made  against  it  and  that  this  is  a  core  element  of  a  fair  procedure 
pursuant to Irish law. The IE SA takes the view that expanding the material scope of the inquiry is not 
possible  under  Irish  procedural  law  and  that,  considering  the  seriousness  of  the  transparency 
infringements, it would not be appropriate to delay the resolution of the matter456. It further notes 
that a very significant risk of procedural unfairness, under Irish national law, would result from the 
proposal to assume, without any further factual examination, that Meta IE has infringed the purpose 
limitation principle457.

7.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

7.4.1  Assessment of whether the objection was relevant and reasoned 

239.  The IT SA objection concerns “whether there is an infringement of the GDPR”458. 

240.  The  EDPB  takes note  of  Meta  IE’s view that  the  IT SA’s objection does not meet the  relevant and 
reasoned thresholds because it falls outside the defined scope of the inquiry. As previously explained, 
the EDPB does not share the understanding that CSAs may not disagree with the scope of the inquiry 
as decided by the LSA by way of an objection459.  

241.  Meta IE further argues that even if the objection satisfied the abovementioned thresholds, it should 
be disregarded because otherwise Meta IE’s right to fair procedures under both Irish and EU law would 
be contravened460. It points out that the objection concerns matters that have not been investigated 
and relates to theoretical findings on legal bases461.  

242.  The  EDPB  considers  that  the  IT  SA  objection  is  relevant  as  it  refers  to  specific  parts  of  the  Draft 
Decision,  namely  Finding  2  and  Finding  3462,  and  argues  that  the  IE  SA  should  have  found  an 
infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR which lay down the principles of data minimisation and 
purpose limitation.  

243.  The objection also includes arguments on legal and factual mistakes in the IE SA’s Draft Decision that 
require amending. According to the IT SA, the IE SA’s reasoning is inconsistent because the high-level, 
rather unclear information provided to the data subjects is a major criticality that should have led the 
IE SA not only to question  the  features  of the information notice, but also to verify, in detail, the 
application  of  the  principles  of  purpose  limitation  and  data  minimisation  from  a  substantive 
perspective463. More specially, the IT SA takes the view that the IE SA should have had regard to the 
actual configuration of the processing operations performed in order to assess whether the controller 
had abided by the obligation to process personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes 
both when collecting those data and thereafter464. 

244.  As  regards  the  risk  posed  by  the  Draft  Decision,  the  EDPB  takes  note  of  the  IT  SA’s  reference  to 
paragraph 16 of the EDPB Guidelines  2/2019  on Article  6(1)(b) GDPR and  reiterates  the particular 
relevance of Articles 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR in the context of contracts for online services, in view of the 
risk  that  data  controllers  may  seek  to  include  general  processing  terms  in  contracts  in  order  to 
maximise the possible collection and uses of data, without adequately specifying those purposes or 
considering data minimisation obligations465. Nevertheless, the EDPB stresses that a mere reference 
to the EDPB Guidelines is not sufficient to demonstrate the risks posed by the Draft Decision in this 
specific case and in these specific circumstances.

245.  The  IT  SA  also  considers  that  the  purposes  for  the  processing  “must  be  clearly  specified  and 
communicated to the data subject, in line with the controller’s purpose limitation and transparency 
obligations”,  otherwise  there  is  “a  risk  that  other  data  protection  obligations  might  be  evaded by 
artificially expanding the types of processing or the categories of personal data that are considered to 
be ‘necessary’ for performance of the contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR - which would in turn nullify 
the safeguards afforded to data subjects by personal data protection law”466. 

246.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  objection  must  put  forward  arguments  or  justifications  concerning  the 
consequences of issuing the decision without the changes proposed in the objection, and how such 
consequences would pose significant risks for data subjects’ fundamental rights and freedoms467. The 
CSA  needs  to  advance  sufficient  arguments  to  explicitly  show  that  such  risks  are  substantial  and 
plausible468. In addition, the demonstration of the significance of the risks cannot be implied from the 
legal and/or factual arguments provided by the CSA, but has to be explicitly identified and elaborated 
in the objection469.  

247.  The  EDPB  considers  that  the  IT  SA  objection  fails  to  meet  these  requirements  as  it  does  not 
demonstrate the significance of the risk stemming from an omission in the Draft Decision of a finding 
that the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation have been infringed by Meta IE. The 
risk, as described by the IT SA objection, is not substantial and plausible enough. Moreover, the risk 
relates to the IE SA’s decision not to conclude on the inappropriate use of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR as a 
legal basis for Meta IE’s processing activities but fails to establish a clear link with the LSA decision not 
to make a finding on the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR.   

248.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that the abovementioned objection by the IT SA is not reasoned (cf. 

Article 4(24) GDPR) and will not assess it on the merits.  

 

8  ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES OTHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE FINES 

8.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

249.  The IE SA considers that an order to bring processing into compliance (Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) should 
be imposed on Meta IE, requiring them to bring their Data Policy and Facebook Terms of Service into 
compliance with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR as regards processing carried 
out on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR within three months of the date of notification of any final 
decision470.  

250.  The LSA considers an order is necessary and proportionate, contrary to the controller’s position471. 
Regarding the necessity, the IE SA explains that this order is the only way to guarantee that Meta IE 
amends the infringements outlined in the Draft Decision, which is essential for the protection of data 
subjects’ rights. Concerning the proportionality, the LSA points out that the proposed measure is the 
minimum action required to ensure the future compliance of the controller. Further, the IE SA recalls

8.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

251.  The NL SA objects to the choice of the corrective measures of the LSA in their Draft Decision473. The 
NL SA notes that the IE SA is proposing to impose an order pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR alongside 
an  administrative  fine,  and  that  this  objection  concerns  the  first  of  these  two  measures474.  More 
specifically, the NL SA objects to the order to bring processing into compliance (Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) 
within  three  months  proposed  by  the  LSA,  arguing  that  it  is  not  appropriate,  not  necessary,  nor 
proportionate  to  ensure  compliance  with  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and  Article 13(1)(c) GDPR,  as 
well as the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR raised in its objection475. 
The NL SA takes the view that the proposed order is insufficient to remedy the serious situation of 
non-compliance  arising  from  these  infringements,  since  it  does  not  remedy  the  illegality  of  the 
conduct carried out during the transition period (i.e. the time between the issuance of the decision 
and the expiration date of the order), bearing in mind that “every day the service continues operations 
as described in the Terms of Use and Data Policy”, it does so in an illegal way harming the rights and 
freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA476. According to the NL SA, the Draft Decision should 
be modified to include a temporary ban on processing (Article 58(2)(f) GDPR), as it would be the “only 
measure suitable to make sure that the expansive violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
data subjects is not continued”477. The NL SA also argues that the breaches of the GDPR established by 
the LSA, combined with the additional breaches put forward by the NL SA, are of a very grave nature 
and justify halting processing operations during the time the controller needs to remedy its severe 
lack of compliance478. In essence, the NL SA identifies the risk posed by the Draft Decision in that it 
allows  the  company  to  resume  operations  as  usual  while  amending  the  compliance  deficits  (with 
regard to transparency), which they argue essentially deprives data subjects of their rights during a 
transition period479. 

252.  According to the IT SA, the finding of the additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should “result 

in the taking of appropriate corrective measures under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR”480.   

253.  The AT SA argues the use of corrective measures is necessary at hand in order to bring the processing 
operations  of  the  controller  in  line  with  the  GDPR481  and  remedy  the  infringement482  of

infringement is found during a complaint-based procedure, the SA is under an obligation to take appropriate 
action by exercising corrective powers, and cites  C-311/18 Schrems II, paragraph 111. Additionally, the AT SA 
clarifies that although it takes the position that a complainant does not have a subjective right to request from 
the respective supervisory authority the exercise of a specific corrective power and it is up to the authority only 
to decide which action is appropriate and necessary (referring to C-311/18 Schrems II, paragraph 112), it finds 
the exercise of corrective powers to be necessary in the current case.

Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  According to the AT SA, the IE SA should exercise “specific corrective powers” so 
as  to  ensure  that  Meta  IE  could  not  continue  to  unlawfully  rely  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  for  the 
processing of users’ personal data for behavioural advertising483. More specifically, the AT SA suggests 
that the IE SA prohibits Meta IE “the processing of a user’s data for behavioural advertising by relying 
on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”484. In the absence of additional corrective measures, the AT SA considers that 
if corrective measures are not imposed, there is a risk “that Facebook continues to unlawfully rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing of a user’s data for behavioural advertising and continues to 
undermine  or  bypass  data  protection  principles”,  which  would  affect  hundred  of  millions  of  data 
subjects within the EEA and bear vast consequences485.  

254.  The FR SA notes  that reversing the findings concerning the infringements of  Article 6(1) GDPR also 
affects the scope  of the  corrective actions proposed by the IE SA, in addition to the administrative 
fine486. Moreover, the PT SA considers that the proposed additional infringement in relation to the 
breach  of  the  lawfulness  obligation  (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR)  should  lead  to  the  application  of  an 
additional corrective measure which is not now envisaged in the Draft Decision487.  

255.  Finally, according to the NO and DE SAs, the IE SA should take concrete corrective measures in relation 
to the additional infringement of Meta IE with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely to order Meta IE to delete 
personal data that has been unlawfully processed on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and to prohibit the use of 
this legal basis for such processing activities488.  

256.  The  PL SA  objects  to  the  content of  the  order  to  bring processing into compliance  with the  GDPR 
(Article 58(2)(d) GDPR) contained in the Draft Decision, arguing that it should be more precise. The PL 
SA  specifically  argues  that  the  order  should  also  include  a  reference  to  the  EDPB  Transparency 
Guidelines  to ensure the controller  is aware  that compliance  requires differentiating between the 
content of the contract with the user and the content of information on data processing489.  The PL SA 
considers the interpretation of the rules provided in the EDPB Transparency Guidelines crucial in the 
present case and, if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, sees a risk the order to bring into compliance 
might not be properly applied, which in turn would limit the possibilities of data subjects to assert 
their rights490. 

8.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

257.  The IE SA does not consider the objections above to be relevant and/or reasoned and does not follow 
them491.  Given that these objections were premised upon the requirement for the Draft Decision to 
include a finding of infringement of Article 6(1)(b), on which the IE SA expressed its disagreement –

the IE SA  does not consider the objections requesting exercise of a corrective power in response to a 
finding of infringement of Article 6(1)(b) as being relevant and reasoned492.  

258.  The  IE  SA  considers  the  PL  SA’s  objection  is  not  relevant  insofar  as  “the  GDPR  does  not  prescribe 

specific formalities for the provision of information under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR”493. 

8.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

8.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

259.  The  objections  raised  by  the  AT,  DE,  FR,  IT,  NL,  NO,  PL  and  PT  SAs  concern  “whether  the  action 

envisaged in the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”494.  

260.  In  addition  to  the  primary  argument  levelled  against  all  CSA’s  objections495,  Meta  IE  provides 
arguments on why it considers these objections to be not relevant and/or reasoned. Meta IE argues 
that  the AT and NL SAs’ objections cannot be considered relevant because they are dependent on 
another objection, which Meta IE deems inadmissible and without merit496.  On the same basis, Meta 
IE refutes that the AT SAs objection is adequately reasoned497.  As stated above in Section 4, the EDPB 
finds the AT and NL SAs’ objections on the subject of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR relevant and reasoned498.   

261.  Additionally, Meta IE argues that the AT and NL SAs’ objections fail to set out how the Draft Decision 
would pose a direct and significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms. First, Meta IE refers to 
their arguments put forward in response to the AT and NL SAs’ objections on the matter of compliance 
with  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR499. The  EDPB has taken this  line  of reasoning into consideration above  in 
Section 4500. Second, Meta IE puts forward that the AT and NL SAs appear to consider that the “Draft 
Decision provides  Meta Ireland with a mandate to engage in unlawful processing or that it would 
prevent  the  DPC  (or  the  CSAs)  from  investigating  and  prohibiting  any  unlawful  processing  in  the 
future”501. Meta IE points out that no such inference can be drawn from the Draft Decision, going on 
to draw the conclusion that no risks or consequences “would arise if the Draft Decision was finalised 

                                                             
492 Composite Response, paragraphs 41 and 103.  
493 Composite Response, paragraphs 95-96.  
494 EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 32.  
495 Meta IE argues that “Objections which raise matters which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry are not 
‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR” and such objections “ought to be disregarded 
in their entirety by the EDPB”. The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See  Section 
4.4.1. 
496 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 75 : “the Austrian SA’s Objection fails to satisfy the Sufficiently 
Relevant Threshold, because it is itself based on an Objection grounded in a mistaken allegation of infringement 
of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, which as explained in Meta Ireland’s response at No. 1.a of this Annex 1, does not satisfy 
the Thresholds and lacks merit. Therefore, this Objection is not sufficiently relevant as it has no direct connection 
with the Draft Decision.” Analogous wording is used in response to the NL SA’s objection in Meta IE Article 65 
Submissions, Annex 1, p. 101.  
497 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 76 : “the Austrian SA’s Objection fails to satisfy the Adequately 
Reasoned  Threshold  because  it  is  premised  on  its  Objection  that  a  finding  of  infringement  should  be  found 
regarding Article 6(1) GDPR, which itself does not satisfy the Thresholds and lacks merit.” Analogous wording is 
used in response to the NL SA’s objection in Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 101.

in its current form”502. As to this second line of reasoning, the EDPB fails to see wording by which the 
AT SA or NL SA might have suggested it understands the Draft Decision as a mandate for Meta IE to 
unlawfully process data, thus limiting future investigations.  

262.  The NL SA disagrees with the corrective measure chosen by the IE SA in addition to the administrative 
fine, arguing that a temporary ban on processing (Article 58(2)(f) GDPR) should have been included in 
the Draft Decision instead of an order to bring processing into compliance. If followed, this objection 
would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures. In consequence, the EDPB 
considers the objection to be relevant.  

263.  The  NL  SA  argues  that  an  order  to  bring  processing  into  compliance  entails  that  Meta  IE  would 
maintain its illegal conduct while they amend their compliance deficits503. Conversely, a temporary 
ban  on  Meta  IE’s  processing  of  data  would  ensure  that  data  processing  is  halted  during  the  time 
needed for the company to change its practices to comply with the GDPR504. In terms of risk, the NL 
SA puts forward that “not temporarily banning this processing would undermine the effectiveness of 
the GDPR”, and would continue to deprive data subjects of their rights during the transition period505. 
The NL SA considers the risk significant, as the  controller processes data of 
 monthly active 
users in the EEA, which amounts to approximately 
 of the population and also because the 
processing involves special categories of personal data506. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection 
to be reasoned and to clearly demonstrate the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision. 

264.  The AT SA disagrees with a specific part of the IE SA’s Draft Decision, namely Chapter 8 “Order to bring 
processing into compliance”, arguing that the LSA should have included corrective measures in order 
to remedy an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR507. More specifically, the AT SA suggests that the IE 
SA  prohibits  Meta  IE  from  relying  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR508.  Therefore,  if  followed,  this  objection 
would lead to a different conclusion as to the choice of corrective measures509. In consequence, the 
EDPB considers the objection to be relevant.  

265.  Furthermore, the AT SA argues that when an infringement is found - notably in light of other objections 
raised  in  the  current  case  in  relation  to  additional  infringement  of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  -  the 
supervisory  authority  is  under  an  obligation  to  issue appropriate  corrective  measures  pursuant  to 
Article 58(2) GDPR.  In  terms  of  risk,  the  AT  SA  argues  that  without  this  amendment  of  the  Draft 
Decision, Meta IE “could simply continue to unlawfully rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and to undermine 
data protection principles” which would continue to affect hundred of millions of data subjects within 
the EEA510. Therefore, the EDPB considers the objection to be reasoned and to clearly demonstrate 
the significance of the risks posed by the Draft Decision.

266.  Considering the above, the EDPB finds that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional 
and/or alternative specific corrective measures to be imposed are relevant and reasoned pursuant to 
Article 4(24) GDPR.   

267.  In addition, the EDPB recalls the analysis made in Section 4.4.1 above concerning the objections in 
relation to the additional breach by Meta IE of its lawfulness obligation made by the FR and PT SAs 
(requesting  to  take  appropriate  corrective  measures)  and  by  the  IT  SA  (asking  the  LSA  to  take 
corrective measures in accordance with Article 58(2)(d) GDPR), which were found to be relevant and 
reasoned.  

268.  The EDPB recalls that the DE and NO SA called on the LSA to take specific corrective measures in the 
event the EDPB followed their objection on compliance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. The EDPB considers 
these  to  be  reflections  upon  how,  in  their  view,  the  LSA  should  give  full  effect  to  the  binding 
direction(s) as set out in the EDPB’s decision511. In the absence of legal or factual arguments provided 
by  these  objections  that  would  justify  including  these  specific  corrective  measures  in  the  Draft 
Decision as opposed to others, the EDPB does not consider this aspect of the DE and NO SAs objections 
to meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR as they are not sufficiently reasoned.   

269.  Meta IE argues that the PL SA “raises abstract and broad concerns and does not concretely identify 
valid concerns with the Draft Decision”. The EDPB finds that the objection is concrete and precise in 
the change proposed, namely including a particular reference to the EDPB Transparency Guidelines. 
However, the EDPB notes that the PL SA’s objection presents a disagreement on the wording of the 
Draft Decision, without going so far as to allege that the envisaged action in relation to the controller 
does not comply with the GDPR. Therefore, the EDPB considers the PL SA’s objection in relation to 
Chapter 8 of the Draft Decision to be not sufficiently reasoned.  

8.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

Preliminary matters  

270.  The EDPB considers that the objections found to be relevant and reasoned in this subsection require 
an  assessment  of  whether  the  Draft  Decision  needs  to  be  changed  in  respect  of  the  corrective 
measures  proposed.  More  specifically,  the  EDPB  needs  to  assess  the  request  to  impose  a  ban  of 
processing  for  both  the  infringements  of  the  transparency  obligations  found  by  the  LSA  and  the 
additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR established above in Section 4.4.2, and the  connected 
issue  of  the  corrective  measure  to  be  imposed  for  the  infringement  of  Article 6(1) GDPR.  When 
assessing the merits of the objections raised, the EDPB also takes into account Meta IE’s position on 
the objection and its submissions.  

271.  By way of introduction, the EDPB highlights that the analysis carried out in this section does not refer 
to the content of the Draft Decision and of the objections in respect of the imposition of administrative 
fines, which are covered below in Section 9.  

Meta IE’s position on the objections and its submissions 

272.  Meta IE considers that the LSA has sole discretion to determine the appropriate corrective measures 
in the event of a finding of infringement512 and that Article 65(1) GDPR does not confer power to the

EDPB to give instruction as to “which (if any) of the corrective powers provided in Article 58 ought to 
be exercised”513.  

273.  While Meta IE acknowledges that “Article 65(1) GDPR allows the EDPB to consider reasoned objections 
as  to  whether  the  envisaged  corrective  measures  comply  with  the  GDPR”,  it  argues  that  CSAs  are 
strictly  limited  to  criticism  of  the  corrective  measures  already  put  forward  by  the  LSA.  Therefore, 
according to Meta IE, “should the EDPB find an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the appropriate 
course  is  for  it  to  refer  the  matter  back  to  the  DPC,  as  LSA,  to  determine  whether  to  impose  any 
appropriate corrective measures. Were the EDPB to do otherwise, and direct the DPC to make a specific 
order  in  the  terms  proposed  by  certain  of  the  objections,  it  would  exceed  its  competence  under 
Article 65 GDPR”514. In addition, Meta IE claims that, where an objection concerns corrective measures 
already  included  in  the  Draft  Decision,  this  objection  should  only  address  whether  the  proposed 
measure complies with the GDPR, insofar that “CSAs cannot seek, through an objection, to substitute 
their own view of the corrective measures which ought to be ordered for that of the LSA”515.   

274.  With  respect  to  the  issue  of  the  corrective  measure  to  be  imposed  for  the  infringement  of 
Article 6(1) GDPR, if any, Meta IE argues that a temporary ban is not necessary to achieve the objective 
of ensuring compliance with the GDPR, as there exists alternative, less onerous measures to bring its 
processing  operation  into  compliance  with  the  GDPR516.  In  particular,  Meta  IE  puts  forward  the 
significant impact of a temporary ban not only on its activities but also on third parties’ business, such 
as SMEs, relying on the  platform for behavioural advertising517. In addition,  Meta IE considers this 
measure  disproportionate  in  comparison  with  other  decisions  taken  under  the  Article 60 GDPR 
cooperation  mechanism  in  similar  circumstances518.  Meta  IE  also  alleges  the  need  to  establish  an 
“urgent necessity”519 for imposing a temporary ban. Finally, Meta IE contends that it would be both 
unfair  and  disproportionate  to  order  an  immediate  ban  given  that  it  relied  upon  a  good  faith 
understanding as to what it considered to be a valid legal basis520.  

EDPB’s assessment on the merits 

275.  First of all, according to the EDPB, the views of Meta IE amount to a misunderstanding of the GDPR 
one-stop-shop mechanism and of the shared competences  of the CSAs.  The  EDPB recalls that  the 
GDPR  requires  supervisory  authorities  to  cooperate  pursuant  to  Article 60 GDPR  to  achieve  a 
consistent interpretation of the Regulation521. The  fact  that  the  LSA will be  the authority that can 
ultimately exercise the corrective powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR cannot neither limit the role of 
the CSAs within the cooperation procedure nor the one of the EDPB in the consistency procedure522.

522 Art. 63 and 65 GDPR. In this regard it should be noted that Recital 11 GDPR stresses that “effective protection 
of  personal  data  throughout  the  Union  requires  [...]  equivalent  sanctions  for  infringements  in  the  Member 
States’’. Therefore, in order to ensure this ‘’consistent monitoring and enforcement’’ of the GDPR, the legislator 
has decided to provide supervisory authorities with the ‘’same corrective powers” (Recital 129 GDPR).

276.  More specifically, when raising an objection on the existing or missing corrective measure(s) in the 
Draft Decision, the CSAs should indicate which action they believe would be appropriate for the LSA 
to undertake and include in the final decision523. In case of a disagreement on these objections, the 
dispute resolution competence of the EDPB covers “all the matters which are subject of the relevant 
and reasoned objection” (emphasis added)524. Therefore, contrary to Meta IE’s views, the consistency 
mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application by the supervisory authorities of 
their corrective powers, taking into account the range of powers listed in Article 58(2) GDPR525, when 
a relevant and reasoned objection questions the action(s) envisaged by the Draft Decision vis-a-vis the 
controller/processor, or the absence thereof.  

277.  In addition, the EDPB finds that Meta IE misunderstands the AT SA objection when it argues that it 
does acknowledge that it is for the LSA alone to decide which corrective measures are appropriate 
and necessary, by citing paragraph 112 of the Schrems II CJEU judgment526. In fact, the AT SA does no 
such thing: in its objection it stated “a complainant does not have a subjective right to request from 
the respective supervisory authority (in this case: the DPC) the exercise of a specific corrective power 
and it is for the supervisory authority alone to decide which action is appropriate and necessary (see 
C‑311/18, paragraph 112)”527 and did not engage in an interpretation of how Article 58(2) GDPR is to 
be  understood  in  cross-border  cases  in  the  sections  referred  to.  The  cooperation  and  consistency 
mechanism of the GDPR is not addressed in CJEU ruling C-311/18 (Schrems II) either.  

*** 

278.  Moving on to the analysis of the issue of corrective measures as required by the objections found to 
be relevant and reasoned above, the EDPB recalls that when a violation of the Regulation has been 
established,  competent  supervisory  authorities  are  required  to  react  appropriately  to  remedy  this 
in  accordance  with  the  means  provided  to  them  by  Article 58(2) GDPR528. 
infringement 
Article 58(2) GDPR provides a wide choice of effective tools for the authorities to take action against 
infringements  of  the  Regulation  and  which  can  be  imposed  in  addition  to  or  instead  of  a  fine. 
According to Recital 129 GDPR, every corrective measure applied by a supervisory authority under 
Article 58(2) GDPR  should  be  “appropriate,  necessary  and  proportionate  in  view  of  ensuring 
compliance  with  the  Regulation”  in  light  of  all  the  circumstances  of  each  individual  case.  Recital 
148 GDPR  shows  the  duty  for  supervisory  authorities  to  impose  corrective  measures  that  are 
proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement529.  This highlights the need for the corrective 
measures and any exercise of powers by supervisory authorities to be tailored to the specific case530.

Section 4.4.2, as well as the number of data subjects affected, the EDPB shares the view of the AT, FR,

The EDPB confirmed that “the indications provided by this Recital can be relevant for the imposition of corrective 
measures  in  general  and  for  the  choice  of  the  combination  of  corrective  measures  that  is  appropriate  and 
proportionate to the infringement committed”. EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021, paragraph 256.

IT and PT SAs that it is particularly important that appropriate corrective measures be imposed, in 
addition to a fine, in order to ensure that Meta IE complies with this provision of the GDPR.   

280.  In respect of which measure should be imposed, as stated, the NL SA argues that the IE SA's proposal 
to order Meta IE to comply with Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR within a period 
of three months is not appropriate, considering these breaches in conjunction with the gravity of the 
additional breaches of Article 6(1)(b) and Article 9(2) GDPR identified in its objection531. Instead, the 
NL SA is of the opinion that only a temporary ban imposed in respect of all these infringements can 
effectively protect the rights of the data subjects during the transition period in which the controller 
remedies to these violations532. In addition, the AT SA calls on the IE SA to use its corrective powers 
under  Article 58(2) GDPR  in order  to bring the  processing operations of Meta IE into line  with the 
GDPR, and suggests “that the DPC prohibits Facebook the processing of a user’s data for behavioural 
advertising by relying on Article 6(1)(b)” stating that “otherwise, Facebook could simply continue to 
unlawfully  rely  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”533.  Finally,  the  IT  SA  argues  that  the  finding  of  the  new 
infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should result in the taking of appropriate corrective measures 
under Article 58(2)(d) GDPR by the LSA534.  

281.  Meta  IE  argues  that  a  temporary  ban  would  not  be  necessary  as  less  onerous  measures  could  be 
imposed, avoiding significant impact on its business and third parties535, and that it would be unfair 
and disproportionate536.  

282.  The EDPB agrees with the observations made by the NL SA that the infringement found in the case at 
hand  constitutes  a  “very  serious  situation  of  non-compliance’’537  with  the  GDPR,  in  relation  to 
processing of “extensive amounts of [...] data, which is essential to the controller’s business model”, 
thus harming “the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in the EEA”538. As a result, the EDPB 
shares the NL SA’s concern that the corrective measure chosen in the circumstances of this case should 
aim to bring the processing into compliance with the GDPR thus minimising the potential harm to data 
subjects created by the violations of the GDPR.  

283.  In addition, the EDPB recalls that contrary to Meta IE’s contention, it is not necessary to establish an 
“urgent necessity”539 for imposing a temporary ban, in that nothing in the GDPR limits the application 
of Article 58(2)(f) GDPR to exceptional circumstances540. 

284.  At the same time, the EDPB notes that in assessing the appropriate measure to be applied, Recital 
129 GDPR provides that consideration should be given to ensuring that the measure chosen does not 
create “superfluous costs” and “excessive inconveniences” for the persons concerned in light of the 

                                                             
531 NL SA Objection, paragraph 56. In this respect, the EDPB recalls that, as  stated in Sections 4.4.2 and 5.4.2 
above, while the EDPB finds that the IE SA should have found an infringement of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR in its Draft 
Decision, it does not have sufficient factual evidence allowing it to find a possible infringement by Meta IE of its 
obligations under Art. 9(2) GDPR.

objective  pursued.  When  choosing  the  appropriate  corrective  measure,  there  is  a  need  to  assess 
whether the chosen measure is necessary to enforce the GDPR and achieve protection of the data 
subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data, which is the objective being pursued541. 
Compliance with the principle of proportionality requires ensuring that the chosen measure does not 
create disproportionate disadvantages in relation to the aim pursued. 

285.  The EDPB takes note of the elements raised by the objections, particularly the NL SA, to justify the 
need for imposing a temporary ban, consisting in essence in the need to halt the processing activities 
that are being undertaken in violation of the GDPR until compliance is ensured in order to avoid further 
prejudicing  data  subject  rights.  However,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  objective  of  ensuring 
compliance  and  bringing  the  harm  to  the  data  subjects  to  an  end  can,  in  this  particular  case,  be 
adequately met also by amending the order to bring processing into compliance envisaged in the Draft 
Decision to reflect Meta IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR identified in Section 4 of this Binding 
Decision. In addition to the fines that will be imposed, this measure would require Meta IE to put in 
place the necessary technical and operational measures to achieve compliance within a set timeframe.  

286.  In respect of the imposition of an order to bring processing into compliance, Meta IE submits that any 
such order should “afford a reasonable period of time” to Meta IE to comply542. When determining 
the transition period for bringing Meta IE’s processing into compliance with GDPR, the EDPB requests 
that the IE SA gives due regard to the harm caused to the data subjects by the continuation of Meta 
IE’s infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR during this period. More specifically, the order should require 
Meta IE to restore compliance within a short period of time. In this respect, the EDPB notes that, in 
response to Meta IE’s submission, the IE SA considered the three-month deadline for compliance for 
the 
infringements  of  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and  Article 13(1)(c) GDPR  necessary  and 
proportionate in light of the potential for harms to the data subjects rights that such a measure entails, 
considering that the interim period for compliance “will involve a serious ongoing deprivation of their 
rights”543. The IE SA also points out the significant financial, technological, and human resources, as 
well as the clear instructions provided to Meta IE to comply with GDPR544. The EDPB considers that 
this line of reasoning applies all the more to the corrective measures imposed in relation to Meta IE’s 
infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

287.  Finally, the EDPB recalls that non-compliance with an order issued by a supervisory authority can be 
relevant both in terms of it being subject to administrative fines up to 20.000.000 euros or, in the case 
of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year in 
line  with  Article 83(6) GDPR,  and  in  terms  of  it  being  an  aggravating  factor  for  the  imposition  of 
administrative fines545. In addition, the investigative powers of supervisory authorities allow them to 

                                                             
541  C-311/18  Schrems  II,  paragraph  112:  “Although  the  supervisory  authority  must  determine  which  action  is 
appropriate  and  necessary  and  take  into  consideration  all  the  circumstances  [...]  in  that  determination,  the 
supervisory  authority  is  nevertheless  required  to  execute  its  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  the  GDPR  is  fully 
enforced with all due diligence”. 
542 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 8.37.  
543 Draft Decision, paragraph 8.4. In this regard, Meta IE argues that this was not a reasonable period of time 
within which to make the necessary changes, as the changes would be resource-intensive and would require 
“sufficient lead in time for preparing the relevant changes, conducting and taking account of user testing of the 
proposed changes, internal cross-functional engagement as well as of course engagement with the Commission, 
and  localisation  and  translation  of  the  information  for  countries  in  the  European  Region.”  Draft  Decision,

order the provision of all the information necessary for the performance of their tasks including the 
verification of compliance with one of their orders546.  

288.  The EDPB therefore instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its 
processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising in the context of the Facebook 
service into compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months. 

289.  In addition,  the EDPB notes that the current wording of the order “to bring the Data Policy and Terms 
of  Service  into  compliance  with  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and  Article 13(1)(c) GDPR  as  regards 
information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR” should be modified in order 
to reflect the EDPB’s findings in Section 4.4.2 that Meta IE is not allowed to rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 
for the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising.  

290.  The EDPB also instructs the LSA to adjust its order to  Meta IE to bring its Facebook Data Policy and 
Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months, 
to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also 
to data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of Facebook service (to 
reflect the finding of the EDPB in Section 4.4.2 that for this processing the controller cannot rely on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).

infringements  

9.1.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

The application of the criteria under Article 83(2) GDPR 

292.  In  its  Draft  Decision,  the  IE  SA  explains  how  it  considered  all  the  criteria  in  Article 83(2) GDPR  in 
deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and determine its amount in the circumstances of 
this case548. The most pertinent criteria for the present dispute are summarised below.  

The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature scope or purpose 
of  the  processing  concerned  as  well  as  the number  of  data  subjects  affected  and  level  of  damage 
suffered by them (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) 

293.  The  IE  SA  explains  that 

infringements  of  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 12(1)  and 
Article 13(1)(c) GDPR  identified  in  the  Draft  Decision  simultaneously  in  the  context  of  the

Article 83(2) GDPR criteria549. Further, the IE SA explains that ‘the processing concerned’ refers to ‘all 
of the processing operations that [Meta IE] carries out on the personal data under its controllership for 
which it relies on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR’, in line with the scope of the inquiry (permissibility in principle 
of processing personal data for behavioural advertising)550.  

294.  In  terms  of  the  nature  of  the  infringements,  the  Draft  Decision  explains  that  they  concern  a 
cornerstone of data subject rights, namely the right to information. The IE SA argues that ‘the provision 
of  the  information  concerned  goes  to  the  very  heart  of  the  fundamental  right  of  the  individual  to 
protection of personal data which stems from the free will and autonomy of the individual to share 
their  personal  data  in  a  voluntary  situation  such  as  this.  If  the  required  information  has  not  been 
provided, the data subject has been deprived of the ability to make a fully informed decision as  to 
whether they wish to use a service that involves the processing of their personal data and engages 
their  associated  rights.  Furthermore,  the  extent  to  which  a  data  controller  has  complied  with  its 
transparency obligations has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the other data subject rights. If 
data subjects have not been provided with the prescribed information, they may be deprived of the 
knowledge they need in order to consider exercising one of the other data subject rights’551. Further, 
the  IE SA notes  that the  European legislator included infringements on the  right to information in 
Article 83(5) GDPR, which carries the highest maximum fine552. 

295.  In terms of the gravity of the infringements, the IE SA explains that Meta IE is found to also have 
infringed Article 12(1) and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR because the company has not provided the required 
information in the required manner under Article 13(1)(c) GDPR. The IE SA adds that ‘this represents 
a significant level of non-compliance, taking into account the importance of the right to information, 
the consequent impact on the data subjects concerned and the number of data subjects potentially 
affected’553.  

296.  With regard to the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned, the IE SA considers that 
the “personal data processing carried out by [Meta IE] pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive. 
[Meta IE] processes a variety of data in order to serve users personalised advertisements, tailor their 
‘News  Feed’,  and  to  provide  feedback  to  advertising  partners  on  the  popularity  of  particular 
advertisements. The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered, and, for this 
reason,  the  provision  of  compliant  information  in  relation  to  that  processing  becomes  even  more 
important. This, indeed, may include location and IP address data”554.  

297.  With  reference  to  the  number  of  data  subjects  affected,  the  IE  SA  points  out  that,  as  Meta  IE 
 monthly active 
confirmed, “as of the date of the Complaint, [Meta IE] had approximately 
 monthly active users  in the European 
users  and, as  of May 2021, it had approximately 
Economic Area”555 and that, while it is not possible to identify the precise number of users affected, 

                                                             
549 “While each is an individual ‘infringement’ of the relevant provision, they all concern transparency and, by 
reason of their common nature and purpose, are likely to generate the same, or similar, outcomes in the context 
of some of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment criteria.” Draft Decision, paragraphs 9.3.

  of  the  population  of  the  EEA  (including  the  UK)  seems  to  be  potentially 

298.  In terms of damages suffered by affected data subjects, the IE SA finds that “the failure to provide all 
of  the  prescribed  information  undermines  the  effectiveness  of  the  data  subject  rights  and, 
consequently, infringes  the rights  and freedoms  of the data subjects  concerned. A core element of 
transparency is empowering data subjects to make informed decisions about engaging with activities 
that  cause  their  personal  data  to  be  processed,  and  making  informed  decisions  about  whether  to 
exercise particular rights, and whether they can. This right is undermined by a lack of transparency on 
the part of a data controller”557.  

299.  On Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, the IE SA concludes that “[the] infringements are serious in nature. The lack 
of transparency goes to the heart of data subject rights and risks undermining their effectiveness by 
not providing transparent information in that regard. While the infringements considered here relate 
to one lawful basis, it nonetheless concerns vast swathes of personal data impacting millions of data 
subjects.  When  such  factors  are  considered,  it  is  clear  that  the  infringements  are  serious  in  their 
gravity” and “Over 
 of the population of the EEA seems to be impacted by the infringements. This 
is a very large figure”558. The IE SA further notes “in particular the impact a lack of transparency has 
on a data subject’s  ability  to be fully informed about their data protection rights, or indeed about 
whether in their view they should exercise those rights”559.  

300.  The IE SA does not attach significant weight to the duration of the infringements560, considering that 
the complaint - and therefor the inquiry -  was made against a specific set of documents (Facebook’s 
Data Policy and Terms of Service) and that more recent versions of the relevant documents are outside 
the scope of the inquiry561.  

The intentional or negligent character of the infringements (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) 

301.  The IE SA notes the Complainant’s view that the infringement arose from “a decision made knowingly 
to present information in a particular way”562 but states that there is no evidence of an “intentional 
and  knowing  breach”  of  a  provision  of  the  GDPR563.  The  IE  SA  notes  that  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on 
Administrative Fines refer to two requirements, “knowledge” and “willfulness”, adding “this suggests 
a controller must infringe the GDPR both in full knowledge of the infringement’s characteristics and 
also in a deliberate manner. Having considered the nature of the infringements further in the context 
of the Fining Guidelines, [the IE SA] accept[s] [Meta IE’s] submissions, that any intentional breach must 
be  an  intentional  and  knowing  breach  of  a  provision  of  the  GDPR.”  The  IE  SA  finds  there  was  no 
evidence of an intentional and knowing breach of a provision of the GDPR.  In terms of the impact of 
this assessment on the decision whether or not to impose an administrative fine, the IE SA stated that

562 Draft Decision, paragraph 9.24. 
563  Draft  Decision,  paragraph 9.25.  In  its  analysis,  the  IE  SA  takes  into  consideration  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on

“While I am not calling into question Facebook’s right to come to a genuine view on this matter 564, I 
am taking into account the failure of an organisation of this size to provide sufficiently transparent 
materials in relation to the core of its business model”565.  

The  action  taken  by  the  controller  or  processor  to  mitigate  the  damage  suffered  by  data  subjects 
(Article 83(2)(c) GDPR) 

302.  The  IE  SA  notes  Meta  IE’s  position  that  “its  approach  to  transparency,  in  the  context  in  which 
infringements have been found, complies fully with the GDPR”. Notwithstanding their disagreement 
with this position the IE SA “accept[s] that it represents a genuinely held belief on [Meta IE’s] part.  This 
does not alter the fact that infringements have occurred. On that basis, there has been no effort to 
mitigate  the damage  to  data  subjects,  given  [Meta  IE’s]  position  was  that  no  damage  was  taking 
place”566. The IE SA is not swayed by Meta IE’s argument that their efforts to comply with the GDPR 
should be taken into consideration, as - in general - compliance with the GDPR is a duty imposed on 
each controller. In the present case, the IE SA finds this factor is neither mitigating nor aggravating 
insofar as “beyond simply complying with the GDPR, there are no obvious mitigating steps that could 
have  been  taken”567.  Notwithstanding  this,  the  IE  SA  identifies  a  mitigating  factor  in  Meta  IE’s 
willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the 
conclusion of the inquiry568. 

The  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  taking  into  account  technical  and  organisational 
measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 (Article 83(2)(d) GDPR) 

303.  The IE SA does not expressly mention whether it considers this factor as aggravating or mitigating in 
the Draft Decision569. The IE SA takes the view that  “[Meta IE]’s responsibility is certainly at a high 
level”,  noting  Meta  IE’s  “genuine  effort  to  implement  compliance  based  on  [their]  genuinely  held 
belief”  which  “however, has  ultimately fallen short in terms  of compliance in significant respects”. 
Moreover, the IE SA finds “that it concerns serious data processing, and that it was deliberate act, in 
spite of the genuinely held belief that the modes of implementation were compliant”570. On this basis, 
the IE SA concluded that the degree of responsibility on Meta IE’s part was therefore responsibility of 
a high level571. 

The categories of personal data affected by the infringements (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR) 

304.  The IE SA notes that “[the] lack of transparency concerned broad categories of personal data relating 
to  users  who  sign  up  to  the  service.  I  have  set  out  several  times  in  this  Draft  Decision  that  the 
assessment of data processing in this Inquiry was, by its nature, rather generalised. Indeed, the lack of 

                                                             
564 In this regard, the IE SA noted Meta IE’s arguments that the infringements arose from a good faith difference 
of  opinion  but  considered  that  this  does  not  alter  the  infringements’  objectively  serious  character  (Draft 
Decision, paragraph 9.8) and pointed out the “clear inconsistencies between the [EDPB Transparency Guidelines] 
and the manner in which Facebook attempted to comply with its obligations” (Draft Decision, paragraph 9.10).

transparency on Meta IE’s part has itself contributed to a lack of clarity on precisely what categories 
of personal data are involved”572.  

305.  The IE SA concludes this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating573. 

The  manner 
(Article 83(2)(h) GDPR) 

in  which  the 

infringements  became  known  to  the  supervisory  authority 

306.  The  IE  SA  notes  that  “[the]  subject  matter  became  known  to  the  Commission  due  to  an  Inquiry 
conducted  on  foot  of  the  Complaint.  The  subject  matter  did  not  give  rise  to  any  requirement  of 
notification, and I have already acknowledged several times that the controller’s genuinely held belief 
is that no infringement is/was occurring”574.The IE SA does not mention this factor as an aggravating 
or mitigating factor in the Draft Decision575.  

Any other aggravating or mitigating factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

307.  The IE SA considers whether the “lack of transparency has the potential to have resulted in financial 
benefits for Facebook” based on the view that a “more transparent approach to processing operations 
carried out on foot of that contract would represent a risk to Facebook’s business model”, which would 
be  the  case  “if  existing  or  prospective  users  were  dissuaded  from  using  the  service  by  clearer 
explanations of the processing operations carried out, and their purposes”576. The IE SA concludes that 
this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating, arguing that “any general consideration of this [factor] 
ultimately involves an element of speculation on both [Meta IE]’s and the Commission’s part”577.  

The application of the criteria under Article 83(1) GDPR 

308.  The IE SA considers that administrative fines pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83 GDPR, totalling 
an amount not less than €28 million and an amount not more than €36 million should be issued on 
Meta IE for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a), Article 12(1) and Article 13(1)(c) GDPR578.  

309.  The LSA considers the proposed administrative fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive taking 
into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry579. Regarding the effectiveness, the IE SA argues 
that  the  “infringements  are serious, both in terms  of the extremely large number of data subjects

More specifically, the IE SA proposes the following administrative fines (Draft Decision, paragraph 9.47):  
- a fine of between €18 million and €22 million for the failure to provide sufficient information in relation to the 
processing operations carried out on foot of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, thereby infringing Art. 5(1)(a) and 13(1)(c) GDPR; 
- a fine of between €10 million and €14 million for the failure to provide the information that was provided on 
the processing operations carried out in foot of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily 
accessible form, using clear and plain language, thereby infringing Art. 5(1)(a) and Art. 12(1) GDPR. 
The proposed administrative fines are to be applied cumulatively, as they do not surpass the maximum provided 
for in Art. 83(5) GDPR. See Draft Decision, paragraphs 10.6, 10.41 and 10.42.

the failure to comply with the transparency requirements for users”580. Concerning the dissuasiveness, 
the LSA states that the fine must “dissuade both the controller/processor concerned as well as other 
controllers/processors  carrying  out  similar  processing  operations  from  repeating  the  conduct 
concerned”581. As regards the  proportionality, the  IE SA considers  that  the  fines  proposed  “do not 
exceed  what  is  necessary  to  enforce  compliance  with  the  GDPR,  taking  into  account  the  size  of 
Facebook’s user base, the impact of the infringements on the effectiveness of the data subject rights 
enshrined in Chapter III of the GDPR and the importance of those rights in the context of the GDPR as 
a whole”582.  

310.  The IE SA refers to the need to take into account the undertaking’s turnover in the calculation of the 
fine amounts583. The notion of “undertaking” is determined to refer to Meta Platforms, Inc.584. The IE 
SA  takes  into  consideration  revenue  reported  by  Meta Platforms, Inc.  for  the  year  ending  31 
December 2020 ($84.169 billion)585.  

9.1.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

311.  The DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs586 object to the envisaged action taken by the LSA with regard to the 
administrative  fine  proposed  in  the  Draft  Decision  with  respect  to  the  infringements  of  the 
transparency obligations by asking the IE SA to impose a significantly587 higher administrative fine 
with reference to the established infringements.  

312.  The  dispute  arising  from  these  objections  concerns  whether  the  proposed  fine  is  effective, 
proportionate and dissuasive pursuant to Article 83(1) GDPR588. With reference to these three criteria, 
the above mentioned SAs, specifically, argue as follows.  

313.  The DE SAs argue that the envisaged fine of at most 36 million euros is not proportionate compared 
to the undertaking’s worldwide annual turnover and its profitability, which is higher than an average 
undertaking. Moreover, the fine cannot be deemed proportionate  taking into account  that a most 
relevant information was not provided to data subjects, also in light of the consideration that Meta IE 
acted with “(only) negligence and any efforts of the controller to abide to the law after committing the 
infringements”589. The  DE SAs point out that “The envisaged maximum fine is about 0.05 %  of the 
global annual turnover, about 0.15 % of the year’s 2020 profit and about 1.29 % of the fining range. 
Thus, the envisaged fine moves at the lowest edge of the corridor. Converted to a single person of the 
about 
 data subjects (section 9.15 DD) affected by the infringements, the fine would be EUR

”590. With regard to effectiveness, the DE SAs consider that the fine proposed by the LSA would 
be hardly noticeable for Meta IE due to its business situation591. Lastly, with respect to dissuasiveness, 
the DE SAs state that the envisaged fine would not have neither special nor general preventive effect. 
With reference to this latter, the DE SAs state that the envisaged fine would likely have the opposite 
effect,  as  “Other  controllers  may  orientate  their  compliance  with  data  protection  law  taking  into 
account such a low fine. They will relate their own turnover and profit to those of the Facebook Group 
and find that there would be little risk, if at all, if they violate data subjects’ rights”592.   

314.  The FR SA argues that the amount of the envisaged fine “seems low and hardly compatible with the 
objective set by Article 83(1) GDPR of ensuring to impose dissuasive fines”  taking into account “the 
number of data subjects concerned, the particularly intrusive nature of the processing operations in 
question, the breaches observed, the position of Facebook Ireland Limited as a quasi-monopolist and 
its  financial  situation”593.  Moreover,  the  FR  SA  notes  that  the  fine  proposed  by  the  IE  SA  is  not 
proportionate since “the cumulative amount of the two breaches of the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) 
and 13-1-c) of the GDPR, on the one hand, and the provisions of Articles 5-1-a) and 12-1 of the GDPR, 
on the other hand, represents only about 0.04% of the turnover of Facebook Inc. and about 1% of the 
maximum fine”594  

315.  The  NL  SA  doubts,  also  referring  to  the  WP29  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines,  that  the  fines 
proposed by the IE SA meet the objective to be effective “particularly considering the strong financial 
position of the controller and the finding that the identified lack of transparency likely has had financial 
benefits  for  the  controller”595.  As  regard  to  dissuasiveness,  the  NL  SA  argues,  also  referring  to  the 
established CJEU case law, that Meta IE “generates a turnover of over 83 billion dollars (approximately 
72 billion euros) per annum, therefore it would be able to generate a daily revenue of approximately 
228 million dollars. Instead of dissuading future behaviour, the penalty would be simply regenerated 
in a few hours” (specific deterrence)596. With reference to proportionality, the NL SA questions the 
lack of reasoning in the Draft Decision as to why  the  amounts proposed are commensurate to the 
seriousness of the infringements597. 

316.  The NO SA argues that the envisaged amount of the fine is not effective nor dissuasive neither to Meta 
IE nor to other controllers, considering the financial benefits accrued because of the violations and 
the worldwide annual turnover of Meta Platform Inc. for 2020, NO SA points out that Meta IE “would 
likely have no issue paying the proposed fine, and the amount of the fine it is not likely to affect [it] in 
such a way that it would see a need to substantially change its practices.”598.  

317.  The PL SA states that “in order to ensure that the administrative fine is effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive, the proposed amount of administrative fine should be adapted to the very high turnover of 
the Controller and the large amount of cash it saved”599 and it argues that “taking into account the 
high turnover of the company, it is difficult to conclude that the proposed financial penalty in such a

low amount can effectively deter the punished entity from committing similar violations in the future. 
Moreover, for other entities achieving a similar turnover, a fine in this amount will be a clear signal 
that it is not worth paying much attention to compliance with the provisions of the GDPR, because the 
costs of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures may exceed the amount of 
a possible fine”600. 

318.  In addition, the objections raise arguments with regard to the weight afforded to some of the criteria 

listed in Article 83(2) GDPR.  

319.  The  DE  SAs  argue  that  the  significant  level  of  non-compliance  established  by  the  LSA601  and  the 
number of data subjects602 should by themselves have resulted in a fine in the range of at least some 
permille of the annual turnover603. Moreover, the DE SAs argue that an even higher number of data 
subjects may be affected than the number taken into consideration in the Draft Decision considering 
that  “Whilst  Facebook  reported  2.80 billion  monthly  active  users,  they  report  3.30 billion  ‘family 
monthly active people’ for 2020. Applying this increase of about 18 % there could be about 
 
)” as a consequence “the possibility of almost 
affected data subjects (
) more affected data subjects  should 

  (the difference between 

 plus 18 % = 

  and 

have considerable weight regarding the calculation”604.   

320.  The FR SA argues that the fine is in contradiction with the seriousness of the violations identified and 

the nature of the processing (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)605  

321.  The  NL  SA  argues  that  the  fine  is  not  commensurate  with  the  seriousness  of  the  infringements 

established (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) and is inconsistent with the IE SA's qualifications as such606.  

322.  The NO SA argues that “the suggested fine is not proportionate to the seriousness of the violations and 
the  aggravating  factors  identified”,  the  “number  of  data  subjects  affected  in  the  EEA  amounts  to 
hundreds of millions” and agrees with the LSA that the controller’s “level of responsibility is high” 607.   

323.  The PL SA considers that “In determining the gravity of the infringements identified in the draft decision 
by the LSA, account must be taken not only of the massive nature of the data processing carried out 
by Controller, but also of the fact that the data processing is the essential part of Controller’s business 
activity” (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR)608. Moreover, the PL SA states that the mitigating factor concerning 
the  fact  that  Meta  IE  expressed  its  willingness  to  engage  in  steps  to  bring  its  processing  into 
compliance on a voluntary basis during the inquiry stage, “should not result in the reduction of the 
proposed administrative fine, due to the fact that the cooperation with the LSA is a legal obligation of 
the  controller  and  its  intention  to  bring  the  processing  operations  into  the  compliance  with  the 
provisions  of  GDPR,  as  a  future  and  uncertain  event,  should  not  be  taken into  account  during  the 
assessment of the administrative fine” (Article 83(2)(c) GDPR)609.

324.  The DE and FR SAs put forward some further factual and legal arguments for the proposed change in 

legal assessment.  

325.  Specifically the DE SAs raise that the profitability of the undertaking is one of the elements that should 
be relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine610, The DE SAs highlight that “the Facebook Group 
is an extreme profitable undertaking. The group has an annual profit (net income) of USD 29.146 billion 
(EUR 23.752 billion per 31st December 2020) with a turnover of USD 85.965 billion (EUR 70.055 billion) 
in 2020. According to the financial report for the second quarter of 2021, the turnover and net income 
are  further increasing  rapidly  (+56%  turnover and  +101  %  net  income  compared  to  the  equivalent 
second quarter of 2020)” and  that  “Facebook’s  return is  significantly better than the return in the 
overall economic field; in relation to German/European companies by a factor of about 9 or higher”611.  

326.  The DE SAs also argue that Meta Platforms, Inc.’s total turnover should be taken into account for the 
determination of the fine. This total turnover amounts to USD 85.965 billion in 2020 and it is higher 
than the USD 84.169 billion (turnover generated through advertising) referred to by the LSA612. 

327.  The FR SA notes that the amount of the fine proposed by the IE SA “seems to be underestimated in 
comparison with the amount retained in the deliberation of the CNIL’s restricted committee No. SAN-
2019-001  of  21  January 2019  imposing  a  penalty  of 50 million  euros  on  the  company  Google  LLC, 
adding that  “this  case  is  comparable because  it is  also based on a referral filed by the association 
‘NOYB’ with the CNIL, relating to a similar issue and formulated against Google, and that the restricted 
committee has identified a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR and a breach of the provisions of Articles 12 
and 13 of the GDPR. However, the amount retained against Google LLC is close to that proposed by 
the  Irish  data  protection  authority,  even  though  the  processing  operations  in  question  concern  all 
European users, which was not the case in the above-mentioned CNIL’s decision, for which only French 
users were taken into account”613. The FR SA states that the amount proposed appears low also in 
comparison with the one retained by the LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company 
Amazon Europe Core, where an administrative fine of 746 million euros has been imposed for the 
infringement  of  Articles 6,  12  and  13 GDPR.  This  case  was  also  based  on  a  complaint  that  the 
processing  operations  carried  out  by  the  companies  of  the  Amazon  group  relating  to  behavioural 
advertising did not have a valid legal basis614. Also, the FR SA argues that expressing the proposed fine 
as a range and not as a fixed amount is not in line with Article 60 GDPR615. 

328.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs consider that, if adopted, the Draft 
Decision would lead to a significant risk for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
the  data  subjects616.  The  DE,  FR,  NL,  NO  and  PL  SAs  explain  that  it  would  not  ensure  an  effective 
enforcement  of  the  GDPR,  as  the  proposed  fine  is  unable  to  create  a  deterrent  effect  (either 
specifically towards the controller, or in general towards other controllers)617. The NO SA considers 
this would mean “that the complainant and the affected data subjects would in practice be denied the

level of data protection set out in the GDPR”618. The FR SA argues the Draft Decision as it stands would 
“lead to a levelling down of the level of administrative fines  imposed by European data protection 
authorities, thereby reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure 
effective compliance with the protection of the personal data of European residents”619. The DE SAs 
add that the Draft Decision does not promote a consistent application of administrative fines620 and 
argue  that “using of the incorrect turnover figure would create a dangerous  precedent since other 
controllers  could  ‘choose’  that  supervisory  authorities  use  a  lower  turnover  figure  as  well”, 
undermining the effectiveness of sanctions and resulting eventually in a significant risk to the rights 
and fundamental freedoms of the data subjects concerned “since controllers could adjust their level 
of compliance to the data protection”621. 

9.1.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

329.  The LSA considers none of the objections relating to the quantum of the proposed administrative fine 

as relevant and reasoned622.   

330.  In relation to objections calling for an increase of the amount of the fine set out in the Draft Decision, 
the LSA states it is “satisfied that it has fully taken into account the criteria at Article 83(2) GDPR, and 
that  the  proposed  administrative  fines  meet  the  requirements  of  Article 83(1) GDPR,  taking  into 
account all the circumstances of this matter, and as set out Part 10 of the Draft Decision” and considers 
that “the proposal as to the fine to be meaningful in terms of both the financial significance of it on 
any view, as well as the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract”623. The LSA refutes 
that including a fining range in the Draft Decision is incompatible with Article 60 GDPR624.  

331.  With reference to the objections relating to the mode of calculating the proposed administrative fine 
(assessment  of  the  Article 83(2) GDPR  criteria),  the  LSA  does  not  accept  that  these  objections  are 
relevant625. The LSA refutes that for the purposes of Article 83(2) GDPR it should have considered a 
larger number of users, namely the reported number of users for the wider Facebook “family” of apps 
insofar such apps are not covered by the Facebook Terms of Service, and so are not relevant to the 
present circumstances626. 

332.  While agreeing that “the full turnover figure should be used when calculating the administrative fine”, 
the IE SA considers the objection not relevant “as the turnover figure in the final decision will in any 
event refer to the 2021 turnover for Meta Platforms, Inc. and Meta Ireland”627.

9.1.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

9.1.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

333.  The objections raised by the DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs concern “whether the action envisaged in the 

Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”628.  

334.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 

threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR629.   

335.  With  specific  regard  to  these  objections  on  the  determination  of  the  administrative  fine  for  the 
transparency infringements, Meta IE acknowledges that objections as to whether envisaged corrective 
measures  comply  with  the  GDPR  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  dispute  resolution  mechanism630, 
however in their view objections solely protesting the amount of a fine are out of its scope631. Meta IE 
argues that “in the context of a matter relating to cross-border processing, the power to impose an 
administrative fine under the GDPR lies within the sole competence of the LSA, in this case the DPC, 
and not the CSAs or the EDPB”632. Moreover, in their view only the LSA is competent to determine 
whether the administrative fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive633. The EDPB does not share 
this reading of the GDPR, as explained above (see Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 275 - 277) and considers 
that CSAs may object to the fine amount proposed by an LSA in its Draft Decision634.  

                                                             
628 EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 32.  
629 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 70. 
630 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraphs 8.14 and 9.2. 
631 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2. 
632 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2. 
633 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.2. Meta IE adds that “the EDPB may not give instructions as to 
whether a fine ought to be imposed or as to its amount (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any instruction to 
the LSA to increase the fine)” The argument is reiterated in Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex I - Response 
to each of the objections, see p. 85 (SE SA), p. 91 (NO SA), p. 110 (FR SA), p. 123 (IT SA), p. 129-130 and 132 (DE 
SAs). 
634 In this regard, Recital 150 GDPR can be recalled, as it states that the consistency mechanism may also be used 
to  promote  a  consistent  application  of  administrative  fines.  Consequently,  an  objection  can  challenge  the 
elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine, and if the assessment of the EDPB within this context 
identifies shortcomings in the reasoning leading to the imposition of the fine at stake, the LSA will be instructed 
to re-assess the fine and remedy the identified shortcomings (EDPB Guidelines on Art. 65(1)(a), paragraph 91; 
EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 34. The EDPB found several objections on this subject matter admissible in 
the  past,  see  e.g.  Binding  Decision 1/2020,  paragraphs 175-178  and 180-181,  Binding  Decision 1/2021, 
paragraphs 310-314, Binding Decision 1/2022 paragraphs 53-55, Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 186-190. 
Consequently, within its mission of ensuring a consistent application of the GDPR, the EDPB is fully competent 
to resolve the dispute arisen among supervisory authorities and remedy the shortcomings in the Draft Decision 
concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which will in any event be quantified and imposed by the 
LSA in its national decision adopted on the basis of the EDPB’s binding decision.

336.  The EDPB takes note of further arguments put forward by Meta IE, aiming to demonstrate lack of 
relevance of the objections raised by the DE635, FR636, NL637, NO638 and PL639 SAs. Meta IE disagrees 
with the content of these objections, which concerns its merits and not its admissibility.  

337.  The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs disagree with a specific part of the IE SA’s Draft 
Decision, namely Chapter 9  “Administrative fine”  and Chapter  10  “Other relevant  factors”,  arguing 
that the fine proposed for the transparency infringements identified is too low640. If followed, these 
objections would lead to a different conclusion in terms of the corrective measures imposed641. In 
consequence,  the  EDPB  considers  the  objections  raised  by  the  DE,  FR,  NL,  NO  and  PL  SAs  to  be 
relevant.  

                                                             
635  Meta  IE  dismisses  the  DE  SAs  Objection  to  the  fine  proposed  in  the  Draft  Decision  as  not  relevant  nor 
reasoned,  because  it  “does  not  challenge  the  factors  relied  upon  to  calculate  the  amount  of  the  fine,  given 
turnover  is  relevant  only  to  determining  the  maximum  fine  that  can  be  lawfully  imposed  and  not  the  fine 
amount”. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 129.  
636 Meta IE dismisses the FR SA’s objection as not relevant, because it criticises the amount of the proposed fine, 
“rather than the factors the DPC relied on to calculate the fine - which are the relevant legal and factual content 
of the Draft Decision”. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 110. Besides noting that the FR SA does criticise 
the  weight  given  to  the  gravity  of  the  infringement  and  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  processing  (see  FR  SA 
Objection, paragraph 50) the EDPB recalls it is entirely possible to argue an administrative fine is not ‘effective, 
proportionate and dissuasive’ in the meaning of Art. 83(1) GDPR without referring to a specific criterion listed in 
Art. 83(2) GDPR. Thus, Meta IE disagrees with the content of the objection, which concerns the merits and not 
the admissibility of the objection. 
637 Meta IE argues the NL SA’s objection “raises general criticisms of the DPC’s approach but fails to engage with 
the specific factual and legal content of the Draft Decision” as articulated in paragraphs 9.47 to 9.52 therein. 
Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 99. The EDPB notes that the IE SA explains in paragraphs 9.48 to 9.50 why it 
is  “satisfied  that  the  fines  proposed  above  would,  if  imposed  on  Facebook,  be  effective,  proportionate  and 
dissuasive, taking into account all of the circumstances of the Inquiry”, which the NL SA expressly disagrees with 
in their objection. See NL SA Objection, paragraphs 37 - 52. 
638 Meta IE reiterates its position that “the LSA has sole competence and discretion to determine the level of the 
fine” to  conclude  the  NO  SA’s  objection  is not relevant.  See  Meta IE  Article 65  Submissions,  p. 91.  The EDPB 
responds to this argument above (Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 275 - 277 as well as footnote 634). 
639 Meta IE rejects that turnover is relevant for determining the fine amount, to conclude on this basis the PL 
SA’s objection “does not challenge the elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine” and this is not 
relevant. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 105.

338.  Meta IE dismisses as unsubstantiated the reasoning put forward by the DE642, FR643, NL644, NO645 and 
PL646  SAs. In doing so, Meta IE  disagrees with the  content of the objections, which concerns their 
merits  and  not  their  admissibility.  Meta  IE  argues  that  the  FR  and  NL  SAs’  objections  do  not 
demonstrate they could lead to a different conclusion in the Draft Decision647, thus not recognising an 
increase of the administrative fine proposed as constituting a different conclusion.  

339.  Meta IE further argues that the DE, FR, NO and PL objections lack sufficient reasoning because they 
introduce ‘additional’ criteria for the determination of the fine that have no basis in Article 83 GDPR648. 
The EDPB understands that Meta IE disagrees with the reasoning provided in the objection, which thus 
concerns the merits and not the admissibility of the objection.  

340.  The  EDPB  finds  that  the  DE,  FR,  NL,  NO  and  PL  SAs  argue  why  they  propose  amending  the  Draft 
Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed, i.e. why 
they propose to impose a higher fine for the transparency breaches649. 

                                                             
642 Meta IE disagrees with DE SAs argument that profitability should have been considered as an aggravating 
factor (under Art. 83(2)(k) GDPR), takes issue with the DE SAs calculating the size of the fine on a per data subject 
basis, and rejects the DE SAs argument that a fine should have a general preventative effect. In addition, Meta 
IE argues the DE SAs did not challenge the elements the IE SA relied on to determine the fine, while also repeating 
the IE SA has sole discretion on this matter. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 129-130. 
643 Meta IE considers the FR SA’s objections to contain “unsubstantiated and theoretical reasons”, which “do not 
provide sound and substantiated factual and legal reasoning as to why the DPC should alter its determination of 
the  fines”.  At  the  same  time,  Meta  IE cites  specific  reasoning from  the  FR  SA’s,  namely  “the number of data 
subjects  concerned,  the  particularly  intrusive  nature  of  the  processing  operations  in  question,  the  breaches 
observed,  the  position  of  Facebook  Ireland  Limited  as  a  quasi-monopolist  and  its  financial  situation”  (FR  SA 
Objection, paragraph 40) and the comparison the FR SA makes with other cases (FR SA Objection, paragraph 43). 
See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 110. 
644  Meta  IE  acknowledges  that  the  NL  SA  provides  reasoning  as  well  as  alleges  inconsistencies  in  the  Draft 
Decision,  but  dismisses  the  objection  as  being  unsubstantiated,  speculative  and  insufficient  to  satisfy 
Article 4(24) GDPR. In particular, Meta IE takes issue with the NL SA “noting that it ‘doubts’ the fines meet the 
required objectives - without more concrete reasoning being provided”. First, the NL SA provides two reasons for 
its ‘doubt’, namely “particularly considering the strong financial position of the controller and the finding that 
the identified lack of transparency likely has had financial benefits for the controller (See paragraph 9.43 of the 
Draft Decision)”. Second, the EDPB finds that using the verb ‘doubt’ does not void the reasoning that follows, 
especially read in conjunction with the affirmative sentences laying out the grounds for the disagreement. See 
Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 99. 
645 Meta IE’s arguments mainly concern the administrative fine the NO SA asks for processing without a valid 
legal basis. These arguments are addressed below (see  paragraph 420 and following). In connection with the 
reasoning of the NO SA asking for an increase of the administrative fine for transparency infringements, Meta IE 
disagrees “that Meta Ireland would not be affected by the fine in a way to substantially change its practices, and 
that neither would 
other controllers” by stating this is mere speculation by the NO SA.  Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 92. 
646 Meta IE considers the objection ‘entirely speculative’ alleging the PL SA “speculates, without providing any 
factual  basis,  that  Meta’s  profits  depend  on  the  volume  of  data  processed”.  Meta IE  Article 65  Submissions,

341.  In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk 
to fundamental rights and argues the objections of the DE650, FR651, NL652, NO653 and PL654 SAs fail to 
demonstrate the contrary, as required. 

342.  Meta IE argues not every GDPR infringement is likely to pose a significant risk to fundamental rights, 
alleging the NO and PL SAs fail to address this655. The EDPB notes the NO and PL SAs actually do not 
refer to ‘any infringement’ but advance their objection in relation to the transparency infringements 
identified in the Draft Decision656, which the NO SA adds are considered serious by the IE SA657.   

343.  Meta IE argues the NO and PL SA’s objections rest on unsubstantiated potential future behaviour of 
controllers,  which  could  only  be  an  indirect  and  remote  risk658.  The  EDPB  notes  that  any  risk 
assessment addresses future outcomes, which are to some degree uncertain. Contrary to Meta IE’s 
view659, the objections reflect specifically on the likely effects to be generated by the Draft Decision in 
the event it is adopted as it stands and thus go beyond mere speculation about controllers at large660.   

344.  Meta IE takes issue with the DE SA’s argument that the proposed fine would be “hardly noticeable for 
the undertaking” and thus lack special preventive effect 661 as well as with the similar argument raised 
by  the  PL  SA662.  Further,  Meta  IE  dismisses  the  concerns  the  DE,  FR,  NL  SAs  articulate  about  the 
precedent the Draft Decision sets in terms of use of corrective powers in terms of general deterrent.  
Meta IE claims a significant risk should be demonstrated in the context of the case at hand663, adding 
that fines require “a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR, which in respect of cross-border 
cases will be subject to the cooperation and consistency mechanism” (apparently contradicting Meta 
IE’s position that determining the fine lies “within the sole competence of the LSA”)664. Finally, Meta IE 

                                                             
650 Meta IE argues the risks identified by the DE SAs are ‘abstract and unsubstantiated’. See Meta IE Article 65 
Submissions, p. 130-132. 
651 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 112. 
652  Meta  IE  argues  that  the  NL  SA  “vaguely  refers  to  the  risk  for  data  subjects  remaining  subject  to  illegal 
processing  in  the  future,  rather  than  showing  the  significance  of  such  risks  based  on  the  facts  of  this  case”.

661 On the one hand, Meta IE “submits the German SA is operating under the misconception that turnover is not 
only a relevant factor to consider when calculating a fine under GDPR, but that unless turnover is calculated in 
the manner the German SA suggests, the fining system will be weakened to such an extent that fines are not 
effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. This is incorrect and untenable as Article 83(2) GDPR does not mention, 
let alone require consideration of turnover for setting the fine amount” On the other hand, Meta IE appears to 
argue the fine is dissuasive as it is, due to reputational costs of fines. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 130-
131. See DE SAs Objection, p. 12-16 on specific and general deterrence. 
662 See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 106 in response to the PL SA’s argument that it is “difficult to conclude 
that  the  proposed  financial  penalty  in  such  a  low  amount  can  effectively  deter  the  punished  entity  from 
committing similar violations in the future”, PL SA Objection, p. 5.

dismisses these objections as not based on any facts or legal demonstration665, going so far as to claim 
“‘precedent’ is a concept foreign to EU law”666. 

345.  First, the EDPB notes that any risk assessment addresses future outcomes, which are to some degree 
uncertain, and finds there is no basis in the GDPR to limit the notion of risks to the boundaries of the 
particular case at hand. Article 4(24) GDPR refers to the risks posed to the “fundamental rights and 
freedoms of data subjects” and “where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union”. 
Both of these aspects are phrased in a general way. The wording of this provision does not in any way 
limit the demonstration of the risks to showing the risks posed to the data subjects affected by the 
concrete processing carried out by the specific controller, in light of the objective of guaranteeing a 
“high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals”667. Therefore, the risks 
posed by a draft decision to be demonstrated by a relevant and reasoned objection might also concern 
data subjects, whose personal data might be processed in the future, including by other controllers.   

346.  Second, the EDPB points out that final decisions taken by SAs belong to the realm of facts, as do court 
rulings. Moreover, Meta IE itself refers to specific pre-existing decisions to argue their current case668 
and expresses its general expectation that SAs take into account pre-existing decisions in new cases669, 
thus illustrating the concern raised by the DE, FR, NL SA is rooted in the reality of legal practice and 
argument. 

347.  The  EDPB  notes  that  the  DE  and  FR  SA  considered  both  of  the  aspects  that  are  entailed  by 

dissuasiveness of the fine, i.e. specific deterrence and general deterrence670.   

348.  The EDPB finds that the DE, FR, NL, NO, PL SAs articulate an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms 
of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high 
level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals671. 

                                                             
665 In response to the FR SA (and using very similar wording in response to the NL SA) Meta IE adds that “[in] 
fact, no fine imposed by the DPC could prevent other SAs from imposing higher fines if they consider that this is 
appropriate and lawful given the specific circumstances of the case they are investigating and the evidence they 
have examined in the context of their investigation”. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 112-113. In response 
to the NL SA, see Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 100.

668 For instance, Meta IE argues a ban on processing would be disproportionate and refers to precedents, namely 
a Luxembourg court decision and decision taken by the BE SA. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 57.  
669 Meta IE states that “the DPC itself has the possibility to impose higher amounts in other cases,  provided it 
explains why such other cases would warrant such higher fines” (emphasis added). At the same time, Meta IE 
dismisses the FR SA’s objection for not indicating “why any fine imposed by the DPC could prevent other SAs from 
imposing higher fines if they consider that this is more appropriate given the specific circumstances of the case 
they are investigating and the evidence they have examined in the context of their investigation.” See Meta IE 
Article 65 Submissions, p. 112-113. 
670 The CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive fine is one that has a genuine deterrent effect, encompassing 
both specific deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again) 
and general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future). See, inter 
alia,  Judgement  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  13  June  2013,  Versalis  Spa  v  European  Commission,  C-511/11  P,

349.  Therefore, the EDPB considers the DE, FR, NL, NO, PL SAs objections to be reasoned. 

9.1.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

350.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters  that  are  the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objections,  in  particular  whether  the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller complies with the GDPR. 

351.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent 
application  of  administrative  fines672.  A  fine  should  be  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive,  as 
required by Article 83(1) GDPR, taking account of the facts of the case673. In addition, when deciding 
on the amount of the fine, the LSA shall take into consideration the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. 

352.  The  EDPB  responds  to  Meta  IE’s  argument  that  the  LSA  has  sole  discretion  to  determine  the 
appropriate corrective measures in the event of a finding of infringement above (see Section 8.4.2, 
paragraphs 275 - 277 as well as footnote 634). 

353.  The  finding in the  Draft Decision of a transparency infringement for the  processing concerned still 
stands.  The  EDPB  recalls  that,  on  substance,  no  objections  were  raised  on  this  finding.  Meta  IE 
infringed its general transparency obligations by being unclear on the link between the purposes of 
processing, the lawful bases of processing and the processing operations involved674, irrespective of 
the validity of the legal basis relied on for the ‘processing concerned’. It remains the case that, for the 
transparency infringements, ‘the processing concerned’ should be understood as meaning all of the 
processing operations that Meta IE carries out on the personal data under its controllership for which 
Meta  IE  indicated  it  relied  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR675,  including  for  the  purposes  of  behavioural 
advertising. This is without prejudice to the fact that Meta IE inappropriately relied on 6(1)(b) as a 
legal basis to process personal data for the purpose of behavioural advertising as part of the delivery 
of its Facebook service under the Facebook Terms of Service. Whether or not Meta IE appropriately 
chose its legal basis for processing, the transparency infringement as assessed in the Draft Decision 
still  stands.  Therefore,  the  IE  SA  must  not  modify  this  description  retroactively  in  light  of  the 
assessment of the validity of the legal basis, including for the purpose of carrying out any reassessment 
of the administrative  fines  originally proposed by  the  Draft Decision, as might be  required by this 
Binding Decision. 

354.  In light of the objections found relevant and reasoned, the EDPB addresses whether the Draft Decision 
proposes a fine for the transparency infringements that is in accordance with the criteria established 
by Article 83(2) GDPR and the criteria provided for by Article 83(1) GDPR. In doing this, the EDPB will 
first look into a preliminary matter, then assess the disputes arisen in respect of the analysis of specific 
criteria under Article 83(2) performed by the LSA, and then examine whether the proposed fine meets 
the  requirements  of  effectiveness,  dissuasiveness  and  proportionality  set  in  Article 83(1) GDPR, 
including by affording adequate weight to the relevant factors and to the circumstances of the case.

Preliminary matter: the total turnover of the undertaking 

355.  The DE SAs does not contest the identification of the relevant undertaking in the IE SAs Draft Decision, 
but contests the turnover figure cited in the Draft Decision. Though the IE SA deems the objection not 
relevant, in the Composite Response the IE SA agrees with the DE SAs on the principle that the total 
turnover figure should be used when calculating the administrative fine676. Moreover, the IE SA adds 
that  “the  turnover  figure  in  the  final  decision  will  in  any  event  refer  to  the  2021  turnover  for 
Meta Platforms, Inc. and Meta Ireland”677.  

356.  For the avoidance of doubt, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into consideration the total turnover 
of all the entities  composing the single undertaking, i.e. the consolidated turnover of the group  of 
companies headed by Meta Platforms, Inc.678. On the notion of ‘preceding financial year’, the EDPB 
recalls the decision taken in its Binding Decision 1/2021 (paragraph 298) and takes note of the IE SA’s 
intention to take the same approach in the current case. 

357.  On the notion of “preceding financial year”, the EDPB recalls the decision taken in its Binding Decision 
1/2021  (paragraph 298)  and  takes  note  of  the  IE  SA’s  intention  to  take  the  same  approach  in  the 
current case. 

358.  In addition, the EDPB agrees with the approach taken by the IE SA for the present case to include in 
the Draft Decision a provisional turnover figure based on the most up to date financial information 
available at the time of circulation to the CSAs pursuant to Article 60(3) GDPR. The final decision will 
have  to  refer  to  the  whole  undertaking’s  annual  turnover  corresponding  to  the  financial  year 
preceding the date of the final decision.   

The number of data subjects affected (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) 

359.  The DE SAs puts forward that the number of affected data subjects may be even higher679 than the 
 monthly users as of May 2021 in the European Economic Area confirmed by Meta IE to 
the IE SA680. The DE SAs refer to a Meta Platforms, Inc. press release of 27 January 2021, inferring from 
that “whilst [Meta Platforms, Inc.] reported 2.80 billion monthly active users, they report 3.30 billion 
‘family monthly active people’ for 2020. Applying this increase of about 18 %  there could be about 

 affected data subjects (

 plus 18 % = 

)”681. 

360.  The IE SA is “satisfied that the reference to the number of users of the ‘family’ of apps refers to the 
total  number  of  users  across  all  apps  owned  by  Meta  Platforms  Inc.,  (i.e.  also  including  users  of 
WhatsApp and Instagram) and not solely the number of users of the Facebook App. Such apps are not 
covered by the Facebook Terms of Service, and so are not relevant to the present circumstances”682.

677 Composite Response, paragraph 114. Meta IE argues that “[turnover] is not a relevant consideration when 
determining the amount of the fine under Article 83(2) GDPR”, see Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.4. 
On  principle,  this  matter  is  not  within  the  scope  of  the  dispute  as  no  CSA  raised  an  objection  disputing  the 
consideration of turnover as such.

Meta IE confirms the  IE SA’s response, adding that the  2020 figures cited in the  DE SAs’ objection 
“relate to the global number of unique people using at least one of the Meta Family of Apps”683. 

361.  From the elements put forward, the EDPB sees no reason to question the response given by the IE SA 
on this objection. Therefore, the  EDPB is of  the  view that  the  Draft  Decision does  not need  to be 
amended  with  regard  to  the  number  of  data  subjects  affected.  This  is  without  prejudice  to  the 
conclusions reached below on whether the fine is in line with Article 83, taking into consideration all 
the circumstances of the case, including the number of data subjects.  

On  any  action  taken  by  the  controller  to  mitigate  the  damage  suffered  by  data  subjects 
(Article 83(2)(c) GDPR) 

362.  The  PL  SA  disagrees  with  the  mitigating  factor  identified  by  the  IE  SA  by  reference  to  Meta  IE’s 
willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance on a voluntary basis pending the 
conclusion of the inquiry684.   

363.  The IE SA states that “[Meta IE]’s willingness to engage in steps to bring its processing into compliance 
on a voluntary basis” should be understood as actions taken to mitigate the damage to data subjects, 
distinct  from  actions  taken  to  comply685.  In  the  present  case,  the  EDPB  fails  to  see  how  such  a 
distinction can be made. Additionally, drawing this distinction seems inconsistent with the  IE SA’s 
position that the negative impact on data subjects lies precisely in the transparency infringements and 
thus in the “the risks to data subjects in being unable to effectively exercise their rights by being unable 
to discern what specific data processing is being done on what legal basis and for what objective”686. 
In other words, the damage caused to data subjects is, in these circumstances, consubstantial with 
the finding of the infringement itself687. 

364.  In addition, the EDPB agrees with the PL SA that the expression of an “intention to bring the processing 
operations  into  the  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  GDPR”  as  such  cannot  serve  as  evidence  of 
actions already taken to mitigate damage suffered. In order for this element to serve as a mitigating 
factor,  further  evidence  would  be  necessary  for  instance  demonstrating  that  the  controller  did 
whatever  they  could  in  order  to  reduce  the  consequences  of  the  breach  for  the  individuals 
concerned688. 

365.  The EDPB agrees with the IE SA that “[taking] steps to attempt to comply with legal obligations is a 
duty, and has no mitigating impact on a sanction for a breach of those obligations”. In any case, Meta 
IE’s “decision to begin preparation for voluntary compliance on the basis of the views set out  in the 
Preliminary Draft Decision” is merely a first step of a longer process towards full compliance with the 
GDPR. The information available in the file does not include indications that the actions taken by the

controller  have  gone  beyond  willingness  to  prepare  to  change  its  practices  in  case  this  appeared 
necessary.  

366.  The EDPB finds the IE SA does not provide sufficient justification for the mitigating factor identified, 
and instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision on this matter, by considering this factor as neither 
aggravating nor mitigating. 

On other factors and the non-exhaustive nature of the criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR 

367.  Meta  IE  argues  some  CSAs  “introduce  criteria  that  are  not  provided  for  by  Article 83(2) GDPR”689, 
which “amounts to a breach of the principle of legal certainty, which is of particular importance with 
respect  to  the  imposition  of  administrative  fines  which  are  criminal  in  nature”690.  Meta  IE 
acknowledges  that  Article 83(2)(k) GDPR  is  open-ended  as  it  refers  to  any  other  aggravating  or 
mitigating factor applicable  to  the  circumstances  of the  case,  arguing however that the criteria of 
Article 83(2) GDPR focus only on the data controller or processor, or on the infringement691. 

368.  The EDPB does not share such a restrictive reading of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, which it deems leaves 
room for “all the reasoned considerations regarding the socio-economic context in which the controller 
or processor operates, those relating to the legal context and those concerning the market context”692. 
The EDPB considers this provision “of fundamental importance for adjusting the amount of the fine to 
the specific case” and that “it should be interpreted as  an instance of the principle of fairness and 
justice  applied  to  the  individual  case”693.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  Article 83(2) GDPR  contains  a  non-
exhaustive list of assessment criteria to be considered, if appropriate, by the LSA in determining the 
amount of the fine corresponding to what is necessary to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive 
in accordance with Article 83(1) GDPR. 

369.  Given  the  open-ended  nature  of  Article 83(2),  the  EDPB  disagrees  with  the  argument  by  Meta  IE 
contending that the principle of legal certainty was breached. In any case, the EDPB recalls that it is 
settled case law that legal certainty is not absolute694. All cases of application of a general norm can 
“not be determined in advance by the legislature”695. Therefore, legal certainty “cannot be interpreted 
as prohibiting the gradual clarification of rules of criminal liability by means of interpretations in the

691 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 9.4 and 9.5. This acknowledgement is put forward as part of Meta 
IE’s reasoning that “[turnover] is not a relevant consideration when determining the amount of the fine under 
Article 83(2) GDPR”. On principle, this matter is not within the scope of the dispute as no CSAs raised an objection 
on the consideration of turnover, other than the DE SAs objection on the turnover figure used.

693 EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraph 108. 
In this regard, the EDPB also notes that at the same time “given the overarching nature of Article 83(1) GDPR, 
the LSA must ensure that the circumstances taken into account when calculating the fine are not counted twice”, 
meaning that for instance if a factor is already to be considered within the assessment under Art. 83(1) GDPR, 
the LSA should not take it into account under Art. 83(2)(k) GDPR too. Binding Decision 1/2022, paragraph 70.

case-law”696 and undertakings are expected to take appropriate legal advice to anticipate the possible 
consequences of a rule and to assess the risk of infringement with “special care”697. Finally, even if 
were the case that supervisory authorities had previously issued conflicting views, such a circumstance 
would  not be  relevant when assessing the  predictability of an infringement698. The  ECtHR has also 
ruled that the fact that a point of law is ruled on for the first time does not undermine legal certainty 
“if the meaning given is both foreseeable and consistent with the essence of the offence”699. 

The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

370.  As explicitly stated in Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, financial benefits gained directly or indirectly from the 
infringement can be considered an aggravating element for the calculation of the fine. When applying 
this provision, the supervisory authorities must “assess all the facts of the case in a manner that is 
consistent and objectively justified”700. Therefore, financial benefits from the infringement could be 
an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the 
infringement of the GDPR701. 

371.  The  aim  of  Article 83(2)(k)  is  to  ensure  that  the  sanction  applied  is  effective,  proportionate  and 
dissuasive  in  each  individual  case702.  With  regard  to  the  financial  benefits  obtained  from  the 
infringement,  the  EDPB  considers  that  when  there  is  a  benefit,  the  sanction  should  aim  at 
“counterbalancing  the  gains  from  the  infringement”  while  keeping  an  effective,  dissuasive  and 
proportionate fine703.  

372.  The financial benefit obtained by Meta IE was considered by the IE SA in the Draft Decision with regard 
to the transparency infringements704. The IE SA found it had insufficient elements to conclude - beyond 
speculating - that Meta IE benefited from the infringement705.

705 The IE SA finds this factor is neither aggravating nor mitigating. Draft Decision, paragraph 9.44. Initially, in the 
Preliminary Draft Decision, the IE SA had indicated the lack of transparency had the potential to have resulted 
in financial benefits for Meta IE (see Draft Decision, paragraph 9.44). The DE SAs expressed their agreement with 
this conclusion (see DE SAs objection, p. 13).

 users according to paragraph 9.15 of the Draft Decision if the transparency violations had 

not occurred) - which would amount to an estimated 

 EUR less in turnover706. 

374.  Considering the  need to have  fines  that are effective, proportionate  and  deterrent, and in light of 
common accepted practice in the field of EU competition law707, which inspired the fining framework 
under the GDPR, the EDPB is of the view that, when calculating the administrative fine, the supervisory 
authority could  take  account of  the  financial benefits obtained from  the  infringement, in order to 
impose a fine that exceeds that amount.   

375.  In the present case, neither the IE SA nor the DE SAs have provided an estimation of the financial 
benefit gained by Meta IE with the transparency infringements. The DE SAs’ calculation presents an 
example and is still largely based on assumptions on a lower number of monthly users. Due to this, 
the EDPB does not have sufficiently precise information to evaluate the specific weight of the financial 
benefit obtained from the infringement.     

376.  Therefore, the EDPB considers that it does not have objective elements to conclude whether the fine 
envisaged  in  relation  to  the  transparency  infringements  takes  sufficient  account  of  the  financial 
benefit obtained from the infringement and, therefore, has a deterrent effect in this respect.  

377.  Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they 
are  disproportionally  low  compared  to  the  benefits  obtained  with  the  infringement.  The  EDPB 
considers  that  the  IE  SA  should  ascertain  if  further  estimation  of  the  financial  benefit  from  the 
infringement of transparency obligations is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to 
increase the amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the 
fine proposed.   

The profitability of the undertaking - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

378.  The DE SAs request the IE SA to consider, in addition to turnover, the annual profit of the undertaking 
in its assessment708. The DE SAs position is that the undertaking’s sensitivity to administrative fines is 
significantly influenced by profitability, not only turnover. The DE SAs argue that the Draft Decision 
does not demonstrate that profitability was taken into account to assess “sensitivity to administrative 
fines” and does not ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive709.   

379.  Meta IE argues Article 83(2) GDPR does not identify annual profit as a factor to which the LSA should 
have regard in calculating the amount of the administrative fine710. The EDPB has explained its view 
on the open-ended character of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR above (see paragraphs 367-369). 

380.  The EDPB recalls that in determining administrative fines under Article 83 GDPR the total worldwide 
annual  turnover  of  the  undertaking  should  be  considered,  as  this  “gives  an  indication,  albeit 
approximate and imperfect, of the size of the undertaking and of its economic power”711. The EDPB 

                                                             
706 The DE SA notes that “[per] worldwide monthly active user (2.80 billion) Facebook generates  a turnover  of 
about  EUR  25.02” (on  the basis  of  a  report from  Meta Platforms, Inc.  )  and  -  for  the  sake  of  the  argument - 
makes the assumption that  this value is applicable for European data subjects using facebook.com . See DE SAs

does not find that in the case at hand the LSA should be requested to amend its Draft Decision to 
additionally consider the annual profit of the undertaking. At the same time, the EDPB reiterates that 
the imposition of an appropriate fine cannot be the result of a simple calculation based on the total 
turnover712 and that as stated above all the circumstances of the specific case have to be considered 
in order to assess if the administrative fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive as required by 
Article 83(1) GDPR. 

381.  Moreover, the size of the undertaking concerned and its financial capacity713 are elements that should 
be taken into account in the calculation of the amount of the fine in order to ensure its dissuasive 
nature714. Taking into consideration the size and global resources of the undertaking in question is 
justified by the  impact sought on  the  undertaking concerned, in order to ensure that the  fine  has 
sufficient deterrent effect, given that the fine must not be negligible in the light, particularly, of its 
financial capacity715. The EDPB recalls that a fine to be imposed on an undertaking may need to be 
increased  to  take  into  account  a  particularly  large  turnover  of  the  undertaking,  so  the  fine  is 
sufficiently dissuasive716. In this respect, the EDPB further notes that in order to ensure a sufficiently 
deterrent  effect,  the  global  turnover  of  the  undertaking  can  be  considered  also  in  light  of  the 
undertaking’s ability to raise the necessary funds to pay its fine717. 

The effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness of the administrative fine (Article 83(1) GDPR) 

382.  With regard to effectiveness of the fines, the EDPB recalls that the objective pursued by the corrective 
measure chosen can be to re-establish compliance with the rules, or to punish unlawful behaviour, or 
both718. In addition, the EDPB notes that the CJEU has consistently held that a dissuasive penalty is 
one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In that respect, a distinction can be made between general 
deterrence (discouraging others from committing the same infringement in the future) and specific 
deterrence (discouraging the addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement again)719. 
Therefore, in order to ensure deterrence, the fine must be set at a level that discourages both  the 
controller  or  processor  concerned  as  well  as  other  controllers  or  processors  carrying  out  similar 
processing operations from repeating the same or a similar unlawful conduct. Proportionality of the 
fine needs also to be ensured as the measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that

some circumstances the imposition of a deterrence multiplier can be justified and that the exceptional financial 
capacity  of  an  undertaking  may  be  one  such  circumstance  (see  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines, 
paragraph 144; and Judgement of the Court of Justice of 29 June 2006, Showa Denko v Commission, C-289/04 P,

objective720. In this respect, the EDPB disagrees with Meta IE’s views that there is no basis to conclude 
that the amount of the fine must have a general preventive effect721. 

383.  The  EDPB  reiterates  that  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  supervisory  authorities  to  verify  whether  the 
amount  of  the  envisaged  fines  meets  the  requirements  of  effectiveness,  proportionality  and 
dissuasiveness, or whether further adjustments to the amount are necessary, considering the entirety 
of the fine imposed and all the circumstances of the case, including e.g. the accumulation of multiple 
infringements, 
increases  and  decreases  for  aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances  and 
financial/socio-economic circumstances722. Further, the EDPB recalls that the setting of a fine is not an 
arithmetically precise exercise723, and supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in 
this respect724. 

384.  The DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs, object to the level of the fine envisaged in the Draft Decision as they 
consider the proposed fine not effective, proportionate and dissuasive (Article 83(1) GDPR)725. These 
SAs  argue  that  the  elements  of  Article 83(2) GDPR  are  not  weighed  correctly  by  the  LSA  when 
calculating  the  administrative  fines 
light  of  the  requirements  of 
Article 83(1) GDPR726. 

in  the  present  case,

number  of  data  subjects  concerned727.  The  PL  SA  adds  that  the  gravity  of  the  infringement  is 
compounded by the fact that the data processing is an essential part of Meta IE’s business model728. 
The DE SAs also refer to the infringement’s duration and the negligence identified by the IE SA729. 

386.  The EDPB takes note Meta IE’s disagreement with the fine proposed by the IE SA730 and their view that 

any objections aiming to increase the quantum of fines are not compatible with Article 83 GDPR731.

387.  The  EDPB  notes  that  in  the  Draft  Decision  the  IE  SA  indicates  being  satisfied  the  proposed  fine  is 
effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive,  taking  into  account  all  the  circumstances  of  the  IE  SA’s 
inquiry732. The IE SA assessed the different criteria of Article 83(2) GDPR in relation to the transparency 
infringements found733. The IE SA considered the infringements as serious in nature734, and in terms 
of gravity of the infringements found a significant level of non-compliance735. Furthermore, the EDPB 
underlines  that, as established by  the  IE SA,  the  infringements  affect  a significant number of  data 
subjects736 and are extensive737. The EDPB also observes that the infringements is considered negligent 
in character738. Further, the IE SA considered the level of damage suffered by data subjects as being 
significant739. In addition, the IE SA identifies only one mitigating factor, however without articulating 
the weight accorded to it740. 

388.  Meta IE argues that reputation costs should also be taken into consideration, citing the IE SA’s remark 
on “the significant publicity that a fine in this region will attract”741.  On principle, the EDPB agrees 
that reputation costs could be taken into consideration to some extent, if credible arguments are be 
put forward about the grave detriment that would ensue. Meta IE does not present such arguments742. 
The EDPB is of the view that in this case other incentives would offset any reputational costs. As far as 
advertisers  are  concerned,  Meta  IE  puts  forward  that  “[the]  personalised  nature  of  the  Facebook 
Service  is  also  the  reason  why  it  has  been  instrumental  in  the  success  of  small  and  medium  sized 
businesses  (‘SMEs’)  worldwide,  including  across  the  EU.  Personalisation  on  the  Facebook  Service 
enables SMEs to compete for customers through  ‘customizing products and services, [...] building a 
unique brand image, tailoring marketing to a specific audience and developing a strong one-to-one 
connection with a community of customers’”743. As far as users of the Facebook service are concerned, 
there are network effects at play which leads to incentives to join - or not leave - the platform, so as 
not to be excluded from participating in discussions, corresponding with and receiving information 
from others744.  

389.  The FR SA compares the proposed fine with the fine of 225 million euros decided upon by the IE SA in 
its decision dated 20 August 2021 against WhatsApp Ireland Limited for transparency infringements 
(breaches of Articles 12 and 13 GDPR)745. The FR SA also compares with the fine of 746 million euros

decided by the  LU SA in its decision of 15 July 2021 against the company Amazon Europe Core for 
carrying out behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis and for transparency infringements 
(Articles 6, 12 and 13 GDPR)746. While the EDPB agrees with both the IE SA and Meta IE that imposing 
fines requires a case-by-case assessment under Article 83 GDPR747, the EDPB notes that the cases cited 
by the FR SA do show marked similarities with the current case, as they both refer to large internet 
platforms run by data controllers with multi-national operations and significant resources available to 
them, including large, in-house, compliance teams. Moreover, there are similarities with regard to the 
infringements involved. Thus, these cases can give an indication on the matter. 

390.  The DE SAs calculate that the envisaged upper limit of the fine  range is about 0.05 % of the global 
annual  turnover748,  which  it  notes  is  80  times  lower  than  the  maximum  ceiling  provided  for  in 
Article 83(5) GDPR.  For illustrative purposes, the DE SAs add that this upper limit would amount to a 
fine  of  EUR 
  data  subjects  affected  according  to 
paragraph 9.15 of the Draft Decision)749. Also illustrative is the amount of time, on average, it took 
Meta IE to generate 36 million euros in turnover in 2020, which was about 4 hours and 30 minutes750.  

  per  person  (on  the  basis  of 

391.  The  EDPB agrees with the  objections raised that  -  if  the  proposed fine  was  to be  imposed for the 
transparency  infringements  -  there  would  be  no  sufficient  special  preventive  effect  towards  the 
controller, nor a credible general preventive effect751. The proposed fine amount, even where a final 
amount at the upper limit of the range would be chosen, is not effective, proportionate and dissuasive, 
in the sense that this amount can simply be absorbed by the undertaking as an acceptable cost of 
doing business752. As behavioural advertising is at the core of Meta IE’s business model753, the risk of 
this occurring is all the greater754. By bearing the cost the administrative fine, the undertaking can 
avoid bearing the cost of adjusting their business model to one that is compliant as well as any future 
losses that would follow from the adjustment755.  

392.  Though the  IE SA touches  upon  the  notions of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness in 
relation to the  proposed fine756, there  is no justification based on elements specific to the  case  to 
explain  the  modest  fine  range  chosen.  Moreover,  the  EDPB  notes  that  while  the  IE  SA  takes  into 
consideration the turnover of the undertaking to ensure that the fine it proposed does not exceed the 
maximum  amount  of  the  fine  provided  for  in  Article 83(5) GDPR757,  the  Draft  Decision  does  not 
articulate how and to what extent the turnover of this undertaking is considered to ascertain that the

The EDPB notes that no basis in law is needed for the DE SA to illustrate their argument in this way.

administrative fine meets the requirement of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness758. In 
this regard the EDPB recalls that the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not exclusively relevant 
for the determination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but 
should also be considered for the calculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine 
is  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  in  accordance  with  Article 83(1) GDPR759.  The  EDPB 
therefore instructs the IE SA to elaborate on the manner in which the turnover of the undertaking 
concerned is considered for the calculation of the fine.  

393.  While a single mitigating factor identified by the IE SA is mentioned760, there is no indication the weight 
that has been attributed  to this factor in the  context of the  Article 83(2) assessment. As indicated 
above  (see  paragraph  366),  the  EDPB  finds  the  Draft  Decision  does  not  sufficiently  justify  this 
mitigating factor, hence it should not be considered an aggravating or mitigating factor.   

394.  In  light  of  the  above,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  proposed  fine  does  not  adequately  reflect  the 
seriousness and severity of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the 
fine does not fulfil the requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance 
with Article 83(1) and (2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a  significantly 
higher fine amount for the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit 
for the administrative fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line 
with the criteria of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR 
in its overall reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine. 

9.2  On the determination of an administrative fine for further infringements  

9.2.1  Analysis by the LSA in the Draft Decision 

395.  The IE SA in the Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has not sought to rely on consent in order to 
process personal data to deliver its service as outlined in the Facebook Terms of Service and it is not 
legally obliged to rely on consent in order to do so (Finding 1)761. Alongside, the IE SA concludes that 
Meta IE can  rely on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  as a legal basis to carry out the  personal data processing 
activities involved in the provision of its service to users, including behavioural advertising insofar as 
that  forms  a  core  part  of  the  service  (Finding 2)762.  In  these  terms,  the  IE  SA  did  not  propose  to 
establish an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

396.  In addition, no infringement of Article 9(1) GDPR has been found as the IE SA has not identified and 
separately assessed any processing of special categories of personal data by Meta IE in the context of 
the Facebook Terms of Service. 

397.  The IE SA in its Draft Decision concludes that Meta IE has infringed Article 5(1)(a), Article 13(1)(c) and 
Article 12(1) GDPR  due  to  the  lack  of  transparency  in  relation  to  the  processing  for  which 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR has been relied on (Finding 3)763.

9.2.2  Summary of the objections raised by the CSAs 

398.  The AT, DE, FR, IT, NO, PL and SE SAs764 object to the LSA’s failure to take action with respect to one 
or more specific infringements  they deem should have  been found and ask  the  IE SA  to  impose  a 
higher administrative fine as a result of these additional infringements.   

Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR or 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR 

399.  The  DE,  FR  and  PL  SAs  ask  for  the  administrative  fine  to  be  increased765  as  a  consequence  of  the 
proposed finding of infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR766. The AT, NO and SE SAs argue that the fine 
should be increased following the proposed finding of an infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR767.  

400.  The  DE SAs state  that the  fact that  Article 6(1) GDPR  was  infringed is not properly reflected in  the 
calculation of the fine in the Draft Decision768. The DE SAs list a variety of arguments concerning the 
criteria  provided  for  in  Article 83(2) GDPR  concerning  the  infringement  of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR769. 
Specifically, the DE SA argues that several factors are to be considered as aggravating, namely: the 
gravity and duration of the  infringement770, taking into account it regards  “personal data of about 
 data subjects were affected over a period of at least three years”771 (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR), 
the categories of personal data affected by the infringement (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR)772, the manner in 
which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR)773, and other factors, namely financial 
benefits gained from the infringement as well as profitability and turnover (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)774. 
The DE SA also highlights that the fine imposed needs to aim to prevent further infringements of the 
GDPR; first, it should be “special preventive” meaning that the amount imposed needs to be such that 
“it is not to be expected that the specific controller will commit similar infringements again” by having 
“such  a  noticeable  impact  on  the  profits  of  the  undertaking  that  future  infringements  of  data 
protection law would not be ‘discounted’ into the processing performed by the undertaking lightly”; 
second, it should be “general preventive” by leading other controllers to “make a significant effort to 
avoid similar violations”775.  

401.  The FR SA considers that some violations are wrongly not included in the Draft Decision776 and argues 
that “since it considers that breaches of Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR have been committed, which are 
added to the other breaches found by the Irish data protection authority, the amount proposed by the

In addition, also the IT SA (IT SA Objection, paragraph 2.7) argued that an administrative fine should be imposed 
for the infringement of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR; however, this aspect of the objection raised by the IT SA was deemed 
to be not relevant and reasoned by the EDPB in paragraph 82 above.

latter should be increased accordingly”777. The FR SA recalls that the same approach of cumulating the 
amounts  of  the  fine  has  been  adopted  by  the  EDPB  in  points  324  to  327  of  its  Binding  Decision 
01/2021778.  

402.  The PL SA believes that the proposed amount of the administrative fine is too low, also because the 
PL SA proposed the establishment of the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, which means 
“the administrative fine should be significantly increased by the LSA”779.  

403.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SAs explain that without an effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive fine, the Draft Decision would lack any deterrent effect with regard to Meta IE in such a 
way that it would see a need to substantially change its practices780. Moreover, the DE SAs raise that 
it would induce controllers to consider - from an economical point of a view - that non-compliance 
with  the  GDPR  could  be  a  reasonable  option781  and  this  would  lead  to  a  significant  risk  for  the 
protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects782. The DE SAs argue that an 
administrative  fine  is,  in  the  present  case,  essential  in  order  to  achieve  a  deterrent  effect  (either 
specifically towards the controller, or in general towards other controllers)783. The DE SAs add that not 
imposing a fine would have the opposite effect on controllers in general784. The FR SA considers that 
adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision as it stands “presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms 
of the data subjects, in accordance with Article 4(24) of the GDPR”785 and “would lead to a levelling 
down of the level of administrative fines imposed by European data protection authorities, thereby 
reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure effective compliance 
with  the  protection  of  the  personal  data  of  European  residents”786.  The  PL  SA  highlights  that  “the 
unchanged draft decision entails a risk for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects, and 
in particular the risk of violation of Art. 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights”, and that “the failure 
to  apply  a  proportionate,  dissuasive  and  effective  remedy  may  prevent  the  controller  from  being 
discouraged from committing further breaches”787.

404.  The  AT,  NO  and  SE  SAs,  considering  that  the  IE  SA  should  have  found  an  infringement  of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR788,  ask  for  the  administrative  fine  to  be  increased  as  a  consequence  of  that 
infringement.  

405.  The AT SA argues that “the additional infringement [of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR] must be properly reflected 
in  the  envisaged  amount  of  the  administrative  fine”  and  that  the  IE  SA’s  Draft  Decision  is  not  in

compliance  with  Article 83 GDPR  insofar  as  it  does  not  consider  the  additional  infringement  of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR when calculating the amount of the administrative fine789.  

406.  The NO SA states that an administrative fine should be imposed for Meta IE’s processing of personal 
data in the context of online behavioural advertising without a valid legal basis790. The NO SA analyses 
several of the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR in order to prove the need of the imposition of an 
administrative  fine791.  Specifically,  the  NO  SA  argues  that  an  administrative  fine  of  a  substantial 
amount is needed, in light of the nature and gravity of the infringement (given that “the principle of 
lawfulness [...] is a fundamental pillar of the GDPR” and “processing personal data without a legal 
basis is a clear violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection because no one 
should  have  to  tolerate  processing  of  their  personal  data  save  for  when  it  is  legitimised  by  the 
legislators”792), as well as the scope of the processing (“wide”, as it took place “on and off the Facebook 
platform”), the number of data subjects affected in the EEA (“hundreds of millions”) and the intangible 
damage  suffered  by  them  (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR),  the  high  level  of  responsibility  of  Meta  IE 
(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR),  the  categories  of  personal  data  involved  (“of  a  very  personal  and  private 
nature”,  able  to  “reveal  intimate  details  of  the  data  subjects’  lifestyle,  mindset,  preferences, 
psychological wellbeing et cetera”) (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR) and an additional aggravating factor (high 
likelihood of contribution to development of harmful algorithms, Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)793.  

407.  The SE SA argues that “the Draft Decision is not in compliance with Article 83 insofar as the additional 
infringement of Article 6(1)(b) is not considered in calculating the administrative fine” and that “[an] 
administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 GDPR cannot be regarded as ‘effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive’  when  the  provision  that  the  processing  is  based  on,  namely  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR,  was 
infringed  and  when  this  infringement  is  not  properly  reflected  in  the  envisaged  amount  of  the 
administrative fine”794. The SE SA takes the view that that the intentional character of the infringement  
(Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) and the financial benefits gained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 
must be found as aggravating factors795. As to intentionality, the SE SA argues that the switch from 
consent to Article 6(1)(b) in 2018 suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the 
new rights afforded to users by the GDPR when the processing relies upon consent, and that in any 
way the infringement needs to be considered as intentional at least as of the moment of adoption of 
the  EDPB  Guidelines  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  which  “clearly  gives  doubt  to  the  legality  of  the 
processing”796. As to the financial benefits gained, the SE SA argues “[Meta IE] has made significant 
financial gain from being able to provide personal advertising as part of a whole take it or leave it offer 
for its social media platform service” and that due to the unclear information provided to data subjects 
it can be  reasonably assumed that more data subjects have  been misled into being subject to the 
processing797. Furthermore, the SE SA considers that Meta IE’s dominant market position (“[It] is the 
provider  of  the  largest  social  media  network  in  the  world”)  and  its  “methods  for  collective  and 
processing  personal  data  relating  to  personalised  advertising  and  profiling”  (which  are  “vast,

aggressive and inadequate with regard to the fulfillment of data subjects’ rights”) should be properly 
taken into account798. Lastly, the SE SA considers it would be appropriate to take into account Meta 
IE’s turnover for the calculation of the fine in order to make it effective and dissuasive799. 

408.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the AT SA argues that “[should] the Draft Decision be approved 
in its current version, the risks for the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects lie in the fact 
that the action envisaged in relation to the controller is likely to fall short of the proportionality and – 
above all – dissuasiveness requirements set forth in Article 83 GDPR” and that “ignoring infringements 
of the GDPR when calculating fines would lead to lesser compliance with the GDPR and ultimately to 
lesser protection of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data”800. The NO SA explains 
that not imposing a fine for the lack of legal basis creates that risk that the violated provisions are not 
respected by Meta IE or other controllers and the LSA would not be able to effectively safeguard the 
data  subjects’  rights,  and  that  “In  absence  of  corrective  measures  that  create  the  appropriate 
incentives for [Meta IE] and other controllers to change their behaviour, the same or similar violations 
are likely to reoccur to the detriment of the complainant and other data subjects” and argues that 
controllers will be  induced to  consider  administrative fines  as expected expenditure items in their 
budgets as the financial advantage gained through the violation would surpass the estimated value of 
an  expected  fine801.  The  SE  SA  argues  the  infringement  of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR  “is  not  properly 
reflected in the envisaged amount of the administrative fine, it shows controllers (Facebook included) 
that enforcement of the GDPR and its provisions is not effective. This threatens compliance with the 
GDPR on a general level, seeing as how non-compliance could be a viable option for controllers when 
the costs for compliance are greater. Given the proposed changed findings regarding legal basis, there 
are  significant  risks  to  the  fundamental  rights  of  data  subjects  if  these  does  not  also  merits  a 
substantive increase in fines to dissuade Facebook and other controllers”802.  

Objections requesting the imposition of a fine for the additional infringement of Article 9 GDPR 

409.   As stated in Section 5.2, paragraph 141, the DE and FR SAs, considering that the IE SA should have 
identified  and  separately  assessed  any  processing  of  special  categories  of  personal  data  under 
Article 9 GDPR in the context of the Facebook Terms of Service803 and that Meta IE processes the entire 
amount of data it holds, including special categories of data, in breach of  Articles 6 and 9 GDPR804, 
argue that the amount of the fine should be increased accordingly.  

410.  The  DE  SA  states  that  “the  infringement of  Articles 5(1)(a),  6(1)  and  9(1) GDPR  [...]  also entails  an 
administrative  measure  and  a  fine  according  to  Art. 83(2)(5) GDPR”805,  and  argues  that  these 
infringements are ‘serious’”806. The FR SA considers that the breaches of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR are 
wrongly not included in the Draft Decision807 and that the amount of the fine proposed by the LSA

should be increased in light of the addition of such infringements to those already established808. The 
FR SA recalls that the same approach of cumulating the amounts of the fine has been adopted by the 
EDPB in points 324 to 327 of Binding Decision 01/2021809.  

411.  On risks posed by the Draft Decision, the DE SA explains that without an effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive fine, the Draft Decision would lack any deterrent effect with regard to Meta IE in such a 
way that it would see a need to substantially change its practices810. Moreover, the DE SA raises that 
it would induce controllers to consider - from an economical point of a view - that non-compliance 
with  the  GDPR  could  be  a  reasonable  option811  and  this  would  lead  to  a  significant  risk  for  the 
protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects812. The DE SA argues that an 
administrative  fine  is,  in  the  present  case,  essential  in  order  to  achieve  a  deterrent  effect  (either 
specifically towards the controller, or in general towards other controllers)813. The DE SA adds that not 
imposing a fine would have the opposite effect on controllers in general814. The FR SA considers that 
adopting the IE SA's Draft Decision as it stands “presents a risk to the fundamental rights and freedoms 
of the data subjects, in accordance with Article 4(24) of the GDPR”815 and “would lead to a levelling 
down of the level of administrative fines imposed by European data protection authorities, thereby 
reducing the authorities' coercive power and, consequently, their ability to ensure effective compliance 
with the protection of the personal data of European residents”816.  

Objections  requesting the imposition of a  fine for the additional infringement of  Article 5(1)(a) and 
5(1)(b)-(c) GDPR 

412.  The  IT  SA817  argues  that  the  fine  should  be  increased  following  the  finding  of  an  infringement  of 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, and of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR818. As stated in Section 6.2, the IT SA agrees 
to  a  large  extent  with  the  Draft  Decision’s  Finding 3  on  the  infringement  of  Article 12(1), 
Article 13(1)(c), and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in terms of transparency819 but it argues that Meta IE has also 
failed to comply with the more general principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, which, in the 
view of the IT SA, entails separate requirements from those relating specifically to transparency820. 
Moreover, as analysed in Section 7.2, the IT SA states that there is an additional infringement of points 
(b) and (c) of Article 5(1) GDPR on account of Meta IE’s failure to comply with the purpose limitation 
and data minimisation principles821. The IT SA asks for a fine to be issued for those  two additional 
infringements.  With  regard  to  Article 5(1)(a) GDPR  the  IT  SA  argues  that  the  finding  of  such 
infringement  “should  result  into  the  imposition  of  the  relevant  administrative  fine  as  per 
Article 83(5)(a) GDPR”  as  far  as  “the  infringement  of  the  fairness  principle  in  addition  to  the 
transparency one [...] should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having

regard to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive. Indeed, the gravity 
of  the  infringement  would  be  factually  compounded”822.  With  reference  to  Article 5(1)(b)  and 
(c) GDPR,  the  IT  SA  considers  that  “the  infringement  of  purpose  limitation  and  data  minimisation 
principles [...] should result into increasing the amount of the said fine substantially by having regard 
to the requirement that each fine should be proportionate and dissuasive. Indeed, the gravity of the 
infringement would be factually compounded”823. 

413.  On the significance of risks posed by the Draft Decision, the IT SA argues that “the failure to find an 
infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as for the fairness principle may become a dangerous precedent 
with a view to future decisions concerning other digital platform operators  – more generally, other 
controllers that rely on the same business model – and markedly weaken the safeguards to be provided 
by way of the effective, comprehensive implementation of the data protection framework including 
the fairness of processing principle”824 and, with reference to Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, should the 
Draft Decision approved as its current version the infringement of two key principles of the whole data 
protection framework as introduced by the GDPR will not punished, “which would seriously jeopardise 
the safeguards the data subjects (Facebook users) are entitled to”825.  

9.2.3  Position of the LSA on the objections 

414.  The  LSA  considers  none  of  the  objections  requesting  the  imposition  of  a  fine  for  the  proposed 
additional infringements  as meeting the  threshold set by Article 4(24) GDPR of being  relevant and 
reasoned826. Given that these objections were premised upon the requirement for the Draft Decision 
to  include  findings  of  infringement  of  Article 6(1)(b),  Article 9,  Article 5(1)(a),  Article 5(1)(b)  and 
Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, on which the IE SA expressed its disagreement – the IE SA does not consider the 
objections requesting exercise of a corrective power in response to these findings of infringement as 
being relevant and reasoned827. 

9.2.4  Analysis of the EDPB 

9.2.4.1  Assessment of whether the objections were relevant and reasoned 

415.  The objections raised by the AT, DE, FR, IT, NO, PL, SE SAs concern “whether the action envisaged in 

the Draft Decision complies with the GDPR”828.  

416.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that not a single objection put forward by the CSAs meets the 
threshold  of  Article 4(24) GDPR829.  In  addition  to  the  primary  argument  levelled  against  all  CSA’s 
objections830, Meta IE rejects the objections in this section based on its view that the  LSA has sole 
discretion to determine corrective measures831. The EDPB responds to these arguments above (see

830 Meta IE argues that “Objections which raise matters which are not within the Defined Scope of Inquiry are not 
‘relevant and reasoned’ within the meaning of Article 4(24) GDPR” and such objections “ought to be disregarded 
in their entirety by the EDPB”. The EDPB does not share this understanding, as explained above. See paragraphs

Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 275 - 277 as well as footnote 634) and is of the view that CSAs may ask for 
specific corrective  measures  to be  taken by the LSA, whether this  concerns infringements already 
identified in the Draft Decision or identified by the CSA in an objection raised832. Meta IE refutes the 
allegations  of  additional  infringements  put  forward  in  the  objections,  and  by  consequence  any 
demands for further corrective measures833. The EDPB recalls that the assessment of admissibility of 
objections and the assessment of the merits are two distinct steps834.  

417.  The EDPB finds that the objections concerning the increase of the administrative fine in connection 
with the additional infringement of Article 6(1)/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR raised by the AT, 
DE, FR, NO, PL and SE SAs stand in direct connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, as they 
concern the imposition of a corrective measure for an additional infringement, which would be found 
as a consequence of reversing the conclusions in the Draft Decision also in scope of this dispute835. 
Clearly,  the  decision  on  the  merits  of  the  demands  to  take  corrective  measures  for  a  proposed 
additional infringement is affected by the EDPB’s decision on whether to reverse the findings in the 
Draft Decision and whether to instruct the LSA to establish additional infringements.  

418.  The  EDPB  takes note of further  arguments put forward by Meta IE aiming to demonstrate lack  of 
relevance of these objections, specifically with regard to the objections raised by the AT836 and DE837 
SAs. However, the  EDPB notes  that  Meta IE disagrees with the  content of  these  objections, which 

                                                             
832 EDPB Guidelines on RRO, paragraph 34. See also recital 150 GDPR. The EDPB found several objections on this 
subject matter admissible in the past, see Binding Decision 2/2022, paragraphs 186-190.  
833 See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions,paragraph 8.2. Meta IE refutes the AT SA’s allegation of infringement of 
Art. 6(1)  GDPR  as  inadmissible  and  without  merit,  and  argues  by  consequence  that  AT  SA’s  demand  for  an 
“amendment of the administrative fine to reflect such Article 6(1)(b) GDPR infringement has no direct connection 
with the Draft Decision”. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, Annex 1, p. 79-80. Meta IE refutes the allegation 
of infringement of Art. 5(1), 6(1) and 9(1) GDPR, considering that aspect of the DE SA’s objection inadmissible 
and  without  merit,  and  by  consequence  also  their  demand  for  an  additional  fine.  See  Meta IE  Article 65 
Submissions, p. 132.

835 AT SA Objection, p. 11-12; DE SAs Objection, p. 16-17; FR SA Objection, paragraph 46; NO SA Objection, p. 8-
11; SE SA Objection, p. 4. 
The EDPB also recalls that the aspect of the IT SA objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine 
for the infringement of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR has already been deemed to not meet the threshold set by Art. 4(24) 
GDPR above in paragraph 82. 
836 Meta IE takes issue with additional reasoning provided by the AT SA under the heading ‘relevance’ of their 
objection. The AT SA states “In addition, it must be taken into account that Facebook is the provider of the biggest 
social media network in the world. Not properly reflecting such an infringement in the envisaged amount of the 
administrative fine weakens the position of supervisory authorities and endangers compliance with the GDPR on 
a  general  level.  Specifically,  it  shows  controllers  (including  Facebook)  that  enforcement  of  the  GDPR  and  its 
provisions  is not as  effective.  Ultimately,  lesser  compliance  with  the GDPR  results in lesser protection  of data 
subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.” See AT SA Objection, p. 11. Meta IE responds “While the 
Austrian SA has very briefly attempted to link this objection generally to requirements of  Article 83(1) GDPR, it 
has not done so concretely, and this speculative and high level commentary cannot be considered sufficiently 
relevant.” Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 80. The EDPB does not rely on this additional reasoning from the 
AT SA in order to assess whether the objection is relevant, as the aspect raised pertains to the significance of 
the risks posed by the Draft Decision to the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects. 
837 Meta IE takes issue with the DE SA challenging “the elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine” 
stating - since no fine was imposed for any such infringements  - “there are no ‘elements relied upon’ for the 
calculation of the ‘fine’ to be challenged”. See Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 132.

concerns its merits and not its admissibility. The EDPB also notes Meta IE’s arguments pertaining to 
the objection raised by the PL SA in this context838. 

419.  These  objections  set  out  how,  if  followed,  they  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  in  terms  of 
corrective measures imposed839. In consequence, the EDPB considers the objections raised by the AT, 
DE, FR, PL, NO and SE SAs in connection to imposing an administrative fine for the alleged breach of 
Article 6/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article 9 GDPR to be relevant. 

420.  Meta IE argues that the AT, DE, FR, NO, PL and SE SAs objections lack sufficient reasoning because 
introduce ‘additional’ criteria for the determination of the fine that have no basis in Article 83 GDPR840. 
Where the SE SA does refer to criteria from Article 83(2) GDPR, Meta IE alleges is “speculative with 
respect to the alleged facts on which it is premised”841. On the matter of profiling raised by the NO SA, 
Meta IE dismisses  the  concern as unsound as the  NO SA “does  not explain on which legal basis  it 
concludes that the advertising in question entails profiling”842. Meta IE alleges the DE SAs’ objection is 
unsubstantiated, by referring back to the fact that no infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR was found 
by the  IE SA843  and thus “there are no ‘elements  relied upon’ for the calculation of the ‘fine’ to be 
challenged”844. In contradiction to this, Meta IE argues the PL SA’s objection is not reasoned, as it does 
not name “any parameters that would have been misapplied” by the IE SA845. The EDPB understands 
that Meta IE disagrees with the reasoning provided in the objections, which thus concerns their merits 
and not their admissibility of the objection.  

421.  Meta IE argues that the AT and FR SA’s objections do not explain how the change would lead to a 
different  conclusion  in  the  Draft  Decision846,  thus  not  recognising  a  higher  fine  amount  for  the 
infringements identified as constituting a different conclusion847. Meta IE further argues the AT SAs 
and FR SAs reasoning is so brief that it is not possible to understand the legal arguments the AT or FR 
SAs wish to put forward in relation to the calculation of the fine. Meta IE takes issue with the AT SA’s 
objection’s argument that the Draft Decision is “not in compliance with Article 83 GDPR”, without also 

                                                             
838 Meta IE argues the the Polish SA’s objection in relation to administrative fines is irrelevant as it “does not 
challenge the elements relied upon to calculate the amount of the fine, given that turnover is relevant only to 
determining the maximum fine that can be lawfully imposed and not the fine amount.” See Meta IE Article 65 
Submissions, p. 132. The EDPB notes this argument pertains to the PL SA’s disagreement with the fine the IE SA 
proposed for the transparency infringements, and moreover recalls that whether turnover should be considered 
in the determination of the fine is out of scope of this dispute.

it  would be  inappropriate  to  find Meta Ireland  infringed  Article 6(1)(a) GDPR  for processing  data purposes  of 
providing  behavioural  advertising”.  See  Meta IE  Article 65  Submissions,  p. 133.  The  EDPB  responds  to  this 
argument above, see paragraph 417 above. 
844 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 132. 
845 Meta IE argues the PL SAs objection in relation to administrative fines “is vague regarding the criteria for 
calculation of the fine proposed for the alleged additional infringement of  Article 6(1) GDPR. It only concludes 
that the fine should be significantly increased, without naming any parameters that would have been misapplied 
by the DPC” Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p 106.

specifying “a certain paragraph or criterion that would risk being infringed by the Draft Decision”848. 
The  EDPB recalls that the  criteria listed in  Article 83(2) GDPR  are not exhaustive, thus it is entirely 
possible to argue an administrative fine is not “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” in the meaning 
of Article 83(1) GDPR without referring to a specific criterion listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. In addition, 
as the objection raised by the AT SA refers to taking into account in the calculation of the final amount 
of the fine the finding of an additional infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR and puts forward several 
arguments showing that not doing so would lead to a fine which is not effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive849.   

422.  Similarly, Meta IE argues the FR SA “does not substantiate how a fine  for the additional purported 
infringements would be calculated, whether this fine would need to be added to the proposed fine and 
how this would affect the overall fine”850. First, CSAs are not required to engage in a full assessment 
of all the aspects of Article 83 GDPR in order for an objection on the appropriate administrative fine 
to be considered reasoned. It is sufficient to lay out which aspect of the Draft Decision that, in their 
view, is deficient/erroneous851. Second, the EDPB recalls that the criteria listed in Article 83(2) GDPR 
are  not  exhaustive,  thus  it  is  entirely  possible  to  argue  an  administrative  fine  is  not  “effective, 
proportionate  and  dissuasive”  in  the  meaning  of  Article 83(1) GDPR  without  referring  to  a  specific 
criterion listed in Article 83(2) GDPR. The AT and FR SA’s position is that a fine amount that does not 
reflect  the  lack  of  legal  basis  for  the  processing  cannot  possibly  be  “effective,  proportionate  and 
dissuasive”852.  The  EDPB  understands  that  Meta  IE  disagrees  with  the  contents  of  the  objections, 
which concerns its merits and not its admissibility. 

423.  The EDPB finds that the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs adequately argue why they propose amending the 
Draft Decision and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed853. 

424.  The EDPB considers that the PL SA’s reference to the increase of the administrative fine in connection 
to the establishment of the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR854 as not being sufficiently detailed and 
articulated  to  be  considered  as  ‘reasoned’  for  the  purposes  of  meeting  the  requirements  set  by 
Article 4(24) GDPR,  in  the  absence  of  legal  or  factual  arguments  that  would  justify  including  this 
specific  corrective  measure  in  the  Draft  Decision  for  this  proposed  additional  infringement855. 
Therefore,  the  EDPB  does  not  consider  this  aspect  of  the  PL  SA’s  objection  to  be  relevant  and

The  DE  SA  argues  that  a  fine  should  have been included  following  a  finding  of infringement  of  Art. 5(1),  6(1)

of  the  case,  see  DE  SAs Objection,  p. 17-20.  The  FR  SA argues  the  administrative  fine  should  be  increased  to 
reflect the breaches of Art. 6 and 9 GDPR, see FR SA Objection, paragraph 46 and 48. The NO SA argues that a

reasoned, without prejudice to the analysis of the admissibility of the other aspects of this objection 
carried out above.  

425.  In terms of risks, Meta IE claims the Draft Decision does not pose any risk, let alone a significant risk 
to fundamental rights and argues the objections of the AT856, DE857, FR858, NO859 and SE860 SAs fail to 
demonstrate the contrary, as required. 

426.  Meta  IE  dismisses  the  concerns  the  FR,  NO,  and  SE  SAs  articulate  about  the  precedent  the  Draft 
Decision  sets in terms of use  of corrective  powers in terms of general deterrent. Meta IE claims a 
significant risk  should be  demonstrated in the  context of the  case  at hand, dismissing the  FR SA’s 
concerns about “reducing the authorities’ coercive power”861. In this context, Meta IE argues the NO 
and SE SA’s objections rest on unsubstantiated potential future behaviour of controllers, which could 
only be  an indirect and remote risk862. The EDPB notes that any risk  assessment addresses future 
outcomes, which are to some degree uncertain. Contrary to Meta IE’s view863, the objections reflect 
specifically on Meta IE’s future approach in the event the Draft Decision is adopted as it stands and go 
beyond providing “generalised assertions regarding notional controllers knowingly breaching GDPR 
for economic benefit”864.   

427.  Meta IE  further  considers  the  NO SA’s objection  lacking  because  “not every infringement carries a 
concrete, significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms”865. In the same vein, Meta IE dismisses 
the concerns put forward by the AT SA, because “not every disagreement on a provision of the GDPR 
will necessarily pose a significant risk to fundamental rights and freedoms”866 The EDPB notes these 
CSAs do not refer to “any infringement” or “any disagreement”, but specifically refer to a “lack of legal 
basis” and the consequences thereof867.  

                                                             
856 Meta IE considers the AT SA’s objection merely speculative because it asserts “that there would be a ‘lesser 
protection of data subjects’ without actually pointing towards a specific risk to fundamental rights or freedoms’s 
arguments on risk”. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 80-81. 
857 Meta IE essentially argues “no risks arise from the DPC’s in principle finding related to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR”. 
Meta  IE  further  dismisses  the  risk  identified  by  the  DE  SA  on  the  basis  that  “this  risk  is  premised  on  the 
misconception that the Draft Decision permits Meta Ireland and others to engage in processing without a lawful 
basis, which is not correct as made clear from the Draft Decision”. Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 133. The 
EDPB  fails  to  see  wording  by  which  the  DE  SA  might  have  suggested  it  understands  the  Draft  Decision  as 
permission or as a mandate for Meta Ireland to unlawfully process data. 
858 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 112.

Article 65 Submissions, p. 87), a line of reasoning the EDPB does not find in the SE SAs objection and in any case 
concerns a different topic.

428.  The  EDPB finds that  the  AT, DE, FR, NO,  and  SE  SAs  articulate  an adverse effect on the  rights and 
freedoms of data subjects if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee 
a high level of protection in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals868.   

429.  Therefore, the EDPB considers the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs objections concerning the imposition of 
a fine for the alleged additional infringements of Article 6/6(1)(b) GDPR and/or Article  9 GDPR to be 
reasoned. 

*** 

430.  With respect to the objection raised by the IT SA concerning the imposition of an administrative fine 
for the infringement of the fairness principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a), the EDPB finds that it stands 
in connection with the substance of the Draft Decision, as it concerns the imposition of a corrective 
measure for an additional infringement, which would be found as a consequence of incorporating the 
finding  put  forward  by  the  objection.  Clearly,  the  decision  on  the  merits  of  the  demand  to  take 
corrective  measures  for  a  proposed  additional  infringement  is  affected  by  the  EDPB’s  decision  on 
whether to instruct the LSA to include an additional infringement. 

431.  If  followed,  the  IT  SA’s  objection  sets  out  how  it  would  lead  to  a  different  conclusion  in  terms  of 
corrective measures imposed869. Taking note of Meta IE’s position870, the EDPB finds the objections 
raised by the IT SA to be relevant. 

432.  Meta IE argues the IT SA’s objection is too brief to be considered sufficiently reasoned, adding that it 
is  not  possible  to  identify  the  legal  arguments  the  IT  SA  wishes  to  put  forward  in  respect  of  the 
fine871.The EDPB finds that the IT SA adequately argues why they propose amending the Draft Decision 
and how this leads to a different conclusion in terms of administrative fine imposed872. 

433.  Meta IE argues the objection of the IT SA fails to demonstrate the risk posed by the Draft Decision, as 
required873 and, in doing so, Meta IE dismisses the concerns articulated by the IT SA on the precedent 
the Draft Decision sets874.  

434.  The EDPB finds that the IT SA articulates an adverse effect on the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
if the Draft Decision is left unchanged, by referring to a failure to guarantee a high level of protection 
in the EU for the rights and interests of the individuals875.

870 Meta IE argues that the LSA has sole discretion to determine which corrective measures are appropriate, see

275 - 277 as well as footnote 634).  
871 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, p. 124. 
872  The  IT  SA  argues  that  the finding  of  such  infringement  “should  result  into  the  imposition  of    the  relevant 
administrative fine as per Article 83(5)(a) GDPR” as far as “the infringement of the fairness principle  in addition 
to the  transparency one  [...]  should  result  into increasing  the amount  of  the  said  fine  substantially by having 
regard  to  the  requirement  that  each  fine  should  be  proportionate  and  dissuasive.  Indeed,  the  gravity  of  the 
infringement would be factually compounded”, see IT SA Objection, p. 11, paragraph 3.

435.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  the  IT  SA’s  objection  concerning  the  imposition  of  a  fine  for  the 
additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR to be reasoned. 

*** 

436.  The EDPB recalls its analysis of whether the objection raised by the IT SA in respect of the proposed 
additional 
infringements  of  Article 5(1)(b)  and  5(1)(c) GDPR  meets  the  threshold  set  by 
Article 4(24) GDPR  (see  Section 7.4.1  above).  In  light  of  the  conclusion  that  such  objection  is  not 
relevant and reasoned, the EDPB does not need to further examine this linked objection.     

9.2.4.2  Assessment on the merits 

437.  In accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR, the EDPB shall take a binding decision concerning all the 
matters  that  are  the  subject  of  the  relevant  and  reasoned  objections,  in  particular  whether  the 
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with the GDPR.  

438.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  the  consistency  mechanism  may  also  be  used  to  promote  a  consistent 
application of administrative fines876 and that the objective pursued by the corrective measure chosen 
can be  to re-establish compliance  with the  rules  or to punish unlawful behaviour  (or both)877.  The 
EDPB  responds  above  to  Meta  IE’s  position  that  the  LSA  has  sole  discretion  to  determine  which 
corrective measures are appropriate (see Section 8.4.2, paragraphs 275 - 277 as well as footnote 634). 

9.2.4.2.1  Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of 

Article 6(1) GDPR  

439.  The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR878 and 
that  the  objections  raised  by  the  AT,  DE,  FR,  NO  and  SE  SAs  found  to  be  relevant  and  reasoned 
requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose an administrative fine879.  

440.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s views that, even if an infringement is found, no additional fine is 
warranted880. Meta IE argues that the “nature of the infringement cannot be regarded as serious in 
circumstances where Meta Ireland has in good faith relied on a legal basis openly” and “users have 
been  on  notice  of  such  reliance  and  continued  to  use  the  Facebook  Service  without  any  harm  or 
detriment being suffered (and none identified by the CSAs or the DPC) over and above what is alleged 
in respect of the transparency infringements”881   

441.  The EDPB concurs that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one882. In the case at hand, however,

the EDPB agrees with the reasoning put forward by the AT, DE, FR, NO and SE SAs in their objections. 
The  EDPB  reiterates  that  lawfulness  of  processing  is  one  of  the  fundamental  pillars  of  the  data 
protection law and considers that processing of personal data without an appropriate legal basis is a 
clear and serious violation of the data subjects’ fundamental right to data protection883.  

442.  Several  of  the  factors  listed in  Article 83(2) GDPR  speak  strongly in  favour  of  the  imposition  of  an 

administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR.  

The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR) 

443.  As mentioned above and outlined below884, the nature and gravity of the infringement clearly tip the 

balance in favour of imposing an administrative fine. 

444.  With respect to the scope of processing, the EDPB notes the IE SA’s assessment that the personal data 
processing carried out by Meta IE on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR is extensive, adding that “[Meta 
IE] processes a variety of data in order to serve users personalised advertisements, tailor their ‘News 
Feed’, and to provide feedback to advertising partners on the popularity of particular advertisements. 
The processing is central to and essential to the business model offered”885.  

445.  In this respect, the EDPB also recalls that the infringement at issue relates to the processing of personal 

data of a significant number of people886 and that the impact on them has to be considered.   

446.  Though the damage is very difficult to express in terms of a monetary value, it remains the case that 
data  subjects  have  been  faced  with  data  processing  that  should  not  have  occurred  (by  relying 
inappropriately on Article 6(1)(b) as a legal basis as established in section 4.4.2). The data processing 
in  question  -  behavioural  advertising  -  entails  decisions  about  information  that  data  subjects  are 
exposed  to  or  excluded  from  receiving.  The  EDPB  recalls  that  non-material  damage  is  explicitly 
regarded  as  relevant  in  Recital 75  and  that  such  damage  may  result  from  situations  “where  data 
subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their 
personal data”. Given the nature and gravity of the infringement of Article 6(1)(b), a risk of damage 
caused to data subjects is, in such circumstances, consubstantial with the finding of the infringement 
itself.  

The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) 

447.  The SE SA argues the infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR should be considered intentional on Meta 

IE’s part, which is an aggravating factor887.  

                                                             
behaviour  (or  both)”),  p. 7  (“The  Regulation  requires  assessment  of  each  case  individually”;  “Fines  are  an 
important tool that supervisory authorities should use in appropriate circumstances. The supervisory authorities 
are  encouraged  to  use  a  considered  and  balanced  approach  in  their  use  of  corrective  measures,  in  order  to 
achieve both an effective and dissuasive as well as a proportionate reaction to the breach. The point is to not 
qualify the fines as last resort, nor to shy away from issuing fines, but on the other hand not to use them in such 
a way which would devalue their effectiveness as a tool.”).

448.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s position that it did not act intentionally with the aim to infringe the 
GDPR, nor was negligent - but “has relied on what it has consistently considered in good faith to be a 
valid legal basis for the purpose of processing of personal data for behavioural advertising and which 
now requires escalation to the EDPB for resolution”888. Before addressing each of the elements of this 
claim,  the  EDPB  first  notes  that  establishing  either  intent  or  negligence  is  not  a  requirement  for 
imposing  a  fine,  but  deserves  ‘due  regard’.  Second,  contrary  to  what  Meta  IE  implies,  the  mere 
circumstance that a dispute between the LSA and the CSAs has escalated to the EDPB does not serve 
as evidence that a controller acted in good faith with respect to the disputed issues. First, the dispute 
arises only (long) after the controller has decided on its course of action, and therefore cannot inform 
it.  Second,  a  dispute  may  simply  bring  to  light  that  an  LSA  has  decided  to  challenge  a  position 
commonly held by (a majority of) the CSAs.   

449.  The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines confirm that there are two cumulative elements on the 
basis of which an infringement can be considered intentional: the knowledge of the breach and the 
willfulness in relation to such act889. By contrast, an infringement is “unintentional” when there was a 
breach of the duty of care, without having intentionally caused the infringement.  

450.  The  characterisation  of  an  infringement  as  intentional  or  negligent  shall  be  done  on  the  basis  of 
objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case890. It is worth noting the broader 
approach adopted with respect to the concept of negligence, since it also encompasses situations in 
which the controller or processor has failed to adopt the required policies, which presumes a certain 
degree  of  knowledge  about  a  potential  infringement891.  This  provides  an  indication  that  non-
compliance in situations in which the controller or processor should have been aware of the potential 
breach (in the example provided, due to the lack of the necessary policies) may amount to negligence. 

451.  The SE SA argues that Meta IE “has continued to rely on Article 6(1)(b) for the processing, despite the 
aforementioned Guidelines [2/2019 on the processing of personal data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in 
the context of the  provision of online services to data subjects]  – which clearly gives doubt to the 
legality  of  the  processing  –  which  were  first  adopted  on  9  April 2019  and  made  final  on  8 
October 2019. The infringement must in all cases be considered intentional from that later date.”  

452.  The EDPB recalls that even prior to the adoption Guidelines 2/2019, there were clear indicators that 
spoke against relying on contract as legal basis. First, in WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on online behavioural 
advertising, only consent - as required by Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive - is put forward as possible 
legal basis for this activity. As Article 6 GDPR resembles Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive to a 
large  extent,  WP29  Opinion  02/2010  remained  a  relevant  source  on  this  matter  for  controllers 
preparing for the GDPR  to enter into application. Second,  WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of 

                                                             
888 Meta IE Article 65 Submissions, paragraph 8.25 and Annex 1, p. 86 and p. 134. 
889 The main elements to be taken into account in this regard were already established in the EDPB Guidelines 
on Administrative Fines, endorsed by the EDPB. The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines rely heavily on the 
EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines in this respect. The EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, quoting the 
EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, refer to the fact that “in general, ‘intent’ includes both knowledge and 
wilfulness  in  relation  to  the  characteristics  of  an  offence,  whereas  ‘unintentional’  means  that  there  was  no 
intention to cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required 
in the law”. 
890 EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraph 57 and EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines, p. 12. 
891  The  EDPB  Guidelines  on  calculation  of  fines,  paragraph  56  (Example 4)  quote  the  EDPB  Guidelines  on 
Administrative  Fines,  which  mention,  among  the  circumstances  indicative  of  negligence,  “failure  to  adopt 
policies (rather than simply failure to apply them)”.

legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract 
does  not  automatically  mean  that  the  processing  is  necessary  for  its  performance.  For  example, 
Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices 
based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller 
has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for 
example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract, 
this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”892. 

453.  It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.  However,  this  mere  element  is  not  sufficient  to  consider  an  infringement 
intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated.   

454.  The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the 
“will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the  EDPB Guidelines on 
calculation  of  fines  and  WP29  Guidelines  on  Administrative  Fines,  where  the  knowledge  and  the 
“wilfulness”  are  considered  two  distinctive  elements  of  the  intentionality893.  While  it  may  prove 
difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need 
to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality894.  

455.  The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional. 
In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”, 
rather than ‘intentionality’ when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care 
which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and 
individual situation”895. In this regard, the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of 
personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place 
for  the  safeguard  of  personal  data896:  this  does  not,  however,  per  se  change  the  nature  of  the 
infringement from negligent to intentional.  

456.  In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement 
on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch 
suggests  this  act  was  done  with  the  intention  of  circumventing  the  new  rights  of  users  under 
Article 6(1)(a)  GDPR.  The  SE  SA  adds  that  “[the]  proposed  finding  of  infringement  concerning 
information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this 
conclusion, since it goes to show that Facebook was aware of the questionable legality of that basis 
and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects”897.   

457.  The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Facebook Terms of Service as an 
objective element; however, this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many 
controllers  updated  their  data  protection  policies.  The  objection  suggests  that  the  conclusion  on 
intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations: in the EDPB’s view,

the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient 
to indicate intention either.  

458.  Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE 
to act in breach of the law, as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent 
its legal obligations. 

459.  Therefore,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the  SE  SAs  do  not  meet  the 
threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of 
the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.  

460.  At  the  same  time,  the  EDPB  notes  that,  even  establishing  that  the  infringement  was  committed 
negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities 
should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR898.   

461.  The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly 
seriously  negligent  in  not  taking  adequate  action,  within  a  reasonable  time  period,  following  the 
adoption of Guidelines 2/2019 on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB considers there was 
at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on 
online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests (see 
paragraphs 452 - 453 above), which mean Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the 
infringement of  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the  fact that processing of personal data is at the  core of its 
business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with 
data protection legislation.  

The  degree  of  responsibility  of  the  controller  taking  into  account  technical  and  organisational 
measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR) 

462.  The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same 

grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regard to the transparency infringements899. 

The manner in which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR) 

463.  The  DE  SAs  identify  an  aggravating  factor  in  the  fact  that  the  “infringement  became  known  by  a 

complaint of a data subject, not by chance or report by the controller itself”900.  

464.  The EDPB considers that, as a rule, the circumstance that the infringement became known to the LSA 
by way of a complaint should be considered neutral901. The DE SAs do not put forward reasons that 
would justify a departure from the rule in the present case.  

465.  Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element as an 

aggravating or mitigating factor.

The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

466.  The DE SAs and SE SA argue Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract 
as legal basis for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Facebook902. 
The  DE  SAs  engaged  in  a  detailed  calculation  to  justify  their  estimation  of  the  benefit,  although 
acknowledging it was based on assumptions903. While not providing an estimate of its size, the SE SA 
considers the existence of financial benefit sufficiently proven on the basis of “the self-evident fact 
that Facebook has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement 
as  part  of  a  whole  take  it  or  leave  it  offer  for  its  social  media  platform  service,  as  opposed  to 
establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear in the information to data subjects, it is 
a  reasonable  assumption  that  more  data  subjects  have  been  misled  into  being  subject  to  the 
processing,  thus  increasing  the  financial  benefits  gained  by  Facebook  pursuant  to  personal 
advertisement”904.  

467.  The EDPB recalls that financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance 
if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR905.  

468.  In  the  present  case,  the  EDPB  considers  that  it  does  not  have  sufficiently  precise  information  to 

evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.  

469.  Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they 
are  disproportionally  low  compared  to  the  benefits  obtained  with  the  infringement.  The  EDPB 
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement 
is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed, 
the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.   

The profitability of the undertaking - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

470.  For the reasons stated above (paragraphs 378 - 381), the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision 
does not need to include this element as aggravating or mitigating factor as put forward by the DE

Competitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR) 

471.  The NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “that the unlawful processing of personal data in all 
likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual 
or societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to FIL. The algorithms may have 
contributed to giving FIL a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors”907. 

472.  On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case 
provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR908. 
In  the  present  case,  the  EDPB  considers  that  it  does  not  have  sufficiently  precise  information  to 
evaluate  the  existence  of  a  competitive  advantage  resulting  from  the  infringement.  The  EDPB 
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from

the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of 
the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed. 

*** 

473.  Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance 
with  Article 83(2) GDPR,  the  EDPB  considers  that  the  IE  SA  must  exercise  its  power  to  impose  an 
additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line 
with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency 
infringements  relating  to  processing    carried  out  in  reliance  on  Article 6(1)(b) GDPR909.  The  EDPB 
underlines  that,  in  order  to  be  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive,  a  fine  should  reflect  the 
circumstances  of  the  case.  Such  circumstances  not  only  refer  to  the  specific  elements  of  the 
infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely 
its financial position. 

9.2.4.2.2  Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of 

the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR  

474.  The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness 
principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR910 and that the objection raised by the IT SA, which was found to 
be  relevant  and  reasoned,  requested  the  IE  SA  to  exercise  its  power  to  impose  an  administrative 
fine911. 

475.  The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection is not relevant and reasoned912 and 
also notes that Meta IE does not provide further arguments on the content of the IT SA objection in 
this regard913.   

476.  The EDPB recalls that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one914. In the same vein, the EDPB’s 
assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness is carried out by taking into account 
the specificities of the case, of the particular social networking service at hand and of the processing 
of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising915.  

477.  As previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically 
linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent 
meaning916. It underpins the  whole  data protection framework  and plays a key role  for securing a 
balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship917. 

478.  Considering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements of 
the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects as 
to  the  processing  of  their  personal  data,  fulfilling  data  subjects’  reasonable  expectation,  ensuring 
power  balance,  avoiding  deception  and  ensuring  ethical  and  truthful  processing918,  as  well  as  the

overall effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR, 
the  EDPB  reiterates 
infringed  the  principle  of  fairness  under 
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into 
account  by  the  IE  SA  in  the  calculation  of  the  amount  of  the  administrative  fine  to  be  imposed 
following the conclusion of this inquiry.

479.  Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness 
principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when, re-assessing the administrative 
fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. 
If, however, the  IE SA considers  an additional fine  for the  breach of the  principle  of fairness  is an 
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any 
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it 
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.

10 BINDING DECISION 

480.  In light of the above, and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue 
binding  decisions  pursuant  to  Article 65 GDPR,  the  EDPB  issues  the  following  Binding  Decision  in 
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR. 

481.  The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, in 

accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR.  

On  the  objections  concerning  whether  the  LSA  should  have  found  an  infringement  for  lack  of 
appropriate legal basis/unlawful data processing 

482.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs regarding Meta 
IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service 
meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

483.  On the parts of the DE SAs objection requesting the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, 
and  the  parts  of  the  DE,  IT  and  NO  SAs  objections  requesting  specific  corrective  measures  under 
Article 58 GDPR  for  the  infringement  of  Article 6(1)  or  6(1)(b) GDPR,  namely  the  imposition  of  an 
administrative  fine,  a  ban  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  behavioural 
advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and an order to 
identify  a  valid  legal  basis  for  future  behavioural  advertising  or  to  abstain  from  such  processing 
activities,  the  EDPB  decides  that  these  parts  of  their  objections  do  not  meet  the  threshold  of 
Article 4(24) GDPR.  

484.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE 
may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service, and 
to include an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, on the basis of the conclusion reached by the EDPB in 
this Binding Decision. 

On the objections concerning whether the LSA’s Draft Decision includes sufficient analysis and evidence 
to conclude that Meta IE is not obliged to rely on consent to process the Complainant’s personal data 

485.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs regarding the LSA’s Finding 1 
that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Facebook 
Terms of Service meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

486.  On  the  part  of  the  NL  SA  objection  asking  the  IE  SA  to  include  in  its  Draft  Decision  the  elements 
concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices 
under  ePrivacy  legislation,  the  EDPB  decides  that  this  part  falls  outside  the  scope  of  the  EDPB’s 
mandate. 

487.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB 
decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its 
Facebook service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and 
complies  with  the  relevant  obligations  under  the  GDPR,  to  the  extent  that  this  new  investigation 
complements the  findings made  in  the  IE SA’s Final  Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding 
Decision, and based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft decision in accordance with 
Article 60(3) GDPR.

On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness  

488.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the infringement by Meta IE of the principle 

of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

489.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision an additional infringement of the principle of 

fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE. 

On  the  objection  concerning  the  potential  additional  infringement  of  the  principles  of  purpose 
limitation and data minimisation 

490.  On the objection by the IT SA concerning the possible additional infringements of  the principles of 
purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the EDPB decides this 
objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

On the objections concerning corrective measures other than administrative fines 

491.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional and/or alternative 

specific corrective measures to be imposed meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

492.  On the objection by the PL SA concerning the order to bring processing into compliance with the GDPR, 

the EDPB decides that this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

493.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing 
of  personal  data  for  behavioural  advertising  purposes  in  the  context  of  the  Facebook  service  into 
compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months. 

494.  The EDPB also instructs the LSA to adjust its order to  Meta IE to bring its Facebook Data Policy and 
Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months, 
to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also 
to data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of Facebook service (to 
reflect  the  finding  of  the  EDPB  that  for  this  processing  the  controller  cannot  rely  on 
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).   

On  the  objections  concerning  the  determination  of  the  administrative  fine  for  the  transparency 
infringements 

495.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs regarding the determination of 
infringements,  meet  the  requirements  of 

for  the  transparency 

fine 

the  administrative 
Article 4(24) GDPR. 

496.  Regarding the turnover of the undertaking, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into consideration the 
total turnover of all the entities composing the single undertaking (i.e. consolidated turnover of the 
group headed by Meta Platforms, Inc.) for the financial year preceding the date of the final decision.   

497.  On the number of data subjects affected (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR), the EDPB finds that the IE SA is not 

required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard. 

498.  Concerning  any  action  taken  by  the  controller  to  mitigate  the  damage  suffered  by  data  subjects 
(Article 83(2)(c) GDPR),  the  EDPB  finds  the  IE  SA  does  not  provide  sufficient  justification  for  the 
mitigating  factor  identified,  and  instructs  the  IE  SA  to  modify  its  Draft  Decision  on  this  matter  by 
considering this criterion as neither aggravating nor mitigating. 

Adopted 
 

 

118 

 
 

499.  Regarding  the  financial  benefit  gained  from  the  infringements  (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR),  the  EDPB 
instructs the IE SA to ascertain if further estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement of 
transparency obligations is possible in this case.  Insofar as further estimation of the financial benefit 
from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the amount of the 
fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed. 

500.  Concerning the relevance of the profit of the undertaking (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB finds that 
in the present case the IE SA does not have to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the 
annual profit of the undertaking pursuant to Article 83 GDPR. 

501.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which  the 
turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine, as 
appropriate,  to  ensure  the  fine  is  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  in  accordance  with 
Article 83(1) GDPR.  

502.  The EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity 
of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the 
requirement  of  being  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  in  accordance  with  Article 83(1)  and 
(2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for 
the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative 
fine envisaged in the  Draft Decision. In doing so, the  IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of 
effectiveness,  proportionality,  and  dissuasiveness  enshrined  in  Article 83(1) GDPR  in  its  overall 
reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.  

On the objections concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis 

503.  The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs regarding the imposition of an 
administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR meet the requirements 
of Article 4(24) GDPR.  

504.  The EDPB decides that the relevant parts of the objections of the IT and PL SAs specifically relating to 

an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR. 

505.  In relation to intentionality under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the arguments put 
forward by the SE SA in their objection do not contain sufficient objective elements to demonstrate 
the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE.  

506.  Concerning the manner in which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR), the EDPB 

decides the IE SA has no cause to amend the Draft Decision.  

507.  Regarding the possible financial benefit obtained  from the infringement as well as the competitive 
advantage (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB instructs the IE SA to  ascertain if an estimation of the 
financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as further estimation of the 
financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the 
amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.  

508.  Concerning the relevance of profit of the undertaking (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB finds that in 
the  present case the  IE SA does  not have  to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the 
annual profit of the undertaking pursuant to Article 83 GDPR. 

509.  The  EDPB  instructs  the  IE  SA  to  cover  the  additional  infringement  of  Article 6(1) GDPR  with  an 
in  accordance  with 

is  effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive 

administrative 

fine  that

Article 83(1) GDPR. In determining the fine amount, the IE SA must give due regard to all the applicable 
factors  listed  in  Article 83(2) GDPR,  in  particular  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  infringement,  the 
number of data subjects affected and the seriously negligent character of the infringement. 

On  the  objection  concerning  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the  infringement  of  the 
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR 

510.  The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for 

the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.  

511.  The EDPB instructs the IE SA to factor the additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined 
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR into its adoption of appropriate corrective measures. In this respect, the IE SA 
is instructed to take due account of this infringement when re-assessing the administrative fines for 
the  transparency  infringements  and  the  determination  of  the  fine  for  the  lack  of  legal  basis.  If, 
however,  the  IE  SA  considers  an  additional  fine  for  the  breach  of  the  principle  of  fairness  is  an 
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any 
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it 
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.   

On  the  objection  concerning  the  imposition  of  an  administrative  fine  for  the  infringement  of 
Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR 

512.  The EDPB decides that it does not need to examine the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition 

of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR.
