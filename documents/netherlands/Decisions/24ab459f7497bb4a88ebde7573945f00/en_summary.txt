The National Police has taken measures to better protect police data against unauthorized access. The National Police thus complies with the order subject to periodic penalty payments imposed by the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) in November 2018.

  Control of viewing N.SIS II system
The violation concerned the security of the system that controls incoming and outgoing persons and goods in the Schengen area, the N.SIS II system. Not all National Police employees who have access to this system have unlimited access to all police data. That is why the National Police must regularly and proactively check who has viewed what information. The AP has now established that the National Police has made sufficient improvements in this regard.

  What preceded?
At the beginning of 2017, the DPA imposed an order subject to periodic penalty payments on the National Police for not regularly and proactively checking log files of N.SIS II. Subsequently, the National Police paid a penalty of 40,000 euros because the violation had not ended. In November 2018, the DPA imposed a second order subject to periodic penalty payments, because it considered the measures taken by the NPN to be insufficient to end the violation.
