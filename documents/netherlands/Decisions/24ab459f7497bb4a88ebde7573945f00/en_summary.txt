The National Police has taken measures to better protect police data against unauthorized access. The National Police thus complies with the order subject to a penalty imposed by the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) in November 2018.

  Checking N.SIS II system inspection
The violation concerned the security of the system used to check incoming and outgoing persons and goods in the Schengen area, the N.SIS II system. Not all employees of the National Police who have access to this system are allowed unlimited access to all police data. That is why the National Police must regularly and proactively check who has seen which information. The AP has now established that the National Police has made sufficient improvements in this regard.

  What came before?
At the beginning of 2017, the AP imposed a cease and desist order on the National Police for failing to regularly and proactively check N.SIS II log files. After that, the National Police paid a penalty of 40,000 euros because the violation had not ended. In November 2018, the AP imposed a second order subject to a penalty, because it considered the measures taken by the NP to date insufficient to end the violation.
