Dear Mr Van den Bosch,
 
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has decided to impose an administrative fine on Stichting OLVG (OLVG).
of €440,000 because OLVG has not met the requirement of two-factor authentication
and reviewing log files on a regular basis. As a result, OLVG has insufficiently appropriate
measures taken as referred to in Article 32, first paragraph, of the General Regulation
Data Protection (GDPR).
 
The decision is explained in more detail below. Chapter 1 is an introduction and chapter 2 describes it
legal framework. In chapter 3, the DPA assesses the responsibility for processing and the violation.
Chapter 4 sets out the (level of the) administrative fine and Chapter 5 contains the operative part and
the remedies clause.

1 Introduction

1.1 Legal entities involved and reason for the investigation
 
OLVG is a foundation with its registered office at Oosterpark 9, in Amsterdam. OLVG is registered in
the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 41199082. OLVG is a top clinical
teaching hospital in Amsterdam with two main locations in Amsterdam East and West. OLVG offers
medical care to approximately 500,000 patients annually. In 2018, OLVG had 5890 salaried employees,
of which 4274 in patient-related functions.1
 
The AP has received two data breach notifications from the OLVG Foundation about access by employees and
working students in electronic patient records. As a result of these data breach reports, the AP
initiated an ex officio investigation into OLVG's compliance with Article 32(1) of the GDPR by
to examine security aspects such as the authentication and control of the logging, among other things.
 
1.2 Process
 
In a letter dated 17 April 2019, the AP announced the investigation and asked OLVG questions. This one
questions were answered by OLVG in a letter dated 3 May 2019.
 
On May 22, 2019, five supervisors of the AP conducted an on-site investigation at OLVG, location
East, at Oosterpark 9 in Amsterdam. During this study, the hospital information system was
demonstrated and viewed various moments and parts. There are also oral
statements taken from members of the Executive Board and from various OLVG employees.
 
The AP sent the report with findings to OLVG on February 10, 2020. By letter of 17 February
In 2020, the AP sent OLVG an intention to enforce. To this end also with this letter by
given the AP the opportunity, OLVG wrote to OLVG on 27 March 2020 and orally on 25 June 2020
gave its opinion on this intention and the report on which it is based.

3. Review

3.1 Processing of personal data
 
Since 19 October 2015, OLVG has been using a new and integrated hospital information system in which
electronic patient records are stored.2 The data about patients that OLVG has in the
hospital information system is processed information with which OLVG natural persons can
identify. These patient data are therefore personal data within the meaning of Article 4, part 1, of
the GDPR. Some of this data is health data and can therefore also be qualified as a
special category of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR.
 
Furthermore, there is a processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4, part 2, of the
GDPR. Due to its scope, the term "processing" includes any possible operation or set of
processing of personal data. Recording and consulting patient data in the
hospital information system is also included. It concerns an extensive processing in which many
people are involved. In 2018 alone, OLVG provided medical care to approximately 500,000 patients
granted.3
 
3.2 Controller
 
In the context of the question whether OLVG acts in violation of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, it is also important
to determine who qualifies as a controller as referred to in Article 4, section 7,
of the GDPR. The determining factor here is who has the purpose and means of processing the data
personal data - in this case the processing of patient data in the hospital information system
of the OLVG - determines. In order to answer this question, the AP in this case attaches value to the
statements by the board of OLVG during the on-site investigation, the registration in the
trade register of the Chamber of Commerce, policy documents and the annual accounts of OLVG
from 2015 and 2018.

The chairman of the Board of Directors of OLVG has stated that a management merger has taken place in 2013
took place between the Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital foundation and the Onze Lieve Vrouwen foundation
Gasthuis and that there has been one joint board since then.4 Subsequently, these two hospitals were closed in June
legally merged into one hospital, named: Stichting OLVG.5 Furthermore, during the merger in 2015
introduced the current hospital information system uniformly within OLVG.6 This system is like
mentioned above, finally put into use on October 19, 2015 by OLVG.7
 
According to the registration in the Chamber of Commerce, the activities of OLVG are 'general'
hospitals, practices of medical specialists and medical day treatment centers, health centers and
outpatient youth care.'8 OLVG further states in its information security & privacy policy that the system
of security and privacy measures focuses, among other things, on securing all information and
information systems, preventing information security incidents and taking
Precautions. The Information Security & Privacy Policy applies to all
business units of the OLVG and on the exchange of data with other organisations.9 Also from the
‘Regulation patient data and use of communication means’ shows that OLVG has determined how
OLVG employees have to deal with electronic patient files.10
 
On the basis of the above documents and statements from the board of OLVG, the AP concludes that
OLVG determines the purpose and means for the processing of personal data for the benefit of the
electronic patient records from OLVG. This means that OLVG is the controller in the
meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR for the processing of patient data in the
OLVG hospital information system.
 
3.3 Data Security Violation
 
3.3.1 Introduction
To ensure security and prevent the processing of personal data from infringing
to the GDPR, the controller must, pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR,
processing inherent risks and take measures to mitigate risks. That
measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the status

of the technology and the implementation costs compared to the risks and the nature of the
personal data.11 In the following, the AP checks whether OLVG has an appropriate security level
used for the processing of personal data in its hospital information system.
 
3.3.2 Two-factor authentication
 
3.3.2.1 Facts
The current hospital information system was put into use by OLVG on 19 October 2015. During the day
the on-site investigation on May 22, 2019 at OLVG, supervisors of the AP investigated for
how OLVG employees gain access to the electronic patient files (log in)
within the hospital information system. The AP notes that the authentication of the identity of the
employee for the use of the hospital information system of OLVG in two ways possible
depends on whether access is requested from inside or outside the OLVG network.
 
During the on-site investigation12, the supervisors of the AP established that employees
from OLVG on a computer (terminal) within the OLVG network can log in to the virtual
workplace (VDI).13 Logging in is done by entering a username and password and
no use is made of a staff card or a token as part of the login process
to access the hospital information system. This way of logging in is different
moments during the on-site investigation. The regulators of the AP have this
first observed during the demonstration of the hospital information system.14 This
statement is also confirmed by the oral statements of [CONFIDENTIAL].15
 
Furthermore, during workplace inspections, the AP supervisors of three different
employees16 of OLVG found that if the employee uses his/her username and
enters the password correctly, he/she gains access to the VDI environment and to the electronic
patient records. It turned out that this involves a 'single sign on' functionality17, which means that the
employee who is logged in to the VDI also has immediate access to the hospital information system with
the electronic patient records.
 
Furthermore, it is stated in article 2.1. of the 'Regulations on patient data and use of communication tools'
that “OLVG employees, (…) insofar as this is necessary for the position they perform within OLVG, by means of
login code and password access [is] granted to the electronic patient record in Epic and similar
patient information systems within OLVG (hereinafter collectively referred to as “EPD”).”18

The second way to access the hospital information system is through a computer outside
the OLVG network. During the demonstration during the on-site investigation, the AP found
that can also be logged into the VDI via a computer outside the OLVG network, for example when
employees work from home.19 In this case, log in to the VDI environment and the
hospital information system with a username and password20 in combination with a
varying token that is received or created by SMS or application.21
 
On 9 March 2020, OLVG linked a reader to every computer (terminal) and thus the
above method changed. As a result, an employee must use his/her staff card for this
reader and then enter a password before access to the computer can be
obtained.22
 
3.3.2.2 Assessment
Pursuant to Article 32(1) of the GDPR, the controller must provide appropriate
take technical and organizational measures to ensure a security level appropriate to the risk
to ensure. In assessing the risks, according to Article 32, second paragraph, of the GDPR, attention must be paid to
to be spent on risks that arise in the processing of personal data. As the
data is more sensitive, or the context in which it is used presents a greater threat
affects the privacy of those involved, stricter requirements are imposed on the
data security.
 
OLVG processes personal data of approximately 500,000 patients on a large scale in its hospital system.
This (usually) concerns extremely sensitive data about health. Health data is out
under Article 9(1) of the GDPR as a special category of personal data.
These personal data, which by their nature are particularly sensitive with regard to fundamental rights and
fundamental freedoms deserve specific protection as the context of their processing
could pose significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms. OLVG serves
therefore take appropriate measures to protect personal data as well as possible and
to prevent infringements as much as possible.
 
Given the sensitive nature of the data, the large scale of the processing by OLVG and the risks
for the privacy of those involved, OLVG had in
electronic health records must set up a two-factor authentication. The AP has in the
the foregoing, however, it has been established that employees can access a computer within the OLVG network
were able to access the data in the electronic patient records using only something an employee
know (namely a username and password). That means that in that case it was used
of only one factor. The investigation has shown that OLVG has not used
a pass, token or other second factor. As a result, OLVG does not meet the requirement of at least

two-factor authentication fulfilled, which in the context of this processing under Article 32 of the
AVG is required. The AP considers such a security measure, also in view of the current state of the
technology and implementation costs, appropriate. In doing so, the AP takes into account that generally
accepted security standards, such as the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare,
prescribe two-factor authentication.
 
OLVG has further stated in its Information Security & Privacy Policy that the aforementioned policy is
based on: 1) the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely: NEN 7510, NEN
7512 and NEN 7513 and 2) current legislation and regulations, including the AVG. OLVG strives for it
demonstrably comply with these standards.23 OLVG has thus also independently committed itself to
comply with the above NEN standards, in which it is established that the identity of users must
are established through two-factor authentication.24
 
Finally, the AP notes that, specifically with regard to the wording 'appropriate'
technical and organizational measures' - as included in Article 32 GDPR - there is a
continuation of what already applied under Directive 95/46/EC and the Personal Data Protection Act
(Wbp).25 There is no question of a material change. Under those circumstances, it is obvious —
also with a view to legal certainty — to continue with the interpretation followed in the past
of Article 32(1) of the GDPR. This means that the interpretation already used in the past via the
requirements of two-factor authentication contained in the NEN standards and the regular assessment of the
log files is maintained.26 The AP has also always clearly communicated that the NEN 7510, if
generally accepted security standard within the practice of information security in healthcare,
remains an important standard for information security in healthcare under the GDPR regime and this
guidelines must be followed.27
 
Opinion OLVG and response AP
In its view, OLVG states that the AP incorrectly judges that OLVG does not provide two-factor authentication
has applied. According to Standard 9.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017), health information systems that
process personal health information, identify users and this should be
to be done through authentication involving at least two factors.
According to OLVG, it has been the case for years that access to PCs has been limited by access to physical space
where the computer is. PCs are located in rooms that can only be accessed with a
personal staff card. The pass is configured in such a way that an employee only

                                                                        
23 OLVG response to AP information request dated 3 May 2019, appendix 2, under 3.3 and appendix 8, under 2.2.
24 Incidentally, on the basis of Articles 3 and 5 of the Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers
obliged to ensure the safe and careful use of electronic devices in accordance with NEN 7510 and NEN 7512
exchange systems and that logging complies with the provisions of NEN 7513.
25 Article 13 Wbp and Article 17, first paragraph, Directive 95/46/EC also already knew the terminology ‘appropriate and organizational measures’
to prevent loss or unlawful processing.
26 For example, it follows from the report 'Access to digital patient files within healthcare institutions' of June 2013;
https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/downloads/mijn_privacy/rap_2013-patientendossiers-binnen-
healthcare institutions.pdf.

has access to areas and functions for which the employee is authorized. According to OLVG there is no
difference in principle between the access that is limited to the person who holds a pass in front of a reader who is
is near the PC.
 
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. For an appropriate security of the personal data in
electronic patient records, it is necessary that the OLVG information system only uses a
two-factor authentication is accessible. If the access to the room is charged with an authentication via
a personal card but the computer itself does not have two-factor authentication, then there is a greater chance that
employees who are authorized to use the room (such as cleaners) but not the electronic
patient records, can access these records. In addition, certain parts of the
hospital, such as outpatient clinics, are not completely closed. So there is indeed an important difference with the
access limited to the person holding a pass for a reader located near the computer.
Finally, the AP emphasizes that standard 9.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) uses the term 'health information systems'
contains. In other words, the information systems themselves must be secured with two-factor authentication.
 
In view of the foregoing, the AP is of the opinion that OLVG at least until 22 May 2019 Article 32, first paragraph,
of the GDPR, now that OLVG's hospital information system has not complied with the
requirement of two-factor authentication. OLVG has meanwhile terminated this violation by informing any
computer(-terminal) to connect a reader. As a result, an employee must have his/her staff card
in front of this reader and then enter a password before accessing the computer
are obtained.
 
3.3.3 Logging check
 
3.3.3.1 Facts
OLVG's Information Security & Privacy Policy states that OLVG strives
demonstrably comply with the standards NEN 7510 (information security in healthcare), NEN 7512
(base of trust for data exchange), NEN 7513 (logging actions on electronic
patient records) and the AVG.28 In addition, OLVG indicates in the Epic Logging policy that this document
must lead to compliance with the NEN 7513 standard and applicable laws and regulations.29 In the Logging
Epic's policy is based on the principle that the log files are periodically checked for
indications of irregularities or errors so that they can preferably be identified early where necessary
30 To this end, all activities of users, systems and
information security events logged.31 From anomalous events
registered in the log data, a report is drawn up and, if necessary, further
research.32 The Logging policy Epic distinguishes in the way in which the log data
are checked, i.e. randomly and on an incident basis.33

Under Epic's Logging Policy, sample checks are required every four weeks
representative sample can be taken for analysis.34 The Epic Logging procedure shows that
a monthly report is obtained from the data warehouse of the number of break-the-glass
events.35 There will always be an average amount of events.36 The EHR Service does random checks
control of the break-the-glass events and is free to determine what a representative
sample.37 If there are major deviations for one or more users, then further
investigation into these deviations.38 The incidental check takes place when the
current events (based on an incident or a patient's request) give rise to this.39 Then the
necessary analyzes are carried out. In this case, if there is a request from a patient,
the research question must come from Legal Affairs.40 From deviating events
reports are drawn up.41 The report shows what the striking events
and how or why these events stand out, and how they conflict with policy
and/or lawful access to a file.42
 
[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG stated during the on-site investigation that every act is
logged.43 [CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that with regard to the control of the logging
a number of random checks and incidental checks have been carried out.44 For example, on March 26, 2018, a random sample was taken
into the break-the-glass behavior of certain job groups.45 This applied to job groups

[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that these two samples are the only two samples
have been carried out by OLVG in the period from 1 January 2018 to 22 May 2019.50
In addition, [CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that OLVG believes that a collection
incidental checks also form a sample, since it is aggregated how
it often happens that there has been unlawful access and which incidents this concerns.51 According to the
[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG, very few irregularities were found in it and it constituted
no specific reason to schedule another sample.52 [CONFIDENTIAL] stated that
there is no random check every four weeks, as described in the logging policy
takes place, but that in practice it is looked at what gives rise to doing a
sample.53 The above samples are the only two samples that were performed.54 At the time
of the on-site investigation, an alarm was still being developed at certain limit values.55
 
In addition to these two random checks, OLVG also carried out incidental checks. OLVG has in the period
from January 2018 to April 2019, eight incident checks were carried out.56 This concerns the retrieval of
one electronic patient record at a time in response to a patient's request.57

In its opinion, OLVG indicates that the protocol “procedure for checking the legality of file inspection”
has been updated and re-established on March 17, 2020. The logging control has been in place since the
investigation on the spot of the AP in May 2019 further tightened. As of 1 July 2019, OLVG has the frequency
of the check on the logging already increased to once every two weeks (at least two or more
reports per month). This check involves a (bi-weekly) data query on all logging data.
In the period from July 2019 to November 2019, reports are based on logging data
made from different perspectives. From these different perspectives, during this period
reported multiple times about the logging behavior. The different perspectives have also been used
to determine where the risk of unauthorized access is greatest. It has started from May 2020
with a new selection method. All contacts are assigned a score with a higher score
means a greater chance of unauthorized access. As of June 2020, there will be at least every two weeks
made a printout of 50 views with the highest point score on a random day, which rated
and then further investigated if suspected of illegality. In addition to the
random check, ad hoc logging check takes place if the actuality (from the resolution
incidents or at the request of a patient) gives rise to this. OLVG is of the opinion that
this complies with standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017).
 
As mentioned above, the AP has established that OLVG in the period from 1 January 2018 to 17
April 2019, two samples and eight incidental checks of the logging of one electronic
patient file. OLVG thus has at least during the aforementioned period
not in accordance with its own policies (including the Information Security & Privacy Policy and Logging Policy
epic) acted. Apart from that, doing just eight occasional checks and two proactive
samples in a period of 15.5 months amply and evidently insufficient to be able to
speak of an appropriate security level that refers to signaling unauthorized access to
patient data and taking measures in response to unauthorized access. In doing so, the
AP of importance the scale of the hospital's processing of health data, the sensitive
nature of the data and the risks to the privacy of those involved.
 
OLVG processes (special categories of) personal data on a large scale and (usually) this concerns:
highly sensitive health data. Stricter requirements are therefore imposed on the
security of this data. Given the sensitive nature of the data, the large size of the
processing and the risks to the privacy of data subjects, OLVG therefore had the
log data regularly. In this way, unauthorized access can be signaled and
take action. The basic principle of the AP is that checking the logging systematically and
must take place consistently, whereby a random check and/or check based on
complaints is not enough. 58 The fine-grainedness of the authorization model used and the control of the
The correctness of the authorizations partly determines the intensity of the check on the logging. At a
random random checks, there is no question of a system aimed at unlawful
use and risks. As a result, OLVG does not meet the requirement of regular assessment of
log files, which is in the context of this processing under Article 32 of the GDPR
requires. The AP considers such a control measure, also in view of the current state of the art and the

implementation costs, appropriate. In doing so, the AP takes into account that generally accepted
security standards, such as the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, regularly
prescribe logging.
 
Finally, OLVG has, as in section 3.3.2.2. already appointed, also independently committed to
comply with NEN standards. Section 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 states that log files from
events that affect user activities, exceptions, and information security events
should be created, stored and regularly reviewed.
 
In view of the foregoing, the AP is of the opinion that OLVG at least until 22 May 2019 Article 32, first paragraph,
of the GDPR because OLVG has not regularly reviewed log files. OLVG has
this violation has now ended because they have completed the procedure with regard to the control of the logging
tightened up and increased the frequency of checking the logging.
 
3.4 Other opinion OLVG and response from AP
 
3.4.1 Rights of the defense
OLVG argues that the imposition of a fine for the conduct observed by the AP is contrary to
the nemo-tenetur principle59 as laid down in Article 48, paragraph 1, of the European Charter and Article
6, paragraph 1, of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), since the
findings are based on data breach reports that OLVG was obliged to make under threat
of a sanction. Referring to various case law, OLVG mentions that if during a
procedure there is (the reasonable expectation) of a criminal charge, at least when it is not possible
are excluded that the material will also be brought against the provider in connection with a criminal charge
are used, the nemo-tenetur principle prevents it from being obtained in the procedure
will-dependent material is used for an administrative punishment by means of
fine.60
 
The fact that OLVG, pursuant to the Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers and the
NEN standards contained therein is obliged to keep certain log files that monitor the
makes compliance with the GDPR possible, according to OLVG does not mean that there is independence of will
evidence. Pursuant to Article 33(1) of the GDPR, OLVG has on September 13, 2018 and on
February 15, 2019 a report of a data breach was made to the AP. These data breach notifications concern according to
OLVG information that does not exist separately from the will of OLVG: OLVG has compiled the information in order to
comply with the obligation of Article 33(1) of the GDPR. Referring again to various
court decisions, OLVG argues that will-dependent information may not be used for a
administrative punishment by means of a fine.61 As a result of the two
data breach reports launched an investigation as part of which the investigation was placed on May 22, 2019

occurred. According to OLVG, it is therefore clear that the entire investigation of the AP is based
to the notifications made by OLVG on the basis of the GDPR.
 
By letter dated April 17, 2019, the AP furthermore, pursuant to Articles 5:16 and 5:17 of the General Act
administrative law (Awb) for information. The AP has not pointed out in this letter that OLVG is not
is obliged to provide information if doing so would prove a violation of the GDPR
to deliver. According to OLVG, this means that all information obtained by the AP with its request
for information, obtained under duress as referred to in Article 6(1) ECHR and Article 48(1)
member of the Charter. OLVG concludes that in view of the foregoing, the will-dependent information that
obtained under duress from OLVG cannot be used for the imposition of an administrative
fine.
 
Response AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. The AP is of the opinion that the evidence it has obtained is not in
contrary to Article 48, paragraph 1, of the European Charter and Article 6, paragraph 1, ECHR and the
closed nemo-tenetur principle has been obtained. Nor should evidence be excluded. AP motivates
that as follows.
 
First of all, the AP will discuss the two data breach reports. As OLVG itself indicates, the two reported
data leaks have only been a reason for the AP to start an official investigation into the
compliance with Article 32 of the GDPR by OLVG. Although the two data breach notifications are in the file
with the documents relating to the case, but they do not constitute evidence in any way
of the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR detected by the AP. Exclusion of those
data breach reports as evidence is therefore not an issue. Apart from that, the AP considers the
data breach notification as independent information. In view of Article 33, paragraph 5 of the GDPR, OLVG is obliged
all personal data breaches, including the facts surrounding the breach in
connection with personal data, the consequences thereof and the corrective measures taken
document, so that it is deemed to have this information.62
 
Secondly, the AP does not follow OLVG in its statement that the AP with its request for information of 17 April 2019
OLVG has been forced to provide information to the AP and as a result that information is not used
may be used to impose an administrative fine. To this end, it is first relevant to establish
that the AP requested information in that letter. No formal information has been ‘claimed’ under
reference to the obligation to cooperate, as follows, for example, from Article 5:20 of the Awb and/or
Article 31 of the GDPR. That the letter in question refers to Article 58(1)(a) of the GDPR and
article 5:16 jo. 5:17 Awb does not make this any different. Those references are for information only for OLVG in
included the letter in order to make it clear that the AP (and its employees) OLVG to
may request information and on what basis they may do so. From providing information under
In the opinion of the AP there is therefore no question of coercion.
 
In addition, if and insofar as exclusion of evidence would (still) apply, that exclusion according to
settled case-law applies only to evidence whose existence depends on the will of the

provider (will-dependent material). This does not apply to evidence that exists independently of
the will of the provider (independent material). The AP has received from OLVG in response to the
information request from the AP dated May 3, 2019 both will-dependent material (statements and
explanations prepared for the AP), as independent material. It
independent material consists of documents that already existed in a physical sense at OLVG, such as the
logging policy dated September 29, 2016 and reports of samples dated March 13, 2019 resp. March 26
2018. The AP subsequently did not use the will-dependent material to determine the
violation and the imposition of the administrative fine. However, the violation is independent of will
material, partly based on will-dependent material that was later provided by employees of OLVG
after they have been informed of the right to remain silent by means of a warrant. Evidence exclusion is in the opinion
of the AP is therefore not up for discussion.
 
On the basis of the above, the AP concludes the imposition of a fine for the
conduct is not in conflict with the nemo-tenetur principle as laid down in Article 48, first paragraph, of
the European Charter and Article 6(1) ECHR.
 
3.4.2 Research objective
OLVG argues that the imposition of a fine for those identified by the AP
conduct, at least with regard to authentication, is contrary to the rights of defence
as laid down in Article 48, paragraph 2, of the European Charter and Article 6, paragraph 2, ECHR,
since the observed behaviors fall outside the scope of the AP's earlier
formulated research goal.
 
According to OLVG, the AP does not conclude in the investigation report that OLVG does not have an appropriate
has taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal data
in the electronic health record cannot be consulted by unauthorized employees. But the
AP finds that OLVG does not meet the requirement of at least two-factor authentication pursuant to
Article 32, first paragraph, preamble, of the GDPR. A two-factor authentication as the AP enters it prevents
according to OLVG, the behavior of the employees involved is not. With a two-factor authentication
all employees, including the working students, have a pass, token, or another second factor.
Having them does not mean that they would not be able to perform the conduct to which the
saw data breach notifications. These employees would also use two-factor authentication such as the AP that
have had the authorization they currently have.
 
Response AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. The AP has informed OLVG that the AP is investigating
whether OLVG's technical and organizational measures are 'appropriate' as referred to in Article 32 of the
GDPR, in order to ensure that personal data in the electronic health record are not
consulted by unauthorized employees. The AP has explicitly stated that the investigation
focuses on logical access security (authentication and authorization), logging, checking the
logging and awareness of employees.

The AP's conclusion that OLVG does not comply with Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR now that the requirements have not been met
the requirement of two-factor authentication is directly related to the research purpose and falls within the
scope of the research objective. After all, the AP mentions Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, the accompanying
appropriate guarantee and explicitly the logical access security (authentication and authorization) in its
research goal. In the context of the right of defence, it is irrelevant whether OLVG . employees
with or without two-factor authentication would have had the same authorization in practice.
 
The AP remarks unnecessarily that in its research goal it excludes the fact that personal data in the
electronic health record may not be accessed by unauthorized personnel if
mentioned guarantee. To minimize the risk of unauthorized access to patient data,
It is very important to establish the correct identity of the employee in advance. That two factor
authentication is not a measure that guarantees that unauthorized access to patient records by
employees no longer occurs, does not alter the fact that it is a measure that significantly
contributes to the prevention of unauthorized access and in this case is required under Article 32 of
the GDPR. In this context, the AP emphasizes that applying two-factor authentication and also checking
on the logging do not stand alone, but must be considered in conjunction with all others
appropriate measures. It is the combination of those measures that enables OLVG to
to control the protection of personal data as well as possible and to prevent infringements as much as possible
to prevent. Applying a two-factor authentication does not relieve OLVG of the obligation to
promote employee awareness of patient privacy protection.
 
3.4.3 Interpretation of Article 32 of the GDPR
OLVG takes the position that the GDPR does not allow Member States and therefore the national legislator to
offers to further flesh out the assessment against the standard of Article 32 of the GDPR by means of NEN-
standards. According to OLVG, the AP is therefore acting in violation of the AVG by stating that in the investigation report
to do. OLVG argues that only then can Member States go further than the regulation
given protection, and may only elaborate on this protection if this is explicitly stated in the
GDPR has been determined. According to OLVG, this is not the case. According to OLVG, the trade-offs between a
number of aspects as included in Article 32 of the GDPR not made by the AP, which is in conflict with
the principle of due care. Finally, in the opinion of OLVG, the NEN standards cannot provide a basis for
form for the implementation of Article 32 of the GDPR now that these standards are not mentioned by the GDPR
and have been created without being related to or based on the GDPR.
 
Response AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view in this either. OLVG points to the prohibition of further (binding)
to set rules in national regulations in the event that a European regulation applies and this
regulation does not explicitly allow this. However, such a situation does not arise in the present case. To the
In the opinion of the AP, Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the GDPR explicitly does offer the
possibility. This does not alter the fact that Article 32 of the GDPR has been applied in the specific case and
interpreted. The application and interpretation is - in view of the hair in Article 6, paragraph 3, of the UAVG
task assigned to monitor compliance with the GDPR - to the AP. That is what the AP
in the investigation report and what it is obliged to do.

When answering the question whether appropriate technical and organizational measures in the sense
of Article 32 of the GDPR, it is relevant what is included in the relevant NEN standards. This one
after all, standards are generally accepted security standards within the practice of the
information security in healthcare. The requirement of two-factor authentication contained in these NEN standards and the
obligation to regularly assess the log files, the AP considers a concrete interpretation of what if
'appropriate' can be considered within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR. That the NEN standards are not included in the AVG
mentioned and created without being related to or based on the GDPR
the AP deems irrelevant. After all, Article 32 of the GDPR provides a standard that addresses all
controllers in all segments of the market. Referring to paragraphs 3.3.2 and 3.3.3
has the AP assessed whether OLVG has taken sufficient appropriate security measures such as
referred to in Article 32 of the GDPR, "taking into account the state of the art and the implementation costs"
against the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. In making that decision, the AP has the presence
of generally accepted security standards such as the NEN standards also in consideration
taken and allowed to take.
 
In addition, OLVG itself has also indicated in its Information Security & Privacy Policy that
the aforementioned policy is based on the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely:
NEN 7510, NEN 7512 and NEN 7513 and current legislation and regulations, including the AVG.63 In its
Logging policy Epic indicates to OLVG that this document must lead to compliance with NEN7513 and
applicable laws and regulations.64 In short, the AP concludes from this that OLVG is also of the opinion that this
NEN standards give substance to the correct degree of information security and therefore act independently
has committed to comply with the above NEN standards.
 
3.4.4 Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers
In the investigation report of the AP, reference is made to Article 3, second paragraph, of the Decree
electronic data processing by healthcare providers (Begz). It states that a
healthcare provider in accordance with the provisions of NEN 7510 and NEN 7512, ensures a safe and
careful use of the healthcare information system and safe and careful use of the electronic
exchange system to which it is connected. OLVG states that the AP only pays a fine or an order
can impose a penalty to enforce the obligations imposed by the GDPR and not for a
violation of the Begz. The Begz was established on the basis of Article 26 Wbp and not on the basis of the
UAVG. Pursuant to Article 51 of the UAVG, the Wbp expired on 25 May 2018. This is also the basis
of the Begz will expire on that date.
 
Response AP
Finally, the AP does not follow OLVG's view in this regard either. As explained in the next chapter
explained, the AP has imposed an administrative fine for the violation of Article 32, first paragraph, of
the GDPR, more specifically with regard to authentication and regular checking of the log files.
Incidentally, the Begz does apply to the OLVG and, on the basis of the Begz, it is obliged to comply with the standards
NEN 7510 and NEN 7512.

4. Fine

4.1 Introduction
 
From May 25, 2018 to at least May 22, 2019, OLVG violated Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR
by failing to meet the requirement of two-factor authentication and regularly reviewing
log files.
 
The AP makes use of its authority to impose a fine on OLVG for the violation that has been established
pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, preamble and under i and Article 83, fourth paragraph, of the GDPR,
read in conjunction with article 14, paragraph 3, of the UAVG. The AP uses the
Fines Policy Rules 2019.65
 
After this, the AP will first briefly explain the penalty system, followed by the motivation of the
fine in the present case.
 
4.2 Fine policy rules of the Dutch Data Protection Authority 2019
 
Pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, preamble and under i and Article 83, fourth paragraph, of the GDPR, read in
in connection with Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG, the AP is authorized to grant OLVG in the event of a
violation of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, to impose an administrative fine of up to € 10,000,000 or,
for a company, up to 2% of total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if
figure is higher.
 
The AP has established fine policy rules regarding the interpretation of the aforementioned power to
imposing an administrative fine, including determining the amount thereof.
 
Pursuant to Article 2, under 2.1, of the Penalty Policy Rules, the provisions with regard to violation
of which the AP can impose an administrative fine of up to the amount of € 10,000,000 (or for
a company up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure
higher) classified in Annex 1 as Category I, Category II or Category III.
 
In Annex 1, Article 32 of the GDPR is classified in category II.
 
Pursuant to Article 2, under 2.3, the AP sets the basic fine for violations for which a statutory
maximum fine of € 10,000,000 or, for a company, up to 2% of the total worldwide
annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure is higher, […] fixed within the next
fine bandwidth:
Category II: Fine range between €120,000 and €500,000 and a basic fine of €310,000. […].

Pursuant to Article 6, the AP determines the amount of the fine by increasing the amount of the basic fine (up to
at most the maximum of the bandwidth of the fine category linked to a violation) or
down (to at least the minimum of that bandwidth).
 
Pursuant to Article 7, without prejudice to Articles 3:4 and 5:46 Awb, the AP takes into account the factors that
are derived from Article 83, second paragraph, of the GDPR and referred to in the Policy Rules under a to k.
 
4.3 Fine amount
 
4.3.1. Nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement
Pursuant to Article 7, opening words and under a, of the Fine Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the nature,
the seriousness and duration of the infringement. In its assessment, the AP takes into account, among other things, the nature, the
scope or purpose of the processing as well as the number of data subjects affected and the scope of the data
suffered damage to them.
 
Any processing of personal data must be done properly and lawfully. Personal data
must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of those
data. Also to prevent unauthorized access to or use of
personal data and the equipment used for the processing. The
The controller must therefore, pursuant to Article 32(1) of the GDPR, provide appropriate and
take technical and organizational measures to ensure a security level appropriate to the risk
to ensure. In determining the risk for the data subject, the nature of the
personal data and the nature of the processing of interest: these factors determine the potential damage
for the individual data subject in the event of, for example, loss, alteration or unlawful processing of the data
data. The AP has come to the conclusion that OLVG has not applied an appropriate security level
for the processing of personal data in its hospital information system.
 
The AP has established that, until at least May 22, 2019, OLVG will provide personal data without appropriate data
processed security. This personal data contains highly sensitive information from patients of
OLVG, such as a wide variety of health data. It is important that OLVG
processes personal data of hundreds of thousands of patients. This large group of stakeholders has
unnecessarily additional risk of, among other things, unauthorized access to their personal data. The fact that
the violation has continued in a structural manner for a longer period, partly under the Wbp
under which an appropriate level of security was already required, the AP considers serious. That it is also a
processing of particularly sensitive data, an insufficient security of the
personal data extra.
 
In view of the nature, seriousness, scope and duration of the infringement, the AP sees reason to increase the basic amount
of the fine pursuant to Article 7, opening words and under a, of the Fine Policy Rules to be increased by
€80,000 to €390,000.
 
4.3.2 Blame and negligent nature of the infringement
Pursuant to Article 5:46, second paragraph, of the Awb, when imposing an administrative fine, the AP
into account the extent to which this can be blamed on the offender. Now that this is a

violation, the imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with established case law does not require that
it is demonstrated that there is intent and the AP may presume culpability if it
offense is established. In addition, pursuant to Article 7, under b, of the Fine Policy Rules
2019 into account the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement.
 
OLVG is obliged under Article 32 of the GDPR to implement security measures that
are appropriate for the nature and scope of the processing operations carried out by OLVG. Now OLVG for longer
period no two-factor authentication and regular checking of the log files in her
organization, the AP is of the opinion that OLVG is in any case particularly negligent
failed to take such measures. OLVG is allowed, partly in view of the sensitive nature and
due to the large scope of the processing, it is expected that it complies with the standards that apply to it
identified and acted upon. The AP considers this culpable.
 
In addition, OLVG has indicated in its own Information Security & Privacy Policy that the aforementioned
policy is based on the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely: NEN 7510,
NEN 7512 and NEN 7513 and current legislation and regulations, including the AVG. OLVG strives for this
demonstrably complying with these standards. OLVG has further stipulated in its logging policy that for the
checking the log data takes a representative sample every four weeks for analysis. It
The AP considers that the fact that OLVG also does not comply with its own existing policy rules is very negligent. It had
located on the way of OLVG to implement the standards and the violation of article 32 of the
AVG as soon as possible, so that, among other things, the detection of unauthorized access to
patient data and taking measures in response to unauthorized access is guaranteed.
 
In view of the negligent nature of the infringement, the AP sees reason to adjust the basic amount of the fine on the basis of
of Article 7(b) of the 2019 Fine Policy Rules by €50,000 to €440,000.
 
4.3.3 Proportionality
Finally, pursuant to Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the Awb, the AP assesses whether the application of its policy for
determining the amount of the fine in view of the circumstances of the specific case, not to a
disproportionate outcome. The AP is of the opinion that, given the seriousness of the violation and the extent to which
in which this can be blamed on OLVG, the (height of) the fine is proportional.66 The AP does not see any
reason the amount of the fine on the basis of proportionality and the other in Article 7 of the
Fines Policy Rules mentioned circumstances, to the extent applicable in the present case, to
increase or decrease.
 
4.4 Conclusion
The AP sets the total fine at €440,000.
