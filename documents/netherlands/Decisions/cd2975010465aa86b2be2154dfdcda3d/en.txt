Dear Mr van den Bosch,
 
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has decided to impose an administrative fine on Stichting OLVG (OLVG).
of €440,000 because OLVG has not met the requirement of two-factor authentication
and reviewing log files regularly. OLVG therefore has insufficient suitable ones
measures taken as referred to in Article 32(1) of the General Regulation
Data Protection (GDPR).
 
The decision is explained in more detail below. Chapter 1 is an introduction and Chapter 2 describes it
legal framework. In chapter 3, the DPA assesses the processing responsibility and the violation.
The (amount of the) administrative fine is elaborated in chapter 4 and chapter 5 contains the operative part and
the remedies clause.

1 Introduction

1.1 Legal entities involved and reason for the investigation
 
OLVG is a foundation that has its registered office at Oosterpark 9, in Amsterdam. OLVG is registered in
the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 41199082. OLVG is a top clinical
teaching hospital in Amsterdam with two main locations in Amsterdam East and West. OLVG offers
medical care to approximately 500,000 patients annually. In 2018, OLVG had 5890 salaried employees,
of which 4274 in patient-related positions.1
 
The AP has received two data breach reports from the OLVG Foundation about access by employees and
working students in electronic patient records. As a result of these data breach reports, the AP
initiated an ex officio investigation into compliance by OLVG with Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR by
among other things, to investigate security aspects such as authentication and checking the logging.
 
1.2 Process flow
 
In a letter dated 17 April 2019, the AP announced the investigation and asked questions to OLVG. This
questions were answered by OLVG by letter dated 3 May 2019.
 
On May 22, 2019, five AP supervisors conducted an on-site investigation at OLVG, location
East, at Oosterpark 9 in Amsterdam. During this investigation, the hospital information system is up
various moments and parts demonstrated and viewed. There are also oral ones
statements taken from members of the Board of Directors and from various employees of OLVG.
 
The AP sent the report with findings to OLVG on February 10, 2020. By letter dated 17 February
In 2020, the AP sent OLVG an intention to enforce. Also with this letter
given the AP the opportunity, OLVG has written on March 27, 2020 and orally on June 25, 2020
expressed its views on this intention and the report on which it is based.

3. Assessment

3.1 Processing of personal data
 
OLVG has been using a new and integrated hospital information system since October 19, 2015
electronic patient files are stored.2 The data about patients that OLVG has in the
hospital information system is information that OLVG can use for natural persons
identify. These patient data are therefore personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of
the GDPR. Part of this data is health data and can therefore also be qualified as a
special category of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR.
 
Furthermore, there is a processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4, part 2, of the
AVG. Due to its scope, the concept of "processing" includes any possible operation or set of
processing of personal data. Capturing and viewing patient data in the
hospital information system is also included. It concerns an extensive processing involving a lot
people are involved. In 2018 alone, OLVG provided medical care to approximately 500,000 patients
granted.3
 
3.2 Controller
 
In the context of the question of whether OLVG acts in violation of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, it is also important
to determine who qualifies as a controller as referred to in Article 4(7),
of the GDPR. It is decisive who has the purpose of and the means for the processing
personal data - in this case the processing of patient data in the hospital information system
of the OLVG - notes. In order to answer this question, the AP attaches importance to the
statements from the board of OLVG during the on-site investigation, the registration in the
trade register of the Chamber of Commerce, policy documents and the annual accounts of OLVG
of 2015 and 2018.

The chairman of the Board of Directors of OLVG has stated that in 2013 there will be an administrative merger
took place between the Sint Lucas Andreas Hospital foundation and the Onze Lieve Vrouwen foundation
Gasthuis and that there has been one joint board ever since.4 Then these two hospitals are in June
Legally merged into one hospital in 2015, named: Stichting OLVG.5 Furthermore, during the merger in 2015,
the current hospital information system has been uniformly introduced within OLVG.6 This system is like
mentioned above, finally taken into use by OLVG on October 19, 2015.7
 
According to the registration in the Chamber of Commerce, OLVG's activities are 'general
hospitals, practices of medical specialists and medical day treatment centers, health centers and
outpatient youth care.”8 OLVG also mentions in its information security & privacy policy that the system
of security and privacy measures focuses, among other things, on securing all information and
information systems, preventing information security incidents and taking
precautionary measures. The information security & privacy policy applies to all
business units of the OLVG and on the exchange of data with other organisations.9 Also from the
'Regulation on patient data and use of means of communication' shows that OLVG has determined how
OLVG employees have to deal with electronic patient files.10
 
Based on the above-mentioned documents and statements from the board of OLVG, the AP concludes that
OLVG determines the purpose and means for the processing of personal data for the benefit of the
OLVG electronic patient files. This means that OLVG is the controller in the
meaning of Article 4, part 7, of the GDPR for the processing of patient data in the
OLVG hospital information system.
 
3.3 Data Security Violation
 
3.3.1 Introduction
To ensure security and prevent the processing of personal data from being infringed
to the GDPR, the controller must, pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR, provide the
assess inherent risks and take measures to mitigate risks. That
measures must ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the state

of the technique and the implementation costs compared to the risks and the nature of the protection
personal data.11 In the following, the AP assesses whether OLVG has an appropriate level of security
used for the processing of personal data in its hospital information system.
 
3.3.2 Two-factor authentication
 
3.3.2.1 Facts
The current hospital information system was taken into use by OLVG on 19 October 2015. During the day
the on-site investigation on May 22, 2019 at OLVG, supervisors of the AP investigated
how OLVG employees gain access to the electronic patient files (log in)
within the hospital information system. The AP notes that the authentication of the identity of the
employee to use the OLVG hospital information system in two ways
depending on whether access is requested from inside or outside the OLVG network.
 
During the on-site investigation12, the AP supervisors established that employees
of OLVG on a computer (terminal) within the OLVG network can log in to the virtual
workplace (VDI).13 Logging in is done by entering a user name and password and
no use is made of a staff pass or a token as part of the login process
to access the hospital information system. This way of logging in is different
moments during the investigation on site. The regulators of the AP have this
first observed during the demonstration of the hospital information system.14 This
this observation is also confirmed by the oral statements of [CONFIDENTIAL].15
 
In addition, the AP supervisors during workplace inspections of three different
employees16 of OLVG found that if the employee uses his/her user name and
enters the password correctly, he/she will have access to the VDI environment and to the electronic
patient records. It turned out that this involves a 'single sign on' functionality17, which means that the
employee who is logged in to the VDI also has immediate access to the hospital information system with
electronic patient records.
 
Furthermore, it is stated in Article 2.1. of the 'Regulation on patient data and use of means of communication'
that “OLVG employees, (…) insofar as this is necessary for the position they perform within OLVG, by means of
login code and password access [is] granted to the electronic patient record in Epic and similar
patient information systems within OLVG (hereinafter collectively referred to as “EPD”).”18

The second way to access the hospital information system is through a computer outside
the OLVG network. During the demonstration during the on-site investigation, the AP observed
that can also be logged into the VDI via a computer outside the OLVG network, for example when
employees work from home.19 In this case, the VDI environment must be logged in and the
hospital information system with a username and password20 in combination with a
changing token that is received or created by SMS or application.21
 
On March 9, 2020, OLVG linked a reader to every computer (terminal) and thus the
above method changed. As a result, an employee must present his/her personnel pass for this
reader and then enter a password before accessing the computer
obtained.22
 
3.3.2.2 Assessment
Pursuant to Article 32, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, the controller must take appropriate steps
take technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
to ensure. According to Article 32, second paragraph, of the GDPR, attention should be paid to the assessment of the risks
to be spent on risks that arise in the processing of personal data. As the
data is of a more sensitive nature, or the context in which it is used poses a greater threat
forms for the privacy of those involved, stricter requirements are imposed on the
data security.
 
OLVG processes personal data of approximately 500,000 patients in its hospital system on a large scale.
This (often) involves extremely sensitive health data. Health data is out
designated as a special category of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR.
These personal data which, by their nature, are particularly sensitive in terms of fundamental rights and
fundamental freedoms, deserve specific protection given the context of their processing
can pose significant risks to fundamental rights and freedoms. OLVG serves
therefore take appropriate measures to protect personal data as well as possible and
infringements as much as possible.
 
Given the sensitive nature of the data, the large scope of the processing by OLVG and the risks
OLVG had regard to the privacy of data subjects when accessing personal data
electronic patient records must implement two-factor authentication. The AP has in it
However, it has been established above that employees can access a computer within the OLVG network
could get to the data in electronic patient records with just something an employee
know (namely a username and password). That means that in that case it was used
of only one factor. The investigation has shown that OLVG did not make use of
a pass, token or other second factor. This means that OLVG does not meet the minimum requirement

two-factor authentication fulfilled, which in the context of this processing under Article 32 of the
AVG is required. The AP considers such a security measure, also given the current state of the
technique and implementation costs, appropriate. In doing so, the AP takes into account that general
accepted security standards, such as the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare,
prescribe two-factor authentication.
 
OLVG has further indicated in its Information Security & Privacy Policy that the aforementioned policy is
based on: 1) the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely: NEN 7510, NEN
7512 and NEN 7513 and 2) the current laws and regulations, including the AVG. OLVG strives for it
to demonstrably comply with these standards.23 OLVG has therefore also independently committed itself to
comply with the above NEN standards, which stipulate that the identity of users must
are established by means of two-factor authentication.24
 
Needless to say, the AP finally notes that specifically with regard to the wording 'appropriate
technical and organizational measures' - as included in article 32 AVG - there is a
continuation of what already applied under Directive 95/46/EC and the Personal Data Protection Act
(Wbp).25 There is no material change. Under those circumstances, it's obvious —
also with a view to legal certainty — to continue the interpretation followed in the past in the interpretation
of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR. This means that the interpretation already used in the past via the
requirements of two-factor authentication contained in the NEN standards and the regular assessment of the
log files are maintained.26 The AP has also always clearly communicated that the NEN 7510, as
generally accepted security standard within the practice of information security in healthcare,
remains an important standard for information security in healthcare under the AVG regime and this one
guidelines must be followed.27
 
Opinion OLVG and response AP
OLVG states in its view that the AP wrongly judges that OLVG does not use two-factor authentication
has applied. According to Norm 9.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017), health information systems that
process personal health information, identify users and this should be done
to be done through authentication involving at least two factors.
According to OLVG, access to PCs has been limited for years by access to the physical space
where the PC is. PCs are in rooms that can only be accessed with a
personal personnel card. The pass is configured in such a way that an employee can only

obliged to ensure the safe and careful use of electronic equipment in accordance with NEN 7510 and NEN 7512.
exchange systems and that logging complies with the provisions of NEN 7513.
25 Article 13 Wbp and Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46/EC already used the terminology 'appropriate and organizational measures'
to prevent loss or unlawful processing.
26 For example, it follows from the report 'access to digital patient files within healthcare institutions' of June 2013;

has access to areas and functions for which the employee is authorized. According to OLVG, there is none
difference in principle between access that is limited to the person who holds a pass in front of a reader who is
located at the PC.
 
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. For appropriate security of personal data
electronic patient files, it is necessary that the OLVG information system only contains a
two-factor authentication is accessible. If access to the room is charged with an authentication via
a personal pass but the computer itself not with a two-factor authentication, then the chances are greater
employees who are authorized for the room (such as cleaners) but not for the electronic
patient records, can access these records. In addition, certain parts of the
hospital, such as outpatient clinics, are not completely closed. So there is indeed an important difference with the
access restricted to the person holding a pass in front of a reader located at the computer.
Finally, the AP emphasizes that standard 9.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) uses the term 'health information systems'
contains. In other words, the information systems themselves must be secured with two-factor authentication.
 
In view of the foregoing, the DPA is of the opinion that OLVG will in any event until 22 May 2019 apply article 32, first paragraph,
of the GDPR, now that OLVG's hospital information system has not complied with it
requirement of two-factor authentication. OLVG has now terminated this violation by informing each
computer (terminal) to connect a reader. As a result, an employee must present his/her personnel card
in front of this reader and then enter a password before accessing the computer
be obtained.
 
3.3.3 Logging check
 
3.3.3.1 Facts
OLVG's Information Security & Privacy Policy states that OLVG is committed to it
demonstrable compliance with the standards NEN 7510 (information security in healthcare), NEN 7512
(based on trust for data exchange), NEN 7513 (logging actions on electronic
patient files) and the AVG.28 Moreover, OLVG indicates in the Logging policy Epic that this document
must lead to compliance with the NEN 7513 standard and applicable laws and regulations.29 In the Logging
Epic's policy is based on the principle that the log files are periodically checked for
indications of irregularities or errors so that they can be detected early where necessary
overcome.30 To this end, all activities of users, systems and
information security events recorded in log files.31 Of anomalous events
registered in the log data, a report is drawn up and, if necessary, further action is taken
research.32 The Logging policy Epic makes a distinction in the way in which the log data
are checked, namely on a random basis and on an incident basis.33

Based on Epic's Logging Policy, random checks must be carried out every four weeks
representative sample must be taken for analysis.34 The Logging procedure Epic shows this
a monthly report is obtained from the data warehouse of the number of break-the-glass
events.35 There will always be an average number of events.36 The EPD Service does random checks
control of the break-the-glass events and is free to determine what constitutes a representative one
sample.37 If there are major deviations for one or more users, further investigation is required
investigation into these deviations.38 The incidental check takes place when the
current events (from an incident or a request from a patient) give rise to this.39 Then the
necessary analyzes are performed. In this case, if there is a request from a patient,
the research question must come from Legal Affairs.40 Of anomalous events
reports are drawn up.41 The report shows what the notable events are
are and how or why these events stand out, and how they conflict with policy
and/or lawful access to a file.42
 
[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG stated during the on-site investigation that every action is
logged.43 [CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that with regard to checking the logging
a number of random checks and incidental checks have been carried out.44 For example, on 26 March 2018 a random check

[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that these two samples are the only two samples
have been carried out by OLVG in the period from 1 January 2018 to 22 May 2019.50
In addition, [CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG has stated that OLVG believes that a collection
of incidental checks also forms a sample, since it is examined in an aggregated manner
it often happens that there has been unauthorized access and what incidents this concerns.51 According to the
[CONFIDENTIAL] of OLVG, very few irregularities were found and formed
not a specific reason to schedule another sampling.52 [CONFIDENTIAL] stated that
there is not, as described in the logging policy, a random check every four weeks
takes place, but that in practice one looks at what gives rise to doing a
sample.53 The samples mentioned above are the only two samples that have been carried out.54 At the time
of the on-site investigation, an alarm at certain limit values was still being developed.55
 
In addition to these two random checks, OLVG also carried out incidental checks. OLVG has in the period
eight incident checks were carried out from January 2018 to April 2019.56 This concerns the requesting of
one electronic patient record at a time in response to a patient request.57
 
Following the opinion hearing of 25 June 2020, OLVG issued additional information on 13 July 2020
written documents, including a data query on all logging data, reports of
samples from different perspectives and reports resulting from the newly applied
selection method.
 
3.3.3.2 Assessment
It has already been explained in paragraph 3.3.2.2 that the controller under Article 32,
paragraph 1 of the GDPR must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the
risk-appropriate level of security.
 
The AP has determined that in the period from January 1, 2018 to April 17, 2019, OLVG, two broader
performed (sample) checks of break-the-glass behavior over larger groups of employees
and eight incidental checks of the logging of one electronic patient record. Furthermore, the AP
determined that in the period from 1 January 2018 to 22 May 2019 OLVG did not systematically
checks for notable deviations from all logging of all electronic health records
performed, nor applied systematic or automatic signaling when exceeding
certain limits in the logging involving all logging of all electronic health records
has been involved.

In its opinion, OLVG indicates that the protocol "procedure for checking the legality of file inspection"
has been updated and re-established on March 17, 2020. Since the
on-site investigation of the AP in May 2019 further tightened. As of July 1, 2019, OLVG has the frequency
of checking the logging has already been increased to once every two weeks (at least two or more
reports per month). This check includes a (biweekly) data query on all logging data.
In the period from July 2019 to November 2019 there are reports based on logging data
made from different perspectives. From these different perspectives is in this period
reported several times about the logging behavior. The different perspectives have also been used
to determine where the risk of unauthorized access is greatest. It started in May 2020
with a new selection method. All contacts are assigned a score with a higher score
means more chance of unauthorized access. As of June 2020, at least every two weeks
made a printout of 50 views with the highest point score on a random day, which was assessed
and subsequently further investigated if there is a suspicion of unlawfulness. In addition to the
random check, an ad hoc logging check takes place if the topicality (from solving
of incidents or from a patient's request) gives rise to this. OLVG believes that
this complies with standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017).
 
As mentioned above, the DPA has established that in the period from 1 January 2018 to 17
April 2019, two spot checks and eight incidental checks of the logging of one electronic
patient file. OLVG therefore has at least during the aforementioned period
not in accordance with its own policies (including the Information Security & Privacy Policy and Logging Policy
Epic) acted. Aside from that, it's only doing eight incidental checks and two proactive ones
samples in a period of 15.5 months amply and clearly insufficient to be able to
speak of an appropriate security level that pertains to signaling unauthorized access to
patient data and taking measures in response to unauthorized access. In doing so, the
AP matters the scale of the hospital's processing of health data, the sensitive
nature of the data and the risks to the privacy of those involved.
 
OLVG processes (special categories of) personal data on a large scale and (mostly) this involves
highly sensitive health data. Therefore, stricter requirements are imposed on the
security of this data. Given the sensitive nature of the data, the large size of the
processing and the risks to the privacy of those involved, OLVG therefore had the
check log data regularly. In this way, unauthorized access can be signaled and
take action. The starting point of the AP is that monitoring of the logging is systematic and
must take place consistently, with a random check and/or check based on
complaints is not enough. 58 The fine-meshed nature of the authorization model used and the control of the
the correctness of the authorizations partly determines the intensity of the monitoring of the logging. At one
random random checks, there is no question of a system aimed at unlawful
use and risks. As a result, OLVG does not meet the requirement of regular assessments
log files are met, which is in the context of this processing under Article 32 of the GDPR
required. The AP considers such a control measure, also in view of the current state of the art and the

implementation costs, appropriate. In doing so, the AP takes into account that generally accepted
security standards, such as the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, on a regular basis
prescribe logging.
 
Finally, as in section 3.3.2.2. already appointed, also independently committed to
comply with NEN standards. Section 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 states that log files of
events that include user activities, exceptions, and information security events
record, should be made, kept and regularly reviewed.
 
In view of the foregoing, the DPA is of the opinion that OLVG will in any event until 22 May 2019 apply article 32, first paragraph,
of the GDPR because OLVG has not regularly reviewed log files. OLVG has
meanwhile this violation has been terminated by the procedure with regard to the control of the logging
tightened and increased the frequency of checking the logging.
 
3.4 Other view OLVG and response AP
 
3.4.1 Rights of the Defense
OLVG argues that the imposition of a fine for the conduct established by the AP is in violation of
the nemo-tenetur principle59 as laid down in Article 48(1) of the European Charter and Article
6, paragraph 1, of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), since the
findings are based on data breach reports that OLVG was obliged to make under threat
of a sanction. Referring to various case law, OLVG states that if during a
procedure there is (the reasonable expectation) of a criminal charge, at least when this is not possible
It is excluded that the material will also be related to a criminal charge against the provider
used, the nemo-tenetur principle precludes it from being obtained in the procedure
volitional material is used for an administrative punishment through
fine.60
 
The fact that OLVG, pursuant to the Electronic Data Processing by Healthcare Providers Decree and the
NEN standards contained therein, it is required to keep certain log files which allow the supervision of the
makes compliance with the GDPR possible, does not mean that there is independence of will, according to OLVG
evidence. Pursuant to article 33, first paragraph, of the GDPR, OLVG has on September 13, 2018 and on
February 15, 2019, a report of a data breach was submitted to the AP. These data breach reports concern according to
OLVG information that does not exist apart from the will of OLVG: OLVG has compiled the information to
comply with the obligation of Article 33, first paragraph, of the GDPR. Referring again to several
court rulings, OLVG argues that voluntary information may not be used for a
administrative punishment by means of a fine.61 In response to the two
data breach reports initiated an investigation in the context of which the investigation took place on May 22, 2019

occurred. According to OLVG, it is therefore clear that the entire investigation of the AP is based
to the notifications made by OLVG on the basis of the GDPR.
 
In a letter dated 17 April 2019, the AP furthermore, pursuant to Sections 5:16 and 5:17 of the General Act
administrative law (Awb) requested information. In this letter, the AP did not point out that OLVG does not
is obliged to provide information if this would prove a violation of the GDPR
to deliver. According to OLVG, this means that all information that the AP has obtained with its request
for information, was obtained under duress as referred to in Article 6, paragraph 1, ECHR and Article 48, paragraph 1
member of the Charter. OLVG concludes that, in view of the foregoing, voluntary information that
obtained under duress from OLVG cannot be used for imposing an administrative sanction
fine.
 
Reply AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. The AP is of the opinion that the evidence it has obtained is not in
contrary to Article 48, first paragraph, of the European Charter and Article 6, first paragraph, ECHR and the
closed nemo-tenetur principle is obtained. Nor should evidence be excluded. AP motivates
that as follows.
 
First of all, the AP will address the two data breach reports. As OLVG itself indicates, the two are reported
data leaks have only been a reason for the AP to start an official investigation into the
compliance with Article 32 of the GDPR by OLVG. The two data breach reports are in the file
with the documents relating to the case, but they do not constitute evidence in any way
of the violation of Article 32 of the AVG found by the AP. exclusion of those
data breach reports as evidence is therefore not an issue. Separately, the AP considers the
data breach notification as independent information. In view of Article 33 paragraph 5 of the AVG, OLVG is obliged
all personal data breaches, including the facts surrounding the breach
in connection with personal data, the consequences thereof and the corrective measures taken
document, so that it is deemed to have had this information.62
 
Secondly, the DPA does not follow OLVG in its statement that the DPA with its information request of 17 April 2019
OLVG has forced it to provide information to the AP and therefore not to use that information
may be subject to an administrative fine. It is first of all relevant to determine this
that the AP requested information in that letter. There is no formal information 'advanced' under it
reference to the obligation to cooperate, as follows, for example, from Article 5:20 of the Awb and/or
Article 31 of the GDPR. That the relevant letter refers to article 58, first paragraph under a, GDPR and
article 5:16 yo. 5:17 Awb doesn't change this. These references are for information purposes only for OLVG
included the letter in order to make it clear that the AP (and its employees) OLVG to that
may request information and on what basis they may do so. From providing information under
In the opinion of the AP there is therefore no question of coercion.
 
In addition, if and insofar as exclusion of evidence would (yet) be at issue, such exclusion according to
settled case law applies only to evidence the existence of which depends on the will of the person

provider (will dependent material). This does not apply to evidence that exists independently of
the will of the provider (independent material). The AP has from OLVG in response to it
information request from the AP dated May 3, 2019 both voluntary material (statements and
explanations prepared for the AP) as independent material. It
Independent material consists of documents that already existed in a physical sense at OLVG, such as the
logging policy dated 29 September 2016 and reports of samples dated 13 March 2019 resp. March 26
2018. The AP subsequently did not use the voluntary material to determine the
violation and the imposition of an administrative fine. The violation is, however, independent of will
material, partly based on volitional material that was later provided by OLVG employees
after they have been made aware of the right to remain silent by means of the caution. Evidence exclusion is at the discretion
of the AP is therefore not relevant for that reason.
 
On the basis of the above, the AP concludes that a fine should be imposed for the identified
conduct is not in conflict with the nemo-tenetur principle as laid down in Article 48(1) of
the European Charter and Article 6, paragraph 1, ECHR.
 
3.4.2 Research purpose
OLVG argues that the imposition of a fine for the
conduct, at least with regard to authentication, is contrary to the rights of the defence
as laid down in Article 48(2) of the European Charter and Article 6(2) ECHR,
since the established behaviors fall outside the scope of the AP previously
formulated research goal.
 
According to OLVG, the AP does not conclude in the investigation report that OLVG is not suitable
has taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal data
in the electronic patient record are not consulted by unauthorized employees. But the
AP finds that OLVG does not meet the requirement of at least two-factor authentication pursuant to
Article 32, first paragraph, opening words, of the GDPR. Prevents a two-factor authentication as the AP fills it in
according to OLVG, the behavior of the employees involved is not. With a two-factor authentication
all employees, including the working students, have a pass, token, or another second factor.
Having them does not mean that they would not be able to perform the behaviors to which the
saw data breach notifications. These employees would also use a two-factor authentication such as the AP
fills in have had the authorization they currently have.
 
Reply AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view. The AP has informed OLVG that the AP is investigating
whether OLVG's technical and organizational measures are 'appropriate' as referred to in Article 32 of the
AVG, in order to ensure that personal data in the electronic health record is not
consulted by unauthorized personnel. The AP has explicitly mentioned that the investigation
focuses on logical access security (authentication and authorization), logging, control of the
logging and employee awareness.

The AP's conclusion that OLVG does not comply with Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, now that the
the requirement of two-factor authentication is directly related to the research objective and falls within the
scope of the research objective. After all, the AP mentions Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, as the
associated guarantee and explicitly the logical access security (authentication and authorization) in it
research purpose. In the context of the right of defense it is irrelevant whether employees of OLVG
with or without two-factor authentication would have had the same authorization in practice.
 
The AP notes unnecessarily that in its research objective it recognizes the fact that personal data in the
electronic health records should not be accessed by unauthorized employees
warranty mentioned. To minimize the risk of unauthorized access to patient data
It is very important to establish the correct identity of the employee in advance. That two factor
authentication is not a measure that guarantees that unauthorized access to patient records by
employees no longer occurs, does not alter the fact that it is a measure that is important
contributes to the prevention of unauthorized access and in this case is required under Article 32 of
the GDPR. In this context, the AP emphasizes that applying two-factor authentication and also control
on the logging does not stand alone, but should be viewed in conjunction with all others
appropriate measures. It is the combination of these measures that enables OLVG to
to manage the protection of personal data as well as possible and to prevent infringements as much as possible
prevent. Applying a two-factor authentication does not release OLVG from the obligation to
promote awareness among employees about patient privacy protection.
 
3.4.3 Implementation of Article 32 of the GDPR
OLVG takes the position that the GDPR does not allow member states and therefore the national legislator any scope
offers to further detail the assessment against the standard of Article 32 of the GDPR by means of NEN-
standards. According to OLVG, the AP therefore acts in violation of the GDPR because of that in the research report
do. OLVG argues that Member States can only go further than the regulation
given protection, and may only further specify this protection if this is explicitly stated in the
GDPR has been determined. According to OLVG, this is not the case. According to OLVG, the trade-offs between a
number of aspects as included in article 32 of the AVG not made by the AP, which is in conflict with
the due diligence principle. Finally, in the opinion of OLVG, the NEN standards cannot be used as a basis
form for the interpretation of Article 32 of the GDPR, now that these standards are not mentioned by the GDPR
and have been created without being related to or based on the GDPR.
 
Reply AP
The AP does not follow OLVG's view in this either. OLVG refers to the prohibition on further (binding)
to set rules in national regulations in case a European regulation applies and this one
regulation does not explicitly allow this. However, such a situation does not arise in the present case. To the
In the opinion of the AP, Article 6, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the GDPR expressly offers the right to do so
possibility. This does not alter the fact that Article 32 of the GDPR has been applied in the specific case and
interpreted. The application and interpretation is - in view of the hair in Article 6, third paragraph, of the UAVG
task assigned to monitor compliance with the GDPR - to the AP. That is what the AP
has done in the research report and what it is obliged to do.

In answering the question of whether there are appropriate technical and organizational measures in place
of Article 32 of the GDPR, it is relevant what is included in the relevant NEN standards. This
after all, standards are generally accepted security standards within the practice of the
information security in healthcare. The requirement of two-factor authentication contained in these NEN standards and the
obligation to regularly assess the log files, the AP considers a concrete interpretation of what if
'appropriate' can be considered within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR. That the NEN standards are not in the GDPR
are mentioned and have been established without being related to or based on the GDPR
the AP deems irrelevant. After all, Article 32 of the GDPR provides a standard that is aimed at all
controllers in all segments of the market. Referring to sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3
the DPA has assessed whether OLVG has taken sufficient appropriate security measures such as
referred to in Article 32 of the GDPR, 'deducted taking into account the state of the art and the implementation costs
against the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected”. The AP has the presence in that consideration
of generally accepted security standards such as the NEN standards
taken and allowed to take.
 
Moreover, OLVG itself has also indicated that in its Information Security & Privacy Policy
the aforementioned policy is based on the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely:
NEN 7510, NEN 7512 and NEN 7513 and current legislation and regulations, including the GDPR.63 In its
Logging policy Epic indicates to OLVG that this document must lead to compliance with NEN7513 and
applicable laws and regulations.64 In short, the AP deduces from this that OLVG is also of the opinion that these
NEN standards give substance to the correct degree of information security and therefore act independently
has committed to comply with the above NEN standards.
 
3.4.4 Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers
The AP's investigation report refers to Article 3(2) of the Decree
electronic data processing by healthcare providers (Begz). It states that a
care provider, in accordance with the provisions of NEN 7510 and NEN 7512, ensures a safe and
careful use of the healthcare information system and safe and careful use of the electronic system
exchange system to which it is connected. OLVG states that the AP only imposes a fine or burden
can impose a penalty to enforce the obligations imposed in the GDPR and not for a
violation of the Begz. The Begz has been established on the basis of Article 26 of the Wbp and not on the basis of the
UAVG. Pursuant to Article 51 UAVG, the Wbp lapsed on 25 May 2018. That is also the basis
of the Begz with effect from that date.
 
Reply AP
Finally, the AP does not follow OLVG's view in this regard either. As will be in the next chapter
explained, the AP has imposed an administrative fine for the violation of Article 32, paragraph 1 of
the GDPR, more specifically with regard to authentication and regular checking of the log files.
Incidentally, the Begz does apply to the OLVG and the standards are mandatory on the basis of the Begz
NEN 7510 and NEN 7512.

4. Fine

4.1 Introduction
 
From May 25, 2018 to at least May 22, 2019, OLVG violated Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR
by not meeting the requirement of two-factor authentication and regularly reviewing
log files.
 
The AP uses its authority to impose a fine on OLVG for the established violation
to be imposed on the basis of Article 58, second paragraph, opening lines and under i and Article 83, fourth paragraph, of the GDPR,
read in conjunction with Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG. The AP uses the
Fining Policy Rules 2019.65
 
After this, the AP will first briefly explain the fine system, followed by the reasons for the fine
fine in this case.
 
4.2 Penalty Policy Rules of the Dutch Data Protection Authority 2019
 
Pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, opening words and under i and Article 83, fourth paragraph, of the GDPR, read in
connection with Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG, the AP is authorized to inform OLVG in the event of a
to impose an administrative fine of up to € 10,000,000 in violation of article 32, first paragraph, of the AVG or,
for a company, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this
figure is higher.
 
The AP has established Fining Policy Rules regarding the implementation of the aforementioned power to
imposing an administrative fine, including determining the amount thereof.
 
Pursuant to Article 2, under 2.1, of the Fining Policy Rules, the provisions regarding violation
of which the AP can impose an administrative fine not exceeding € 10,000,000 (or for
a company up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure
is higher) classified in Annex 1 as Category I, Category II or Category III.
 
In Annex 1, Article 32 of the GDPR is classified in category II.
 
Pursuant to Article 2, under 2.3, the AP sets the basic fine for violations for which a legal
maximum fine of € 10,000,000 or, for a company, up to 2% of the total worldwide
annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure is higher, [...] fixed within the next
fine bandwidth:
Category II: Fine range between €120,000 and €500,000 and a basic fine of €310,000. […].

Pursuant to Article 6, the AP determines the amount of the fine by increasing the amount of the basic fine (to
at most the maximum of the bandwidth of the fine category linked to a violation) or
down (to at least the minimum of that bandwidth).
 
Pursuant to Article 7, without prejudice to Articles 3:4 and 5:46 Awb, the AP takes into account the factors that
are derived from article 83, second paragraph, of the AVG and in the Policy Rules referred to under a to k.
 
4.3 Fine amount
 
4.3.1. Nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement
Pursuant to Article 7, preamble and under a, of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the nature,
the seriousness and duration of the infringement. In assessing this, the AP takes into account, among other things, the nature, the
scope or purpose of the processing as well as the number of data subjects affected and the scope of the processing
damage suffered to them.
 
Any processing of personal data must be done properly and lawfully. Personal data
must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of that
guarantees data. Also to prevent unauthorized access to or use of
personal data and the equipment used for the processing. The
The controller must therefore provide appropriate and
take technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
to ensure. In determining the risk for the data subject, the nature of the
personal data and the nature of the processing are important: these factors determine the potential damage
for the individual data subject in the event of, for example, loss, alteration or unlawful processing of the
facts. The AP has come to the conclusion that OLVG has not applied an appropriate security level
for the processing of personal data in its hospital information system.
 
The AP has determined that OLVG will process personal data without appropriate data until at least 22 May 2019
processed security. This personal data contains highly sensitive patient information
OLVG, such as a wide variety of health data. It is important that OLVG
processes personal data of hundreds of thousands of patients. This large group of stakeholders has
unnecessary additional risk of, among other things, unauthorized access to their personal data. The fact that
the violation has continued in a structural manner for a longer period, also under the Wbp
under which an appropriate security level was already required, the AP considers serious. That it is also one
processing of particularly sensitive data makes insufficient security of the
personal data extra blame.
 
In view of the nature, seriousness, scope and duration of the infringement, the DPA sees reason to set the basic amount
of the fine pursuant to Article 7, preamble and under a, of the Fining Policy Rules to be increased by
€80,000 to €390,000.
 
4.3.2 Culpability and negligent nature of the breach
Pursuant to Section 5:46(2) of the Awb, when imposing an administrative fine, the AP
take into account the extent to which this can be attributed to the offender. Now that this is one

violation, it is not required for the imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with established case law
it is demonstrated that there is intent and the AP may assume culpability if the
perpetrator is established. In addition, the AP, pursuant to Article 7, under b, of the Fining Policy Rules
2019 take into account the willful or negligent nature of the breach.
 
OLVG is required by Article 32 of the GDPR to implement security measures that
are appropriate for the nature and scope of the processing operations that OLVG carries out. Now OLVG for longer
period no two-factor authentication and regularly checking the log files in her
organization has implemented, the AP is of the opinion that OLVG is in any case particularly negligent
in not taking such measures. Partly in view of the sensitive nature, OLVG is allowed
the large volume of processing, however, it is expected that it adheres to the applicable standards
ascertained and acted accordingly. The AP considers this culpable.
 
In addition, OLVG has indicated the aforementioned in its own Information Security & Privacy Policy
policy is based on the Dutch standard for information security in healthcare, namely: NEN 7510,
NEN 7512 and NEN 7513 and current laws and regulations, including the GDPR. OLVG strives for this
demonstrable compliance with these standards. OLVG has also stipulated in its logging policy that it is responsible for the
control of the log data takes a representative sample to analyze every four weeks. It
The fact that OLVG therefore also does not comply with its own existing policy rules is considered very negligent by the AP. It had
on the way of OLVG to implement the standards and the violation of Article 32 of the
AVG as soon as possible, so that, among other things, to signal unauthorized access to
patient data and taking measures in response to unauthorized access is guaranteed.
 
In view of the negligent nature of the infringement, the AP sees reason to base the basic amount of the fine
of article 7, under b, of the Fining Policy Rules 2019 to be increased by €50,000 to €440,000.
 
4.3.3 Proportionality
Finally, pursuant to Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the Awb, the AP assesses whether the application of its policy for
determining the amount of the fine in view of the circumstances of the specific case, not one
disproportionate outcome. The AP is of the opinion that, given the seriousness of the violation and the extent
in which this can be blamed on OLVG, the (amount of) the fine is proportionate.66 The AP sees no
cause the amount of the fine on the basis of proportionality and the other in Article 7 of the
Penalty Policy Rules mentioned circumstances, insofar as applicable in the present case, te
increase or decrease.
 
4.4 Conclusion
The AP sets the total fine amount at €440,000.
