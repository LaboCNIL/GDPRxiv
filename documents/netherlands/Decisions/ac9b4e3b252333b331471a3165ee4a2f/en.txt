Dear [CONFIDENTIAL],
 
By decision of 18 June 2019 [CONFIDENTIAL], the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP), insofar as

a grace period of 15 weeks. The beneficiary period ran until October 2, 2019.
 
On October 17, 2019, an on-site investigation (OTP) took place at the office of
Haga Hospital in The Hague to check whether Haga Hospital has complied with the order subject to periodic penalty payments.
A report has been made of the OTP that has been sent in draft form to Haga Hospital by email on October 21, 2019.
submitted for comment. In a letter dated October 28, 2019, Haga Hospital responded to the
concept report. This response has been incorporated into the final report of the OTP, which is attached.
 
The AP concludes that at the time of the on-site investigation of October 17, 2019 Haga Hospital on the
load met. It should be noted that the checking process with [CONFIDENTIAL] is dynamic
and subject to change. The business rules that are used in combination with [CONFIDENTIAL].

improvement cycle.
 
The AP emphasizes that the conclusion of the OTP does not mean that the order subject to periodic penalty payments has been lifted. The
AP can re-investigate in the (near) future whether the order subject to periodic penalty payments by Haga Hospital
is/will be complied with.
