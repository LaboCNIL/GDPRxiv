9. On November 11, 2020, TikTok Inc., TikTok UK and TikTok Technology Limited (hereinafter: TikTok
Ireland) submitted a written opinion. TikTok6 has the aforementioned view in that view
the results and conclusions of the investigation report. In addition, TikTok has this
argued that as of 29 July 2020 it has a principal place of business in Ireland as referred to in Article 4 under 16
of the GDPR and the AP is therefore not authorized to take enforcement action against TikTok.

explained his point of view orally.

 

11. TikTok also announced in its written opinion and during the opinion hearing to

unless these account holders allow other users to follow them. TikTok carries this one
change for both existing users and new users under the age of 16.
- the "Suggest your account to others" feature is disabled by default for both existing ones
as new users under the age of 16.
- the ability to comment on videos will be extended to all existing and new users
16 years defaults to 'Friends'. The "Everyone" option will be for these users
switched off.
- the functions 'Duet' and 'Stitch' are no longer available for users under the age of 16.
- Downloads are only allowed for videos made by users over the age of 16
and older.
- the Family Pairing feature has been expanded with an option that also allows parents privacy
manage children's settings.

her statement that TikTok Ireland qualifies as head office from June 29, 2020

13. Article 55(1) of the GDPR stipulates that each supervisory authority has the competence to

territory of its Member State to carry out the tasks assigned to it in accordance with this Regulation
and to exercise the powers conferred on it by this Regulation
promised. However, Article 56(1) of the GDPR stipulates that the supervisory authority of the
headquarters or the sole establishment of the controller or processor is competent
to act as lead supervisory authority for cross-border processing by
that controller or processor in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 60 of the
AVG.
 

14. Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR defines the concept of principal place of business as follows: “with regard to

a controller that has establishments in more than one Member State, the place where its central
administration is located in the Union, unless the decisions on the objectives and means of the
processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller
who is also located in the Union and who is also authorized to implement those decisions, in which case the
establishment where those decisions are made is regarded as the principal establishment”

 

15. In the Guidelines for determining the lead supervisory authority8 (Guidelines

competence) it is stated on page 7 that recital 36 of the GDPR can help to clarify
of the main factor that will be used in determining the principal place of business if it
criterion of the central administration does not apply. Recital 36 of the GDPR states: “Which
establishment is the main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined on the basis
of objective criteria, such as the effective and actual implementation of management activities, with a view to the
making the core decisions about the purposes of and means of processing via permanent
proportions."

 

16. Opinion 8/2019 on the competence of the supervisory authority in the event of a change
in the circumstances of principal establishment or sole establishment9 discusses which
supervisory authority is competent in the event of a change in circumstances in relation
to headquarters during ongoing investigations. This Advice is now relevant in the present case
TikTok states that there is a change in circumstances.10

 

17. Opinion 8/2019 states, in summary, that in the event of continuous infringements, the jurisdiction can

transfer to another supervisory authority until the lead supervisory authority
has made a decision. Advice 8/2019 stipulates that the relocation of a head office from
a third country to the EU offers the possibility during the procedure
controllers to use the “one-stop shop” scheme. 11

18. A change of the guard in the lead supervisory authorities does not mean that the

original lead supervisory authority had no power to act. The
acts performed by this old lead supervisory authority and the hereby obtained
information and evidence remain valid and may be changed by the new lead supervisory authority
used.12 In addition, Opinion 8/2019 underlines that the cooperation procedure referred to in
Article 60 of the GDPR applies in case of a change of lead supervisory authority
authority. This means that the old (leading) supervisory authority on the basis of the Article
60 of the GDPR remains involved in the establishment of a final
decision.13

 

19. In addition, Advice 8/2019 points out that forum shopping must be prevented and that it is therefore

it is up to the controller to demonstrate that the relocation of the main establishment
has actually taken place. The concept of the headquarters in itself indicates that a
temporary or mere bureaucratic step by the company is not enough to establish the headquarters
point, but that it is a real step with a long-term goal. It's on the
supervisory authorities to determine whether the criteria are met, in order to mitigate the risk
reduce data controllers from artificially changing their headquarters with the
with a view to changing the authority competent to deal with the case.14

 

View TikTok

 
20. TikTok states in its written opinion that the processing responsibility was transferred on July 29, 2020

transferred from TikTok Inc. to TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK and that TikTok Ireland qualifies
as a principal place of business in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR. 15 TikTok takes the stand
that as a result, the authority to investigate TikTok from July 29, 2020 with the Irish SA
lies and not with the AP. TikTok bases this on Advice 8/2019.

 

21. TikTok further states that the AP finds in the investigation report that TikTok does not yet have

shown that TikTok Ireland qualifies as a main establishment, but no evidence forward either
means that the AP itself is authorized to act. TikTok states in its written opinion that the
AP only refers to the correspondence between TikTok and the Irish SA and in particular to the letter from
August 13, 2020 from Irish SA to TikTok.

 

22. TikTok also notes in its written opinion that the AP does not make any

has taken into account the extensive answer that TikTok has on September 30, 2020
sent to the Irish SA. According to TikTok, this answer contains additional, detailed and strong
proof that TikTok's headquarters is in Ireland as of July 29, 2020.

                                                                        
12 See marginal number 21 of Advice 8/2019.
13 See marginal number 24 of Advice 8/2019.
14 See marginal number 26 of Advice 8/2019.
15 TikTok has indicated by letter to the Irish SA on September 30, 2020 that its Irish headquarters is based on the fact that
this location makes decisions and implements them, and not because this location should be designated as a place where
its central administration is located in the Union.

23. TikTok concludes in its written opinion that TikTok, taking into account all

correspondence with the Irish SA, has sufficiently shown that TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK
can be regarded as joint controller and TikTok Ireland as well
as the main establishment in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR from July 29, 2020. TikTok
states that the AP is not authorized and states that on the basis of the AVG and Advice 08/2019 the current
cases/proceedings should be transferred to the Irish SA.

 

Considerations AP

 
24. First of all, the AP notes that TikTok did not have a main office at the start of the investigation

was established in the EU in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16. During that period, TikTok Inc. if
controller designated TikTok UK as its representative in accordance with
Article 27 of the GDPR. Article 56(1) of the GDPR was therefore not applicable at the start of
the investigation and therefore the DPA was authorized on the basis of Article 55, paragraph 1 of the GDPR.

 

25. As described above, TikTok states that this situation has changed on July 29, 2020. TikTok poses
that it has established itself with a head office in Ireland and from that moment on therefore does not have the
AP but the Irish SA has jurisdiction. Below, the question of whether TikTok has
demonstrated that it is established in Ireland with a head office. Then the consequences
described with regard to the authority of the AP to act as a lead supervisory authority
authority to act.

 

Headquarters

 

26. It appears from marginal numbers 13 to 18 of this decision that TikTok must demonstrate that there is

an actual headquarters created with a long-term goal. The head office
must effectively and effectively carry out its management activities, with a view to taking
the core decisions about the purposes of and the means of processing through permanent
proportions. This should not involve a temporary or purely bureaucratic step or the
artificially changing the main place of business for the purpose of handling the case
competent authority.

 

27. As stated in the investigation report, the AP was of the opinion that TikTok with the information it provided

information up to and including August 7, 2020 had not sufficiently demonstrated that TikTok was a
headquartered in Ireland. In that context, the Irish SA has, by letter dated 13 August 2020
a large number of additional questions asked to TikTok to get more clarity on
different aspects.16

 

28. TikTok provided additional information to Irish SA on September 30, 2020 in response to
aforementioned letter of August 13, 2020. The AP has received some of this additional information via the

Irish SA received on October 7, 2020. For another part, the Irish SA had no permission
received from TikTok to provide this information to other supervisory authorities
(including the AP) without first submitting this to her in connection with TikTok's view
highly confidential nature of this part of the documents submitted to the Irish SA. The
AP has still requested TikTok to provide these company-sensitive documents to the AP. At 25
January 2021, TikTok handed over all documents to the AP.

 
29. With the information provided on October 7, 2020 and January 25, 2021, TikTok has shown that
there is an actual head office in Ireland with a long-term goal. To this end
the AP considers the following.

 

30. One of the most important findings of the AP in August 2020 was that although TikTok is

paper stated that her office in Ireland made decisions and had the authority to enforce them
decisions to be implemented within the EU, but that there were still many uncertainties
on many related topics. Moreover, it was not possible from the submitted material
it can be concluded that there were stable and sustainable agreements within the group and that
the Irish branch would have sufficient and competent people and resources to fulfill its role as
headquarters properly. In August 2020, it could not be ruled out that TikTok
one had only taken a bureaucratic, artificial step with the aim of treating the
competent authority for this case (forum shopping).

 

31. From the minutes submitted by TikTok on January 25, 2021 of the board of the Irish branch of
TikTok shows the changes within the TikTok concern with regard to shifting
the processing responsibility for EU data subjects and the creation of a head office in
Ireland arise from a long-running project. In the period from, in particular, the end of May 2020
various concrete initiatives have been launched in this context and decisions have been taken to improve the organisation
prepare for the new structure. This is evident from these minutes of the board of the Irish branch
is actually aimed at a permanent transition and that in this context the above
necessary decisions are taken.

 

32. In addition, minutes of the Data Protection Steering Committee (DPSC)17 show that this

decision-making body from July 29, 2020 actually discusses important matters with regard to
to data protection and make decisions in this regard. These are things that directly affect you
the protection of children. It also appears from various documents submitted that the Irish
establishment is actually responsible for the implementation of decisions taken and
is responsible for the execution of some central processes such as assessing
requests from data subjects and investigating and reporting data breaches.

 

                                                                        
17 According to the agreements previously submitted by TikTok (intra-group), this decision-making consultation was set up by the
joint controllers to discuss and discuss important data processing issues
to take decisions.

33. In addition, the overviews submitted by TikTok show that TikTok Ireland has a large number
recruited (hundreds of) employees in the spring and summer of 2020. Precisely on this point
doubts existed now that the Irish branch in Ireland had few employees at the beginning of 2020. The
AP had doubts about whether it would be able to deliver on a large scale in times of a pandemic
hiring quality staff. Sufficient and high-quality personnel is for one
after all, a large platform such as TikTok is essential to actually function as
Headquarters. Despite applicable COVID restrictions, TikTok is Ireland according to this submission
overviews proved to be able to recruit a large number of permanent and competent employees
Pull. As a result, the AP believes that the site in Ireland has sufficient manpower
to be able to effectively fulfill its task as head office.

 

34. With these additional documents in combination with those previously provided in writing

agreements between legal entities within the TikTok group, the AP notes that there is one
is headquartered in Ireland and that there is not just a bureaucratic and
artificial step with the sole purpose of violating the competence of the lead supervisory authority
change (forum shopping).

 

35. Based on the foregoing, the AP establishes that TikTok has demonstrated that it is dealing with a

36. It follows from Advice 8/2019 that the competence to act as a lead supervisory authority

44. With regard to the violation of Article 12(1) of the GDPR described in the investigation report

in the period from May 25, 2018 up to and including July 28, 2020, the AP determines that there is a
violation that ended before July 29, 2020. This violation therefore falls outside the scope of

4. Facts

54. This chapter lists the facts relevant to the decision. First, in paragraph 4.1 a

outline description are given of the TikTok app. Section 4.2 discusses the method
how users create an account and post videos via the TikTok app and how
the privacy policy of TikTok Inc. was offered to users. Section 4.3 briefly discusses the
(underlying) processing of personal data that takes place in the context of
users' use of the TikTok app. Finally, it is explained in section 4.4 that a
large number of children use the TikTok app.

 
4.1 General description of the TikTok app

 

55. TikTok is a platform that allows users to create short videos via an app, too

edit and share online. The TikTok app allows users to upload photos and videos
of their smartphones and allows them to add filters, stickers, effects and music.
Over time, TikTok has developed into a platform where users mainly feel
profile by posting creative and humorous short videos. This distinguishes
TikTok stands out from other social media platforms such as Instagram.

 

56. In addition to making, editing and posting short videos, users can also use the TikTok app
establish and maintain social contacts. This allows users to post comments on videos
from others, like videos, follow other users, become friends with other users and
sending and receiving messages from other users, etc. It is also possible, for example
to set up live stream connections. The TikTok app can therefore be regarded as social
media app.

 

57. An important part of the TikTok app is the 'for you' page. This is a page where the user

is offered videos relevant to him or her via a continuous feed. Which videos
exactly are offered through this feed differs per user and depends on his or her
preferences. The algorithm developed by TikTok determines which videos are shown.
In addition, conversations with advertisers who are active on the TikTok platform show that for the time being
only TikTok knows exactly how this algorithm works and which factors are exactly decisive.

 

58. The above functionalities can all be used via the TikTok app. The TikTok app can be accessed via the
various app stores can be downloaded for free. TikTok's revenue model is, as with many
social media platforms, to generate income through (personalised) advertisements. Out
research has shown that at the time of the adoption of the research report, TikTok did not yet have a
personalized advertisements as a product offered to advertisers when it comes to Dutch
users. This product was already available for larger European markets such as France, Italy,
Spain and the UK.

4.2 User registration and provision of privacy policies to users
 

Login process
 

59. After a user has downloaded the TikTok app in an app store, it is immediately possible to download the
view videos shared via the TikTok platform. The user also receives via the 'for you'
page videos offered via a feed. Further functionalities in the app are not (yet).
available. In short, unregistered users can watch videos but not
post videos and enter into social contacts about this via the TikTok platform.

 

60. Creating a TikTok account is a necessary requirement to create, edit videos

and post it online and make use of the interactive possibilities of the TikTok app.

 

61. The AP has created an account as part of an online test to gain insight into the method

on which users register in the TikTok app and which data they had to do so
provide. In short, a user must go through the following four steps.19

 

62. First of all, a user must indicate by which method he or she wants the registration process

through, using a phone number, email address or other existing social media
account. The user is informed in the Dutch language that he or she agrees with the
TikTok Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The user can click on the word
terms of use and privacy policy to access these documents.

 

63. The user must then indicate his or her year of birth via a gear wheel. If the

user fills in a year of birth that shows that the person is younger than 13 years, the
user will see a red bar that says “sorry, it looks like you are not eligible for TikTok,
but thank you for looking us up”. Until early 2020, this red bar disappeared after about 5 seconds
and the user came back to the screen to enter his or her year of birth via a gear.
At that point, the user could enter a different year of birth to go through this step
come. At the beginning of 2020, TikTok introduced a temporary block if a user indicates
be younger than 13 years old. 20

 

64. As a third step, the user must enter his or her email address or telephone number and the

user set a password. The screen again states that the user agrees to
TikTok's terms of use and privacy policy.

 

65. Finally, as a fourth step, TikTok checks that the user is not a robot through a manual test
(use the mouse to move puzzle pieces to the right place). After going through this step

                                                                        
19 Reference is made to file documents 1 and 7 for a complete description of the process that Dutch users must follow
to create an account and use it to post videos online.

is a user logged in and can he or she use the functionalities of the TikTok
app, such as posting videos and entering into social contacts.

 

Privacy Policy in English language
 

66. The online tests conducted by the AP in December 2019 and February 2020 showed that the

privacy policy was displayed in the English language during the registration process described above. This
was also the case when a user was logged in and wanted the privacy policy in the TikTok app
consult.21 In response to the AP's question about how TikTok informs Dutch children about
the processing of their personal data, TikTok has stated on May 1, 2020 that they do this, among other things
through its privacy policy. The privacy policy provided by TikTok to the AP concerned a
English version.22

 
67. TikTok informed the AP on June 26, 2020 that it will change its privacy policy with effect from July 29, 2020.

to Dutch persons involved – and therefore also Dutch children under the age of 16 – in the
Dutch language will provide. As TikTok also noted in its written opinion
In addition, as of July 29, 2020, TikTok has prepared a separate document that in language use
and form is appropriate for (Dutch-speaking) children.23

 

68. Based on the foregoing, the AP determines that TikTok Inc. during the period of May 25, 2018
has its privacy policy to Dutch users - including children - until July 28, 2020
provided in the English language only.

 
4.3 Processing of personal data by TikTok
 
69. As a social media platform, TikTok processes a large number of personal data from both

registered and unregistered users. For example, TikTok handles the following
categories of personal data to enable users to share videos and about this
engage in social interaction via the TikTok platform: User ID, name/nickname, user settings, user
generated content (e.g. videos, messages, comments), IP address, mobile carrier, time zone settings,
App version, device model, device system, network type, device ID, screen resolution, operating
system, access tokens, appID, appsecret, code, redirected URL (for social login/sharing).24

 

70. The above categories of personal data have been mentioned by TikTok in its register of
processing. TikTok has this register for all processing purposes identified by it

privacy policy in the period from May 25, 2018 – July 29, 2020 not substantially changed.

4.4 Use of the TikTok App by Children
 
71. TikTok is a social media app that is popular and used by children. From research

shows that a large group of Dutch children under the age of 16 use the TikTok app and that a
part of this group of young children are around 12 years old (and in some cases
younger).

 

72. This is apparent from an indicative study conducted at the end of 2019 by a research agency, which has this to say
stated to the AP that TikTok is used by children, especially around the age
aged 12.26 In addition, this research agency estimated that approximately 830,000 Dutch children
under the age of 18 use TikTok. Below is the table – based on the
research results from the end of 2019 from the aforementioned research agency – which show that children
aged from 6 to 18 years old used the TikTok app and that TikTok proportionally
was mainly used by children around the age of 12 years.27

 

                                                                        
25 For example, TikTok describes in its processing register, among other things, the following goal: “To enable users to share user content and interact
with other users”. It goes too far for this decision to detail all eighteen processing purposes put forward by TikTok
to describe. In this decision, a reference to the processing register provided by TikTok will suffice

for the Data Protection Impact Assessment.

73. In addition, research shows that TikTok in recent months, at the time of the COVID-19

pandemic, has gained a lot of popularity, also among older users. The below
graph based on official TikTok figures in May 2020 illustrates this28:

 

 
 

                                                                        
28 The marketer who published these figures remarks about these figures that he can conclude that nowadays not only
children are more active on the TikTok app : “In the Netherlands there are 7 million app downloads, of which 3.5 million are unique users
are in the Netherlands. This cannot only be young people under the age of 18. That is why there is still a target group that is older than 18 years.” See
file document 26, p2.

74. Furthermore, media reports in August 2020 state that figures from Bytedance, the

parent company of TikTok, show the number of active users of TikTok in the Netherlands
had risen to 4.5 million. Although the largest user group would no longer consist of teenagers,
users in the 13 to 17 age group would make up as much as 28 percent of all
users in the Netherlands, which amounts to approximately 1,260,000 users.29

 

75. Based on the above, the AP has established that TikTok is used by a large number

Dutch children under the age of 16.
 
 

5. Assessment

76. This chapter successively establishes that TikTok Inc. if

controller has processed personal data and that TikTok Inc. in the period of
25 May 2018 up to and including 28 July 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

5.1 Processing of personal data

 

Personal data
 

77. Article 4, preamble and under 1, of the GDPR stipulates that personal data is all information about

an identified or identifiable natural person.
 

78. As can be seen from the register of processing operations30, TikTok Inc. in the period from May 25, 2018 to

with 28 July 2020 processed a large number of data from users, including the videos they
posted, messages they sent and other (social) activities they engaged in. Based upon
of this, the AP determines that in the present case there is information of identifiable
persons and therefore personal data within the meaning of Article 4, preamble and under 1, of the
AVG.
 
Processing
 

79. Pursuant to Article 2(1) and Article 3(1) of the GDPR, the GDPR applies to all or

partially automated processing of personal data in the context of the activities of
an establishment of a controller or a processor in the European Union. It
Under Article 4, preamble and under 2, of the GDPR, the term 'processing' includes every possible one
processing or set of processing of personal data, whether or not carried out via
automated processes, such as collecting, storing, disseminating and making available
facts.
 

80. From the register of processing of TikTok Inc. and paragraph 4.1 shows that TikTok Inc. in the period

from May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020 received, processed,
analyzed and distributed. This is the processing of personal data in the sense
of Article 4, preamble and under 2, of the GDPR.

 

81. In view of this, the AP concludes that the processing of personal data is subject to the GDPR

applies – see Article 2(1) of the GDPR.

5.2 Controller

 

82. Article 4, preamble and under 7 of the GDPR stipulates that the controller has a

natural or legal person, who alone or jointly with others, the purpose of and the
means for the processing of personal data. Decisive is who the goal of and the
means for the processing of personal data. The controller can
do this alone, but also together with others.
 
View TikTok
 

83. TikTok states in its written opinion that the processing responsibility was transferred on July 29, 2020

transferred from TikTok Inc. to TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK.
 
Considerations AP
 

84. From the register of processing operations and Privacy Policy of TikTok Inc.31 submitted on May 20, 2020,

as well as TikTok's written submission shows that TikTok Inc., located in California (the
United States), in the period from May 25, 2018 through July 28, 2020, the goals and means for
determined the processing.
 

85. The AP therefore concludes that TikTok Inc. for the period from 25 May 2018 to 28 July 2020

qualifies as a controller within the meaning of Article 4, preamble, and under 7, of the GDPR.
  

5.3 Transparency and obligation to provide information
 
86. Transparency is an important principle of EU law.32 Transparency is an expression of the

principle of fairness in relation to the processing of personal data as contained in
Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Transparency is therefore
together with lawfulness and fairness, included in the GDPR in Article 5, paragraph 1, opening lines and
under a as one of the basic principles of the processing of personal data.

 
87. Recital 60 of the GDPR notes that the data subject, in accordance with the Principles
of fair and transparent processing, must be informed that there are
processing takes place and the purposes thereof. Recital 39 of the GDPR supplements that
information and communication related to the
processing of those personal data must be easily accessible and understandable. Also must
use clear and simple language. Natural persons must become aware
made of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights associated with the processing of
personal data, as well as how they exercise their rights with regard to this processing
can exercise.

88. In the Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter:

Transparency Guidelines) emphasizes that one of the core elements of the principle of
transparency and fairness is that those involved are informed in advance of the scope and consequences of the
processing and not be surprised later by other ways in which their
personal data have been used.33

 
89. The practical (information) requirements when it comes to informing data subjects are

elaborated in Articles 12 to 15 of the GDPR.

 
90. Article 12 of the GDPR requires the controller to take appropriate measures
so that data subjects receive the information related to the processing in a concise, transparent,
intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language, in the
particularly when the information is specifically intended for a child. The information will be in writing
or provided by other means.

 

91. The element “understandable” is further elaborated in the Transparency Guidelines and serves as

benchmark an average member of the intended audience. Of a
controller that respects the principle of accountability
are expected to know the data subjects about whom information is being collected. On the basis of
this knowledge should allow the controller to determine what the target group is likely to do
to understand. For example, a controller can process the personal data of employees
professionals assume that his or her target audience has a higher level of understanding
than the target group of a controller who processes personal data of children
collects.34

 
92. In order to comply with the “clear and simple language” element, the information provided to a

data subject is not provided with language or terminology that is too legal, technical or specialist
must contain. When the information is translated into one or more languages, the
controller to ensure that all translations are faithful and that the
word choice and sentence structure in the other language or languages are correct, so that the translated text is good
follow and understand. When the controller addresses data subjects who have a
speak another language, a translation into those languages must be provided.35

 
93. With regard to providing information to children, recital 58 of the GDPR highlights:

“Since children deserve specific protection, the information and communication, when the
processing is specifically directed at a child, be stated in language such that it is clear and simple
child can understand it easily”.

94. The Transparency Guidelines also pay extra attention to the duty of care

regarding the requirement to use simple language when it comes to the provision of
information to children and other vulnerable groups. For example, the guidelines state transparency
Stresses that a controller that targets children (or is aware of it,
or should be, that his or her goods/services are mainly used by children)
ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language used is appropriate for
children. In this way, the child for whom the information is intended can understand that information
addressed to him or her.36

 

View TikTok

 
95. TikTok recognizes that one of the core elements of the principles is transparency and fairness

that those involved must be able to determine in advance the scope and consequences of the
processing and that they should not be faced with any surprises afterwards about the way in which their
personal data is used. First, TikTok believes that it can do so through various measures
has met this standard and that the AP wrongly focuses only on the
TikTok Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. TikTok refers in this context to
1) measures in the TikTok app such as pop-up notifications and the privacy and security settings,
2) the TikTok Help Center and Safety Center where users are provided with information, and
3) the Dutch summary of its privacy policy rolled out by TikTok in July 2020.
Second, TikTok believes that Dutch users have a decent command of the English language,
as a result of which there is no conflict with Article 12, paragraph 1 of the GDPR. She notes in that regard that
Since 2011, the Netherlands has been in the top three of the so-called Education First English
Proficiency Index. Third, according to TikTok, the research report does not substantiate that
its privacy policy has not used clear and simple language aimed at children.

 

Considerations AP
 

96. As the Transparency Guidelines show, a controller should

be required to know his intended audience and to make a determination based on this information
state what qualifies as understandable. In the case of TikTok, this means that they are aware of it
should be that the target group consists in any case for a substantial part of children younger than
16 years. This young target group also contributes in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 1 of the GDPR and the Guidelines
transparency comes with an extra responsibility when it comes to using clear and
simple language in all communication. After all, children deserve specific protection,
which makes the use of clear and simple language even more important.37

97. However, it appears from what has been explained above in marginals 66 to 68 that TikTok Inc.

during the period from May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020, its privacy policy to Dutch
data subjects – including children – in the English language only. 38

 

98. The circumstance that TikTok Inc. has not provided this information in the Dutch language to

Dutch (speaking) children under the age of 16 already means that TikTok has Article 12, paragraph 1 of the GDPR
violate. The requirement of comprehensibility requires at least that when the
controller addresses data subjects who speak a different language, they
translation into that language is provided to those data subjects. This obligation applies in particular when –
as in this case – it focuses on (young) children, so that they can easily access that information
understand.39 The circumstance that a relatively large group of Dutch people have a good command of English
this does not change, especially now that TikTok is used by many people under the age of 16. A
good command of the English language of those involved in that age group(s) is not
obvious. TikTok Inc. should therefore not have assumed that it was given to children
of the English language version of the Privacy Policy only complies with Article 12(1) of
the GDPR.

 

99. The other transparency measures taken mentioned by TikTok do not detract from the fact that the

English privacy statement has not been provided in language understandable to children and can already be converted
therefore do not compensate for the violation of Article 12 (1) of the GDPR.

 

100. The pop-ups used by TikTok undeniably contribute to better transparency. This
however, this measure does not alter the full privacy policy of TikTok Inc. was not drafted in
understandable and simple language for Dutch children under the age of 16. These pop ups are none
replace its privacy policy. They inform those involved about the public nature of their information
post videos, but do not provide all information as provided by the GDPR under Article 13 of the GDPR
controller must be provided.

 

101. In addition, the privacy and security settings mentioned by TikTok and the Help and

Safety Center that children are only informed there if they actively go to information themselves
to search. As a result, there is a risk that they will not be informed in time, which – like TikTok
itself recognizes - is a crucial element of the transparency obligation.40 Moreover, also applies to
these measures that it cannot replace its privacy policy now not all information
is provided by the controller pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR
are provided.

the version last updated in October 2019. However, TikTok has changed the terms of the privacy policy in the period from 25
May 2018 – July 29, 2020 not substantially adjusted, see letter dated May 1, 2020 from TikTok to the AP, p. 7 (answer to question 11).

102. With effect from July 29, 2020, TikTok will provide its privacy policy to Dutch data subjects – and

this also includes Dutch children under the age of 16 – in the Dutch language. Like TikTok also in

separate document has been drawn up that is in line with (Dutch-speaking) children in terms of language and form.41 Met
these two measures, TikTok meets the requirement in accordance with Article 12 of the GDPR to

5.4 Conclusion regarding Article 12(1) of the GDPR
 
103. Based on the foregoing, the AP concludes that TikTok Inc. during the period of

25 May 2018 up to and including 28 July 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

 

6. Fine

6.1 Introduction

 

104. By not informing children in understandable language about the processing of their personal data,
has TikTok Inc. in the period from 25 May 2018 up to and including 28 July 2020 acted in violation of article
12 (1) GDPR. TikTok Inc. has not taken any measures to ensure this during this period
ensure that children have the information related to the processing of their personal data in a
received clear and simple language for them and has thus completely ignored the importance
of Dutch children when it comes to the extra protection they enjoy under the GDPR.
The AP is of the opinion that this is a serious violation.

 

105. The AP sees this as a reason to make use of its power to impose a fine on the basis of

Article 58(2) opening words and under i and Article 83(5) GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 14,
paragraph 3 of the UAVG, to TikTok Inc. to impose. The AP uses the
Fining Policy Rules 2019.42

 

View TikTok
 

106. TikTok is primarily of the opinion that the AP is not authorized to impose a fine since the

TikTok's headquarters is located in Ireland. Even if the AP were authorized, there would be none
be grounds for imposing a fine because TikTok trades and has traded in
in accordance with the GDPR. If the AP thinks otherwise about this, then it has to, before imposing it
of a punitive sanction, the AP can demonstrate that TikTok has acted in violation of a
legal provision that was clear, precise and foreseeable for TikTok.43
[CONFIDENTIAL]. Imposing a punitive sanction based on open norms is inconsistent

with the nulla poena principle and the principle of legality. In such cases, a reprimand is one
more suitable instrument. Finally, TikTok states that all circumstances of the case must be taken into account
taken into account to arrive at an appropriate settlement, as well as the conditions of Article 83 GDPR
and all principles of good administration. TikTok has fully cooperated with the investigation and
also requested a meeting with the research department to express their concerns
easier to understand.

 
Considerations AP
 

107. In section 5.4 of this decision, the AP concluded that TikTok Inc. during the period of

25 May 2018 up to and including 28 July 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR. TikTok Inc. has
thus not acted in accordance with the GDPR. As described above in Chapter 2 of this Decree
has been set out, the DPA is authorized to take action for the established violation of Article 12, paragraph 1 of the GDPR
make a decision and impose a sanction. It is a violation that preceded
July 29, 2020 has ended. This violation therefore falls outside the scope of Opinion 8/201944
which means that the AP is authorized to impose a fine for this.
 

108. With its statement that the AP must be able to demonstrate that TikTok acted in violation of a

legal provision that was clear, precise and foreseeable to it, TikTok actually does a
appeal to the lex certa principle.
 

109. As the Judicial Division of the Council of State has considered45 several times

the lex certa principle, which is included, inter alia, in Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms, of the legislature that he with a view to the
legal certainty describes the prohibited conduct as clearly as possible. Thereby
should not be forgotten that the legislature sometimes consists of a certain vagueness
the use of general terms, describing prohibited behaviors to prevent
behaviors that are punishable fall outside the scope of that description. That vagueness can
unavoidable, because it is not always possible to foresee how the interests to be protected will be protected
will be violated in the future and because, if foreseeable, the descriptions of
prohibited behaviors would otherwise be too refined with the result that clarity is lost and
this harms the importance of the general clarity of legislation.
 

110. The mere fact that the notion of “intelligible, clear and simple language” used in this case

is decisive for the applicability of Article 12 (1) of the GDPR, based on the facts and
circumstances requires explanation, does not mean that the administrative
fine is contrary to the lex certa principle.
 

111. This description is so clear, foreseeable and knowable that TikTok could have known that it was not in
offering its privacy policy in the Dutch language to Dutch (speaking) stakeholders, of which

consists of a large proportion of children, would constitute a violation of the requirement of clear and
simple language as referred to in Article 12(1) of the GDPR. This is especially true now in the
Guidelines Transparency is considered when the controller is
addresses to data subjects who speak another language, a translation into those languages must be provided.
This obligation applies in particular when it is aimed at (young) children, so that they have that information
easy to understand and connects to the specific protection that children
earn pursuant to Recital 58 of the GDPR. The TikTok app is aimed at Dutch
involved, including children, and is for the most part in the Dutch language for them
made available. In addition, TikTok does point out to the user when installing the app
Dutch language that he or she agrees with its privacy policy.
 

112. There is therefore no conflict with the lex certa principle.

114. The AP sees no reason in what TikTok has stated to exercise its authority to impose

to waive a fine for violation of Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

 
6.2 Fining Policy Rules of the Dutch Data Protection Authority 2019 (hereinafter: Fining Policy Rules 2019)
 
115. Pursuant to Article 58(2) opening words and under i and Article 83(5) GDPR, read in conjunction

company, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if any
figure is higher.

 
116. The AP has established Fining Policy Rules 2019 regarding the interpretation of the aforementioned power to

imposing an administrative fine, including determining the amount thereof.

 

117. Pursuant to Article 2, under 2.2, of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the provisions relating to

violations for which the AP can impose an administrative fine not exceeding the amount of
€ 20,000,000 or, for a company, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the
previous financial year, if this figure is higher, classified in Annex 2 in category I, category II,

120. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the DPA determines the amount of the fine by

amount of the basic fine upwards (up to the maximum of the bandwidth of the to
an offense linked penalty category) or down (to at least the minimum of that
bandwidth).

 

121. Pursuant to Article 7 of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the AP, without prejudice to Articles 3:4 and 5:46

of the General Administrative Law Act (hereinafter: Awb) take into account the following factors
derived from Article 83, paragraph 2 of the GDPR, referred to in the Fining Policy Rules 2019 under a to
k.

 
6.3 Fine amount

 

122. This section first discusses the factors that may arise under Article 7 of the

The 2019 Fining Policy Rules are relevant for determining the fine amount. Finally, it enters
on the principle of proportionality.
 

123. According to the AP, in this case the following are mentioned in Article 7 of the Fining Policy Rules 2019:

factors relevant to determining the fine amount:
- the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement;
- the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (culpability);
 - the measures taken by the controller or processor to
   mitigate the damage suffered by those involved.
 

6.3.1 Nature, seriousness and duration of the breach
 
124. Pursuant to Article 7, preamble and under a, of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the

nature, gravity and duration of the infringement. In its assessment, the AP involves, among other things, the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing as well as the number of data subjects affected and the
extent of the damage suffered by them.

 

125. The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 16,
paragraph 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is everyone's right to
protection of his personal data. The principles and rules regarding the protection of
natural persons when processing their personal data must comply
with their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular with their right to protection
personal data. The GDPR aims to contribute to the creation of an area of freedom,
security and justice and of an economic union, as well as to economic and social progress, the
strengthening and convergence of economies within the internal market and the well-being of
natural persons. The processing of personal data must serve people. It
right to the protection of personal data is not absolute, but must be

considered in relation to its function in society and must conform to it
principle of proportionality against other fundamental rights. Any processing of
personal data must be done properly and lawfully. It serves for natural persons
to be transparent about the collection, use and consultation of personal data concerning them
or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed
incorporated.

 

126. Pursuant to Article 12(1) of the GDPR, the controller must take appropriate measures

to ensure that data subjects receive the information related to the processing in a concise,
transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language
received, especially when the information is specifically intended for a child. If inconsistent
if this is acted upon, it affects the right of data subjects to have their privacy respected
privacy and the protection of their personal data.

 

127. The activity of TikTok Inc. to which the AP's findings refer concerns the provision of only

the English version of the privacy policy to Dutch data subjects, including a large one
group of Dutch(speaking) children younger than 16 years. The privacy policy was not in Dutch
language, while a good command of the English language in that age group is not
is self-evident. It was therefore not possible for them to predict the scope and consequences in advance
of the processing and it was not clear how their personal data is used
would become.

 

128. When assessing the seriousness of the violation, the DPA also takes into account the large number of people involved

and the amount of personal data processed. Section 4.4 of this Decree has already been discussed
explained that in an indicative study at the end of 2019, a research firm estimated that
about 830,000 Dutch children under the age of 18 use TikTok and that TikTok is
at that time was relatively mainly used by children around 12 years of age.
In that same paragraph it was noted that media reports in August 2020 report that figures
of TikTok's parent company show the number of active users of TikTok in the Netherlands
had risen to 4.5 million, with users aged 13 to 17 28
percent of all users in the Netherlands, which amounts to approximately 1,260,000 young
users. The processing therefore also related to a vulnerable group of persons,
namely children. They have specific rights with regard to their personal data
protection, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and risks involved
safeguards and of their rights in connection with the processing of personal data.46 This makes, in
especially given the massive number of young users of TikTok in the Netherlands, the
violation very serious.

 

129. With regard to the duration of the violation, the DPA takes into account a period from 25 May 2018 to
with 28 July 2020, in which it considers it particularly important that, in the opinion of the AP, this is the case
was of an offense that has continued for a considerable period of time.

130. In view of the seriousness and duration of the violation, the AP sees reason to set the basic amount of the fine

to be increased by
€ 225,000 to € 750,000, being the maximum of the bandwidth of the violation
linked penalty category.
 

6.3.2 Intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (culpability)
 
131. Pursuant to Section 5:46(2) of the Awb, when imposing an administrative fine, the AP

take into account the extent to which this can be attributed to the offender. Pursuant to Article 7, under
b, of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the intentional or negligent nature of the
infringement. Since this concerns a violation, it is for imposing an administrative fine
in accordance with settled case law47, it is not required that it be demonstrated that there is intent and the AP may
assume culpability if the perpetrator is established.48

 

132. According to Article 12(1) of the GDPR, the controller must process the information in connection
with the processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and
in clear and plain language to the data subjects, in particular when the
information is specifically intended for a child. From a professional party like TikTok Inc. may, me
given the nature and scope of the processing, it is expected that it will handle it properly
applicable standards and comply with them.

 

133. TikTok Inc. has consciously informed its privacy policy to Dutch data subjects – including children –

provided in the English language only49, while the comprehensibility requirement requires that when the
controller addresses data subjects who speak another language, at least they
provides a translation into that language to those data subjects. This obligation is especially true now
TikTok Inc. was also aimed at (young) children, while the TikTok app itself for the most part
in the Dutch language has been made available to them and TikTok the user upon installation of the
app indicates in the Dutch language that he or she agrees with its privacy policy. In the
In light of the foregoing, the AP deems the violation culpable.

 
6.3.3 Measures taken to limit the damage suffered by those involved

 

134. The AP considers that TikTok Inc. has taken various measures aimed at
mitigate the damage suffered by those involved. Getting involved when using the TikTok app
pop-up notifications informing them about the public access of any te
post videos. In addition, the updated privacy and security settings and the Help

Center and Safety Center of TikTok, where users are provided with information, contribute to one
better transparency. Also, as of July 29, 2020, TikTok has provided its privacy policy in the
Dutch language to Dutch parties involved and as of that date it also has a separate
document made available in which (Dutch-speaking) children are taught in understandable language
informed.

 
135. The AP considers that this has not removed the consequences for the rights of data subjects and

already concludes on this basis that there is no reason to increase the basic amount of the fine
pursuant to Article 7, under c of the 2019 Policy Rules.

 

6.3.4 Other Factors
 
136. The AP sees no reason to increase the basic amount of the fine on the basis of the other provisions in Article 7 of the
Fining Policy Rules 2019, insofar as applicable in the present
case, increase or decrease.
 

6.3.5 Proportionality
 
137. Finally, the AP assesses on the basis of Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the Awb (principle of proportionality) whether
the application of its policy for determining the amount of the fine given the circumstances
of the specific case, does not lead to a disproportionate outcome. Apply it
The principle of proportionality, according to the Fining Policy Rules 2019, means that the AP when determining
of the fine takes into account, if necessary, the financial circumstances of the offender
is. TikTok has not relied on limited funding already for that reason
there is no reason to mitigate the fine on the basis of proportionality. The AP deems a fine in this case
of € 750,000 appropriate and offered and TikTok Inc. sufficient to pay this amount
can afford.

 
6.3.6 Conclusion
 
138. The AP sets the total fine amount at € 750,000.
