2. Facts

2.1 The breach at Transavia
 
In the data breach notification of October 24, 2019, Transavia indicated that a malicious third party
(hereinafter also: 'attacker') has had unauthorized access to Transavia systems.2 Transavia is
according to the report found out on October 21, 2019. Transavia then has an external
service provider engaged and together with this service provider is the attacker of the systems of
Transavia banned. The external service provider also analyzed which systems were affected
and what data was involved.
 
The report drawn up by the external service provider (hereinafter also: 'forensic report') describes
that an attacker used [CONFIDENTIAL] email addresses. These addresses are
may be found on the Internet.3 The attacker attempted to access the
[CONFIDENTIAL]4
 
The attacker has used a “password spray” or “credential stuffing” attack. With a "password
spray” attack, an attacker uses commonly used passwords in an automated manner
gain unauthorized access. In a credential stuffing attack, an attacker uses known
user data (derived from other third-party data breaches) to attempt to access
a system.
 
At 9:52 AM on September 12, 2019, a successful login attempt was made by the attacker. The
username used was [CONFIDENTIAL] and password was [CONFIDENTIAL]. Of
this login allowed the attacker to use the [CONFIDENTIAL] user.5 This is a user who
was used for [CONFIDENTIAL].6

 

With the [CONFIDENTIAL] user it was possible to access a Citrix environment from
Transavia. Citrix is software that makes it possible to telework. Then it was possible to
trace possible [CONFIDENTIAL] users in the [CONFIDENTIAL] domain.7
 
The attacker then succeeded in obtaining the authentication data from the user
[CONFIDENTIAL] by using the password [CONFIDENTIAL] again. This user

                                                                        
2 Transavia France S.A.S. (sister company of Transavia) has reported separately to the French regulator according to the
data breach notification of 24 October 2019 because personal data would also be involved where Transavia France S.A.S
is responsible for. See File document 1, report dated 24 October 2019.

had, according to Transavia, “the highest privileges in the [CONFIDENTIAL]”.8 In principle, this means that the
accounts [CONFIDENTIAL] and [CONFIDENTIAL] together provided access to a large part of
the computer network of Transavia.9 The role of the account was intended to serve as a link
between Transavia's HR system and the Active Directory (to determine which employees
rights to systems).10 Active Directory is a Microsoft service that (among other things)
used to manage user rights.
 
The attacker then explored Transavia's systems that are part of the domain. In this
reconnaissance phase, a login has been made (probably automated) to [CONFIDENTIAL] systems.11 In
overall activity has been observed concerning [CONFIDENTIAL] systems. The external service provider
has been able to determine on [CONFIDENTIAL] systems that it concerns data that are
copied.12 The attacker may have been interested in accessing [CONFIDENTIAL]. Access to this
however, it was not successful.13 This was also confirmed by Transavia.14
 
The attacker has [CONFIDENTIAL] log files on at least [CONFIDENTIAL] systems
removed.15
 
The attacker also used [CONFIDENTIAL] software. This is penetration test
software intended to find vulnerabilities in an IT landscape. The external service provider
found evidence of this on at least [CONFIDENTIAL] systems. On October 21, 2019
This type of attack has been noticed by the administrator and the administrator has launched an investigation. After October 21
2019, no activity has been observed from the attacker either.16

 

Based on this alert, Transavia appointed an external service provider on 22 October 2019
enabled (not the administrator). The external service provider has performed a forensic analysis. Out
the analysis revealed that the majority of the attacker's activities were aimed at
reconnaissance activities. However, the following information was copied: Network documentation,
business and various other documents as well as six e-mail boxes.17

 

Systems have been labeled critical by Transavia [CONFIDENTIAL]. There was a system in between
for the exchange of data with [CONFIDENTIAL]. Also included were [CONFIDENTIAL] and a
[CONFIDENTIAL]. On one of the critical systems, the [CONFIDENTIAL], certain
log files deleted. Because of this, there was less evidence on this system about what happened with this
system.18

On November 22, 2019, Transavia instructed the external service provider to check the mailboxes
studies copied to a remote location by the attacker in this breach. The purpose of
the investigation concerned the personal data in six mailboxes: five mailboxes belonging to employees and one from
a former employee. The mailboxes contained 49 files with personal data.19 These
according to Transavia, mailboxes were (in particular) used by [CONFIDENTIAL] employees.20
 
These files were then analyzed and on the basis of this it was decided to make a statement to
81,000 data subjects, as required by Article 34 of the GDPR if there may be a high
risk.21 This group of data subjects consisted of Transavia employees and Transavia customers. The
employees whose mailboxes had been copied had already been verbally informed according to
Transavia.22

 

Transavia indicates that since November 25, 2019, the attacker had definitively no longer had access to the IT
landscape of Transavia.23 This has also been confirmed by the external service provider.24

 

In summary, an unauthorized third party has had access to Transavia systems. Hereby
access allowed a user with many privileges to use, giving the attacker a lot
capabilities within these systems. Because of this, there has been access to many systems and there are
personal data copied to an external location.
 
2.2 Type of personal data
 
There are two groups of personal data that can be distinguished in this breach: (1) personal data that the
attacker has copied to a remote location and (2) personal data that the attacker has access to
had.
 
2.2.1 Personal Data Copied to an External Location
 
The following personal data contained in the mailboxes were copied by the attacker
(excluding the file names):25

The table above shows that passenger, supplier and (potential) employee data
have been copied. Transavia has stated that this concerns approximately 80,000 passengers.26 Also stated in
multiple files containing the personal data of up to 3000 employees and up to 200 suppliers.27

 

Passengers are involved: first and last name, date of birth, flight information and SSR code. By
one passenger is an address and telephone number involved. The following are the employees
data: first and last name, business e-mail addresses, address, telephone number. And from suppliers
are involved: business e-mail addresses, first and last name, address, e-mail address, telephone number.

Up to 10 CV files of potential employees also appear to be involved. This contained pre-
and surname, address, e-mail address, telephone number and date of birth.
 
In the notification to the passengers involved (80,000) that Transavia has sent, Transavia reports the
following data involved: first name, last name, date of birth, flight details, booking number
and the additional service such as luggage, but also wheelchair use.28 Transavia also indicates that the
affected employees have also been informed.29
 
The added services were described as SSR code. SSR code stands for “Special Service Request”
code. Transavia uses a series of 4 characters in their booking system for additional requests, such as
a bicycle as luggage. The SSR code is then “BIKE”.30 These codes can be found on the internet, which means that the
meaning is known, if this is not already clear from the code.31
 
The AP has asked Transavia which SSR codes Transavia uses and in what numbers. The door
Codes used by Transavia indicate, among other things, when a wheelchair is required, or whether a passenger
use an electric wheelchair, for example. Transavia does not use codes for dietary requirements
they do not provide meals during the flights.32

 

Codes indicating wheelchair use were included in the files that were copied to an external location
358 times before. A code indicating blindness also occurred five times. Deafness occurred four times.33

 

According to Transavia, the passenger data was collected in the period from 21 to 31 January
2015.34 The data was in a mailbox on “managed devices of employees”.35 These are managed
devices, mostly mobile devices such as phones or laptops. The employees in question were
[CONFIDENTIAL].
 
2.2.2 Personal data to which access was possible
 
Below is an overview of the systems where the users [CONFIDENTIAL] and
[CONFIDENTIAL] together.36 The title 'host' in this case means the name of the
system. The column “Data seen from / Exfiltrated” indicates whether there are still data after logging into the system
other actions have been observed. If "no" is displayed by Transavia, you have only logged in
according to Transavia.37

The tables above show that the following passenger data are processed: the front and
surname, date of birth, gender, e-mail address and telephone number, flight and
booking details and the (business) e-mail correspondence.

For employees, the first and last name, gender, date of birth, employee number,
the home address, telephone number, qualifications/training, citizen service number, attendance records and
processed login data. Furthermore, it is mentioned in the overview that reports on a system
safety incidents on board. This may also include personal data of employees
and passengers involved.

In total, up to 25,000,000 persons involved are listed in the overview provided for passengers. For
employees are mentioned up to 3000 people involved. This means that the attacker has personal data
has seen or could have seen of 25 million people.

actual evidence found for copying personal data. System [CONFIDENTIAL] is
regarded as critical by Transavia due to the amount of personal data. On this system there was
both mention [CONFIDENTIAL].
 
On the [CONFIDENTIAL] system, evidence for the attacker's activities was more limited than with
other systems, because log files were missing for the relevant period of the infringement.40 Furthermore
the system [CONFIDENTIAL] as critical because of the amount of personal data on this
system.41 On this system there was mention of [CONFIDENTIAL].

In the report to the AP, Transavia indicated that those involved come from several
countries, namely all of Europe. The AP has requested Transavia has an overview from which country the
stakeholders come. Transavia replied that 90% of customers come from the Netherlands,
based on the Point of Sale.42 Only a limited number of sister company personal data

The AP comes to the conclusion that Transavia processed personal data of more than
25 million persons. Of these, personal data of up to 83,000 people have been leaked and
health data of 367 individuals.

2.3 Security at the Time of the Breach
 
2.3.1
 
Transavia's password policy specifies the requirements that apply per user, per option
risk level.44 Transavia's password policy states 3 levels:

Access to the [CONFIDENTIAL] domain

“Minimal baseline”, the standard level;
“Medium Additions”, additional measures for users with more privileges;
“Medium and High additions”, additional measures for certain high-risk users.




 

According to Transavia, the users used by the attacker had the following levels:45




[CONFIDENTIAL] had as level: minimal baseline
[CONFIDENTIAL] had level: Medium and High security additions

 
The third-party service provider has indicated that the [CONFIDENTIAL] users “contained the highest
possible privileges”.

 

According to the password policy, a minimal baseline user has the following password requirements:46

Transavia distinguishes two types of user accounts: “user accounts” and “generic accounts”. The “user
accounts” refer to individuals. The “generic accounts” exist for several people or
systems, including for links between systems. Logging in to these users is common
automatically place according to Transavia.48

 

The AP has asked Transavia why the accounts involved in the breach did not comply
to Transavia's own standards. Transavia indicates in its answer that the focus was on “user
accounts” when it comes to password policy compliance. These are relatively more accounts and there
was considered to be the most risky. Transavia has also indicated that this
approach would increase awareness within the organization. Because of this focus, the shortcomings
for the generic accounts involved in the breach have not been noticed.49
 
The password policy also states that remote access requires multi-factor authentication.50 Off
the report shows that this was not the case for the users that the attacker could access
to acquire. For example, access was made to a Citrix environment without multi-factor authentication. The external
service provider gives as one of the recommendations to Transavia the implementation of
multi-factor authentication for users whose accounts are accessible from the Internet or in any
case for users with many rights.51 Citrix itself also recommends multi-factor authentication for the
use of their application.52
 
The AP asked Transavia why access was possible to a telework environment without
using multi-factor authentication on the accounts involved in the breach.53

 

In response, Transavia indicated that the roll-out of
these measures. The implementation of these measures at the “user accounts” took longer than
expected. Flying personnel use applications that are necessary for their work
a safe flight. If a measure such as multi-factor authentication would cause a delay,
this could cause major flight delays. “Generic accounts” had lower priority
Transavia. Because the implementation with the aircrew was delayed, the implementation with the
“generic accounts” also delayed.54

The [CONFIDENTIAL] check also indicates that for privileged accounts (accounts with
many access rights) there must be a check whether the passwords comply with the policy of
Transavia.57 As an example, Transavia provided the results of a [CONFIDENTIAL]
audit of 2019, quarter 3. The findings cover the 12-month period before the study.
It shows positive and negative results. This is indicated here for several systems
the passwords did not comply with Transavia's policy.58

 

Access within the [CONFIDENTIAL] domain

The AP notes that the passwords used in the attack did not meet the requirements of the
Transavia password policy. There was also no multi-factor authentication for these users,
while these users were accessible via the internet or via telecommuting software.
 
2.3.2
 
The attacker had access to virtually the entire [CONFIDENTIAL] domain during the breach. Transavia
has implemented more network segmentation as a follow-up measure.59 According to the National Cyber Security
Center (NCSC), network segmentation is the “dividing the network into functional segments”. Of
network segmentation only separates the systems that need to communicate with each other
segments placed. “Users only get access to the segments they need.”.60

 

The AP has asked Transavia whether the attacker is using the systems to which automatic access is available
obtained could also have done other things such as copying, viewing or otherwise processing data.61
Transavia has indicated that the attacker had this option.

In the written response, Transavia mentions a number of security measures that were in force on the
moment of the breach: “At the moment of the breach, Transavia had taken various measures in the
as part of its security policy to prevent the consequences of an unauthorized login, including monitoring.
For example, with the Security Operations Center set up for Transavia by its IT supplier, the computers
network activities of Transavia are monitored and checked for anomalous activities. Through this system

Transavia received the security notification from its IT supplier on October 21, 2019 indicating unauthorized
access to Transavia's IT landscape.”62
 
The forensic report indicated that the administrator had set up logging options, which meant that
the external service provider has been able to reconstruct the events to a large extent. The
external service provider has been able to use the [CONFIDENTIAL]63 environment of
Transavia.64
 
Research showed that it was possible to delete certain log files. That is indicated
log files have been deleted on at least [CONFIDENTIAL] systems for a week. Also is
described that certain logging was not maintained in the centralized environment, including from
Citrix and certain critical systems. A recommendation from the external service provider is therefore the
expand central logging to monitor its integrity. This would also lead to a better response
on incidents.65
 
The forensic report also states that various systems have outdated operating systems
were installed. It also says that the implemented multi-factor authentication on certain
systems was set up in such a way that a user could enter a telephone number to call a
receive second factor message. Certain systems had uncontrolled access to it
internet. This allowed the attacker to communicate with remote systems from within the network
Transavia.66 Finally, there was insufficient network intruder detection. Because of this there was talk
of a limited view of the attacker's network activity.67
 
2.4 Post-Infringement Measures
 
After Transavia found out on October 21, 2019 that an attacker has unauthorized access
to its systems, Transavia has a forensic analysis performed directly by an external service provider
have it executed. After establishing the infringement, Transavia took various measures.
 
Transavia has introduced two-factor authentication for all end users and devices, among other things.
In addition, the passwords of all user and generic accounts have been reset and are
password requirements technically implemented. Finally, Transavia has divided its network into
multiple segments.68

2.5 Transavia's view on the established facts and AP's response
 
Transavia has nuanced some facts in its view and asked the AP to address these points
pass.69 Insofar as relevant to this decision, the AP briefly mentions this view, accompanied by a
response from the AP.
 
Transavia would first like to emphasize that the accounts [CONFIDENTIAL] only together (and not each
for themselves) gave access to a large part of Transavia's computer network. And that the overviews
to the data to which the accounts jointly had access. The AP does not dispute this fact. In the
report from the AP described that through access to the first account, the
second account. Nevertheless, the AP has included a further nuance on this in the decision.
 
Secondly, Transavia states that the exfiltrated data does not mainly consist of contact details
existed. This is in contrast to the files that have only been viewed or could have been viewed by the attacker
see. The historical passenger data file contained no contact details, only before and after
last name, date of birth, flight information and SSR code. The other exfiltrated files contain
do concern business contact details of employees and business contacts, but proportionally
this according to Transavia less data. The AP agrees with Transavia's position and has amended it.
 
Finally, Transavia indicates that from a passage of the report prepared by the external service provider
it is not so much to read that systems had unnecessary access to the internet, but that these systems
had uncontrolled or unsecured access to it due to the lack of host based firewalls
internet. In response, the AP replaced the word "unnecessary" with "uncontrolled."

3. Review

3.1 Personal Data and Cross-Border Processing
 
Transavia processes data from passengers, employees and suppliers. Data such as names and
dates of birth are data with which Transavia can identify natural persons. This is possible
directly or indirectly by combining data. Because Transavia processes data with which a
person can be identified directly or indirectly, Transavia processes personal data such as
referred to in Article 4, part 1, of the GDPR.
 
Transavia also processes personal data relating to wheelchair use, deafness and blindness.
Because this information, along with other linked information, says something about a person's health
customer of Transavia, Transavia also processes special categories of personal data as indicated
in Article 9 (1) of the GDPR.
 
Transavia offers services in several European countries. There are also flights to and from several
European countries.70 Transavia's passenger data therefore concerns data from those involved
several European countries. Transavia has indicated that personal data processed by Transavia
are 90% likely to originate from the Netherlands, based on “point of sale”.71 Given the number
personal data that Transavia processes from Europeans, the AP still considers 10% to be substantial
number.
 
Because the processing of Transavia from at least one branch involves data subjects from several
member states will be, or are likely to be, materially affected, according to the
AP concerns cross-border processing as referred to in Article 4, part 23, of the GDPR.
 
3.2 Controller
 
In the privacy policy of Transavia Airlines C.V. it has been indicated that Transavia is responsible for the
personal data processed by Transavia. Furthermore, Transavia has indicated that the French company
is itself responsible for the data that this branch collects.72

 

Transavia Airlines C.V. has made agreements with sister company Transavia France S.A.S if
Transavia France S.A.S uses the systems of Transavia Airlines C.V. through one
Service Level Agreement. These agreements state that the management of the ICT systems is the
is the responsibility of Transavia Airlines C.V. 73

With regard to employee data, Transavia has indicated that this data will be separated
processed.74 This means that both the French and Dutch organizations are independently responsible
for this data of their own employees. Transavia has provided documentation from which
shows that employee data is also stored on systems of Transavia Airlines C.V. are located. 75

 

Furthermore, Transavia indicated that at the time of the breach only a limited number of systems
personal data of Transavia France S.A.S. 76

 

Transavia Airlines C.V. was also the client for the research by the external party
service provider. Transavia Airlines C.V. is also the party informed by the administrator and a
has reported the infringement to the AP and those involved.77
 
In view of the above, Transavia Airlines C.V. the purpose and means of (a large part)
of the personal data on the systems as mentioned earlier in chapter 2. The AP has established that
Transavia Airlines C.V. the controller is as referred to in Article 4, part 7 of the
AVG.
 
The head office of Transavia Airlines C.V. is also located in Schiphol, the Netherlands.78 In view of the
fact established above that Transavia Airlines C.V. as a controller
designated, the AP is the lead supervisor. According to Article 56 of the GDPR, the AP has in the
European cooperation system IMI consulted with the other supervisors about the fact that the AP
sees itself as a leading supervisor. No contradiction has arisen from this procedure
other European regulators.
 
3.3 Appropriate Security Measures
 
3.3.1
 
Article 32 of the GDPR contains the requirements regarding the security of the processing of personal data
included. The controller must provide appropriate technical and organizational
take measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. When determining
appropriate measures should take into account the risk to rights and freedoms
of persons.
 
In the following, the AP tests whether the technical measures at Transavia with regard to access
until personal data were appropriate as referred to in Article 32 of the GDPR.

3.3.2 Assessment
 
To determine what is appropriate, a trade-off must be made between the state of the art, the
implementation costs, as well as the nature, scope, context and processing purposes and qua
likelihood and severity of varying risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals. And one up
risk-adjusted level of security includes the ability to maintain the
confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of the processing systems and services
guarantee (Article 32 (1) (b) GDPR).
 
State of the art and implementation costs
As established in Chapter 2, the attacker used a password spray or credential stuffing attack
where a hacker applies commonly used or previously leaked passwords. The measures against this
can be taken depend, among other things, on the type of application and the possibilities. In this
however, the cause of the breach turned out to be a simple and commonly used password in two
users that was easy (automated) to guess. The strength and level of the password
was not in accordance with Transavia's own authentication policy.
 
It is certain that Transavia has a policy for user authentication. It is also established that Transavia
carries out periodic checks and continuously works on its own security policy. From the door
However, periodic security checks supplied by Transavia show that many applications do not
the password policy of Transavia itself was complied with.
 
Transavia has indicated that the generic accounts used during the breach are not the focus
during internal audits. For example, the passwords of generic accounts have not been verified
were used according to its own policy. According to Transavia, the risk lay with other types of accounts,
namely, the user accounts linked to individual users. This is why the bad ones
passwords not noticed in time according to Transavia. It is also indicated that multi-factor authentication
implement for “generic accounts” had not yet been realized at the time of the breach, because
implementation to other users was delayed.
 
After the first successful authentication, a Citrix environment was used. This environment is
then used by the attacker to gain further access to Transavia's systems.
For these types of environments, it is recommended to use multi-factor authentication to gain access
to limit. As mentioned earlier, this is a common measure that was also used at the time of the breach
was advised by the provider of the teleworking software Citrix.
 
After the attacker gained further access, he/she had many freedoms on the systems of
Transavia. Ultimately, this resulted in the copying of personal data from mailboxes
staff. This could have been prevented by dividing the network into several segments.
Furthermore, the rights of users can be adjusted to determine whether they are necessary
users have these rights (authorisations). Transavia has this measure after the infringement
implemented.
 
It also turned out to be possible to save log files on systems that have been designated as critical by Transavia
to delete. As a result, after the breach, there was no complete picture of what had happened on these systems.

Commonly used information security standards that were valid at the time of the
violate password management, network segmentation, and user rights
various recommendations. For example, as a control measure, safeguarding strong
passwords. Groups of information systems must also be separated into networks. Further
indicates that access rights must be restricted and controlled and must be accessed
information to be limited. 79
 
The measures that Transavia could have taken at the time of the infringement already complied with a standard
Transavia itself, according to suppliers and according to international standards. Furthermore, it turned out that there were certain
measures had already been partly implemented by Transavia.
 
Based on the above, the AP is of the opinion that, given the state of the art at the time of the
breach, it was certainly possible to implement security measures for the risk that arises
realized in the infringement. The introduction of the essential precautions mentioned above
would have made it possible to maintain the confidentiality of the personal data processed
in accordance with Article 32 (1) (b) of the GDPR and the risk of the occurrence of the
substantially reduce data breaches.
 
The information supplied by Transavia also shows that after the breach a multiple of
measures have been taken including changing passwords, implementing
network segmentation and adjusting user rights. The AP considers the implementation costs for this
security measures not so high that these measures could not be implemented earlier
become.
 
The nature, scope, context and processing purposes
For example, as the data is processed on a large scale and becomes more sensitive,
stricter requirements are imposed on the security of the data.
 
The AP has established that Transavia processes a large amount of personal data, including
special personal data such as health data. The attacker had access to systems where
contains records of approximately 25 million passengers. Given this large-scale processing of
personal data, the AP does not consider Transavia's security to be adequate at the time of the breach.
 
Probability and severity of varying risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals
The breach involved unauthorized access and provision of personal data.
Furthermore, not only could the attacker have had access to much more personal data, it was
possible to copy or otherwise process this data. The data processed by Transavia
such as contact details, in the hands of a malicious third party can be misused for
purposes that may lead to material or immaterial damage.80 Transavia also processes

                                                                        
79 See file document 43: NEN-norm_ISO_27001_2017_nl, pages 23, 24 and 29.
80 For example, contact details can be used by a malicious third party for phishing. Phishing is aimed at getting
(sensitive) information, in order to commit fraud. See also: https://www.ncsc.nl/onderwerpen/phishing.

special personal data of passengers and BSN numbers of employees. A breach of the
confidentiality of this can lead to immaterial damage, such as discrimination or fraud.81
 
Appropriate technical measures
In view of the above, the AP is of the opinion that the technical measures were not 'appropriate' at the time
of the infringement, as referred to in Article 32 of the GDPR. Considering the quantity and type
personal data processed by Transavia, a high level of measures must be taken. A
breach of the confidentiality of this data can be material or
result in immaterial damage.
 
The measures that Transavia could have taken were possible and appropriate given the state of the
technology and implementation costs. The lack of these measures, on multiple levels, has led to
a (realized) risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
 
3.3.3 Transavia's view and AP's response
 
Below, the AP briefly summarizes Transavia's view on the AP's assessment, provided
of a response from the AP.
 
View Transavia
In its opinion, Transavia indicates that it has embedded a continuous improvement process cyclically
its organization according to the standardization and Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle generally used in the sector
(PDCA). Against this background, Transavia has implemented a user authentication policy (the
'Authentication Policy') established in December 2017 with a policy horizon of three years ('Plan' phase).
Transavia realizes that the passwords of the compromised accounts in 2019 did not meet the
own Authentication Policy. Although the Authentication Policy was appropriate according to Transavia itself, such as
referred to in Article 32 GDPR, the implementation of that policy was not complete. The passwords of the
compromised accounts did not comply with its own policies and as such were not appropriate for it
intended level of security.
 
However, Transavia wants the AP's image in the research report on multi-factor authentication
nuance. Based on the information available at the time, Transavia expected that the chance of a
successful password spray attack or credential stuffing attack was greater for user accounts than for
generic accounts. User account information is generally much easier to find
on the internet (think of the name of the person in combination with the organization, data on Linkedin), then
information about generic accounts that are not linked to an individual. In addition, this one played
consideration for Transavia an important role that the number of user accounts in proportion many times
was greater than the number of generic accounts. Transavia wants to emphasize that they have the choice to prioritize
give to user accounts has carefully taken into account at that time

foreseeable risks. Finally, Transavia would like to point out that, with regard to the introduction of multi-
factor authentication between 2017 and 2019, kept pace with the rest of the industry.
 
Reply AP
The AP has established that the security measures at several levels are insufficiently appropriate
goods. The combination of weak passwords and the lack of two-factor authentication
made it foreseeable, according to the AP, that there was a high risk of unauthorized access to the
personal data of Transavia. Two-factor authentication has been common for many years
security measure and quite easy to implement. The AP sees on the basis of the nuance of
Transavia about multi-factor authentication is no reason to adjust the assessment in this regard.
 
3.4 Conclusion
 
The AP comes to the conclusion that Transavia did not take appropriate measures at the time of the infringement
to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. This has put Transavia in conflict
acted in accordance with Article 32, first and second paragraph, of the GDPR.

4. Fine

4.1 Introduction
 
Transavia has acted in violation of article 32, first and second paragraph, of the GDPR. The AP makes for the
established violation will use its authority to impose a fine on Transavia. Seen
the seriousness of the violation and the extent to which this can be attributed to Transavia, the AP deems the
imposition of a fine. The AP motivates this in the following.
 
4.2 Penalty Policy Rules of the Dutch Data Protection Authority 2019
 
Pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, opening words and under i and Article 83, fourth paragraph, of the GDPR, read in
connection with Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG, the AP is authorized to notify Transavia in the event of a
to impose an administrative fine of up to € 10,000,000 or, for a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR,
company, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover in the previous financial year, if this figure
is higher.
 
The AP has established Fining Policy Rules regarding the implementation of the aforementioned power to
imposing an administrative fine, including determining the amount thereof.82 In the
Penalty policy rules have been chosen for a category classification and bandwidth system.
Violation of Article 32 of the GDPR is classified in category II. Category II has a
fine bandwidth between €120,000 and €500,000 and a basic fine of €310,000.
 
4.3 Fine amount
 
The AP adjusts the amount of the fine to the factors referred to in Article 7 of the
Penalty policies, by lowering or increasing the base amount. It is an assessment of the
seriousness of the offense in the specific case, the extent to which the offense can be imposed on the offender
and, if there is reason to do so, other circumstances.
 
4.3.1 Severity of the Violation
 
The AP has come to the conclusion that Transavia has not applied an appropriate security level for
the processing of personal data in its network. Transavia processes many types of personal data,
such as contact details of passengers and the citizen service number, attendance records and login details
its employees. Transavia also processes health data, such as wheelchair use,
deafness and blindness of passengers.
 
It is also important that Transavia processed personal data of more than 25 at the time of the breach
million persons. At the time, Transavia involved the personal data of this large group of data subjects

insufficiently secured. This huge group of citizens have run an unnecessary extra risk of, among other things
unauthorized access to their personal data. A risk that has incidentally been realized by the breach
from 2019 leaking personal data of up to 83,000 individuals and health data of 367
persons.
 
Due to the fact that data processing is extensive in this violation, it is a large number
concerns data subjects and special personal data were also processed, the AP qualifies these
breach of the GDPR as very serious.
 
In view of the above, the AP sees reason to, based on the degree of seriousness of the violation
to impose a fine on Transavia and to increase the (basic) amount of the fine to € 400,000.
 
4.3.2 Culpability, negligence and mitigation measures
 
Pursuant to Section 5:46(2) of the Awb, when imposing an administrative fine, the AP
take into account the extent to which this can be attributed to the offender. Now that this is one
violation, it is not required for the imposition of an administrative fine in accordance with established case law
it is demonstrated that there is intent and the AP may assume culpability if the
perpetrator is established. In addition, the AP also takes into account the negligent nature of the infringement and the
damage-limiting measures by Transavia.
 
Under Article 32 of the GDPR, Transavia is obliged to introduce security measures that
are appropriate for the nature and scope of the processing carried out by Transavia. Considering the (sensitive)
nature and the large scope of the processing, the AP is of the opinion that Transavia is in any case special
has been negligent in taking such measures sufficiently. May be from Transavia
expects it to ascertain the standards that apply to it and to act accordingly. The AP considers this
culpable.
 
In addition, the AP has determined that the periodic security checks supplied by Transavia
it turned out that many applications did not comply with Transavia's own password policy.
The AP considers it very negligent that Transavia did not immediately take action to prevent such a
to ensure an appropriate level of security. On the other hand, Transavia has after taking note of it
data breach, many measures were immediately taken to protect personal data more appropriately and to
prevent the attacker from accessing Transavia's systems any longer. In addition, has
Transavia indicated that it has also generally taken several measures to reduce the
security level in the company.
 
In view of the above considerations, the AP therefore sees reason to set the fine on the basis of the
negligent nature of the infringement by € 25,000. But also for the amount of the fine under the
reduce the damage-limiting measures taken by € 25,000.

4.3.3 Other Circumstances
 
In its opinion, Transavia states that the parties involved are almost certain to have no
have been adversely affected by the data breach. The leaked passenger data contained none
contact details and were not or only to a limited extent sensitive. Transavia has had none for the past year and a half
reported misuse of data. Transavia also reported the data leak to the AP in good time
and informed those involved. Finally, Transavia cooperated as well as possible with the investigation
of the AP and no profits were made or losses avoided from the breach.
 
The AP is of the opinion that Transavia's cooperation has not gone beyond its legal obligation
to comply with Article 31 of the GDPR. Transavia has not cooperated in any particular way with this
with the AP. Also the circumstance that Transavia only complies with its legal obligation to report to the AP
and those involved, given the seriousness of this violation, the fulfillment of this obligation cannot be regarded as a
mitigating or mitigating factor. Finally, the AP notes that the right of
the protection of personal data of various data subjects has indeed been damaged, because
for example, passenger health data and employee contact details
came from a malicious third party. These persons involved are prevented from retaining the
control of their personal data.
 
Given the seriousness of the violations and the degree of culpability, the AP does not express this view
reason to waive the imposition of a fine or to waive the fine on the grounds stated by Transavia
moderate.
 
4.3.4 Proportionality
 
Finally, pursuant to Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the Awb, the AP assesses whether the application of its policy for
determining the amount of the fine in view of the circumstances of the specific case, not one
disproportionate outcome.
 
The AP is of the opinion that (the amount of) the fine is proportionate.83 In this opinion, the AP has assessed the seriousness of the
violation, the extent to which this can be blamed on Transavia, the damage-limiting measures
and other circumstances taken into account. Due to the large volume of data processing, the fact
that it concerns a large number of data subjects and that special personal data were also processed
the AP qualifies this breach of the GDPR as very serious.
 
Given all the circumstances of this case, the AP sees no reason to set the amount of the fine on the grounds of
the proportionality and the circumstances referred to in the Fining Policy Rules, insofar as applicable
the present case, to increase or decrease even further.
 
4.4 Conclusion
The AP sets the total fine amount at € 400,000.

                                                                        
83 For the justification, see sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.
