When patients visit a hospital for treatment, they must be able to trust that there is
their personal data is treated confidentially and that measures have been taken to
prevent employees who have no treatment relationship with the patient or who do not need the data
for the management of the care provision or treatment, unauthorized in the
view personal (medical) records. In case there is a leak of your personal
data, as a patient you want the hospital to report this to you and to the supervisor.
 
In October 2018, the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) investigated the measures it
Haga Hospital has taken steps to ensure that personal data in the digital patient file is not

are as referred to in Article 32, first paragraph, opening words, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 
When testing the security measures taken against Article 32 of the AVG, the NEN 7510 and 7513 are considered
measuring instrument used.
 
The AP also has the policy of the Haga Hospital with regard to identifying and reporting data leaks
examined (Articles 33 and 34 GDPR).
 
The AP finds that the Haga Hospital has not taken sufficient appropriate measures in this regard
of the security aspects 'authentication' and 'checking the logging'. The Haga Hospital acts on this basis
contrary to Article 32, first paragraph, opening words, of the AVG.
 
With regard to the investigated security aspects 'authorisations', 'logging of access' and
'Awareness of employees with regard to information security', the AP finds no violations.
 
The Haga Hospital has an internal data breach register; data breaches are registered therein,
even if reporting to the AP and to those involved is not necessary. The AP concludes that the written policy of
the Haga Hospital with regard to the registration and reporting of data leaks is in accordance with
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR and that Article 24, second paragraph, of the GDPR is complied with on this point.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background and purpose of the research

 
The reason for the investigation is a report of a data leak from the Haga Hospital on April 4, 2018.
concerns a data breach in which Haga Hospital has established that 85 of its employees have received medical
viewed data of a patient when he was admitted to the Haga Hospital, without doing so
competent, that is to say: without being directly involved in the treatment of the person in question
patient and/or were involved in the administrative handling thereof. The patient was known
Dutchman. In mid-April 2018, various reports appeared in the media about this.
 
The hospital has announced measures after questions from the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP).1 This
report contains the results of the further investigation into the security measures of the
Haga Hospital. The research focuses on the situation in October 2018.
 
The main question in this research is the following:
Are the measures taken by Haga Hospital to ensure that personal data
in the digital patient file cannot be viewed by unauthorized employees, 'appropriate' as referred to in
article 32 of the GDPR?
 
The AP has investigated the following aspects in this context: authentication, authorisations, logging, control
of the logging and the awareness of employees.
 
The AP has also investigated the procedures for reporting data leaks (article 33, first
paragraph, and Article 34, paragraph 1, of the GDPR).
 

1.2 Study progress

 
In a letter dated October 12, 2018, the AP conducted a further investigation and asked questions. The requested
information was provided by letter dated 23 October 2018 from Haga Hospital.
 
On October 31, 2018, four employees of the AP conducted an on-site investigation at the
Haga Hospital, Leyweg location in The Hague, where the hospital information system has been examined and
oral statements were also taken from [CONFIDENTIAL].
 
On November 19, 2018, AP submitted the statements in writing to Haga Hospital. It
Haga Hospital responded in writing to this on 29 November 2018.
 
On January 16, 2019, the AP sent the preliminary findings to Haga Hospital. It
Haga Hospital responded in writing on February 4, 2019.
 

                                                                        
1 Following the report of the data breach, the AP requested the Haga Hospital on 23 April 2018 for information regarding
the data breach and the measures taken. This information was provided to the AP by letter dated 25 May 2018.

1.3 Legal framework

 
The data breach took place in January 2018, when the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp) was still in force
was applicable. As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable,
as well as the GDPR Implementation Act (UAVG). The Wbp was also repealed on that date, pursuant to Article 51 of
the UAVG.
 
The AP's investigation at Haga Hospital focuses on the situation in October 2018; that is, after
the GDPR becoming applicable.
 
Lawfulness of data processing
For employees of healthcare institutions, access to personal data about health is in digitized form
patient files only lawfully if and insofar as an employee is directly involved in the
treatment of or care provided to a patient and/or in the management of this
treatment/care provision and access is limited to the data necessary for the
performance of the employee's duties. Incidentally, the personal data may only be
processed by persons who by virtue of their office, profession or statutory regulation or pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement is required. This follows from the provisions of Article 9 of the GDPR, paragraph 2
under h2 and paragraph 33, article 30 of the UAVG, paragraph 3 under a4 and paragraph 45, and article 7:457 first and second paragraph Civil
Code (BW).6
 
 

                                                                        
2 “the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the
the employee's fitness to work, medical diagnoses, the provision of health care or social services or
treatment or the management of healthcare systems and services or social systems and services, under Union law
or Member State law, or under a contract with a healthcare professional and subject to those mentioned in paragraph 3
conditions and guarantees;”
3 “The personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in paragraph 2(h) where
data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional authorized under Union or Member State law
is bound by professional secrecy by law or by rules adopted by national competent authorities, or by another
person who is also authorized under Union or Member State law or under rules laid down by national competent authorities
secrecy is kept.”
4 “In view of Article 9(2)(h) of the Regulation, the prohibition on processing health data does not apply
applies if the processing is carried out by:

a.

care providers, institutions or facilities for health care or social services, insofar as the
processing is necessary for the proper treatment or care of the data subject or the management of the data subject
relevant institution or professional practice;”

5 “If application is made to the first, second or third paragraph, the data will only be processed by persons from
by virtue of office, profession or statutory regulation or pursuant to a confidentiality agreement. If the
controller processes personal data and does not already rely on him by virtue of his office, profession or law
regulation is subject to a duty of confidentiality, he is obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the data, except insofar as the law requires him
communication is mandatory or the need arises from his task that the data be communicated to others who are authorized by virtue of the
first, second or third paragraph are authorized to process it.”
6 “1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 448, paragraph 3, second sentence, the care provider shall ensure that persons other than the patient are not
information about the patient or access to or copies of the documents, referred to in Article 454, are then provided with
patient's consent. If provision takes place, this will only take place insofar as this affects personal privacy
of another is not harmed. The provision may take place without observing the restrictions referred to in the
previous sentences, if required by or pursuant to the law.
2. Others than the patient do not include those who are directly involved in the implementation of the
treatment agreement and the person who acts as a replacement for the care provider, insofar as the provision is necessary for
the activities to be performed by them in that context.”

Security measures to be taken
Article 32, paragraph 1, opening words, of the GDPR stipulates that the controller must use appropriate technical
and organizational measures to ensure a level of security tailored to the risk for the data subject
guarantees. In doing so, the controller takes into account the available technology and the
implementation costs and with the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing.
 
The 'Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers' contains further rules, among other things
established on functional, technical and organizational measures for electronic
data processing by healthcare providers. Pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 2, and Article 5, paragraph 1 of the
Decision, a healthcare provider must act with regard to the security and logging of its healthcare information system
in accordance with the provisions of NEN 7510 and NEN 7513.7,8 The NEN 7510 and NEN 7513 standards contain
thus a mandatory further interpretation of Article 32 of the AVG with regard to a safe and careful
use of the healthcare information system of the healthcare provider. That is why the AP uses the provisions in NEN
7510 and NEN 7513 as a standard for the assessment of 'appropriate technical and
organizational measures”.
 
The following requirements from NEN 7510 and NEN 7513 are involved in the assessment of the appropriate level of
the measures taken by the hospital with regard to access to data
electronic patient records:

- The identity of users is established on the basis of two-factor authentication.9
-
-

There is an access control policy for granting access to information.10
Log files are created to irrefutably determine which events happened afterwards
have taken place on a patient file.11,12

- The log files are checked regularly for indications of unauthorized access or

unlawful use of personal data.13

- Employees are made aware of their responsibilities in the field of

information security.14

 
These standards are further elaborated in Chapter 2 of this report.
 
Reporting data breaches
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR contain the 'obligation to report', which is known in common parlance
data leaks', the obligation to report a personal data breach to the
supervisory authority and the data subject.15 Pursuant to Article 24, second paragraph, of the GDPR, a
controller, where it is proportionate to the processing activities
about an appropriate data protection policy that is also implemented. These standards are evolving
elaborated in Chapter 2 of this report.

2.1.1

2.1.2

 
Processing of patient data in the hospital information system
 
The subject of the AP's investigation is the processing of patient data in the
hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
The data relating to patients who enter the Haga Hospital in the hospital information system
processes are personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR16, because it contains information about
identified17 natural persons. Some of this data is 'health data'
the meaning of Article 9 of the AVG and can therefore be qualified as special personal data.
 
Furthermore, there is a processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4, under 2 of the AVG.18 By
its scope includes the concept of "processing" any possible operation or set of operations of
personal data. This also includes consulting patient data in the hospital information system
below.
 
Responsible
 
Since 2013, the Haga Hospital19 forms together with the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft and (since 2015) the
LangeLand Hospital in Zoetermeer the (foundation) Reinier Haga Group (RHG).20 Because of this
partnership, the question must be answered which organization is the
controller21 is responsible for the processing of patient data in the
hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
In this context, the AP considers that it has emerged that the management of the Haga Hospital independently manages the institution
and management of the hospital information system. There is talk of an administrative merger and none
legal merger between the hospitals of the RHG and the hospitals within the RHG are system technical

                                                                        
16 Article 4, point 1 of the GDPR: ” “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
(“the data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
in particular by means of an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or from
one or more elements characteristic of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social
identity of that natural person;”
17 Because, among other things, name and address details and also the BSN are processed, the identity of the persons is established and it concerns
so identified persons.
18 Article 4(2) of the GDPR: ““processing” means any operation or set of operations relating to personal data or
a set of personal data, whether or not carried out by automated processes, such as collecting, recording, organizing,
structure, store, update or modify, retrieve, consult, use, provide by transmission, distribute
or otherwise making available, aligning or combining, blocking, erasing or destroying data;”.

separated.22 The general RHG information security policy23 is fleshed out locally and the
Haga Hospital has its own authorization policy for digital patient files.24 In view of this, the AP is of
is of the opinion that the HagaZiekenhuis foundation is the controller within the meaning of Article 4, under 7, GDPR
for the processing of patient data in the hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
The AP notes that the foundation could become RHG as co-controller
marked. The board of directors of the RHG foundation is responsible for the development and implementation
of hospital policy and the management and organization of hospital organisations.25 Nevertheless, the
management of the Haga Hospital has the most say over the local interpretation of the policy and thus
the Haga Hospital must be regarded as the (main) controller.
 

2.2 Authorizations (access control policy)

 

2.2.1 Elaboration of legal framework

 
Norm 9.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates that access to information must be limited. This serves
- inter alia - an access security policy must be established.26
 
Specifically for healthcare institutions, they must control access to health information. In the
in general, users of health information systems must control their access to personal
restrict health information to situations:
a) in which there is a care relationship between the user and the person to whom the data relates
have (the client whose personal health information is being accessed);
b) in which the user performs an activity on behalf of the person to whom the data relates;
c) where specific data is required to support this activity.
 
In addition, organizations that process personal health information must have an access control policy
(authorisations) with which access to this data is regulated. The policy of the
organization with regard to access control should be established on a prior basis
defined roles with associated privileges that match, but are limited to, the needs of
the roll.
 
The access control policy, as part of the information security policy framework, belongs
reflect professional, ethical, legal and client-related requirements and should perform duties
are performed by caregivers, and consider the workflow of the task.
 
The healthcare institution should have appropriate rules for access security, rights and restrictions for specific
establish user roles with respect to their assets, detailing and rigor of
the control measures reflect the related information security risks.

2.2.2

It is also important that, in order to prevent the provision of care from being delayed or halted, there should be more powerful ones
requirements then usually apply to a clear policy and process, with associated authorization, to ensure 'normal'
bypass access control rules in emergency situations.27
 
In concrete terms, with regard to a healthcare information system, the above means that the healthcare institution has roles
must establish and apply with associated authorizations. Those authorizations should be 'appropriate'. That
means (the need for) access to health information and the limitations of access
depend on the role of the healthcare worker and the relationship with the patient (as evidenced by, for example,
treatment plan, work context, specialism, department, consultation), including the proper performance of the tasks that
performed by healthcare providers into account.28
 
Factual findings
 
The AP notes that the Haga Hospital has an authorization policy based on
authorization profiles (roles/role-based access).29
 
The starting point of the authorization policy is that employees in the Haga Hospital have exclusive access
have access to patient data if they have a treatment agreement with the patient or if they
are directly involved in the implementation of a treatment agreement that a (other)
care provider within the organization has with the patient or act as a substitute for the other
healthcare provider (in summary, having a treatment relationship). An employee only needs access to this
access to the data necessary for his task in the context of the treatment agreement.
This not only concerns medical but also administrative support and management of the
institution, insofar as the data are necessary for this (for example, registering a patient, the
scheduling appointments, performing checks).30
 
According to the policy, the powers are limited to those patients with whom a
treatment relationship. The treatment relationship corresponds to the employee's work context.31 This also follows
from the authorization matrix sent by the hospital32 It follows from the authorization policy that
access to data must also be limited in time, namely for a period of one year, necessary to
to complete activities in the context of the treatment relationship.33
 
The AP notes that restrictions in access are concretely implemented because the authorizations of doctors,
physician assistants, nurses and other staff of support departments are based on it
specialism or the department for which they work or asked for a consultation with a specific patient

are. Access to information from sensitive specialties (psychology, psychiatry, medical social
work and sexology) is shielded hospital-wide. 34.35
 
In cases where the required availability of data for the care deviates from the set
authorization, the hospital has a specific emergency button procedure (also known as “Breaking the glass”
named). The screen shown contains a warning in which the user must specify the reason for access
36 The emergency button procedure is shown when:
- an employee visits a patient who is not known to the department/specialism for which there are rights
are set. This means that it cannot be found in the outpatient clinic planning, work list or department occupancy list
of the department(s)/speciality.
- an employee opens a file of a specialism for which he has no rights.37,38
 
The hospital also has a pseudonym procedure for shielding a patient at the hospital
emergency room or an admitted patient when they need to be shielded for visits or
family (for example, when there is abuse or removal of parental authority) or
when the patient should not be found by searching by name via the 'search patient'
functionality (e.g. known person or employee of the Haga Hospital).39
 

2.2.3 Assessment

 
In this study, the AP assesses the policy with regard to the granting of authorisations
(access control policy) and in general its application. The AP does not assess the individual
authorizations40 of employees/roles.
 
The AP concludes that a context-bound method of authorization of employees has been provided, that the
policy for setting authorizations has been carefully designed and that the correct starting points are used
are used. The AP concludes on the basis of the statements of employees and the
Haga Hospital provided documents that this policy is being implemented. That means it
Haga Hospital's access control policy complies with standard 9.1.1 of the NEN 7510-2 (2017) and
this means that appropriate measures are taken with regard to access control policy as required
pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR.

2.3 Authentication

 

2.3.1 Elaboration of legal framework

2.3.2

 
Standard 9.4. of the NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates that unauthorized access to systems and applications must be
will be prevented. Health information systems that process personal health information41
this includes - among other things - establishing the identity of users and this should be done
through authentication involving at least two factors42.43
This means that for access to patient data in the hospital information system of the
Haga Hospital requires two-factor authentication. For example, authentication by means of
something the user knows (a password or PIN) and something the user has (a token or
smart card).
 
Factual findings
 
The AP notes that authentication of the identity of the employee in the Haga Hospital is at two
ways is possible. Firstly, users can log in to the virtual workplace (VDI)44 through the
staff pass for a card reader. Then the user enters his username, it
password and a four-digit (user-specified fixed) PIN. There is a single-
sign-on' functionality, which allows access to the VDI once logged in
hospital information system.45 The user can then use the pass for four hours at any workstation
log out and log in without entering a user name, password and/or pin code.46,47
 
Secondly, the user can log in to the VDI and the hospital information system without a staff pass
with a user name and password, for example if the employee has forgotten the staff pass.48,49
 

2.3.3 Assessment

 
The strength of the user authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information
to which access is granted. In the hospital information system, data about health
processed and requires two-factor authentication. Since users can access the
data in the digital patient records with only something a user knows (namely a username
and password) in that case one factor is used. This does not fulfill it

                                                                        
41 NEN 7510-1 (2017), 3.44: “Information about an identifiable person related to the physical or mental
condition of, or the provision of care services to, the person in question.”
42 In general, three factors are distinguished: something the user knows (a password or pin code); something that the
user has (e.g. a token); or something the user is (a biometric). (Source: NCSC, Use two-factor
authentication. Passwords all are not always sufficient. Factsheet FS-2015-02, version 1.1. October 22, 2018).

requirement of two-factor authentication. The Haga Hospital does not comply with standard 9.4.1 of the NEN on this point
7510-2 (2017) and therefore there are no appropriate measures with regard to authentication such as
is required under Article 32(1) of the GDPR.
 

2.4 Logging

 

2.4.1 Elaboration of legal framework

 
Standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates, among other things, that log files should be made of
events that include user activities, exceptions, and information security events
register.50
 
In addition, it follows from standard 5.1 of the NEN 7513 (2018) that the logging must generally make it possible
to determine irrefutably afterwards which events have taken place on a
patient record. Among other things, the system must keep track of which event took place, the date
and the time of the event, which client was involved and who the user was.
 
It is also important that all events involving actions that relate to a
patient file (including viewing data) are logged;51 also events that do not fall
under normal data access procedures, such as applying an emergency procedure (eg
the “Breaking the glass” procedure).52
 
Factual findings
 
The Haga Hospital logs every access to digital patient files in the hospital information system, both
access via the emergency button procedure and beyond. The logging shows which employee is on a
has had access to the electronic patient file of the patient on a certain date and at a certain time
patient.53,54,55
 

2.4.2

2.4.3 Assessment

 
The Haga Hospital logs all access to patient files and the log files offer the possibility to
determine afterwards whether there has been abuse. With this, the Haga Hospital meets that requirement
is indicated in NEN 7510 and 7513. This means that appropriate measures are taken with regard to
logging as required under Article 32 of the GDPR.

2.5 Checking the Logging

 

2.5.1 Elaboration of legal framework

2.5.2

 
The requirements regarding registration and auditing are among the most important of all security requirements
for protecting personal health information. These requirements guarantee accountability
clients who entrust their information to electronic medical record systems and
are also a strong incentive for the users of such systems to implement policies on it
acceptable use of these systems. Effective auditing and registration can contribute to
demonstrating misuse of health information systems or personal health information.
These processes can also help organizations and clients obtain redress from users
who abuse their access rights. Requirements for registering events are detailed in NEN
7513 discussed (explanation of standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017)).
 
Norm 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) therefore stipulates that log files should be regularly
rated. The AP applies the principle that there must be systematic, consistent
control of all logging. A random check and/or a check based on complaints is not
sufficient to fulfill this. The AP has these starting points in its report on security
of digital patient records already described in 2013. It is also indicated that hospitals should
strive for more 'intelligent' analysis or control of the logging.56 With these starting points, the AP is referring to
the presence of a risk-oriented system for the checks, of which only random
random checks and/or checks based on complaints of only a few files per year
there is no question.
 
Factual findings
 
The policy for checking the logging of the Haga Hospital is, given the Authorization Policy and
statements by Haga57,58 that periodically, i.e. once every two months, a check on the logging
takes place by means of a random sample of 1 patient file. The authorization policy describes the
intended checks on the logging: “A failed access attempt as well as a successful access to
a digital file outside the treatment relationship, realized via the emergency button procedure, will be processed via this logging

                                                                        
56 See also report “Access to digital patient records within healthcare institutions” (2013), p. 13, 15-16 and 17.
p. 13;” The Dutch DPA also notes that the health care institutions examined do not provide for systematic, consistent monitoring of
all logging. At most, the logging is checked when the emergency button is used, which is – often – also limited to
random checks or checks based on complaints. Healthcare institutions where there is no systematic control of all logging
therefore do not comply with Article 13 of the Wbp.” (…) P.16:” The obligation to log to prevent unauthorized access
as included in the NEN standards implies that the logging is actually checked. That control is one
essential part of access security and is all the more important where in healthcare institutions the authorization – for the time being –
falls short. If healthcare institutions improve those authorizations, the analysis of the logging may also be approached more 'intelligently'
could be." (…) P.17: “In the health care institutions studied, there is no further provision for a systematic, consistent control of
all logging. At most, the logging is checked when the emergency button is used, which is – often – also limited to
random checks or checks based on complaints. The obligation to check the logging in order to check whether
access to patient data is limited to situations where it is lawful, logically follows from the obligation to
logging as included in NEN 7510 and NEN 7513. Healthcare institutions where no systematic check of all logging takes place,
therefore do not comply with Article 13.” (https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/downloads/mijn_privacy/rap_2013-

regularly checked for legality. Such checks will be for regular
patient records are performed on the basis of an audit. Checks for patient records belonging to
treatment in the specialties of psychiatry, psychology, VIP, own staff and in relation to
venereal diseases will be carried out in total.59
 
The AP has established that in the period from January to October 2018, a check of the logging
has taken place with regard to the file of the patient referred to in paragraph 1.1 in accordance with the
authorization policy.60,61 In view of the number of accesses to this specific file, further investigation has been launched into
(un)lawful access.62
In addition, requests from patients and employees in six files were checked during that period
unauthorized access occurred. No irregularities emerged from those checks
come.63,64,65
 
There is no question of checking the logging of all files by selecting for striking deviations or
outliers, nor is automatic signaling used when certain limits are exceeded
limit values.66,67
 
The Haga Hospital has indicated that it intends to conduct six random samples
do in 2019, in accordance with the policy. This includes access to the file of six different patients
checked by various departments.68,69
 

2.5.3 Assessment

 
The policy for checking the logging of the Haga Hospital regulates that checking the legality of
access to the patient files takes place via the logging of a random sample of six annually
patient records, taking into account failed access attempts as well as actual access to the
digital file outside the treatment relationship, realized via the emergency button procedure. If selected
file belongs to one of the five 'sensitive' groups, the logging of that file must be complete
checked.
 
However, with a check of the logging of a random sample of six patient records annually,
the Haga Hospital does not have a policy with regard to systematic, risk-oriented or intelligent control of the

logging. Also in practice no systematic check of the logging has taken place, because the
inspections that did take place in the past period were in response to a number of complaints and
requests but not risk-oriented and also insufficient in scope, given the scale of the processing of
the hospital. This means that the Haga Hospital does not meet the standard 12.4.1 of the NEN 7510-2
(2017). This means that there are no appropriate measures with regard to checking the logging, such as
is required under Article 32(1) of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the planned checks for 2019, the AP notes that a random sample check of
six patient files per year is in any case not sufficient to meet the standard of systematic,
risk-oriented or intelligent control.
 

2.6 Employee awareness

 

2.6.1 Elaboration of legal framework

 
The hospital should make employees aware of their responsibilities with regard to the
information security. This includes appropriate awareness education and training for all employees
receive and receive regular training in organizational policies and procedures, as relevant
for the function. Employees should be made aware of disciplinary processes and consequences
regarding information security violations. An awareness program should also be established
established, with a number of activities, such as campaigns and the distribution of newsletters. This follows from
standard 7.2.2 of NEN 7510-2 (2017).
 
Factual findings
 
The Haga Hospital provides information about information security as part of the
introduction program for new employees, during work meetings and on the intranet. Furthermore, it has
hospital participated in a national awareness campaign for employees aimed at the
importance of information security. In addition, AVG workshops have been held and all RHG
employees received a letter with an explanation as a result of the data breach in the second quarter of 2018
about the standard and possible sanctions.70,71,72

In the opinion of the AP, the Haga Hospital has taken sufficient measures with regard to
the awareness of employees with regard to information security. With this it acts

2.7 Conclusion on security aspects (article 32 GDPR)

 
The AP finds that the Haga Hospital has not taken sufficient appropriate measures in this regard
of the security aspects 'authentication' and 'checking the logging'. The Haga Hospital acts on this basis
contrary to article 32, first paragraph, opening words, of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the investigated security aspects 'authorisations', 'logging of access' and
'Awareness of employees with regard to information security', the AP finds no violations.
 

2.8 Reporting data breaches

 

2.8.1 Elaboration of legal framework

 
General
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR contain the 'obligation to report', which is known in common parlance
data leaks', the obligation to report a personal data breach to the
supervisory authority and the data subject.73
 
Data breach
The term 'data breach' does not appear in the law. Instead, the GDPR talks about a “related breach
with personal data'.74 This is the case in the event of a security breach that occurs accidentally or on
unlawfully leads to the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or
unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
 
Examples of data leaks are the loss of a USB stick with unencrypted personal data, a
cyber attack in which personal data has been captured or an infection with ransomware in which
personal data has been made inaccessible.
 
But unauthorized access to personal data is also a data breach. For example, in the case where
employees of a hospital can view medical personal data of a patient75 without doing so
competent, that is to say: without being directly involved in the treatment of the person in question
patient and/or were involved in the administrative handling thereof.
 
Data breach notification obligation
In the event of a data breach (a breach), the controller is subject to two different reporting obligations:
(a) there is a reporting obligation to the AP (Article 33 GDPR); and
(b) there is an obligation to report to the data subject whose personal data it concerns (Article 34 GDPR).
 
A personal data breach must always be reported to the AP, unless it is not
it is likely that the infringement poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”
(Article 33, first paragraph, of the GDPR).

                                                                        
73 Explanatory Memorandum to the GDPR. Parliamentary Paper 34851, no. 3, p. 56-57.
74 Article 4(12) of the GDPR: . personal data breach” means a breach of security that is accidental or on
unlawfully leads to the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized
access to transmitted, stored or otherwise processed data; “
75 Among other things, 'consulting' and 'requesting' personal data already constitutes 'processing' of personal data in
the sense of the GDPR (Article 4 point 2 GDPR).

Final Report 2019

 

16



 
Furthermore, a personal data breach must be notified to the data subject if the
it is likely that an infringement will result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons
persons (Article 34 paragraph 1 GDPR).
 
The threshold for communicating a breach to data subjects is therefore higher than the threshold for reporting
a breach to the supervisory authority. Not all breaches need to be reported to data subjects
reported, to prevent unnecessary notification fatigue.76 The controller must inform the
assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to take into account the
specific circumstances of the infringement. In the 'Guidelines on the obligation to report data breaches'77, this
assessment by the controllers.
 
However, even if it concerns data about health, not every unauthorized access by an employee
of a healthcare institution leads to a probability of damage for the person concerned and thus to a high
risk. Because not every unauthorized access is intentional or happens with wrong (unprofessional)
intentions, such as curiosity. For example, if a wrong file is opened by mistake, or
if it turns out afterwards that it was not necessary to view the data of a particular patient. In these cases
is the patient still protected by the healthcare professional's professional ethics or
support worker and it is not necessary - without further ado - to assume a 'probably
(high) risk for the person concerned. However, it should always be determined by the specific circumstances of the case
looked. These cases must be distinguished from the cases in which it does exist
(intentionally) violating professional ethics. For example, if out of curiosity and without professional
reason a medical file has been looked at (for example, in the file of a famous person, or of a
family member or acquaintance.78) In such cases it is likely that the infringement will result in a high
risk for the data subject and the breach must be reported to the AP and to the data subject.
 
Administration obligation data breaches
In addition, the controller is subject to an administrative obligation with regard to infringements
in connection with personal data. It follows from Article 33 paragraph 5 AVG that 'all infringements', therefore not
Notifiable breaches must be administered.
 
Written procedure for reporting data breaches
Pursuant to Article 24, paragraph 2, of the GDPR, a controller must submit this when
proportionate to the processing activities, to have an appropriate
data protection policy that is also implemented. That means that the Haga Hospital, because
many medical personal data79 are processed within it, as part of the
                                                                        
76 “Article 29” Working Group, Guidance on Personal Data Breach Notification under Regulation
2016/679, (Last revised and approved on February 6, 2018), (hereinafter: “Guidelines WP 29”), p. 23.
77 Guidance on personal data breach notification under Regulation 2016/679, revised on 6
February 2018, by WP29. (WP250rev.01)
(https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guidelines_meldmandatory_data leaks.pdf). These "Guidelines
duty to report data leaks' of the consultative body of the European supervisors contain further explanation and guidelines for the
notification of data breaches.
78 Although it may be assumed that the healthcare sector generally has a high level of professional ethics with regard to the
handling confidential and medical personal data, practice shows that this professional ethics is not always observed.
The case that gave rise to this investigation serves as an example.
79 The term used in the AVG and UAVG is: 'health data'; including Article 9, first paragraph, of the GDPR; that's a special one
category of (sensitive) personal data.

data protection policy must have a policy or a written procedure for
reporting data breaches and this policy must actually be implemented.
 
Factual findings
 
The AP notes that Haga Hospital has a specific written procedure for this
data leaks80 and the conversations held showed that the procedure is understood.81 This procedure
describes, in addition to a part of the standard explanation, the working method to be followed if an employee of the Haga Hospital
reports a possible data breach.
The procedure also mentions a number of examples of data leaks. There is a Commission
Data Breach, which consists of the Data Protection Officer and the Information Security Officer,
the executive secretary, the communications manager and the HR manager. If there is a large scale
data breach, the Commission can be expanded. The AP also notes that the Haga Hospital has an internal
has a register in which incidents are registered.82
 

2.8.3 Assessment

 
The AP concludes that the Haga Hospital has an internal data leak register and that the procedure
of the Haga Hospital with regard to registering and reporting data leaks, as described in the
document 'Procedure Notification Data Leak Haga Hospital' provides an appropriate interpretation of the obligations
of the Haga Hospital with regard to registering and reporting data leaks that follow from the articles
33 and 34 of the GDPR. Because the Haga Hospital has an appropriate written procedure
with regard to data breaches, Article 24(2) of the GDPR is complied with on this point83.
 
The AP notes that the "unauthorized access by its own employees to data about the health of
patients' is not mentioned as an example in the 'Procedure Notification Data Leak Haga Hospital' . The AP orders
Haga Hospital to supplement the document on this point.

3. Conclusions

 
The AP has investigated whether the measures taken by the Haga Hospital
in order to ensure that personal data in the digital patient file are not viewed by
unauthorized employees, are appropriate as referred to in Article 32, paragraph 1, preamble, of the GDPR.
 
The AP also has the policy of the Haga Hospital with regard to identifying and reporting data leaks
examined (Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR).
 
The AP finds that the Haga Hospital has not taken sufficient appropriate measures in this regard
of the security aspects 'authentication' and 'checking the logging'. The Haga Hospital acts on this basis
contrary to article 32, first paragraph, opening words, of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the security aspects examined, 'authorisations', 'logging of access', 'awareness
employees with regard to information security', the AP finds no violations.
 
The AP also concludes that the Haga Hospital has an internal data leak register and that it
written policy of the Haga Hospital with regard to registering and reporting data breaches
is in accordance with Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR and that Article 24, second
member, of the AVG.

3.1 Appendix 1: Response to Haga Hospital's opinion

 

 
In a letter with an appendix dated 16 January 2019, the AP sent the Haga Hospital a draft of the present
research report, with the request to comment on it. The Haga Hospital made that one
possibility of use by letter dated 4 February 2019. This appendix contains a response to this opinion.
 
General
Based on the opinion of the Haga Hospital, the draft research report has been revised
points adjusted. It only concerns some textual changes.
 
The substantive view of the Haga Hospital pertains to two parts of the concept
research report, namely 'checking the logging' and 'authentication'. Those topics are discussed below
the order.
 
1. Checking the logging
 
View Haga Hospital:
The Haga Hospital notes in its opinion that the AP in its assessment in section 2.5.3 (Assessment
control logging) states that the number of sample checks of six patient records is not sufficient to meet
meet the standard of systematic control. The Haga Hospital has indicated in response that
the NEN 7510 and 7513 do not speak of numbers, but of 'regular' checks. The Haga Hospital has
asked the AP to indicate on the basis of which standard or policy it came to the conclusion that six
samples would not be sufficient to meet the standard.
 
Reply AP:
The standard with regard to checking the logging has already been elaborated in section 2.5.1. It says in this
described that inspections on the basis of NEN 7510 should take place 'regularly' and that the AP
The starting point is that access control is systematic and consistent. A
random checks and/or a check based on complaints is not sufficient to give substance
to systematic and consistent access control. The AP has also described this starting point in the
previously published report 'Access to digital patient records within healthcare institutions' (2013), p 13, 15-16
and 17.84
 
View Haga Hospital:
The Haga Hospital has stated in its opinion that it explicitly strives for more intelligent analysis
of the logging and developments in this area. Soon the supplier will have a
giving the first presentation of such a recently completed module at the Haga Hospital.
 
Reply AP:
The AP takes note of the fact that the Haga Hospital expressly strives for 'more intelligent' analysis c.q.
checking the log. That does not alter the fact that the Haga Hospital does not yet meet the requirement
systematic consistent access control,
 
2. Authentication
 
View Haga Hospital:
The Haga Hospital indicates in its opinion that the DPA in its assessment of the authentication (section
2.3.3 Assessment) rightly states that this is insufficient and that in consultation with [CONFIDENTIAL] a short

discussed in consultation with [CONFIDENTIAL].
