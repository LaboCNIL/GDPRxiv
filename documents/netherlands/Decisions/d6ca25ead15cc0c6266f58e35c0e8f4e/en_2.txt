Summary
 
When patients visit a hospital for treatment, they must be confident that there is
their personal data is treated confidentially and that measures have been taken to
prevent employees who have no treatment relationship with the patient or who do not need the data
have for the management settlement of the care or treatment, unauthorized in the
personal (medical) file. In case there is a leak of your personal
data, you as a patient want the hospital to report this to you and to the supervisor.
 
In October 2018, the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) investigated the measures taken by the
Haga Hospital has taken steps to ensure that personal data in the digital patient file is not
be viewed by unauthorized employees. In doing so, the AP has assessed whether these measures are 'appropriate'
are referred to in Article 32, first paragraph, preamble, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 
When assessing the security measures taken against Article 32 of the GDPR, the NEN 7510 and 7513 are as
measuring instrument used.
 
The AP also has the policy of the Haga Hospital with regard to identifying and reporting data leaks
investigated (Article 33 and 34 GDPR).
 
The AP has established that the Haga Hospital has not taken adequate measures with regard to
of the security aspects 'authentication' and 'control of the logging'. The Haga Hospital acts because of this
in violation of Article 32, first paragraph, preamble, of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the examined security aspects 'authorizations', 'logging of access' and
The AP does not find any violations for 'awareness of employees with regard to information security'.
 
The Haga Hospital has an internal data leak register; data leaks are registered there,
even if reporting to the AP and to those involved is not necessary. The AP concludes that the written policy of
the Haga Hospital with regard to the registration and reporting of data breaches is in accordance with
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR and that Article 24(2) of the GDPR is complied with in this regard.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background and aim of the study

 
The reason for the investigation is a report of a data breach from the Haga Hospital on April 4, 2018. The
concerns a data breach in which it was established by HagaZiekenhuis that 85 of its employees
have viewed data from a patient when he was admitted to the Haga Hospital, without doing so
competent, i.e. without being directly involved in the handling of the concerned
patient and/or were involved in the management settlement thereof. The patient was an acquaintance
Dutchman. In mid-April 2018, various media reports appeared about this.
 
The hospital has announced measures after questions from the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP).1 This
report contains the results of the further investigation into the security measures of the
HagaHospital. The investigation focuses on the situation in October 2018.
 
The main question in this research is the following:
Are the measures taken by the Haga Hospital to ensure that personal data
the digital patient file cannot be viewed by unauthorized employees, 'appropriate' as referred to in
Article 32 of the GDPR?
 
In this context, the AP has investigated the following aspects: authentication, authorizations, logging, control
of logging and employee awareness.
 
The AP has also investigated the procedures for reporting data breaches (Article 33, first paragraph).
paragraph, and Article 34, paragraph 1, of the GDPR).
 

1.2 Research progress

 
In a letter dated 12 October 2018, the AP initiated a further investigation and asked questions. The requested
information was provided by the Haga Hospital in a letter dated 23 October 2018.
 
On October 31, 2018, four AP employees conducted an on-site investigation at the
Haga Hospital, Leyweg location in The Hague, where the hospital information system was examined and
oral statements were also taken from [CONFIDENTIAL].
 
On November 19, 2018, the AP submitted the statements in writing to the Haga Hospital. It
Haga Hospital responded to this in writing on 29 November 2018.
 
On January 16, 2019, the AP sent the preliminary findings to the Haga Hospital. It
Haga Hospital responded in writing on February 4, 2019.
 

                                                                        
1 Following the report of the data breach, the AP asked the Haga Hospital on 23 April 2018 for information about
the data breach and the measures taken. This information was provided to the AP by letter dated 25 May 2018.

1.3 Legal framework

 
The data breach took place in January 2018, when the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp) was still in effect
was applicable. As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies,
as well as the GDPR Implementation Act (UAVG). The Wbp was also repealed on that date, pursuant to Article 51 of
the UAVG.
 
The investigation by the AP at the Haga Hospital focuses on the situation in October 2018; that is, after
the application of the GDPR.
 
Lawfulness of data processing
For employees of healthcare institutions, access to personal data about health in digitized
patient records only lawfully if and insofar as an employee is directly involved in the
treatment of or care to a patient and/or in the management of the management of that patient
treatment/care provision and access is limited to the data necessary for the
performance of the employee's duties. Incidentally, the personal data may only be
processed by persons who, pursuant to an office, profession or legal regulation or pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement are required. This results from the provisions of Article 9 of the GDPR, paragraph 2
under h2 and paragraph 33, article 30 of the UAVG, paragraph 3 under a4 and paragraph 45, and article 7:457 first and second paragraph Civil
Code (BW).6
 
 

                                                                        
2 “the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the
employee's fitness for work, medical diagnoses, the provision of health or social services or
treatment or management of healthcare systems and services or social systems and services, under Union law
or Member State law, or under a contract with a healthcare professional and subject to the provisions of paragraph 3
conditions and guarantees;”
3 “The personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in paragraph 2(h) where they
data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional who, under Union or Member State law
is bound by professional secrecy by law or by rules laid down by national competent authorities, or by another
person who also under Union or Member State law or under rules adopted by national competent authorities
secrecy has been kept.”
4 “In view of Article 9(2)(h) of the Regulation, the prohibition on processing health data does not apply to
applies if the processing is carried out by:

a.

care providers, institutions or facilities for health care or social services, to the extent that the
processing is necessary for the proper treatment or care of the data subject or the management of the data
concerning institution or professional practice;”

5 “If the first, second or third paragraph is applied, the data will only be processed by persons who
are obliged to observe secrecy by virtue of an office, profession or legal regulation or by virtue of an agreement. If the
controller processes personal data and not already on him by virtue of office, profession or law
is subject to a duty of confidentiality, he is obliged to observe secrecy with regard to the data, except insofar as the law
communication is required or the necessity arises from his task that the data be communicated to others who, pursuant to the
first, second or third paragraph are authorized to process it.”
6 “1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 448, paragraph 3, second sentence, the care provider shall ensure that persons other than the patient are not
information about the patient or inspection of or copies of the documents, referred to in Article 454, are provided then with
consent of the patient. If provision takes place, it will only take place insofar as this affects the personal privacy
of another is not harmed. The provision may be made without taking into account the restrictions referred to in the
previous sentences, if required by or pursuant to the law.
2. Others than the patient do not include those who are directly involved in the implementation of the
treatment agreement and the person who acts as a replacement for the care provider, insofar as the provision is necessary for
the work to be performed by them in that context.”

Security measures to be taken
Article 32, first paragraph, preamble, of the GDPR provides that the controller must provide appropriate technical
and organizational measures to ensure a security level that is appropriate to the risk for the data subject
guarantees. In doing so, the controller takes into account the available technology and the
execution costs and with the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing.
 
The 'Decree on electronic data processing by healthcare providers' includes further rules
established on functional, technical and organizational measures for electronic
data processing by healthcare providers. Pursuant to Article 3, second paragraph, and Article 5, first paragraph of the
By decision, a healthcare provider must act in the security and logging of its healthcare information system
in accordance with the provisions of NEN 7510 and NEN 7513.7.8 The standards NEN 7510 and NEN 7513 contain
thus a mandatory further implementation of Article 32 of the GDPR with regard to a safe and careful
use of the healthcare information system of the healthcare provider. That is why the AP uses the provisions in NEN
7510 and NEN 7513 as a standard for the assessment of 'appropriate technical and
organizational measures'.
 
The following requirements from NEN 7510 and NEN 7513 are involved in the assessment of the appropriate level of:
the measures taken by the hospital in the field of access to data in
electronic patient records:

- Users are identified based on two-factor authentication.9
-
-

There is an access control policy for granting access to information.10
Log files are created to establish irrefutably afterwards which events
have taken place on a patient file.11,12

- The log files are regularly checked for indications of unauthorized access or

unlawful use of personal data.13

- Employees are made aware of their responsibilities in the area of

information security.14

 
These standards are further elaborated in Chapter 2 of this report.
 
Reporting data breaches
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR contain the 'obligation to report', which is known in common parlance
data breaches', the obligation to report a personal data breach to the
supervisory authority and the data subject.15 Pursuant to Article 24(2) of the GDPR, a
controller, when this is proportionate to the processing activities
about an appropriate data protection policy that is also implemented. These standards are further
detailed in Chapter 2 of this report.

2.1.2

 
Processing of patient data in the hospital information system
 
The subject of the AP's investigation is the processing of patient data in the
hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
The data relating to patients who enter the Haga Hospital in the hospital information system
processed, are personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR16, as it contains information about
identified17 natural persons. Some of this data is 'health data' in
within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR and therefore qualify as special personal data.
 
Furthermore, there is a processing of personal data within the meaning of Article 4(2) of the GDPR.18 By
its scope, the term "processing" includes any possible operation or set of operations of
personal data. Consulting patient data in the hospital information system also falls there
below.
 
Responsible
 
Since 2013, the Haga Hospital19 has formed together with the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft and (since 2015) the
LangeLand Hospital in Zoetermeer the (foundation) Reinier Haga Groep (RHG).20 Because of this
partnership, the question must be answered as to which organization
controller21 is for the processing of patient data in the
hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
In this context, the AP considers that it has become apparent that the management of the Haga Hospital independently
and determines the management of the hospital information system. There is talk of an administrative merger and no
legal merger between the hospitals of the RHG and the hospitals within the RHG are system-technical

                                                                        
16Article 4(1) of the GDPR: “personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
(“the data subject”); considered identifiable is a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or from
one or more elements characteristic of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social
identity of that natural person;”
17 Because, among other things, name and address details and also the citizen service number are processed, the identity of the persons is established and concerns
so identified persons.
18 Article 4(2) of the GDPR: ““processing” means an operation or set of operations on personal data or
a set of personal data, whether or not carried out via automated processes, such as collecting, recording, arranging,
structure, store, update or modify, retrieve, consult, use, provide by forwarding, dissemination
or otherwise make available, align or combine, block, erase or destroy data;”.

separated.22 The general RHG information security policy23 is further elaborated locally and the
Haga Hospital has its own authorization policy for digital patient files.24 In view of this, the AP of
believes that the HagaZiekenhuis foundation is the controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR
for the processing of patient data in the hospital information system of the Haga Hospital.
 
The AP notes that the RHG foundation could become a co-controller as a co-controller
designated. The board of directors of the RHG foundation is responsible for the development and implementation
of hospital policy and the management and organization of hospital organisations.25 Nevertheless, the
The management of the Haga Hospital has the most say over the local implementation of the policy and thus
Haga Hospital must be regarded as the (main) controller.
 

2.2 Authorizations (access control policy)

 

2.2.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

 
Standard 9.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates that access to information must be limited. To this end
- inter alia – to establish an access security policy.26
 
Specifically for healthcare institutions, they must control access to health information. In the
In general, users of health information systems should limit their access to personal
limit health information to situations:
a) in which there is a relationship of care between the user and the person to whom the data relates
have (the client whose personal health information is being accessed);
b) in which the user performs an activity on behalf of the person to whom the data relates;
c) where specific data is needed to support this activity.
 
In addition, organizations that process personal health information should have an access control policy
(authorisations) that regulate access to this data. The policy of the
organization with regard to access control should be established on the basis of prior
defined roles with associated privileges that match, but are limited to, the needs of
the roll.
 
The access control policy, as part of the information security policy framework, should be
reflect professional, ethical, legal and client-related requirements and the duties that
performed by caregivers, and taking into account the workflow of the task.
 
The healthcare facility should have appropriate access security rules, ‐rights and ‐restrictions for specific

the controls are a reflection of the related information security risks.

2.2.2

It is also important that, in order to prevent the provision of care from being delayed or stalled, more powerful
requirements then usually apply to a clear policy and process, with associated authorization, to ensure 'normal'
circumvent access control rules in emergency situations.27
 
In concrete terms, the above means with regard to a health care information system that the health care institution plays a role
and associated authorizations must be established and applied. Those authorizations should be 'appropriate'. That
means that (the need for) access to health information and the restrictions on access
depend on the role of the healthcare worker and the relationship with the patient (as shown, for example, by
treatment plan, work context, specialism, department, consultation), including the proper execution of the tasks that
are performed by health care providers.28
 
Actual findings
 
The AP notes that the Haga Hospital has an authorization policy based on:
authorization profiles (roles/role-based access).29
 
The starting point of the authorization policy is that employees in the Haga Hospital only have access
have access to patient data if they have a treatment agreement with the patient or if they
are directly involved in the performance of a treatment agreement that involves a (other)
care provider within the organization has with the patient or act as a replacement for that other
healthcare provider (in summary, having a treatment relationship). An employee must only have access
to have access to the data necessary for his task in the context of the treatment agreement.
This concerns not only medical but also administrative support and management of the
institution, insofar as the data is necessary for this (for example, registering a patient,
scheduling appointments, performing checks).30
 
According to the policy, the powers are limited to those patients with whom a logically
treatment relationship. The treatment relationship corresponds to the employee's work context.31 This also follows
from the authorization matrix sent by the hospital32 Incidentally, it follows from the authorization policy that
access to data should also be limited in time, i.e. for a period of one year, necessary to
to complete work in the context of the treatment relationship.33
 
The AP notes that restrictions in access are concretely implemented because the authorizations of doctors,
physician assistants, nurses and other support staff are based on the
specialism or the department for which they work or it was requested in consultation with a certain patient

to be. Access to information from sensitive specialties (psychology, psychiatry, medical social
work and sexology) is hospital-wide shielded. 34.35
 
In cases where the required data availability for healthcare differs from the set
authorization, the hospital has a specific emergency button procedure (also known as “Breaking the glass”
named). The screen shown contains a warning where the user must state the reason for access
36 The emergency button procedure is displayed when:
- an employee visits a patient who is not known to the department/specialism for which there are rights
are set. This means that it cannot be found in the outpatient clinic planning, work list or department occupancy list
of the department(s)/specialism.
- an employee opens a file of a specialty for which one has no rights.37,38
 
The hospital also has a pseudonym procedure for shielding a patient on the
emergency department or an in-patient when they need to be shielded from visiting or
family (for example, when there is abuse or deprivation of parental authority) or
when the patient cannot be found by searching by name via the 'search patient'
functionality (e.g. known person or employee of the Haga Hospital).39
 

2.2.3 Assessment

 
In this study, the AP assesses the policy with regard to the granting of authorizations
(access control policy) and its application in a general sense. The AP does not assess the individual
authorizations40 of employees/roles.
 
The AP concludes that a context-bound method of authorization of employees is provided, that it is
policy for setting authorizations has been carefully designed and that the correct principles
are used. The AP establishes on the basis of the statements of employees and the
Haga Hospital provided documents that this policy is being implemented. That means it
Haga Hospital on the point of access control policy complies with standard 9.1.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) and
this means that appropriate measures are taken with regard to access control policy as required
pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR.

2.3 Authentication

 

2.3.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

2.3.2

 
Standard 9.4. of NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates that unauthorized access to systems and applications must be
will be prevented. Health information systems that process personal health information41
include - among other things - establishing the identity of users and this should be done
through authentication involving at least two factors42.43
This means that to access patient data in the hospital information system of the
Haga Hospital must have two-factor authentication. For example, authentication through
something the user knows (a password or PIN) and something the user has (a token or
smart card).
 
Actual findings
 
The AP has established that authentication of the identity of the employee in the Haga Hospital takes two
ways is possible. Firstly, users can log in to the virtual workplace (VDI)44 by using the
holding a staff card in front of a card reader. Then the user enters his username, the
password and a four-digit (user-specified fixed) PIN. There is a single
sign-on' functionality, which allows access to the VDI once logged in to the VDI
hospital information system.45 The user can then spend four hours at any workstation with the pass
log out and log in without entering a username, password and/or pin code.46,47
 
Secondly, the user can log in to the VDI and the hospital information system without a staff card
with a username and password, for example if the employee has forgotten the personnel card.48,49
 

2.3.3 Assessment

 
The strength of user authentication should be appropriate for the classification of the information
to which access is granted. In the hospital information system, data about health
processed and requires two-factor authentication. Since users can access the
data in the digital patient records using only something a user knows (namely a username
and password) in that case one factor is used. This does not comply with the

                                                                        
41 NEN 7510-1 (2017), 3.44: “Information about an identifiable person related to the physical or mental
condition of, or the provision of care services to, the person concerned.”
42 In general, three factors are distinguished: something the user knows (a password or PIN); something that the
user has (for example, a token); or something that the user is (a biometric metric). (Source: NCSC, Use two-factor
authentication. All passwords are not always enough. Factsheet FS-2015-02, version 1.1. October 22, 2018).

requirement of two-factor authentication. The Haga Hospital does not comply with standard 9.4.1 of the NEN on this point
7510-2 (2017) and therefore there are no appropriate measures with regard to authentication such as
required under Article 32(1) of the GDPR.
 

2.4 Logging

 

2.4.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

 
Standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) stipulates, among other things, that log files should be made from
events that affect user activities, exceptions, and information security events
register.50
 
In addition, it follows from standard 5.1 of NEN 7513 (2018) that logging in general must make it possible
to establish irrefutably afterwards which events have taken place on a
patient record. The system must, among other things, keep track of which event has occurred, the date
and the time of the event, which client was involved and who the user was.
 
Furthermore, it is important that all events involving actions related to a
patient file (including viewing data) are logged;51 also events that are not covered
under normal data access procedures, such as applying an emergency procedure (such as
the “Breaking the glass” procedure).52
 
Actual findings
 
The Haga Hospital logs every access to digital patient files in the hospital information system, both
access via the emergency button procedure and beyond. The logging shows which employee is on a
has had access to the electronic patient record of the
patient.53,54,55
 

2.4.2

2.4.3 Assessment

 
The Haga Hospital logs all access to patient files and the log files offer the possibility to:
to determine afterwards whether there has been abuse. With this, the Haga Hospital complies with what
is specified in the NEN 7510 and 7513. This means that appropriate measures are taken with regard to
logging as required under Article 32 of the GDPR.

2.5 Checking the logging

 

2.5.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

2.5.2

 
Registration and auditing requirements are among the most important of all security requirements
for protecting personal health information. These requirements guarantee accountability for
clients who entrust their information to electronic medical record registration systems and
are also a powerful incentive for the users of such systems to
acceptable use of these systems. Effective auditing and registration can contribute to
demonstrating misuse of health information systems or of personal health information.
These processes can also help organizations and clients obtain compensation from users
who abuse their access rights. Requirements for event registration are detailed in NEN
7513 discussed (explanation of standard 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017)).
 
Norm 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 (2017) therefore stipulates that log files should be regularly
assessed. The AP uses the principle that there must be systematic, consistent
control of all logging. A random check and/or a check based on complaints is not
sufficient to fulfill this. The AP has included these principles in its report on security
of digital patient records in 2013. It is also indicated that hospitals should
striving for 'more intelligent' analysis and/or control of the logging.56 With these principles, the AP refers to
the presence of a risk-oriented system in the checks, of which the only random
random checks and/or checks based on complaints of only a few files per year
there is no question.
 
Actual findings
 
The policy for checking the logging of the Haga Hospital is, in view of the Authorization Policy and
statements from Haga57.58, that periodically, i.e. once every two months, a check on the logging
takes place by means of a random sample of 1 patient file. The authorization policy describes the
intended checks on the logging:“A failed access attempt as well as a realized access to
a digital file outside the treatment relationship, realized via the emergency button procedure, will be stored via this logging

                                                                        
56 See also report “Access to digital patient files within healthcare institutions” (2013), p. 13, 15-16 and 17.
p. 13;” The Dutch DPA also notes that the examined care institutions do not provide for a systematic, consistent check of
all logs. At the most, there is control of the logging when using the emergency button, which – often – is also limited to:
random checks or checks based on complaints. Healthcare institutions where there is no systematic control of all logging
therefore do not comply with Article 13 Wbp.” (…) P.16:” The obligation to log to prevent unauthorized access
as included in the NEN standards implies that the logging is actually checked. That control constitutes a
essential part of access security and is all the more important where in healthcare institutions the authorization – for the time being –
falls short. If healthcare institutions improve those authorizations, the analysis of the logging may also be approached more 'intelligently'
could be." (…) P.17: “The researched health care institutions does not provide for a systematic, consistent control of
all logs. At the most, there is control of the logging when using the emergency button, which – often – is also limited to:
random checks or checks based on complaints. The obligation to check the logging in order to check whether
access to patient data is limited to situations where it is lawful, logically follows from the obligation to
logging as included in NEN 7510 and NEN 7513. Healthcare institutions where no systematic control of all logging takes place,
therefore do not comply with Article 13.” (https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/sites/default/files/downloads/mijn_privacy/rap_2013-

are regularly checked for legality. Such checks will be carried out for regular

treatment in the specialties of psychiatry, psychology, VIP, own staff and in relation to
venereal diseases will be carried out in total.59
 
The AP has established that, in fact, in the period from January to October 2018, a check of the logging
has taken place with regard to the file of the patient referred to in paragraph 1.1 in accordance with the
authorization policy.60,61 In view of the number of inspections in this specific file, further investigation has been initiated into
(un)lawful access.62
In addition, during that period, requests from patients and employees were subject to checks in six files
unauthorized access. No irregularities have emerged from these checks
come.63,64,65
 
There is no question of checking the logging of all files by selecting for striking deviations or
outliers, nor is automatic signaling used when certain limits are exceeded
limits.66.67
 
The Haga Hospital has indicated that it intends to take six random samples
do in 2019, in accordance with the policy. In addition, access to the file of six different patients is
from different departments.68,69
 

2.5.3 Assessment

 
The policy for checking the logging of the Haga Hospital regulates that checking the legality of
access to patient records is through the logging of a random sample of six . yearly
patient records, taking into account failed access attempts as well as realized access to the
digital file outside the treatment relationship, realized via the emergency button procedure. If a selected
file belongs to one of the five 'sensitive' groups, the logging of that file must be complete
checked.
 
However, checking the logging of a random sample of six patient records annually,
the Haga Hospital does not have a policy with regard to systematic, risk-oriented or intelligent control of the

log. In practice, too, no systematic control of the logging has taken place, because the
checks that did take place in the past period were as a result of some complaints and
requests but not risk-oriented and furthermore insufficient in size, given the scale of the processing of
the hospital. This means that the Haga Hospital does not comply with the standard 12.4.1 of the NEN 7510-2
(2017). This means that there are no appropriate measures with regard to monitoring the logging such as
required under Article 32(1) of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the planned checks for 2019, the AP notes that a random sample check of
six patient files per year is in any case not sufficient to meet the standard of systematic,
risk-oriented or intelligent control.
 

2.6 Employee awareness

 

2.6.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

 
The hospital should make employees aware of their responsibilities regarding the
information security. This includes all employees undergoing appropriate awareness education and training
receive and regularly update organizational policies and procedures, as relevant
for the function. Employees should be made aware of disciplinary processes and consequences with
regarding information security violations. An awareness program should also be
established, with a number of activities, such as campaigns and the distribution of newsletters. This follows from
standard 7.2.2 of NEN 7510-2 (2017).
 
Actual findings
 
The Haga Hospital provides information about information security as part of the
induction program for new employees, in work meetings and on the intranet. Furthermore, it has
hospital participated in a national employee awareness campaign focused on the
importance of information security. In addition, AVG workshops have been held and all RHG
employees received a letter with an explanation as a result of the data breach in the second quarter of 2018
about the standard and possible sanctions.70,71,72

2.7 Conclusion on security aspects (Article 32 GDPR)

 
The AP has established that the Haga Hospital has not taken adequate measures with regard to
of the security aspects 'authentication' and 'control of the logging'. The Haga Hospital acts as a result of this
in violation of Article 32, first paragraph, preamble, of the GDPR.
 
With regard to the examined security aspects 'authorizations', 'logging of access' and
The AP does not find any violations for 'awareness of employees with regard to information security'.
 

2.8 Reporting data breaches

 

2.8.1 Elaboration of the legal framework

 
General
Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR contain the 'obligation to report', which is known in common parlance
data breaches', the obligation to report a personal data breach to the
supervisory authority and the data subject.73
 
data breach
The term 'data breach' does not appear in the law. Instead, the GDPR refers to a “breach of connection”
with personal data'.74 This is the case in the event of a security breach that is accidentally or
unlawfully leads to the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or
unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
 
Examples of data breaches include the loss of a USB stick containing unencrypted personal data, a
cyber attack in which personal data is stolen or a ransomware infection in which
personal data has been made inaccessible.
 
But unauthorized access to personal data is also a data breach. For example, in the case where
hospital staff can view a patient's medical personal data75 without doing so
competent, i.e. without being directly involved in the handling of the concerned
patient and/or were involved in the management settlement thereof.
 
Data breach notification obligation
In the event of a data breach (a breach), the controller has to deal with two different reporting obligations:
(a) there is a reporting obligation to the AP (Article 33 GDPR); and
(b) there is a duty to report to the data subject whose personal data is concerned (Article 34 GDPR).
 
A personal data breach must always be reported to the AP, 'unless it's not'
it is probable that the infringement poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”
(Article 33(1) of the GDPR).

                                                                        
73 MvT to the GDPR. Parliamentary paper 34851, no. 3, p. 56-57.
74 Article 4(12) of the GDPR: . personal data breach” means a breach of security that is accidental or
unlawfully leads to the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of, or the unauthorized
access to data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed; “
75 For example, in the case of 'consulting' and 'requesting' personal data, there is already a 'processing' of personal data in
the meaning of the GDPR (Article 4(2) of the GDPR).

Final report 2019

Furthermore, a personal data breach must be notified to the data subject if it
an infringement is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons (Article 34 (1) GDPR).
 
The threshold for communicating a breach to data subjects is therefore higher than that for reporting a breach
a breach of the supervisory authority. Not all breaches need to be disclosed to data subjects
reported, in order to avoid unnecessary notification fatigue.76 The controller should
assessment of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons taking into account the
specific circumstances of the infringement. In the 'Guidelines on the obligation to report data breaches'77, this
assessment by the controllers in more detail.
 
However, even if health data is involved, not every unauthorized access by an employee
of a healthcare institution leads to a probability of harm to the person concerned and thus to a high
risk. Because not every unauthorized access is intentional or is done with wrong (unprofessional)
intentions, such as curiosity. For example, if a wrong file is opened by mistake, or
if it turns out afterwards that it was not necessary to view data from a particular patient. In these cases
is the patient still protected by the healthcare professional's professional ethics or
support employee and it is not necessary - without further ado - to assume a 'probably'
(high) risk' for the person concerned. However, it must always be determined according to the specific circumstances of the case
looked. These cases must be distinguished from cases in which the
(intentional) violation of professional ethics. For example if out of curiosity and without professional
reason has been looked into a medical file (for example, in the file of a famous person, or of a
relative or acquaintance.78) In such cases, it is likely that the infringement will result in a high
risk for the data subject and the infringement must be reported to the AP and to the data subject.
 
Administration obligation data leaks
In addition, the controller has an administrative obligation with regard to infringements
in connection with personal data. It follows from Article 33 paragraph 5 of the GDPR that 'all infringements', so also not
notifiable breaches must be recorded.
 
Written procedure for reporting data breaches
Pursuant to Article 24, second paragraph, of the GDPR, a controller must, where required
proportionate to the processing activities, to have an appropriate
data protection policy that is also implemented. That means that the Haga Hospital, because
many medical personal data79 are processed within it, as part of the
                                                                        
76 Working Group “Article 29”, Guidelines for the reporting of personal data breaches under Regulation
2016/679, (Last revised and approved on 6 February 2018), (hereinafter: “WP 29 Guidelines”), p. 23.

In dealing with confidential and medical personal data, practice shows that this professional ethics is not always observed.
An example is the case that prompted this investigation.

data protection policy must have a policy or written procedure for
reporting data breaches and this policy must also be implemented in practice.
 
Actual findings
 
The AP notes that the Haga Hospital has a specific written procedure for
data leaks80 and the interviews have shown that the procedure is understood.81 This procedure
describes, in addition to a part of the standard explanation, the procedure to be followed if an employee of the Haga Hospital
reports a possible data breach.
The procedure also mentions a number of examples of data breaches. There is a Commission
Data Breach, which consists of the Data Protection Officer and the Information Security Officer,
the executive secretary, the Communications manager and the HR manager. If there is a large-scale
data breach, the Commission can be expanded. The AP also notes that the Haga Hospital is an internal
has a register in which incidents are registered.82
 

2.8.3 Assessment

 
The AP concludes that the Haga Hospital has an internal data leak register and that the procedure
of the Haga Hospital with regard to registering and reporting data breaches, as described in the
document 'Procedure Notification Data Leak Haga Hospital' provides an appropriate interpretation of the obligations
of the Haga Hospital with regard to registering and reporting data leaks that follow from the articles
33 and 34 of the GDPR. Because the Haga Hospital has an appropriate written procedure at its disposal,
with regard to data leaks, Article 24, second paragraph, of the GDPR is complied with in this respect.
 
The AP notes that the 'unauthorized access by its own employees to data about the health of'
patients' is not mentioned as an example in the 'Procedure Notification Data Leak Haga Hospital'. The AP recommends
the Haga Hospital to supplement the document on this point.

3.1 Appendix 1: Response to Haga Hospital's opinion

 

 
In a letter with an attachment dated January 16, 2019, the AP sent the Haga Hospital a draft of the present
research report, with a request to comment on it. The Haga Hospital made that
possibility of use in letter dated 4 February 2019. This appendix contains a response to this opinion.
 
General
In response to the Haga Hospital's view, the draft research report has been
points adjusted. It concerns only some textual adjustments.
 
The substantive view of the Haga Hospital focuses on two parts of the concept
research report, namely 'control of the logging' and 'authentication'. Those topics will come next
the order.
 
1. Checking the logging
 
Haga Hospital's view:
In its view, the Haga Hospital notes that the AP in its assessment in section 2.5.3 (Assessment
control logging) states that the number of random checks of six patient records is not sufficient to meet
meet the standard of systematic control. In response, the Haga Hospital has indicated that
the NEN 7510 and 7513 do not speak of numbers, but of 'regular' checks. The Haga Hospital has
requested the AP to indicate on the basis of which standard or policy it comes to the conclusion that six
samples would not be sufficient to meet the standard.
 
Response AP:
The standard with regard to the control of logging has already been elaborated in section 2.5.1. This states
described that checks on the basis of NEN 7510 must take place 'regularly' and that the AP
The basic principle is that access control is systematic and consistent. A
random checks and/or a check on the basis of complaints is not sufficient to give substance
to systematic and consistent access control. The AP has also described this principle in the
previously published report 'Access to digital patient files within healthcare institutions' (2013), p 13, 15-16
and 17.84
 
Haga Hospital's view:
The Haga Hospital has stated in its view that it is expressly striving for more intelligent analysis
of logging and developments in this area closely. Soon the supplier will
give the first presentation of such a recently delivered module at the Haga Hospital.
 
Response AP:
The AP takes note of the fact that the Haga Hospital is emphatically striving for 'more intelligent' analysis and/or analysis.
checking the log. This does not alter the fact that the Haga Hospital does not yet meet the requirement of
systematic consistent access control,
 
2. Authentication
 
Haga Hospital's view:
In its view, the Haga Hospital indicates that the AP in its assessment of the authentication (section
2.3.3 Assessment) rightly states that this is insufficient and that in consultation with [CONFIDENTIAL] in the short term
in due course the practical applicability of improvement measures in this regard is mapped and
discussed in consultation with [CONFIDENTIAL].

improvement measures with regard to user authentication are mapped out. This takes
This does not mean that the Haga Hospital has currently insufficiently fulfilled the requirements for the
authentication of users.
