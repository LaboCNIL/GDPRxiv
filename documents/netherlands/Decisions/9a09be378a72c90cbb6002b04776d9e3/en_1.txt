Dear [CONFIDENTIAL],
 
Below you will find the decision of the AP to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments, which you as
authorized representative of Theodoor Gilissen Bank (TGB). This decision is part of
the further decision of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) on the objection that [APPLICANT]
filed against the decision of the AP of 7 September 2016, reference [CONFIDENTIAL] (primary
decision).
 
1 Introduction
 

1. [APPLICANT] submitted a request to TGB on the basis of Article 35 of the Protection Act

personal data (Wbp). In it he asked for:
-an overview of the personal data relating to [APPLICANT] that are collected by TGB
incorporated;
-a copy of chat messages exchanged between [APPLICANT] and his account manager at TGB -
[CONFIDENTIAL] – in an investor chat room [CONFIDENTIAL];
-a copy of an internal instruction from the head of the Internal Audit Service of TGB about the
make arrangements with [APPLICANT].
  

2. The request was rejected by TGB. [APPLICANT] subsequently requested the AP to take enforcement action

steps.

2. Course of the procedure
 

3. By letter dated 11 August 2016, received on 15 August 2016, [APPLICANT] requested

enforcement filed with the AP.
 

4. By primary decision of September 7, 2016, the AP decided on the enforcement request and

request rejected.
 

5. By letter dated September 30, 2016, received on October 3, 2016, Mr [APPLICANT] sent a

filed an appeal against the decision of 7 September 2016.

 

6. Given the opportunity to do so, TGB has provided a written explanation.

 

7. A hearing was held on 14 December 2016. A report was made of the hearing.

 

8. By decision on the objection of 27 January 2017, the AP revoked the primary decision and instead

decision made a new decision. The AP has received the enforcement request that concerns not providing
of an overview and additional information as referred to in Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wbp assigned
and has also made it known that it intends to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments on TGB.

 

9. In a separate letter dated January 27, 2017, the AP sent TGB an intention to impose an order

sent under duress.

 

10. TGB and [APPLICANT] have submitted further documents.

 

11. A hearing was held on 16 February 2017 in response to the intention. Of this

hearing, a report has been made. This is attached as Annex 1 to this Decree.

 

12. TGB and [APPLICANT] have submitted further documents.

 
3. Part I of the decision on objection: decision of 27 January 2017
 

13. The objection lodged by [APPLICANT] against the primary decision was declared well-founded by the decision

on objection of 27 January 2017 with reference [CONFIDENTIAL] (appendix 2). The AP has ruled that
TGB violates Article 35 of the Wbp, because it does not provide at least an overview accompanied by additional
has provided information of the personal data it has processed about [APPLICANT]. The AP has
the enforcement request that concerns not providing an overview and additional information if
referred to in Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wbp. The AP has TGB and [APPLICANT]
subsequently made known simultaneously with the declaration of the objection that it intends to
to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments, meaning that TGB will provide the following information to Mr
[APPLICANT] must provide:
(1) a complete overview in comprehensible form of the data subject concerning personal data;

(2) a description of the purpose or purposes of the processing;
(3) the categories of data to which the processing relates;
(4) the recipients or categories of recipients as well as
(5) the available information on the origin of the data.
 
4. Part II of the decision on objection: follow-up to the intention to impose the order
 

14. TGB has put forward a view on the intention to impose an order under
penalty. TGB argues in this that the AP must renege on its intention to impose an order under
to impose coercion. In that context, TGB first of all argues that the [APPLICANT] abused the
right of inspection. In the event that this view is not followed, TGB argues that Article 35 of the
Wbp does not provide a right to a copy of documents and that it is not obliged to carry out internal analyzes and the
record of deliberation to [APPLICANT]. It further argues that the provision of
an overview of personal data relating to [APPLICANT] a disproportionate
effort from TGB.
  

15. TGB's arguments are discussed below.

 

16. The legal framework is attached as Annex 3 to this Decree.

 
Abuse of law
-argument TGB

17. TGB states first and foremost that it has been established that [APPLICANT] abuses the right of access. To this end, TGB

to the judgment of the District Court of The Hague of 2 February 2017 in case no. C/09/516394 / HA RK 16-400 (the
verdict). With that judgment, the court rejected the [APPLICANT]'s request for TGB
on the basis of Article 46 of the Wbp to still grant his request as referred to in Article 35 of the Wbp
to point. To this end, the court considered that the [APPLICANT]'s request does not comply with the
objectives of the Wpb, because it has not been made plausible that [APPLICANT] is concerned about the correctness and
wants to verify the lawfulness of the processing of his personal data. This makes
[APPLICANT] abuse of the right of access, as stated in the judgment. TGB argues that the AP is
determination of the court that there is abuse of rights is bound. To this end, TGB argues that
the court has established the legal relationship between [APPLICANT] and TGB pursuant to Article 46 of the Wbp
determined, to the effect that [APPLICANT] in this case cannot invoke the right of inspection under the Wbp
due. In any case, the AP must be very cautious when assessing whether
[APPLICANT] may make use of the right of inspection, argues TGB. TGB has to substantiate
this position referred to the parliamentary history of the Enforcement Act
consumer protection, which expresses that responsibility for
acting with due care in consumer matters rests with the consumer and the service provider, so that in the cases
in which they can come to a solution themselves, enforcement action by the Consumer Authority
(currently: Authority for Consumers and Markets) has not been designated.

Furthermore, TGB argues that another decision by the AP leads to a violation of the trias politica,

 
combination with the imposition of an order subject to periodic penalty payments leads to the same legal action being taken twice
is used. At the hearing on February 16, 2017, TGB clarified that its objection
it is particularly appropriate that in both proceedings it is requested to carry out on pain of a penalty
the obligation to submit documents.
  
from which it follows that the AP, as part of the administrative power, determines the legal relationship
to be followed by the judiciary. Moreover, according to TGB, a different decision leads to a violation
of the principle of legal certainty, trust and due care. TGB can rely on it
that the decision of the court is binding on the administrative body charged with supervising the
implementation of the Wbp, argues TGB.
  
it acts contrary to a legal obligation and thus commits an unlawful act in principle.
  

Finally, TGB argues that if the AP does not consider itself bound by the judgment of the court,

18. Also irrespective of the decision of the court, TGB argues that [APPLICANT] abuses the

right of inspection. According to TGB it is established that [APPLICANT] uses the right of access for a purpose other than
checking whether his personal data have been processed correctly and lawfully: according to TGB,
[APPLICANT] use the data (exclusively) as evidence in a civil court
liability proceedings against TGB. However, the right of access is intended to enable a data subject to
to check whether his personal data has been processed correctly and lawfully
with reference to recital 41 to Directive 95/46 (the Directive). Now the [APPLICANT]
If this is not the case, he abuses the right of inspection, according to TGB. In support, TGB points to a
judgment of the ECtHR of 4 January 2007, NJ 2007, 475 (Smith), from which, in its view, it follows that if the
right of access is not used for the purpose for which it was granted, the request for access is out of reach
of the privacy regulations. Furthermore, TGB has referred to a judgment of the Court of Justice of
17 July 2014, ECLI:EU:C:2014:2081, from which it follows that, when assessing a
According to TGB, the request for access must check whether the purpose of that request is consistent with the purpose of the Wbp.
 
-position [APPLICANT]

19. [APPLICANT] takes the position that an administrative enforcement procedure – otherwise
than TGB argues – can coexist with civil proceedings. In that context, [APPLICANT]
indicates that the AP is authorized to proceed with enforcement independently of the request of [APPLICANT]. Furthermore
[APPLICANT] has indicated that an appeal has been lodged against the judgment of the court. ten
finally, [APPLICANT] referred to a judgment of the District Court of Central Netherlands, in which this
court in a similar case – in which another applicant invokes Article 46 of the
Wbp wanted to obtain an overview of personal data processed by TGB – came to the conclusion
that there is no abuse of rights.
 
-judgment court

20. The relevant considerations from the court's judgment are as follows:

3.9 Various civil proceedings are (or have been) pending between the parties, in which [APPLICANT]
TGB accuses of having failed imputably in the fulfillment of its obligations
towards [APPLICANT]. It has been argued without dispute by TGB that [APPLICANT]
has already attempted to obtain requested documents through civil proceedings, including
invoking Articles 22, 85 and 843a DCCP. and that the parties also initiate summary proceedings
before the preliminary relief judge of the Amsterdam District Court. In all procedures
the request rejected.

3.10 The court is of the opinion that the present request of [APPLICANT] does not comply with
the objective of the Wbp. It has become sufficiently plausible that [APPLICANT] with his
request is not intended to question the correctness and lawfulness of the processing of
to clear his personal data. From the documents submitted and the oral
treatment it became apparent that [APPLICANT] made the request for the purpose of filing documents
to get hands that he wants as evidence in the underlying proceedings against TGB
to use. This is abundantly clear from [APPLICANT]'s additional request in which he
requests, among other things, to be provided with all documentation showing that TGB on
or actually closed positions of [APPLICANT] about 19 September 2008.
[APPLICANT] thereby abuses his right of access as referred to in Article 35 Wbp.
 

-review AP

21. The AP comes to the following assessment.

  

22. Contrary to what TGB argues, the AP considers that it is not bound by the determination of the

legal relationship between [APPLICANT] and TGB by the court. To this end, the AP points out the following.
It follows from the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv) that in an unassailable judgment:
decisions about a legal relationship in dispute between the parties have binding force, see article 236,
first member, Rv. The AP itself is not a party to the dispute in which the judgment was rendered. Only TGB and
After all, the [APPLICANT] is a party to the dispute before the court. Therefore, the decision of the
court for the AP does not have binding force. In addition, [APPLICANT] has appeal
instituted against the judgment of the court, so that there is no question of an unchallengeable ruling that
has been given res judicata. In view of the foregoing, the AP rejects TGB's conclusion that the AP
acts unlawfully if it does not consider itself bound by the judgment.
 

23. In the opinion of the AP, there is also no reason to conclude that, in view of the judgment, the AP

should be restrained. In this context, the AP considers that it has been designated as the competent
administrative body that supervises the processing of personal data in accordance with the
determined pursuant to the law (Article 51(1) of the Wbp). In addition, the AP, in view of the
public interest served by enforcement, is in principle bound in the event of a violation
to take enforcement action.1 In that context, the AP has its own responsibility in supervising
compliance with the Wbp, and for that reason too there is no obligation for it to comply with the judgment
to be restrained. In addition, the Wbp system is characterized by a differentiated

system of enforcement (and legal protection), in which the civil and administrative avenues
coexistence.2 In view of the legal system, both procedures can coexist: the law
leaves room for the existence of proceedings before a civil court on the basis of Article 46 of the Wbp
in addition to administrative enforcement by the AP. In view of this, the AP – apart from the question of how this is done in the
consumer law is regulated – not the conservative attitude advocated by TGB.
 

24. In view of the foregoing, the AP sees reason to independently investigate whether [APPLICANT] abuse

exercise his right of access. In doing so, it will take into account the conclusions of the court in its
judgment, by explicitly assessing whether – and if not why not – the AP supports the conclusions of the court
shares. Contrary to what TGB argues, this is not in conflict with the Trias Politica, the legal certainty,
principle of trust or due care. Because the court's judgment was not rendered in a
procedure to which the AP is a party, the AP is not bound by the decisions in that judgment as above
has already been explained. From the point of view of due care, that judgment must be taken into account
kept, which the AP does in this way. There is no further question of aroused confidence by the AP,
now that it is necessary that commitments attributable to the administrative body have been made. such a
commitment has not been made. A decision in a court judgment to which the AP is not a party is
further not attributable to the AP.

 

25. Nor is there any reason to conclude that enforcement action by the AP in this case is contrary

would come up with the ne bis in idem principle (or, the AP adds, the una via principle). Both principles
are only applicable if there is a 'criminal charge' as referred to in Article 6,
first paragraph, of the ECHR. Only if the first procedure extends to 'determination of a criminal charge',
a second prosecution of the same offense is not permitted.3 Now the imposition of a charge under
penalty payment is a sanction aimed at restoring the legal situation, there is no question of
a criminal charge, so the principles do not apply.

 

26. When assessing whether [APPLICANT] is abusing the right of access, the following applies:

interest. As the AP has stated in the decision on the objection of 27 January 2017 (under marginal 21)
there is a misuse of rights if a power is exercised for no other purpose
than to harm another or for a purpose other than that for which it was granted or in case one, in
taking into account the disproportion between the interest in the exercise and the interest thereby
is harmed, could not reasonably have been exercised (Article 3:13, second paragraph, of
the Civil Code).

 

27. In addition, the decision on the objection of 27 January 2017 states that the Wbp gives everyone the right

freely and at reasonable intervals to contact the responsible person with the request
to state whether personal data concerning him are being processed and that the interest in such

request is presupposed by the Wbp (also under marginal 21 of that decision).4
 

28. The presupposition of the interest in invoking the right of access does not mean that the motive
by which a data subject invokes the right of access is not relevant: in line with the judgment of the
Den Bosch Court of 16 January 2006, NJF 2006, 91 (Dexia), the AP is of the opinion that, partly in view of the argument
of TGB that there is abuse of rights, it must be examined whether the request in
agreement has been made with the purpose of Article 35 of the Wbp. This also ties in with the TGB
cited Smith judgment.
 

29. The purpose of Article 35 of the Wbp is to give the data subject ([APPLICANT]) the opportunity to

to check whether and, if so, which personal data concerning him are processed by the person responsible (TGB)
processed, and whether the representation of his personal data in the processing of TGB is correct, for the purpose or
the purposes of the processing are complete and relevant and whether TGB collects its personal data
processed in accordance with legal regulations.5
  

30. [APPLICANT] stated at the hearing on 16 February 2017 that with his request on

pursuant to Article 35 of the Wbp, the aim is to find out to whom the TGB is concerned
made personal data available. He further substantiated this by stating that
TGB in the civil liability proceedings that [APPLICANT] is pending against TGB
made, has stated that there is a [CONFIDENTIAL]. With his appeal to the right of access,
[APPLICANT] [CONFIDENTIAL], he states. This purpose is consistent with the purpose of Article
35 of the Wbp. The AP sees no reason to doubt the statements of [APPLICANT]. The
statement by TGB that [APPLICANT] has received documents in the past in which his
personal data and has never made a correction request as a result thereof, is that
framework is not enough. Regardless of whether the statement is true, it is consistent with the purpose of
Article 35 of the Wbp to find out to whom TGB has provided which personal data. The
statement by TGB's representative at the hearing that no information was provided to others,
barring the supervisory authority, is insufficient in that context: Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wbp states
namely the right to obtain at least an overview with additional information. In view of the
for the foregoing, the AP sees no reason to come to the conclusion that [APPLICANT]
abuses his right of access.
 

31. Even if – as the court found plausible in its judgment – [APPLICANT] with his appeal

on Article 35 of the Wbp (also) aims to use the obtained documents in a
civil proceedings against TGB, there is no ground for the conclusion that [APPLICANT] abuse
exercise the right of inspection. As the Den Bosch Court of Appeal also concluded in the Dexia case, the
the mere circumstance that a data subject with the data once obtained also subsequently sends another person
purpose, for example by using it in a possible civil procedure,

                                                                        
4 Cf. in this context also the judgment of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of 30 November 2011, ECLI:NL:RVS:2011:BU6383,
consideration 2.4.3.
5 Cf. also the judgment of the Den Bosch Court of Appeal of 16 January 2006, NJF 2006, 91 (Dexia), consideration 4.6.3.

insufficient to assume abuse of rights.6 The AP also takes into account that TGB has not
and that, moreover, it has not been shown that this aim is unlawful.
 

32. The judgment of the Court of Justice of 17 July 2014 to which TGB refers does not lead to a different

conclusion. Insofar as TGB infers from this judgment that [APPLICANT] with his request for access only to:
may have the purpose of checking the correctness of the processing of his personal data, TGB misunderstands
that the Directive and the Wbp do not prevent data once obtained for another purpose
– for example, civil proceedings – are used. As noted above, that
data is not enough to presume abuse of rights.
 

33. In view of the foregoing, the AP – unlike the court in its judgment – comes to the conclusion that

[APPLICANT] does not abuse his right of access. TGB's argument fails.
 
Right to a copy of documents

34. TGB argues that Article 35 of the Wbp does not confer a right to copies of documents. The AP understands this

argue in such a way that an order subject to periodic penalty payments cannot in any case serve to provide copies
of documents containing personal data of [APPLICANT]. To this end, TGB points to the
the aforementioned judgment of the Court of Justice of 17 July 2014.
 

35. If personal data are processed, the controller must, pursuant to Article 35, second paragraph,

of the Wbp to provide the following information within four weeks:
(1) a complete overview in comprehensible form of the data subject concerning personal data;
(2) a description of the purpose or purposes of the processing;
(3) the categories of data to which the processing relates;
(4) the recipients or categories of recipients as well as
(5) the available information on the origin of the data.

 

36. The AP has already taken the position with TGB in the decision on the objection of 27 January 2017 that

the right of access is fulfilled when a complete overview in comprehensible form of this
personal data is provided, see marginal numbers 25-27.7 Only if not with an overview
If the objective of the right of access can be met, the [APPLICANT] can claim
a copy, the AP concluded.
 

37. TGB further argues that it is not required to undertake internal analyzes and the recording of deliberations
[APPLICANT], except insofar as it contains personal data. Like the AP under
marginal 31 of the decision of 27 January 2017, [APPLICANT] cannot simply
claim copies. Now that TGB does not yet have an overview and additional information
provided as explained above, it is not yet possible to verify whether the overview and the
additional information the objectives of the right of access are adequately met. To the
ask whether [APPLICANT] is entitled to copies of the chat messages and the internal instruction comes the AP

therefore not allowed.
 
Exceptional situation Article 43 of the Wbp

38. TGB argues that Article 35 of the Wbp must be disapplied, because a

exceptional situation as referred to in Article 43, opening words and under e, of the Wbp. In that context
TGB argues that providing an overview of [APPLICANT]-related
personal data requires an extraordinary effort on the part of TGB. To this end, TGB points out that it and
[APPLICANT] conducted business between 2004 and 2009. [CONFIDENTIAL]. Providing a
overview of his personal data, given that size, such an extraordinary effort and
administrative burden, that TGB's rights and freedoms are affected.
 

39. In its decision on the objection of 17 January 2017, the AP substantiated that and why the appeal of
TGB on Article 43, opening words and under e, of the Wbp fails (under marginal numbers 28 and 29). For brevity
the AP refers to it. What TGB put forward at the hearing about the minimum
importance of the information [CONFIDENTIAL], does not lead to a different conclusion. The starting point is that it
it is decisive that the data subject is, as a rule, with regard to the personal data processed about him/her
is entitled to knowledge with regard to 'the same' as what the person responsible has about him
stores/processed.8 It is not up to TGB to assess whether that information is important for
[APPLICANT] or not.

 

Conclusion: violation Wbp

40. In view of what has been set out in the decision on the objection of 27 January 2017 and the foregoing, the

AP concluded that now TGB has no overview and additional information to [APPLICANT]
strengthened about the processing of the personal data of [APPLICANT], TGB acts contrary to
Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wbp.
 

41. TGB further argues in this context that in view of the court's judgment it is in any case not possible to

maintained that there was an obvious violation of the Wbp. TGB hereby misunderstands that the question of whether
[APPLICANT] abuses his right of access - which question is denied by the AP
answered – is independent of the question of whether the Wbp is being violated. Now it is further established that there is
a violation of the Wbp, the AP does not get to discuss the argument of TGB that is not
the prioritization criteria from the Policy Rules for Enforcement by the Dutch DPA (Government Gazette 31 January 2011, no.
1916), also compare the explanation of this policy in the decision on objection of 27 January 2017, under
edge number 13.
 
Principle obligation to enforce; choice for order subject to penalty

42. From Article 65 of the Wbp, viewed in conjunction with Article 5:32(1) of the General Act

administrative law (Awb) follows that the AP is authorized to impose an order subject to a penalty in the event of violation
of Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wbp.

43. Pursuant to Article 5:2, first paragraph, under b, of the Awb, the order subject to a penalty is aimed at terminating

of the detected violation and the prevention of repetition.
   

44. In view of the public interest served by enforcement, the AP will, in the event of violation of a
must, as a rule, exercise its enforcement powers. special
circumstances in which enforcement action should be waived do not arise
in front of.
 
5. Order subject to penalty and beneficiary period
 

45. The AP imposes the following burden on TGB:

 
 
TGB must provide [APPLICANT] with the following information:
(1) a complete overview in comprehensible form of the data subject concerning personal data;
(2) a description of the purpose or purposes of the processing;
(3) the categories of data to which the processing relates;
(4) the recipients or categories of recipients as well as
(5) the available information on the origin of the data.
  
 

46. In view of what TGB has put forward about the effort involved in drawing up a

overview is involved and the size of the number of documents containing personal data
[APPLICANT], the AP attaches to this charge a grace period of two months which
ends on July 11, 2017.
 

47. If TGB does not meet the burden before the end of the beneficiary period, it forfeits a

penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at an amount of
€ 12,000.00 for each week that the load is not (fully) carried out, up to a maximum of € 60,000.00.
