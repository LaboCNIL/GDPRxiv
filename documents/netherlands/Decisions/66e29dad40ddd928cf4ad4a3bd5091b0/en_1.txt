28. In response to the AP's intention to take enforcement action, the NP during the

oral hearing of 23 March 2016. In summary, this is the point
that it endorses the conclusions drawn in the investigation report. The NP has in her
point out that it attaches importance to proper information security and the associated security
related safeguards for privacy. In order to end the observed violations
the NP announced that it would take measures.
 
Judgement
 

29. The AP establishes that the NP has access rights to N.SIS II and processes police data in that context. This

means, in view of the provisions of Article 2(1) of the Wpg, that the Wpg applies. Furthermore
the Decree and the Regulation on data processing apply. The Regulation and the
Decision contain common provisions on the architecture, financing and the
responsibilities, as well as general data processing and protection rules for SIS II.
Apart from these common rules, the Decree contains specific provisions on processing
of SIS II data for judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters, while the
Regulation contains rules for the processing of SIS II data for the purpose of implementing it
policy on the free movement of persons which is part of the Schengen acquis.
 

30. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must provide appropriate technical and organizational

take measures to protect police data against accidental or unlawful destruction,
against alteration, unauthorized communication or access, in particular if the processing involves transmission of
includes data over a network or making available through direct automated access, and against all
other forms of unlawful processing, taking into account in particular the
risks of the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. These measures must be taken into account
taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation, an appropriate
guarantee a level of security, given the risks of the processing and the nature of the police data.

 

31. The AP closes before assessing whether there are appropriate technical and organizational requirements

security measures with the further details given in the Code for
Information security, the NEN-ISO/IEC 27002:2013 standard (hereinafter the NEN standard). The NEN standard is one
standard in which internationally applicable measures for information security are further elaborated. If
an organization complies with the NEN standard, the AP assumes that it also complies with Article 4, third
member of the Wpg.1 In addition, the AP joins in where there is a special arrangement for the police
to the Police Information Security Regulations (Rip). The Rip is a ministerial regulation based on Article
23, first paragraph, under b, of the Police Act 2012. Pursuant to Article 2, first paragraph, of the RIP, this regulation
applies to the entire process of information provision and the entire life cycle of
information systems, regardless of the technology used and regardless of the nature of the information.

Regarding the security plan

32. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. This means paying attention
Article 4, preamble and under e, of the RIP, among other things, that the NP must draw up an (information) security plan
that pertains to N.SIS II. This security plan must explicitly include
what measures the NP takes to secure the processed data.2 The need to have a
to adopt a security plan also follows from Article 10, paragraph 1, opening words, of the Decree and Article 10,
first paragraph, preamble, of the Regulation.3
 

33. During the investigation, the NP submitted documents to the AP that relate to the

security measures within the NP. Based on these documents, the AP has concluded that these
documents cannot be regarded as a security plan related to N.SIS II. During the day
the hearing of March 23, 2016, the NP also confirmed by letter of May 13, 2016, to the AP
informed that it does not dispute the conclusions of the investigation report. In addition, the NP
explained that it has several documents related to the security plan,
but that it remains to be assessed which documents should be reviewed and indexed
could be. In order to put an end to the observed violations, the NP in the
improvement plan and measures announced in the appendix to the letter of 13 September 2016.4 At
e-mail dated January 31, 2017, the NP has sent the security plan 2017-2019, version 1.0, status final, to the
AP sent. This security plan relates, among other things, to the processing of police data
in the context of N.SIS II. With the sending of this security plan, the AP determines that this point is
complies with Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg, viewed in conjunction with Article 4, preamble and under e, of the
Rip.
 
With regard to access rights to N.SIS II and personnel profiles

34. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. Access security
This has been elaborated by means of authorizations and is further specified in Article 6 of the Wpg. The NP
must maintain a system of authorizations pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Wpg that
meets the requirements of due care and proportionality. The requirements of due diligence and
proportionality are the starting point of the authorization system. These requirements include
also note that persons are not authorized more widely than necessary for the fulfillment of their duties. 5
This means that the authorizations must be linked to a certain function or functionality.
To this end, the NP must draw up profiles in which the tasks and responsibilities are specified
of persons authorized to view and process personal data in N.SIS II.
                                                                        
2 See also NEN-ISO-IEC 27002:2013, section 5.1.1 and CBP Guidelines for the Protection of Personal Data, February 2013, p. 22
3 It should be noted that Article 10, first paragraph, opening lines, of the Decree refers to a security plan, while Article 10,
The opening paragraph of the Regulation refers to a safety plan. These terms mean the same thing.
4 However, with regard to all measures announced by the NP, it should be noted that they are not sufficiently specific
to be able to give an opinion with regard to the question whether these measures will remedy the observed violations.

Drawing up personnel profiles serves, among other things, as a means of assessing whether the
authorizations are properly arranged. This also follows from the NEN standard6, article 10, first paragraph, under f and g, of the
Regulation and Article 10(1)(f) and (g) of the Decree.
 

35. The AP has established in the investigation report that the NP is an organization with access rights to N.SIS

II and that it is the administrator of the parties connected to N.SIS II. In the research report
concluded that the NPN did not regulate access rights correctly. It has been established that this is not the case
all parties that have access rights to N.SIS II are listed in the authorization matrix and that in the
parties mentioned in the matrix not all types of access rights are listed. Furthermore, it has been concluded
that the NP has not drawn up profiles in which the tasks and responsibilities are described
of persons authorized to see and process personal data in N.SIS II. During the
hearing of March 23, 2016, also confirmed by letter of May 13, 2016, the NP has announced that it
the conclusions of the investigation report are not contested. In a letter dated 13 September 2016, the NP issued a
appendix containing measures that the NP intends to take in order to achieve the
rectify established violations. These measures have an implementation period
which runs until January 2017. On 9 January 2017, the NP explained this orally
that the NP is lagging behind on this planning and that this cannot be realized in January 2017, but in June 2017
become. In view of this, the AP concludes that the NP is currently still acting in violation of Article 6, first paragraph, in
viewed in conjunction with Article 4(3) of the Wpg.
 
With regard to the granting of authorizations and the control thereof

36. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. Access security
This has been elaborated by means of authorizations and is further specified in Article 6 of the Wpg. The NP
must maintain a system of authorizations pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Wpg that

To make access security possible, the protocol obligation is laid down in Article 32 of the Wpg. Article 32, first
paragraph, under c, of the Wpg stipulates that the controller is responsible for the written recording of
the granting of the authorizations, as referred to in Article 6 of the Wpg.
These legal provisions have been elaborated in more detail in the NEN standard, with the benefit of management
access rights stipulate that a formal registration and logout procedure must be carried out
implemented to enable allocation of access rights.7 Furthermore, the
users' access rights should be reviewed regularly.8 This also follows from Article 10,
first paragraph, under f and k, of the Regulation and Article 10, first paragraph, under f and k, of the Decree.

37. The AP has concluded in the investigation report that the (National Unit of the) NP does not have a formal
established procedure that relates to the authorizations for the business information managers of the
Parties affiliated to N.SIS II and IND employees who are registered in the context of N.SIS II

checks the functional managers of the parties connected to N.SIS II and the to
IND employees granted authorizations in the context of N.SIS II.

In 2016, the NP added an appendix containing measures that the NP intends to implement
to put an end to the observed violations. These measures have a
implementation term that runs up to and including January 2017. On 9 January 2017, the NP
explained orally that the NP is behind schedule and that this will not be in January 2017, but in June
can be achieved in 2017. In view of this, the AP determines with regard to the granting of authorizations
that the NP does not yet have a formally established procedure that relates to authorizations for the
functional administrators of the parties connected to N.SIS II and the IND employees who work in the
process personal data within the framework of N.SIS II. As a result, the NP is still acting contrary to
Article 6, first paragraph, in conjunction with Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg, the NEN standard9, Article 10, first paragraph,
under f of the Regulation and Article 10, first paragraph, under f, of the Decree. With regard to the
(ongoing) checks on granted authorizations, the ANP establishes that the ANP does not have a (periodic) check
performs on the functional managers of the parties connected to N.SIS II and on the
employees of the IND granted authorizations. The NP is also still trading in this respect insofar as this
conflict with Article 6, first paragraph, viewed in conjunction with Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg and Article 32, first
paragraph, under c, of the Wpg.
 
Regarding the security incidents

39. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. This means paying attention
Article 3(2)(f) of the RIP states, among other things, that the NP must adopt a policy document
which lays down the manner in which detected or suspected infringements of the
information security are reported by police officers, the police officer to whom these breaches occur
are reported and how they are handled. The NEN standard specifies this in more detail, namely
that a consistent and effective approach to the management of
information security incidents, including security event communications and
security vulnerabilities. Management responsibilities and procedures should be for this purpose
be established to ensure a prompt, effective and orderly response to information security incidents
to be achieved.10 This also follows from Article 10(1)(d) of the Regulation and Article 10(1)
paragraph, under d, of the Decree.

40. In the investigation report, the AP concluded that the NP has not established a procedure against

regarding the management of information security incidents in the context of N.SIS II and therefore
there is no prompt, effective and orderly response to information security incidents.
During the hearing of March 23, 2016, also confirmed by letter of May 13, 2016, the NP told the AP
informed that it does not dispute the conclusions of the investigation report. At the end of the observed
the NP has stated in the appendix to the improvement plan and in the appendix to the letter
announced on 13 September 2016 to take measures. In an email dated October 3, 2016, the NP
documents pertaining to the procedure with regard to the policy with regard to
information security incidents. This policy was explained verbally during a conversation with the AP on 4
October 2016. By e-mail of October 7, 2016, the NP sent another document relating to
has on the policy regarding information security incidents. With the transmission of this
documents and the explanation given during the interview of October 4, 2016, in which it is stated that the
established procedure with regard to the policy with regard to information security incidents
also relates to the processing of data in the context of N.SIS II, the AP notes that this
point, Article 4(3) of the Wpg is complied with, viewed in conjunction with Article 3(2),
under f, of the Rip.
 
With regard to the logging and the (ongoing) checks on the use of N.SIS II

41. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. This means, considering
the interpretation given by the NEN standard11, that log files of events that
log user activities, exceptions and information security events
be made, stored and regularly assessed.12 This also follows from Article 10, first paragraph,
under i and k of the Regulation and Article 10, first paragraph, under i and k, of the Decree.
 

42. In the investigation report, the AP concluded that the NP does not regularly update the log files

checks. It has been established that the check on the logging only takes place (afterwards) in the event that there is
of safety signals, integrity investigations, complaints or a technical malfunction. The log files
are not periodically proactively checked for indications of unauthorized access or unauthorized use
use of police data. In addition, the AP has concluded that changed authorizations in N.SIS II
not be logged by the POI. At the hearing of 23 March 2016, also confirmed by letter dated 13
May 2016, the NP informed the AP that it does not dispute the conclusions of the investigation report.
In order to put an end to the observed violations, the NP has added in the appendix to the letter of 13
announced in September 2016 that it would take measures, with an implementation term specified
runs through April 2017. During the interview on October 4, 2016, the NP explained that the control of
log files cannot yet proactively take place at the ANP, because the action is subject to consent
under the Works Councils Act, and the works council has not yet agreed to this.

43. In view of the foregoing, the AP notes that the NP due to the lack of a regular

proactive control of the log files and due to the fact that changed or deleted authorizations in
N.SIS II are not logged by the NP, currently still violates Article 4, paragraph 3, of the
Wpg.
 
With regard to the training regulations

44. Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must – in summary – provide appropriate technical and

take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, against alteration, unauthorized communication or access. Information security
comprises the entirety of measures with which organizations secure their information. Providing a
appropriate training can be regarded as an organizational measure and, given the
interpretation given by the NEN standard13, that all employees of the organization and, insofar as
relevant, contractors receive appropriate awareness education and training and regular refresher training
organizational policies and procedures, as relevant to their position.14
Providing appropriate training also follows from Article 14 of the Regulation and Article 14 of the
Decision.
 

45. With regard to the training offered by the NP, the AP concluded in the investigation report that

the staff of the NP does not receive specific and sound training with regard to the rules on
data security and protection of N.SIS II and the relevant criminal offenses and sanctions and that
neither is attention paid to N.SIS II in the general training.

 

46. Following this report, the NP, both during the hearing and by letter dated 6 April 2016, issued a

further explanation of the training program of the NP. In this regard, summarized
explained that the generic training/courses, which are developed in consultation with the Police Academy
developed, do not contain specific N.SIS II aspects, but where employees have specific
have rights to create or delete alerts within N.SIS II, the NP uses
a 'train the trainer concept', using the SMC User Manual. In addition
it has been explained that during the training courses attention is paid to the relevant criminal offenses and
sanctions related to the information security policy.

 

47. In view of what was put forward during the hearing and the documents submitted subsequently, the

AP has established in this context that there is currently no longer a violation within the meaning of Article 4, third paragraph, of
the Wpg.
 
Order subject to periodic penalty payments and grace period
 

48. The AP decides to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments pursuant to Article 35, paragraph 2 of the
Wpg, viewed in conjunction with Article 65 of the Wbp and Article 5:32, first paragraph, of the Awb. This burden

subject to periodic penalty payments is aimed at ending the established violations and preventing
repetition, as referred to in Section 5:2(1)(b) of the Awb.
 

49. The AP orders the NP to take measures within the beneficiary period referred to below

in order to remove the unlawful nature of the processing. This implies that NP within this
term should ensure that further violation of Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg, Article 6, first
paragraph of the Wpg and Article 32, first paragraph, under c, of the Wpg is omitted.
 

50. In concrete terms, this means that the ANP must have a formally established procedure that relates

on the authorizations for the functional managers of the parties connected to N.SIS II and the
employees of the IND. The AP points out that this must be a formal registration
logout procedure to allow assignment of access rights.15 These procedures serve
all stages in the user access lifecycle, user access, from the initial registration of
new users to the final logout of users who no longer have access to
information systems and services.16

 

51. The NPN should also establish personnel profiles in which the tasks and responsibilities are specified
of persons authorized to view and process personal data in N.SIS II.17

 

52. Furthermore, the NPN must ensure that a periodic check is carried out on the authorisations

assigned to the functional managers of the parties connected to N.SIS II and the
employees of the IND.18
 

53. It is also required that the NP logs changed authorizations in N.SIS II.19

 

54. In addition, in the context of N.SIS II, the NP should regularly check log files for indications of

unauthorized access or use of police data. This means not just afterwards
an audit (in the event of safety signals, integrity investigations, complaints or a
technical failure) must take place, but that the log files must also be proactive on a regular basis
are checked for indications of unauthorized access or use of
police data.20
 
Beneficiary term

55. Article 5:32a, paragraph 2, of the Awb stipulates that a grace period is set 'during

which the offender can carry out the order without forfeiting a penalty'. In the Memoir of

Explanatory notes to the Awb emphasize that this period should be as short as possible, but long enough to
to be able to carry out the load.21
 

56. The DPA attaches a grace period of six months to the order subject to periodic penalty payments. The AP has

the determination of the beneficiary period takes into account the context within which the
developments in security and the renewal of information provision at the NP take place, such as
was explained by the NP in a letter dated 10 October 2016 and subsequently explained orally on behalf of the NP.
In the opinion of the AP, a period of six months is reasonable with a view to terminating the
detected violations and the prevention of further violations.
 

57. Article 5:32b, third paragraph, of the Awb stipulates that the penalty amounts must be in reasonable proportion

to the seriousness of the violated interest and to the intended effect of the penalty. At that last one
It is important that a penalty must provide such an incentive that the order is complied with.

 

58. If the NP does not end the observed violations within six months, it will forfeit a

penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at € 12,500 for each week that the order is not
(in full) has been carried out up to a maximum of € 200,000. In the opinion of the Authority, the
amount of these amounts in reasonable proportion to the seriousness of the violation caused by the violation
interest - the protection of police data and the privacy of those involved - and
are these (further) sufficiently high to induce the NP to end the violations.
