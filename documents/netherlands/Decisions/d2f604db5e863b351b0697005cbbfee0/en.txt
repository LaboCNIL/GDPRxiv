13. Article 55(1) of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority has the competence to

territory of its Member State to carry out the tasks assigned to it in accordance with this Regulation
conferred upon it and to exercise the powers conferred upon it in accordance with this Regulation
promised. However, Article 56(1) of the GDPR provides that the supervisory authority of the
main establishment or sole establishment of the controller or processor is competent
to act as lead supervisory authority for cross-border processing by
that controller or processor in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 60 of the
GDPR.
 

14. Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR defines the term principal place of business as follows: “with regard to

a controller that has establishments in more than one Member State, the place where its central
administration is located in the Union, unless decisions on the objectives and means of the
processing of personal data is taken at another establishment of the controller
who is also located in the Union and who is also authorized to execute those decisions, in which case the
establishment where those decisions are made is considered to be the principal place of business”

 

15. In the Guidelines for Determining the Lead Supervisory Authority8 (Guidelines

competence) it is stated on page 7 that Recital 36 of the GDPR can help clarify
of the main factor that will be used in determining the principal place of business if it
criterion of the central administration does not apply. Recital 36 of the GDPR states: “Which
establishment is the principal place of business of a controller in the Union should be determined on the basis of
of objective criteria, such as the effective and effective execution of management activities, with a view to
taking the core decisions on the purposes and means of processing through resistant
proportions."

 

16. Opinion 8/2019 on the competence of the supervisory authority in the event of a change
in the circumstances concerning the principal place of business or the sole establishment9 addresses the question of which
supervisory authority is competent in the event of a change in circumstances relating to
to headquarters during ongoing investigations. This Opinion is relevant in the present case now
TikTok states that there has been a change in circumstances.10

 

17. Opinion 8/2019 states, in summary, that in case of continuous infringements, the jurisdiction may

transfer to another supervisory authority until the lead supervisory authority
has made a decision. Recommendation 8/2019 stipulates that the relocation of a head office from
offers a third country to the EU during the procedure the possibility to
controllers to make use of the “one-stop shop” scheme. 11

18. A change of guard at the lead supervisory authorities does not mean that the

original lead supervisory authority had no power to act. The
acts performed by this old lead supervisory authority and the hereby obtained
information and evidence remain valid and may be reviewed by the new lead supervisor
In addition, Opinion 8/2019 underlines that the cooperation procedure referred to in
Article 60 of the GDPR applies in the event of a change of lead supervisory authority
authority. This means that the old (lead) supervisory authority on the basis of the provisions in Article
60 of the GDPR remains involved in the establishment of a final
decision.13

 

19. In addition, Opinion 8/2019 points out that forum shopping must be prevented and that it is therefore

it is up to the controller to demonstrate that the relocation of the principal place of business
actually took place. The concept of the head office in itself indicates that a
temporary or purely bureaucratic step by the company is not sufficient to establish the head office
but that it is a real step with a long-term goal. It's up to the
supervisory authorities to determine whether the criteria are met, in order to mitigate the risk
reduce data controllers artificially switching headquarters with the
with a view to changing the competent authority to handle the case.14

 

TikTok view

 
20. TikTok states in its written opinion that the processing responsibility is on July 29, 2020

transferred from TikTok Inc. to TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK and that TikTok Ireland qualifies
as a principal place of business in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR. 15 TikTok Takes The Stand
that as a result, the authority to investigate TikTok from July 29, 2020 with the Irish SA
lies and not with the AP. TikTok bases this on Advice 8/2019.

 

21. TikTok further states that the AP finds in the research report that TikTok does not yet have

demonstrated that TikTok qualifies Ireland as head office, but no evidence put forward either
implies that the AP itself is authorized to act. TikTok states in its written opinion that the
AP only refers to the correspondence between TikTok and the Irish SA and in particular to the letter from
August 13, 2020 from the Irish SA to TikTok.

 

22. TikTok further notes in its written opinion that the AP does not

took into account the comprehensive response TikTok has on September 30, 2020
sent to Irish SA. According to TikTok, this answer contains additional, detailed and strong
proof that TikTok is headquartered in Ireland as of July 29, 2020.

                                                                        
12 See marginal 21 of Recommendation 8/2019.
13 See marginal 24 of Recommendation 8/2019.
14 See marginal 26 of Recommendation 8/2019.
15 TikTok has indicated by letter to the Irish SA on September 30, 2020 that its Irish headquarters is based on the fact that
this site makes decisions and implements them, and not because this site should be designated as a place where
its central administration is located in the Union.

23. TikTok concludes in its written submission that TikTok, taking into account all

correspondence with the Irish SA, has sufficiently demonstrated that TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK
can be regarded as joint controller and TikTok Ireland also
the main establishment is in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16 of the GDPR from 29 July 2020. TikTok
states that the AP is not competent and states that on the basis of the AVG and Advice 08/2019 the ongoing
cases/proceedings must be transferred to the Irish SA.

 

AP . Considerations

 
24. First of all, the AP notes that TikTok did not have a head office at the start of the investigation

was established in the EU in accordance with Article 4, preamble under 16. During that time, TikTok Inc. if
designated controller TikTok UK as its representative in accordance with
Article 27 of the GDPR. Article 56(1) of the GDPR was therefore not applicable at the start of
the investigation and thus the DPA was authorized on the basis of Article 55, paragraph 1 of the GDPR.

 

25. As described above, TikTok states that this situation changed on July 29, 2020. TikTok suggests
that it has established itself with a principal place of business in Ireland and as a result, from that moment on, has not
AP but the Irish SA has jurisdiction. After this, the question of whether TikTok has
demonstrated that it is established in Ireland with a head office. After that, the consequences
described with regard to the authority of the AP to act as lead supervisory
authority to act.

 

Headquarters

 

26. It appears from margin numbers 13 to 18 of this decision that TikTok must demonstrate that

an actual headquarters that has been created with a long-term goal. The head office
should carry out its management activities effectively and effectively, with a view to taking
the core decisions on the purposes and means of processing through resistant
proportions. This should not involve a temporary or purely bureaucratic step or
artificially changing the principal place of business for the purpose of processing the case
competent authority.

 

27. As stated in the investigation report, the AP was of the opinion that TikTok with the

information up to and including August 7, 2020 had not yet sufficiently demonstrated that TikTok is a
headquartered in Ireland. In that context, the Irish SA has by letter dated 13 August 2020
asked a large number of additional questions to TikTok to get more clarity on
different aspects.16

 

28. TikTok provided additional information to the Irish SA on September 30, 2020 in response to
aforementioned letter dated August 13, 2020. The AP has shared some of this additional information via the

Irish SA received on October 7, 2020. For another part, Irish SA was not authorized
received from TikTok to provide this information to other supervisory authorities
(including the AP) without first presenting this to her in connection with it in the eyes of TikTok
highly confidential nature of this part of the documents submitted to the Irish SA. The
AP has still requested TikTok to provide these business-sensitive documents to the AP. at 25
January 2021, TikTok transferred all documents to the AP.

 
29. With the information provided on October 7, 2020 and January 25, 2021, TikTok has demonstrated that
there is an actual head office in Ireland with a long-term objective. for this
the AP considers the following.

 

30. One of the most important findings of the AP in August 2020 was that TikTok was on

paper stated that its office in Ireland made decisions and had the authority to
to implement decisions within the EU, but that there were still many uncertainties
on many related topics. In addition, it was not possible from the material submitted
be drawn up that there were permanent and sustainable agreements within the group and that
the Irish branch would have sufficient and competent people and resources to fulfill its role as
head office properly. In August 2020, it could not be ruled out that TikTok
had taken a merely bureaucratic, artificial step with the aim of improving the treatment of the
to change competent authority for this case (forum shopping).

 

31. From the minutes of the board of directors of the Irish branch of . submitted by TikTok on January 25, 2021
TikTok shows that the changes within the TikTok concern regarding the shifting of
the processing responsibility for EU data subjects and the creation of a headquarters in
Ireland emerge from a long-running project. In the period from the end of May 2020 in particular,
Various concrete initiatives have been launched in this context and decisions have been taken to improve the organization
to prepare for the new structure. These minutes of the board of the Irish branch show that
is actually aimed at a lasting transition and that, in this context, the
necessary decisions are made.

 

32. It appears from the minutes of the Data Protection Steering Committee (DPSC)17 that this

decision-making body from 29 July 2020 actually discusses important matters regarding
data protection and make decisions about it. This concerns matters that directly affect
the protection of children. It also appears from several documents submitted that the Irish
establishment is actually responsible for the implementation of decisions taken and
is responsible for the execution of some central processes such as assessing
requests from data subjects and investigating and reporting data breaches.

 

                                                                        
17 According to the agreements previously submitted by TikTok (intra concern), this decision-making meeting was established by the
joint controllers to discuss and discuss important data processing matters
to take decisions.

33. In addition, it appears from statements submitted by TikTok that TikTok Ireland has a large number of
(hundreds) of staff has been recruited in the spring and summer of 2020. Right on this point
doubts existed now that the Irish branch in Ireland had few employees at the beginning of 2020. The
AP had doubts whether it would be able to provide enough in times of a pandemic
quality of staff. Sufficient and high-quality personnel is
after all, a large platform such as TikTok is essential to be able to actually function as a
Headquarters. Despite applicable COVID restrictions, TikTok Ireland is according to this submitted
overviews nevertheless proved to be able to recruit a large number of permanent employees who are competent on paper
Pull. As a result, the AP is of the opinion that the location in Ireland has sufficient manpower
to be able to actually fulfill its task as head office.

 

34. With these additional documents in combination with the previously provided in writing

agreements between legal entities within the TikTok group, the AP determines that there is a
headquartered in Ireland and not just a bureaucratic and
artificial step with the sole purpose of limiting the competence of the lead supervisory authority
to change (forum shopping).

 

35. On the basis of the foregoing, the AP establishes that TikTok has demonstrated that it

has its registered office in Ireland on 29 July 2020.

 

 

Jurisdiction

36. It follows from Opinion 8/2019 that the competence to act as lead supervisory authority

transfers from the AP to the Irish SA in case of continued infringements at the time TikTok has
demonstrated that it is headquartered in Ireland and if there is no
(final) decision has been taken by the AP. As described above, TikTok has with the op
7 October 2020 and 25 January 2021 provided additional information demonstrated that they
headquartered in Ireland on July 29, 2020. This date the AP considers the
date the competence passed from the AP to the Irish SA [CONFIDENTIAL].

4. Facts

54. This chapter lists the facts relevant to the decision. First, in section 4.1, a

outline description of the TikTok app. Section 4.2 discusses how
how users create an account and post videos via the TikTok app and the way in which
the privacy policy of TikTok Inc. was offered to users. Section 4.3 briefly describes the
(underlying) processing of personal data that take place in the context of
the use of the TikTok app by users. Finally, Section 4.4 explains that a
large number of children use the TikTok app.

 
4.1 General description of the TikTok app

 

55. TikTok is a platform that allows users to create short videos via an app,

edit and share online. TikTok app allows users to upload photos and videos
of their smartphones and allows them to add filters, stickers, effects and music.
TikTok has developed over time into a platform where users mainly
profiling by posting creative and humorous short videos. This distinguishes
TikTok is moving away from other social media platforms such as Instagram.

 

56. In addition to creating, editing and posting short videos, the TikTok app also allows users
establishing and maintaining social contacts. For example, users can comment on videos
from others, like videos, follow other users, become friends with other users and
send and receive messages from other users, etc. Furthermore, it is also possible, for example
to set up live stream connections. The TikTok app can therefore be considered as social
media app.

 

57. An important part of the TikTok app is the 'for you' page. This is a page where the user

is offered videos relevant to him or her via a continuous feed. Which videos
exactly offered through this feed varies per user and depends on his or her
preferences. The algorithm developed by TikTok determines which videos are shown.
It appears from conversations with advertisers who are active on the TikTok platform that for the time being
only TikTok knows exactly how this algorithm works and which factors exactly determine it.

 

58. The above functionalities can all be used via the TikTok app. The TikTok app can be accessed via the
various app stores can be downloaded for free. The revenue model of TikTok is, as with many
social media platforms, to generate income through (personalized) advertisements. Out
research has shown that at the time of the adoption of the research report, TikTok had not yet
offered personalized advertisements as a product to advertisers when it comes to Dutch
users. This product was already available for larger European markets such as France, Italy,
Spain and the UK.

4.2 User registration and provision of privacy policy to users
 

Sign up process
 

59. After a user has downloaded the TikTok app from an app store, it is immediately possible to
watch videos shared via the TikTok platform. The user also gets via the 'for you'
page of videos offered via a feed. Further functionalities in the app are not (yet)
available. In short, unregistered users can watch videos but not
posting videos and socializing about it via the TikTok platform.

 

60. Creating a TikTok account is a necessary requirement to create, edit videos

and place them online and use the interactive possibilities of the TikTok app.

 

61. The AP created an account as part of an online test to gain insight into the way

on which users register in the TikTok app and what data they had to do with it
provide. In short, a user must go through the following four steps.19

 

62. First of all, a user must indicate through which method he or she wants the registration process

through, using a phone number, email address, or other existing social media
account. The user is informed in the Dutch language that he or she agrees with the
TikTok's terms of use and privacy policy. The user can click on the word
terms of use and privacy policy to access these documents.

 

63. Then the user must indicate his or her birth year via a gear wheel. If the

user enters a year of birth that shows that the person is younger than 13 years old, gets the
user will see a red bar that says “sorry, it looks like you are not eligible for TikTok,
but thank you for visiting us.” Until early 2020, this red bar disappeared after about 5 seconds

At that time, the user could enter another year of birth to still go through this step

64. As a third step, the user must enter his or her email address or telephone number and the

user to set a password. The screen again states that the user agrees with
TikTok's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

app, such as posting videos and socializing.

 

Privacy Policy in English Language
 

66. Online tests conducted by the AP in December 2019 and February 2020 showed that the

privacy policy was presented in the English language during the registration process described above. This
was also the case when a user was logged in and wanted the privacy policy in the TikTok app
21 In response to the AP's question how TikTok informs Dutch children about
the processing of their personal data, TikTok stated on May 1, 2020 that they do this, among other things
through its privacy policy. The privacy policy provided by TikTok to the AP concerned a
English version.22

 
67. TikTok informed the AP on June 26, 2020 that it will update its privacy policy effective July 29, 2020

to Dutch stakeholders – and therefore also Dutch children under the age of 16 – in the
Dutch language will provide. As TikTok also noted in its written view
In addition, TikTok has drawn up a separate document with effect from July 29, 2020 that
and shape suits (Dutch-speaking) children.23

 

68. Based on the foregoing, the AP finds that TikTok Inc. during the period from May 25, 2018
has its privacy policy to Dutch users - including children - up to and including 28 July 2020
provided in the English language only.

 
4.3 Processing of personal data by TikTok
 
69. TikTok, as a social media platform, processes a large number of personal data from both

registered and unregistered users. For example, TikTok processes the following
categories of personal data to enable users to share and about videos
social interaction via the TikTok platform: User ID, name/nickname, user settings, user
generated content (e.g. videos, messages, comments), IP address, mobile carrier, time zone settings,
App version, device model, device system, network type, device ID, screen resolution, operating
system, access tokens, appID, appssecret, code, redirected URL (for social login/sharing).24

 

70. The above categories of personal data have been mentioned by TikTok in its register of
processing. In this register, TikTok has for all processing purposes identified by it

version that was last updated in October 2019. However, as can be seen from the answer to question 11, TikTok has the conditions from the
privacy policy in the period from May 25, 2018 – July 29, 2020 not substantially adjusted.

4.4 Children's use of the TikTok app
 
71. TikTok is a social media app that is popular and used by children. From research

shows that a large group of Dutch children under the age of 16 use the TikTok app and that a
part of this group of young children are around 12 years of age (and in some cases
younger).

 

72. According to an indicative study conducted at the end of 2019 by a research agency, which has
stated to the AP that TikTok is used by children and especially around the age
age 12.26 This research agency estimated that approximately 830,000 Dutch children
under the age of 18 use TikTok. Below is the table – based on the
research results from the end of 2019 from the aforementioned research agency – showing that children
aged from 6 years to 18 years used the TikTok app and that TikTok proportionally
was mainly used by children around the age of 12.27

 

                                                                        
25 For example, TikTok describes the following goal in its processing register: “To enable users to share user content and interact
with other users”. It is going too far for this decision to examine in detail all eighteen processing goals put forward by TikTok
to describe. In this decision it is sufficient to refer to the processing register provided by TikTok and
data protection impact assessment, see appendix 3 to file 15 for the processing register and appendix 4 to file 15
for the Data Protection Impact Assessment.

27 These results are confirmed in conversations that the AP has had with various parties active in this market, see

73. In addition, research shows that TikTok in the last months, at the time of the COVID-19

pandemic, has gained in popularity, including among older users. The below
chart based on official TikTok figures in May 2020 illustrates this28:

 

 
 

                                                                        
28 The marketer who published these figures remarks about these figures that he can observe that nowadays not only
children are more active on the TikTok app: “In the Netherlands, there are 7 million app downloads, of which 3.5 million are unique users.
are in the Netherlands. This cannot only be young people under the age of 18. There is therefore still a target group that is older than 18 years.” See

74. In addition, media reports in August 2020 state that figures from Bytedance, the

parent company of TikTok, show that the number of active TikTok users in the Netherlands
had risen to 4.5 million. Although the largest user base would no longer be teenagers,
13 to 17 year olds would make up 28 percent of all
users in the Netherlands, which amounts to approximately 1,260,000 users.29

 

75. Based on the above, the AP finds that TikTok is used by a large number

Dutch children under 16 years old.
 
 

5. Review

76. This chapter successively establishes that TikTok Inc. if

controller has processed personal data and that TikTok Inc. in the period of
May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

5.1 Processing of personal data

 

Personal data
 

77. Article 4, preamble and under 1, of the GDPR provides that personal data concerns all information about

an identified or identifiable natural person.
 

78. As can be seen from the register of processing30, TikTok Inc. in the period from 25 May 2018 to

with July 28, 2020 processed a large number of data from users, including the videos they
posts, messages they sent and other (social) activities they engaged in. Based upon
of this, the AP establishes that in the present case there is information of identifiable
persons and therefore personal data within the meaning of Article 4, opening words and under 1, of the
GDPR.
 
Processing
 

79. Pursuant to Article 2(1) and Article 3(1) of the GDPR, the GDPR applies to all or

partially automated processing of personal data in the context of the activities of
an establishment of a controller or processor in the European Union. It
Under Article 4, preamble and under 2, of the GDPR, the term "processing" includes any possible
processing or whole of processing of personal data, whether or not carried out via
automated processes, such as the collection, storage, distribution and provision of
data.
 

80. From TikTok Inc.'s register of processing operations. and Section 4.1 shows that TikTok Inc. in the period

from 25 May 2018 to 28 July 2020, among other things, received, processed,
analyzed and distributed. This means the processing of personal data in the sense:
of Article 4, preamble and under 2, of the GDPR.

 

81. In view of this, the AP concludes that the processing of personal data is subject to the GDPR

applies – see Article 2(1) of the GDPR.

5.2 Controller

 

82. Article 4, preamble and under 7, of the GDPR provides that the controller must

is a natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, fulfills the purpose and
means of processing personal data. Decisive is who the purpose of and the
means of processing personal data. The controller may
do this alone, but also with others.
 
TikTok view
 

83. TikTok states in its written opinion that the processing responsibility is on July 29, 2020

transferred from TikTok Inc. to TikTok Ireland and TikTok UK.
 
AP . Considerations
 

84. From TikTok Inc.'s Register of Processing and Privacy Policy submitted on May 20, 202031,

as well as TikTok's written submission, it appears that TikTok Inc., established in California (de
United States), in the period from May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020, the goals and means for
determined the processing.
 

85. The AP therefore concludes that TikTok Inc. for the period from May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020

qualifies as a controller within the meaning of Article 4, preamble, and under 7, of the GDPR.
  

5.3 Transparency and information obligation
 
86. Transparency is an important principle of EU law.32 Transparency is an expression of the

principle of fairness in relation to the processing of personal data as contained in
Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Therefore, transparency is
together with legality and propriety, included in the GDPR in Article 5(1), preamble and
under a as one of the basic principles of the processing of personal data.

 
87. Recital 60 of the GDPR notes that, in accordance with the principles
of fair and transparent processing, should be informed that there are
processing takes place and the purposes thereof. Recital 39 of the GDPR adds that
in accordance with the principle of transparency, information and communication related to the
processing of those personal data should be easily accessible and understandable. Also,
clear and simple language. Natural persons must become aware
made of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights associated with the processing of
personal data, as well as the way in which they exercise their rights with regard to this processing
can exercise.

88. In the Guidelines on Transparency under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter:

Transparency Guidelines) emphasizes that one of the core elements of the principle of
transparency and fairness is that those involved know in advance the scope and consequences of the
processing and not be surprised later by other ways in which their
personal data has been used.33

 
89. The practical (information) requirements when it comes to informing data subjects are

detailed in Articles 12 to 15 of the GDPR.

 
90. Article 12 of the GDPR provides that the controller takes appropriate measures
so that the data subjects receive the information related to the processing in a concise, transparent,
in comprehensible and easily accessible form and in clear and simple language, in
especially when the information is specifically intended for a child. The information will be in writing
or provided by other means.

 

91. The element “understandable” is further elaborated in the Transparency Guidelines and serves as

measure to be taken by an average member of the intended audience. Of a
controller who respects the principle of accountability may
are expected to know the data subjects about whom information is being collected. On the basis of
this knowledge should allow the controller to determine what the target group is likely to
to understand. For example, a controller who uses personal data of working
professionals assume that his or her target audience has a higher level of understanding
than the target group of a controller who processes personal data of children
collects.34

 
92. In order to comply with the “clear and simple language” element, the information submitted to a

data subject is not provided with too legal, technical or specialist language or terminology
should contain. When the information is translated into one or more languages, the
controller to ensure that all translations are accurate and that the
word choice and sentence structure in the other language or languages are correct, so that the translated text is
follow and understand. When the controller addresses data subjects who have a
speak another language, a translation into those languages must be provided.35

 
93. With regard to the provision of information to children, Recital 58 of the GDPR emphasizes:

“Since children deserve specific protection, the information and communication when the
processing is specifically directed to a child, should be stated in such clear and plain language that it
child can easily understand it”.

94. The Transparency Guidelines also pay extra attention to the duty of care to

with regard to the requirement to use plain language when it comes to the provision of
information to children and other vulnerable groups. For example, the guidelines make transparency
Stresses that a controller who addresses (or is aware of, children)
or should be, that his or her goods/services are mainly used by children)
must ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language used is appropriate for
children. In this way, the child for whom the information is intended can understand that the information
addressed to him or her.36

 

TikTok view

 
95. TikTok recognizes that one of the core elements of the principles of transparency and fairness is

that those involved must be able to determine in advance what the scope and consequences are of the
processing and that they should not be surprised afterwards about the way in which their
personal data has been used. TikTok is of the opinion that through various measures
has met this standard and that the AP wrongly focuses only on the
TikTok's terms of use and privacy policy. TikTok refers in this regard to
1) measures in the TikTok app such as pop-up notifications and the privacy and security settings,
2) TikTok's Help Center and Safety Center where users are provided with information, and
3) the Dutch summary of its privacy policy rolled out by TikTok in July 2020.
Secondly, TikTok believes that Dutch users have a good command of the English language,
as a result of which there is no conflict with Article 12 (1) of the GDPR. In this regard, she notes that
The Netherlands has been in the top three of the so-called Education First English since 2011
Proficiency Index. Third, according to TikTok, the research report does not substantiate that
its privacy policy has not used clear and simple language aimed at children.

 

AP . Considerations
 

96. As the Transparency Guidelines show, a controller should

be required to know his intended audience and to determine on the basis of this information
state what qualifies as understandable. In the case of TikTok, this means that they are aware
must be that the target group consists in any case for a substantial part of children younger than
16 years. In addition, this young target group brings in accordance with Article 12(1) of the GDPR and the Guidelines
transparency comes with an extra responsibility when it comes to the use of clear and
simple language in all communication. After all, children deserve specific protection,
which makes the use of clear and simple language extra important.37

97. However, it appears from what has been explained above in paragraphs 66 to 68 that TikTok Inc.

during the period from May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020, its privacy policy to Dutch
data subjects – including children – has provided in the English language only. 38

 

98. The fact that TikTok Inc. has not provided this information in the Dutch language to

Dutch (speaking) children under the age of 16 already means that TikTok has Article 12, paragraph 1 of the AVG
violate. The requirement of comprehensibility requires at least that when the
controller addresses data subjects who speak another language, they
translation in that language to those data subjects. This obligation applies in particular when –
as in this case – it addresses (young) children, so that they can easily access that information
to understand.39 The circumstance that a relatively large group of Dutch people have a good command of English
doesn't make this any different, especially now that TikTok is used by many people under the age of 16. A
good command of the English language of those involved in that age group(s) is not
naturally. TikTok Inc. should therefore not have assumed that it would not be available to children
of only the English language version of the privacy policy is in accordance with article 12, paragraph 1 of
the GDPR.

 

99. The other transparency measures taken by TikTok mentioned do not alter the fact that the

English language privacy statement is not provided in language understandable to children and can already be
for this reason do not compensate for the violation of Article 12 (1) of the GDPR.

 

100. The pop-ups used by TikTok undeniably contribute to better transparency. This one
However, this measure does not affect the fact that the entire privacy policy of TikTok Inc. was not drafted in
for Dutch children under the age of 16 understandable and simple language. These pop ups are not
replace its privacy policy. They inform data subjects about the public nature of their information
post videos, but do not provide all information such as those provided under Article 13 of the GDPR by the
controller must be provided.

 

101. In addition, the privacy and security settings mentioned by TikTok and the Help and

Saftety Center that children are only informed there if they actively go to information themselves
Search. As a result, there is a risk that they will not be informed in time, which – like TikTok
also acknowledges itself – is a crucial element of the obligation of transparency.40 In addition,
these measures that it can not provide a substitute for its privacy policy now not all information
provided by the controller pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR
are provided.

102. As of July 29, 2020, TikTok will provide its privacy policy to Dutch data subjects – and

therefore also Dutch children under the age of 16 – in the Dutch language. Like TikTok also in

With these two measures, TikTok meets the requirement under Article 12 of the GDPR to

5.4 Conclusion on Article 12(1) of the GDPR
 
103. Based on the foregoing, the AP concludes that TikTok Inc. during the period of

May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR.

 

6. Fine

6.1 Introduction

 

104. By not informing children in understandable language about the processing of their personal data,
has TikTok Inc. acted contrary to article in the period from 25 May 2018 to 28 July 2020
12(1) of the GDPR. TikTok Inc. has not taken any measures during this period to ensure
ensure that children receive the information related to the processing of their personal data in a
received clear and simple language for them and thereby completely ignored the importance
of Dutch children when it comes to the extra protection they enjoy under the GDPR.
The AP believes that this is a serious violation.

 

105. The AP sees this as a reason to use its power to impose a fine on the basis of

Article 58, paragraph 2, preamble and under i and Article 83, paragraph 5 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 14,
paragraph 3 of the UAVG, to TikTok Inc. to impose. The AP uses the
Fines Policy Rules 2019.42

 

TikTok view
 

106. TikTok is primarily of the opinion that the AP is not authorized to impose a fine since the

TikTok is headquartered in Ireland. Even if the AP were competent, there would be no
lead to the imposition of a fine because TikTok acts and has acted in
in accordance with the GDPR. If the AP thinks differently about this, then it should be before imposing
of a punitive sanction, the AP can show that TikTok has acted in violation of a
legal provision that was clear, accurate and foreseeable to TikTok.43
[CONFIDENTIAL]. Imposing a punitive sanction based on open standards is contrary

with the nulla poena principle and the principle of legality. In such cases, a reprimand is a
more suitable tool. Finally, TikTok states that all circumstances must be taken into account
taken into account to arrive at an appropriate settlement, as well as the conditions of Article 83 GDPR
and all principles of good administration. TikTok has fully cooperated with the investigation and
has also requested a meeting with the research department to address their concerns
easier to understand.

 
AP . Considerations
 

107. In paragraph 5.4 of this decision, the AP concluded that TikTok Inc. during the period of

May 25, 2018 to July 28, 2020 has violated Article 12(1) of the GDPR. TikTok Inc. has
thus not acting in accordance with the GDPR. As above in Chapter 2 of this Decree
has been set out, the DPA is authorized to act for the established violation of Article 12(1) of the GDPR
make a decision and impose a sanction. This is because there is an offense committed before
July 29, 2020 has ended. This violation therefore falls outside the scope of Opinion 8/201944
which means that the AP is authorized to impose a fine for this.
 

108. With its statement that the AP must be able to demonstrate that TikTok has acted in violation of a

legal provision that was clear, accurate and foreseeable to it, TikTok actually does a
invoking the lex certa principle.
 

109. As the Judiciary Division of the Council of State has repeatedly considered45 requires

the lex certa principle, which is enshrined, inter alia, in Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms, of the legislature that it, with a view to the
legal certainty describes the prohibited conduct as clearly as possible. Thereby
it must not be lost sight of that the legislator sometimes acts with a certain vagueness, consisting of
the use of general terms, describes prohibited behaviors in order to prevent
conduct that is punishable by law falls outside the scope of that description. That vagueness can
unavoidable, because it is not always possible to foresee how the interests to be protected in the
will be infringed in the future and because, if foreseeable, the descriptions of
prohibited behaviors can be refined otherwise, with the result that the overview is lost and
thereby harms the interest of the general clarity of legislation.
 

110. The mere fact that the concept of “understandable, clear and simple language” used in this case

is decisive for the applicability of Article 12(1) of the GDPR, based on the facts and
circumstances require explanation does not mean that the administrative law imposed on the basis of that provision
fine is contrary to the lex certa principle.
 

111. This description is so clear, foreseeable and knowable that TikTok could have known that it was not in
offer the Dutch language of its privacy policy to Dutch(lingual) data subjects, of which

constitutes a large proportion of children, would violate the requirement of clear and
simple language as referred to in Article 12(1) of the GDPR. This is especially true now in the
Guidance on Transparency It is considered that when the controller is
addressed to data subjects who speak another language, a translation into those languages must be provided.
This obligation applies in particular when it is addressed to (young) children, so that they
easily understand and connects to the specific protection that children
earn under Recital 58 of the GDPR. The TikTok app is aimed at Dutch
involved, including children, and is largely in the Dutch language to them
made available. In addition, TikTok points the user in the app when installing the app
Dutch language that he or she agrees with its privacy policy.

121. Pursuant to Article 7 of the Fine Policy Rules 2019, the AP keeps without prejudice to Articles 3:4 and 5:46

of the General Administrative Law Act (hereinafter: Awb) take into account the following factors that are:
derived from Article 83, paragraph 2 of the GDPR, referred to under a up to and including in the 2019 Fine Policy Rules
k.

 
6.3 Fine amount

 

122. This section first examines the factors that are considered pursuant to Article 7 of the

Fines policy rules 2019 are relevant for determining the amount of the fine. Finally, it goes into
on the principle of proportionality.
 

123. According to the AP, in this case, the following are mentioned in Article 7 of the 2019 Fine Policy Rules

factors relevant for determining the amount of the fine:
- the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement;
- the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (culpability);
 - the measures taken by the controller or processor to
   to limit the damage suffered by those involved.
 

6.3.1 Nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement
 
124. Pursuant to Article 7, opening words and under a, of the Fine Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the

nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement. In assessing this, the AP will include the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing as well as the number of data subjects affected and the
extent of the damage they have suffered.

 

125. The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.

Under Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 16,
paragraph 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, everyone has the right to
protection of his personal data. The principles and rules concerning the protection of
natural persons when processing their personal data must comply
with their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular with their right to protection of
personal data. The GDPR aims to contribute to the creation of an area of freedom,
security and justice and of economic union, as well as to economic and social progress, the
strengthening and convergence of economies within the internal market and the well-being of
natural persons. The processing of personal data must serve people. It
right to the protection of personal data is not absolute, but must be

considered in relation to its function in society and must conform to the
proportionality principle against other fundamental rights. Any processing of
personal data must be done properly and lawfully. For natural persons it is
be transparent that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted
or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data is or will be processed
incorporated.

 

126. Pursuant to Article 12(1) of the GDPR, the controller must take appropriate measures

to ensure that data subjects receive the information related to the processing in a concise,
transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language
received, especially where the information is specifically intended for a child. If in conflict
is acted upon, it affects the right that data subjects have to respect for their
privacy and the protection of their personal data.

 

127. The activity of TikTok Inc. to which the findings of the AP relate concerns the provision of only

the English version of the privacy policy to Dutch data subjects, including a large
group of Dutch(speaking) children younger than 16 years old. The privacy policy has not been published in the Dutch language
language, while a good command of the English language in that age (group) does not
is self-evident. It was therefore not possible for them to determine in advance the magnitude and consequences
of the processing and it was not clear how their personal data is used
would become.

 

128. In assessing the seriousness of the violation, the AP also takes into account the large number of those involved

and the amount of personal data processed. Section 4.4 of this Decree has already
explained that in an indicative study conducted at the end of 2019, a research firm estimated that
approximately 830,000 Dutch children under the age of 18 use TikTok and that TikTok on
At that time, it was mainly used by children around the age of 12 years.
In the same section, it was noted that media reports in August 2020 report that figures
of TikTok's parent company show that the number of active TikTok users in the Netherlands
had increased to 4.5 million, with users aged 13 to 17 years 28
percent of all users in the Netherlands, which equates to approximately 1,260,000 young
users. The processing operations thus also related to a vulnerable group of persons,
namely children. They have the right to specific information regarding their personal data
protection, as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and
safeguards and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data.46 This makes, in
especially in view of the massive number of young TikTok users in the Netherlands, the
violation very serious.

 

129. With regard to the duration of the violation, the AP takes into account a period from 25 May 2018 to
with 28 July 2020, in which it considers it particularly important that, in the opinion of the AP, this means
was of an offense that lasted for a significant period of time.

130. In view of the seriousness and duration of the violation, the AP sees reason to adjust the basic amount of the fine

pursuant to Article 6 and Article 7, opening words and under a, of the 2019 Fine Policy Rules, to be increased by
€225,000 to €750,000, being the maximum of the bandwidth of the violation
linked fine category.
 

6.3.2 Intentional or negligent nature of the infringement (culpability)
 
131. Pursuant to Article 5:46, paragraph 2 of the Awb, when imposing an administrative fine, the AP will

into account the extent to which this can be blamed on the offender. Pursuant to Article 7, under
b, of the Fines Policy Rules 2019, the AP takes into account the intentional or negligent nature of the
infringement. Now that this is a violation, the imposition of an administrative fine is
in accordance with settled case law47, it is not required to demonstrate intent and the DPA may
presume culpability if the perpetrator is established.48

 

132. According to Article 12(1) of the GDPR, the data controller must provide the information in connection with
with the processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and
in clear and plain language to the data subjects, in particular when the
information is specifically intended for a child. From a professional party like TikTok Inc. may, fellow
given the nature and extent of the processing, they are expected to be well aware of the
applicable standards and comply with them.

 

133. TikTok Inc. has consciously disclosed its privacy policy to Dutch data subjects – including children –

provided in the English language only49, while the requirement of intelligibility requires that when the
controller addresses data subjects who speak another language, they are at least
provides a translation in that language to those data subjects. This obligation applies in particular now
TikTok Inc. also aimed at (young) children, while the TikTok app itself for the most part
is made available to them in the Dutch language and TikTok the user when installing the
app does indicate in the Dutch language that he or she agrees with its privacy policy. In the
In light of the foregoing, the AP considers the violation culpable.

 
6.3.3 Measures taken to limit the damage suffered by those involved

 

134. The AP considers that TikTok Inc. has taken various measures aimed at
to limit the damage suffered by those involved. Getting involved when using the TikTok app
pop-up notifications informing them about the public nature of any information
post videos. In addition, the updated privacy and security settings and the Help

TikTok Center and Safety Center, where users are provided with information, contribute to a
better transparency. Also, with effect from July 29, 2020, TikTok has provided its privacy policy in the
Dutch language to Dutch stakeholders and as of that date also has a separate
document made available in which (Dutch-speaking) children are presented in comprehensible language
informed.

 
135. The AP considers that this does not remove the consequences for the rights of data subjects and

already concludes on that basis that there is no reason to increase the basic amount of the fine
pursuant to Article 7, under c of the Policy Rules 2019.

 

6.3.4 Other factors
 
136. The AP sees no reason to change the basic amount of the fine on the basis of the other provisions in Article 7 of the
Circumstances referred to in the penalty policy rules 2019, insofar as applicable in the present
case, increase or decrease.
 

6.3.5 Proportionality
 
137. Finally, on the basis of Articles 3:4 and 5:46 of the Awb (principle of proportionality), the AP assesses whether
the application of its policy for determining the amount of the fine given the circumstances
of the specific case, does not lead to a disproportionate outcome. Apply to it
proportionality principle, according to the 2019 Fine Policy Rules, the AP means that when determining
of the fine takes into account, if necessary, the financial circumstances in which the offender
is in. TikTok has not invoked limited capacity, which is why there are already
there is no reason to moderate the fine on the basis of proportionality. The AP considers a fine in this case
of € 750,000 is appropriate and bid and TikTok Inc. sufficient to bear this amount
can afford.

 
6.3.6 Conclusion
 
138. The AP sets the total fine at €750,000.
