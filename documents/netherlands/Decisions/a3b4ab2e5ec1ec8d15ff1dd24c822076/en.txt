1 Introduction
 
By decision of February 6, 2017, the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has sent the National Police (NP) a
order subject to periodic penalty payments imposed.1 This order subject to periodic penalty payments consisted of five parts and related
on the security and training regulations of the national in use by the NP
Second Generation Schengen Information System (N.SIS II). At the end of the beneficiary period
the AP has determined that the NP has complied with four of the five burden components. The AP has
found that the NP did not meet the burden component pertaining to the regular and proactive
checking log files. This left one violation of Section 4(3) of the Act
protection of police data (Wpg), which - as follows from the assessment included in the present Decree -
continues to date.
 
2. Course of the procedure
 
The AP has conducted an official investigation into the use of the N.SIS II by the NP. The
research findings are included in the final findings report dated October 22, 2015
(research report).2
 
As a result of these findings, the AP issued a decision subject to periodic penalty payments on 6 February 2017
imposed, consisting of five parts (I to V). This decision is now irrevocable.

After the end of the six-month beneficiary period, the NP sent documents in which it
has made known what measures it has taken in response to the order imposed under
penalty.
By decision of 12 March 2018, the AP determined that the NP was affected by the implementation of the
measures has complied with load components I to IV. 3 The AP has further established that this is not the case
requirement part V has been complied with. Therefore, the DPA in that same decision - which is now irrevocable -
proceeded to collect the forfeited penalty of € 40,000.
 
In connection with the continuous violation with regard to the aforementioned load component, the AP has added
letter of 29 March 2018 expressed the intention to (again) impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments that extends
to take measures with which the NPN will still end the remaining violation.
 
In a letter dated 11 April 2018, the NP expressed its views on this intention.
 
A hearing took place on April 12, 2018, at which the NP was given the opportunity to present its views
provide oral explanations in writing. The record of the hearing is attached as Annex 1 to this decision
attached.
 
In a letter dated 12 June 2018, the AP requested an explanation of the methods proposed by the NP.
 
In a letter dated 3 July 2018, the NP provided an additional explanation of its view on request.
 
In a letter dated 29 August 2018, the NP announced that it had taken measures in this regard
of the observed violation.
 
3. Background
 
The investigation report established, among other things, that the NP's checks on the log files
are generated in the context of data processing in N.SIS II only takes place in the case
there are safety signals, integrity investigations, complaints or a technical malfunction.4 Therefore
the NP did not comply with Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg, which entails that log files from under
other events that record user activity should be checked regularly
and assessed. The order subject to periodic penalty payments of 6 February 2017 served (among other things) to terminate this
offence.
 
The NP has proposed two approaches – one for the short term and one for the longer term –
with which it believes that it can put an end to the violation. Only by letter dated 29 August 2018 did the NP
informed the AP that the intended and temporary working method has now been introduced. The AP finds
however – with reference to the considerations set out below – that the NP
The implemented method does not lead to the termination of the research report and in

the order subject to periodic penalty payments of February 6, 2017 established violation of Article 4, third paragraph, of the
Wpg. This is reason for the AP to, pursuant to Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wpg5, in conjunction
viewed with Article 58, second paragraph, under d, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
Article 16, paragraph 1, of the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act (UAVG) and
Article 5:32, first paragraph, of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb) to impose the present order subject to a penalty.
lay. The order subject to periodic penalty payments is intended to end the aforementioned continuous violation.
 
4. Explanation of the legal framework
 
By decision of 12 March 2018, the AP established that the NP has not complied with part V of the
order subject to periodic penalty payments of 6 February 2017. The NP has not disputed this. On March 29, 2018, the AP
expressed its intention to (again) impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments with regard to the currently remaining,
continuous violation. Since then, there have been no material changes to the legal framework
occurred that have substantive consequences for the present file.
 
The legal framework is included as Annex 2 to this Decree.6
 
5. View of the NP
 
In letters dated 11 April, 3 July and 29 August 2018, the NP describes two methods with which it believes the
violation of Article 4, third paragraph, of the Wpg. It is:
1) a temporary method, [CONFIDENTIAL] and
2) an automatic method that the NP wants to introduce in the longer term [CONFIDENTIAL].7
 
[CONFIDENTIAL]
 
 
                                                                        
5 Article 47 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention,
the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, and on freedom
movement of such data and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (Directive (EU) 2016/680) refers to the
powers of supervisory authorities to take corrective action. This Directive has been implemented in
national legislation that has not yet entered into force at the time of this decision. Now the implementation term of this one
Directive has expired, national law - including Article 35, second paragraph, of the Wpg - must become directive-compliant
interpreted.
6 The aforementioned Directive (EU) 2016/680 requires, among other things, that appropriate technical and organizational measures are taken
to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. In view of this, an interpretation in conformity with the guideline has no effect
material change of the legal framework.
The following applies with regard to the NEN-EN-ISO/IEC 27002:2017 (NEN standard). For the assessment of whether there is appropriate
technical and organizational security measures, the AP previously aligned with the further implementation that is given to them
the Information Security Code, the NEN-ISO/IEC 27002:2013 standard. It is now in line with the most recent interpretation, namely NEN-
EN ISO/IEC 27002:2017. The website https://www.nen.nl/NEN-Shop/Norm/NENENISOIEC-270012017-nl.htm states: 'This European
acceptance does not deviate substantively from the NEN-ISO variant with publication date 2013'. The standard has therefore remained materially the same.
Section 12.4 of this document is (particularly) important in the present file.
7 This working method has previously been put forward in the correspondence and documents that the NP has sent to the AP in the context of
the inspection by the AP of compliance with load part V of the previously imposed order subject to periodic penalty payments. It is
correspondence dated August 4, 2017, November 24, 2017, December 4, 2017, and December 7, 2017.

6. Assessment
 
Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Wpg, the NP must, in short, provide appropriate, technical and
take organizational measures to protect police data against accidental or
unlawful destruction, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. This means that, given the
interpretation given by the NEN standard, log files of events that indicate user activities,
record exceptions and information security events should be made,
kept and regularly reviewed.
 
[CONFIDENTIAL]
 
The AP concludes that the NP with the implementation of the temporary and partly manual method
does not regularly and proactively check the log files regarding N.SIS II for illegal activity
processing. This does not provide it with an up-to-date and representative picture of unauthorized access or
unlawful use of police data. In view of the foregoing, the violation of Article 4,
third paragraph of the Wpg.
 
7. Order subject to periodic penalty payments and grace period
 
Pursuant to Section 35(2) of the Wpg, viewed in conjunction with Section 58(2)(d),
of the AVG, article 16, first paragraph, of the UAVG and article 5:32, first paragraph, of the Awb, the AP is
the case at hand is authorized to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments.
 
The AP attaches a grace period of twelve weeks to the order subject to periodic penalty payments. At the
setting this term, it considered it important that this violation already occurred in October 2015
and has therefore continued for at least three years. The AP also considers it important that
the NP stated at the time in its opinion of 12 April 2018 that the timely and manual
working method largely still had to be worked out, but from 1 September at the latest (i.e. slightly more than
twenty weeks later) could be operational. This method is now operational, but the AP has
concluded that this method is not sufficient to remove the violation.
 
In determining the penalty, the AP considers it important that the penalty imposed by decision of 6 February
2017 has been determined, before the ANP has proved to be insufficient incentive to (fully) comply with the associated
load to meet. The amount of the penalty in that decision amounted to a maximum in total
€ 200,000 for five violations, therefore € 40,000 per violation. In view of an early
termination of the infringement, which has been ongoing for some time, is the periodic penalty payment in the present decision
increased and the additional amount to be forfeited increases by every two after the end of the beneficiary period
weeks that the burden has not been met.
 
In view of the foregoing, the AP comes to the following. If the NP does not observe the violation
terminates within twelve weeks, it will forfeit for every two at the end of that period of favour
weeks that the order has not been complied with a penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty for the

€120,000), two weeks later (six weeks after the end of the beneficiary period), she forfeits an additional €90,000 (in total
€210,000) and two weeks thereafter (eight weeks after the end of the beneficiary period) she forfeits an additional €110,000 (in total
320,000).

8. Operative part
 

The AP imposes the following order subject to periodic penalty payments on the NP:
 
The NP must be submitted within twelve weeks of the date and with due observance of this decision in the context of the
data processing in N.SIS II to take measures that ensure that the log files are regularly and
are proactively monitored for indications of unauthorized access or use of
police data.
 
If the NP does not de
has implemented measures, the NP will forfeit a penalty of € 50,000 (in words: fifty thousand euros)
for the first two weeks after the end of the beneficiary period that the order has not been (fully) executed.
After that, the periodic penalty payment will be increased every two weeks by an amount of € 20,000.
(in words: twenty thousand euros). The maximum amount to be forfeited is € 320,000 (in words:
three hundred and twenty thousand euros).
 
If the NP wishes to forfeit the penalty immediately after the beneficiary period has expired
the AP advises the NP to provide the documents - with which the NP can demonstrate that it complies with the
order subject to periodic penalty payments (for example by means of an audit report) - in a timely manner, but no later than four weeks
before the end of the beneficiary period to the AP for assessment.
