Dear Mr Kliphuis,

Below you will find the decision of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) to impose an order under
penalty to Coöperatie VGZ U.A. (VGZ). This decision is part of the new decision of
Today on the objection of the Civil Rights Association Vrijbit (Vrijbit). This new decision on objection is
taken after the investigation carried out by the AP following the interim ruling of the
Midden Nederland court (the court) dated 7 July 2017, ECLI:NL:RBMNE:2017:3421 (de
interlude). This case was started with an enforcement request that Vrijbit submitted to the College
protection of personal data (CBP).

Vrijbit's enforcement request relates to the way in which Dutch health insurers
are currently processing personal data relating to health. According to Vrijbit, this method is in
violation of the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp), the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union (the Charter) and Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights and the
fundamental freedoms (ECHR). Vrijbit, in summary, underlies this that health insurers are still
always work in accordance with the Code of Conduct for the Processing of Personal Data for Healthcare Insurers (the code of conduct),
while the AP still withheld its approval of that code of conduct as a result of a
judgment of the Amsterdam District Court from 2013.1

The course of the procedure between Vrijbit and the AP, the legal framework, the decision of the
Amsterdam District Court, the interim ruling, the original decision on the objection of 1 June 2016, the
the design of the investigation and the course of the investigation are set out in the new decision on
objection. The AP refers to this for brevity.

Findings
The findings of the AP . are annexed to this decision to impose the order subject to periodic penalty payments
added. First of all, this sets out the code of conduct and the privacy policy applied by VGZ
order (1). Subsequently, the aspects of digital declaration without diagnosis information are discussed (2),
purpose limitation (3), unauthorized access to personal data (4), processors (5) and medical
professional secrecy (6).

In its findings, the AP concludes that VGZ violates Article 13 of the Wbp. The AP has in
that framework noted the following:

- VGZ has organized its corporate culture in such a way that only employees have access

may have access to personal data relating to health to the extent necessary
for the purpose for which the employees process the personal data. Among other things,
established by VGZ that marketing employees do not receive any personal data regarding the
processing health.

- However, the investigation by the AP shows that a number of employees of the Customer and

VGZ brand partners actually have access to personal data relating to health,
while this is not necessary for their work. Being able to consult
personal data, pursuant to Article 1, opening words and under b, of the Wbp can be regarded as
processing personal data.

- VGZ therefore does not have sufficient technical resources to guarantee that

employees have not had access to personal data that is not necessary for
the purpose for which they are processed. In this context, the AP further points out that VGZ does not
keeps log files about access to special personal data.

- The foregoing leads to the conclusion that VGZ does not have suitable technological

measures as referred to in Article 13 of the Wbp;

- The AP has in the submitted documents that show how a marketing campaign at VGZ

being carried out, no indications were found for the conclusion that
marketing staff actually process personal data relating to health
for a marketing campaign. However, this does not detract from the conclusion that Article 13 of the Wbp is
because the technological measures taken by VGZ are not appropriate.


Principle obligation to enforce
From article 65 of the Wbp, viewed in conjunction with article 5:32, first paragraph, of the General Act
administrative law (Awb) follows that the AP is authorized to impose an order subject to a penalty in the event of violation
of Article 13 of the Wbp.
Pursuant to Article 5:2, first paragraph, opening words and under b, of the Awb, the order subject to a penalty is aimed at the
terminating the detected violation and preventing repetition.

In view of the public interest served by enforcement, in the event of a violation of
a statutory provision, as a rule, have to make use of its enforcement powers.
Special circumstances in connection with which enforcement action must be waived, do
not occur in this case.

Order subject to penalty and beneficiary period
The AP orders VGZ to set up its system in such a way that unauthorized access to
personal data is prevented.

The authorizations and consultation roles that VGZ uses for logical access security

Ensure adequate technological control systems on the basis of which it ensures

To that end, it must in any case:
1.
systems of the Customer and Brand Partners department need to be adapted, more
in particular for the employees listed in confidential annex 1. These authorizations and
consultation roles of the aforementioned employees of VGZ should be adapted in such a way,
that these employees in fact no longer have access to personal data, including
personal data relating to health, when the processing of these personal data
is not necessary for their work.
2.
that employees only have access to special personal data, including
personal data relating to health, where such access is necessary for the
work of an employee. In any case, this concerns logging of access and
changes, so that – whether or not as a result of incidents – it can be checked whether
employees have obtained access while access to this data is not necessary
for their work.
3.
takes place at least once every six months – by the Data Protection Officer and
the Compliance officer(s) to the management, which shows whether incidents have occurred and so
yes, which measures have been taken:
a.
b.

with regard to the aforementioned under 1;
with regard to the above mentioned under 2.

VGZ must also provide periodic written feedback – which is at least

- beneficiary period and amount of penalty with regard to parts 2 and 3b
In view of what VGZ has put forward about its wish to set up its system in such a way that
technically and largely automated, it is ensured that employees do not have access to more
personal data than is necessary for their work, the AP connects to part 2 and
part 3b of this charge a beneficiary period that ends on December 31, 2018.

If VGZ does not meet the burden before the end of the beneficiary period referred to under 6,
she forfeits a penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at an amount of
€ 150,000.00 for each (entire) week, after the end of the last day of the set term, on which VGZ
fails to comply with part 2 and part 3b of the order, up to a maximum of € 750,000.00.
In view of the fact that the penalty must be an incentive to comply with the order, the amount of the turnover,
of VGZ, the large number of insured persons and the seriousness of the violation, the AP deems the level of this
penalty appropriate.

- beneficiary period and amount of penalty with regard to parts 1 and 3a
With regard to part 1. of this burden, the AP is of the opinion that with the implementation thereof less
efforts are involved. The AP therefore attaches to part 1 and part 3a of the charge a
beneficiary period ending on 26 May 2018.

If VGZ does not meet the burden before the end of the beneficiary period referred to under 8,
she forfeits a penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at an amount of € 50,000.00
for each (entire) week, after the end of the last day of the set term, on which VGZ fails to
part 1 and part 3a of the charge, up to a maximum of € 250,000.00.
In view of the fact that the penalty must be an incentive to comply with the order, the amount of the turnover,
of VGZ, the large number of insured persons and the seriousness of the violation, the AP deems the level of this
penalty appropriate.

-interim report
The AP advises VGZ to make a statement – ​​once a quarter – on the basis of a concrete schedule
inform the AP about the progress of the measures it is taking to comply with the
imposed burden.

-post-check
The AP requests VGZ to submit supporting documents to the AP in good time before the end of the beneficiary period
send proof that the charge has been paid in full and on time. The timely submission of
documentary evidence does not alter the fact that the AP is authorized to conduct an investigation, including an investigation
on site, if deemed appropriate.

Explanation of the load
By way of explanation, the AP notes the following.

In the document 'CBP Guidelines. Security of personal data' (Government Gazette 2013, 5174, hereinafter also: de
guidelines) the question of when security measures are 'appropriate' within the meaning of
Article 13 of the Wbp. The guidelines make it clear that for that assessment, first of all
the reliability requirements to be set must be considered. This must be done on the basis of the nature of
the data to be protected is determined what an appropriate level of protection is. The nature of the
personal data is important here. Also the amount of processed personal data per person and
the purpose for which the personal data are processed must be taken into account.

In this case, it concerns the processing of data relating to health, i.e. special
personal data. This means that the consequences of an unlawful processing of that data,
can be serious for those involved. As a result, for the processing of personal data
requires a high level of security by VGZ.

After establishing the reliability requirements, the responsible party must
take security measures to ensure that the reliability requirements are met, such as
is in the guidelines. Security standards provide guidance when actually taking

appropriate measures to cover the risks. A very widely used security standard is the
Code for Information Security, NEN-ISO/IEC 27002+C1(2014)+C2 (2015). In this are concrete
security measures included. Security standards provide guidance during the actual encounter
appropriate measures to cover the risks. Which security standards for a particular
processing are relevant and which security measures based on these security standards
should be taken, however, should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The Code for Information Security lists the following relevant measures in this regard:
9.4.1 Restricting access to information
Access to information and system functions of applications should be restricted in accordance with the
access security policy.
12.4.1 Log events
Event logs that record user activities, exceptions, and information security events
should be created, stored and regularly reviewed.

Irrespective of the design of the access security policy, the nature of the
personal data that a health insurer such as VGZ processes and the scope of that processing, which is at least
at least log files are kept in such a way that at least a reactive check of
the log files is possible. In particular, the AP is concerned with acts in the form of
consultations or changes in the systems to which employees are authorized with regard to
(special) personal data are not logged, as a result of which a check on access to that data
data – for example as a result of incidents – is currently not possible.

As noted above, the AP found during the investigation that a number of employees
of the Customer and Brand Partners department have authorizations that give access to personal data
health, when this is not necessary for their work. VGZ has in her
response to the intention to enforce acknowledged the correctness of this finding. VGZ has stated that
it has taken corrective measures, as a result of which the unauthorized access has been terminated. Already
because this statement is not supported by evidence, the AP sees no reason to waive this point
of enforcement.

VGZ has also argued that the AP incorrectly
link between logging and preventing unauthorized access to
personal data. In response to this, the AP points out the following. The AP already has under 17 for this
explained that and why keeping log files for a health insurer such as VGZ is a
necessary measure to guarantee an appropriate level of security. This applies all the more to VGZ,
now that she has an access security policy that involves working with an authorization matrix
per officer. This entails the risk that the authorizations actually granted will not be valid over time
longer correspond to the authorizations that are strictly necessary for the activities of the
relevant employee.
Although the AP has not established that other VGZ employees have authorizations and
roles that enable more far-reaching access to (special) personal data than necessary
however, the AP VGZ has recommended that the authorization policy be elaborated in such a way that if

The main rule is that per function (group) it is determined which roles and authorizations for the exercise
are necessary for that function.


20 With regard to the beneficiary period, VGZ has proposed that the necessary

measures to meet the burden. VGZ has stated that it is dependent on
third parties. VGZ has not provided insight into this on the basis of a substantiated planning. Seen
the seriousness of the violation and, in the opinion of the AP, the measures to be taken, the AP deems the above
time limits mentioned under 6 and 8 are appropriate and reasonable.

What VGZ has put forward in its response to the intention to enforce this point,
In view of the foregoing, this is no reason for the AP to refrain from taking enforcement action.
