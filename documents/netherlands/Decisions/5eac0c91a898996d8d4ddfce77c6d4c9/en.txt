Dear Sirs [CONFIDENTIAL],
 
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has decided to inform your clients Uber B.V. (UBV) and Uber
Technologies, Inc. (UTI) jointly impose an administrative fine of € 600,000, because UBV and
UTI, as (jointly) responsible on November 15, 2016, at least within 72 hours at the latest
after UTI was notified of the data breach on November 14, 2016, the AP and
notify data subjects of the data breach.
 
The report to the AP first took place on November 21, 2017. On that same day, Uber issued a
published a news item about the data breach on its website. The AP and those involved are not with that
immediately notified of the data breach. This is a violation of Article 34a, first and second paragraph,
of the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp), as it applied at the time.
 
The decision is explained in more detail below. Paragraph 1 presents the facts on which it is based
depend on the decision. Section 2 describes the legal framework. In section 3, the AP assesses her

Services Uber

Processor Agreement

Storage of (personal) data in the United States

 
1.3
The Uber group offers a service that makes it possible for users of that service to book taxi rides
can be ordered via, among other things, an application (the Uber app). Users of the Uber app who want a taxi ride
orders (riders) are linked to drivers (drivers) who order via another application of the Uber-
concern customers (the Uber Driver app). Uber drivers use their own car for it
offering rides, are not employed by Uber and may not meet the demand for rides from Uber riders
accept or refuse.
 
To use the Uber apps, both as a rider or as a driver, it is necessary to have an account
to create. For this it is mandatory to provide first and last name, telephone number and e-mail address
to give. The purpose of processing this data is, among other things, to bring together demand and
offer to/from taxi rides and the processing of payments for those taxi rides.
 
1.4
On March 31, 2016, UBV and UTI concluded a Data Processing Agreement.
In it, UBV and UTI have agreed that UBV is responsible for the processing of
personal data that it collects and processes from data subjects outside the United States of America
(United States) and that UTI processes that data as a processor on behalf of UBV.
 
1.5
The data of drivers and users of the Uber app outside of the United States will be
forwarded from the Netherlands to the United States. There they are stored on servers of UTI
in the United States. It has also emerged that UTI has a processor agreement for the use of data
storage capacity/servers (AWS S3) has been contracted with Amazon. The purpose of that storage is to create
backups of that (personal) data.
 
1.6
On November 14, 2016, UTI was made aware of a vulnerability in its data security. On
that date the then [CONFIDENTIAL] of UTI received an e-mail message from a person who received the
[CONFIDENTIAL] informed that he and his team (reporter/reporters) have identified a major vulnerability in the
data security of the Uber group.
 
The reporter has had access to AWS S3 storage in the period from October 13, 2016 to November 15, 2016
of the Uber group through credentials stored in a private GitHub
repository of the Uber group. Amazon's servers contained "rider" (customer) and "driver"
(driver) data stored. This concerns the following personal data:
 
1 user ID;
2 Driver ID;
3 First and Last names;
4 Email address;
5 Mobile number;

On November 15, 2016, UTI fixed the data breach.
 
The data breach prompted UTI to call in [CONFIDENTIAL], a forensic expert. It
request to this effect was made on 18 October 2017. [CONFIDENTIAL] has investigated to what extent the
reporters had access to data from the Uber group that was on Amazon servers at the time
stored. [CONFIDENTIAL] has recorded its findings in a report.3 This has been established
the data breach involved 57,383,315 Uber users, of which 25,606,182 were American and
31,777,133 non-U.S. The information from UBV shows that approximately 174,000 Dutch Uber drivers
users have been affected by the data breach. It appears from the research carried out by [CONFIDENTIAL].
that 31 types of personal data were involved in the data breach.
 
On October 25, 2017, UBV's [CONFIDENTIAL] became aware of what Uber calls an “IT
security incident in 2016, that it was being investigated, and that it could potentially create a media cycle.”

On November 4, 2017, a meeting took place between UTI and UBV. During this discussion
UTI has indicated that there was a security incident.
 
On November 21, 2017, a news post was published on Uber's website by the current CEO of
UTI in which the public is informed about the data breach.4 On the same day, UBV reported
a data breach to the AP.
 
2. Legal framework
 
At the time of the data breach from October 13, 2016 to November 15, 2016 and at the time of the notification by
UBV to the AP on November 21, 2017, the Wbp applied, including the data breach notification obligation as laid down
in Article 34a, first and second paragraph, of the Wbp. The Wbp, which formed the implementation of a guideline
95/46/EC5, was repealed on 25 May 2018.6 On that day, the General Regulation
Data Protection (GDPR) has become applicable7 and the General Regulation Implementation Act
Data Protection (UAVG) entered into force.8
Subsection 2.1 will first describe the legal framework under the Wbp, insofar as relevant, and
explained. Subsection 2.2 then describes the legal framework under the GDPR, where relevant,
described.
 
2.1
 
2.1.1
Article 1, preamble and under a, of the Wbp stipulates that personal data is any data concerning a
identified or identifiable natural person. The concept of personal data must be broadened
conceived. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable “all means must be considered
which may be reasonably assumed to have been obtained by the person responsible for the processing
be used by any other person to identify said person”.9
 
Article 1, preamble and under b, of the Wbp stipulates that the processing of personal data is any act
or any set of acts related to personal data, including in any case the
collecting, recording, organizing, storing, updating, changing, retrieving, consulting, using,
providing by transmission, distribution or any other form of making available,

6 In Article 51 of the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act (UAVG) – which came into effect on
of 25 May 2018 – states that the Wbp will be withdrawn.
7 Article 99, second paragraph, of the GDPR stipulates that the GDPR applies from 25 May 2018.
8 By Royal Decree of 16 May 2018 (Staatsblad 2018, 145) the time for determining the entry into force of the UAVG
adopted on 25 May 2018. This decision is based on Article 53 of the UAVG, whereby the entry into force of the UAVG on a
time to be determined by Royal Decree has been made possible.

Article 1, preamble and under d, of the Wbp stipulates that the controller is the natural person,
legal entity or any other body or governing body that, alone or jointly with others, has the purpose
of and determines the means for the processing of personal data.
 
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has confirmed in a recent judgment that any
joint responsibility for certain data processing does not detract from the individual
responsibility of one of the (joint) controllers.10
 
2.1.3
Article 4(1) of the Wbp stipulates that the Wbp applies to the processing of
personal data in the context of activities of an establishment of a controller in the Netherlands.
 
Article 4, second paragraph, of the Wbp stipulates that the Wbp applies to the processing of
personal data by or on behalf of a controller who does not have an establishment in the European
Union, using automated or non-automated means located in the Netherlands
unless these means are only used for the transmission of personal data.
 
2.1.4
Article 13 of the Wbp stipulates that the responsible person has appropriate technical and organizational
implements measures to protect personal data against loss or against any form of
unlawful processing. These measures guarantee, taking into account the state of the art
and the costs of implementation, an appropriate level of security in view of the risks posed by the
processing and the nature of the data to be protected. The measures are also on it
aimed at preventing unnecessary collection and further processing of personal data.11
 
2.1.5 Data breach notification obligation
As of 1 January 201612, article 34a, paragraph 1, of the Wbp stipulates that the controller must inform the Board (read:

the protection of personal data.
 
Article 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp stipulates that the controller must immediately inform the data subject
of the infringement, referred to in Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, if the infringement is probable
will have unfavorable consequences for his privacy.
 
The AP has further elaborated in its Policy Rules on the obligation to report data breaches how those responsible
must give substance to the data breach notification obligation, and provide tools for those responsible to
determine whether they have to report certain security incidents under the data breach notification obligation to the AP
to report.13 The Policy Rules on the obligation to report data breaches also contain details of the obligation to report
data subjects. The Policy Rules on the obligation to report data breaches stipulate, among other things, that 'immediately', as intended
in Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, means notification within 72 hours.
 
2.1.6
Article 66, second paragraph, of the Wbp stipulates, insofar as relevant, that the AP can impose an administrative fine
imposing a maximum of the amount of the fine of the sixth category of Article 23, fourth paragraph, of
the Criminal Code with regard to violation of the provisions of Article 34a of the Wbp. Article
23, seventh paragraph, of the Criminal Code applies mutatis mutandis.
 
Article 66, third paragraph, of the Wbp stipulates, insofar as relevant, that the AP does not impose an administrative fine
due to violation of the provisions of or pursuant to the provisions referred to in Article 66, second paragraph, of the Wbp
articles, then after it has issued a binding instruction. The AP can give the offender a time limit
within which the instruction must be followed.
 
Article 66, fourth paragraph, Wbp stipulates that the third paragraph does not apply if the violation
committed intentionally or as a result of grossly culpable negligence.
 
2.2
 
2.2.1 Notification of a personal data breach to the AP
Article 33, first paragraph, of the GDPR stipulates that if a personal data breach has occurred
occurred, the controller notifies it without undue delay and, if
possible, at the latest 72 hours after becoming aware of it, to the person referred to in Article 55
competent supervisory authority, unless it is unlikely that the breach related to
personal data poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. If the
notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by a
justification for the delay.

after which the AP - pursuant to Article 60 of the Wbp - started an investigation. On November 23, 2017
the AP has sent a first written request for information to UBV. The final the
research findings of the study are included in the report dated June 1, 2018. That report and
Uber's views on the intention to impose an administrative fine have resulted

3.1.2 GDPR as a basis for a fine
At the time of the data breach from October 13, 2016 to November 15, 2016 and at the time of the notification by
UBV on 21 November 2017, the Wbp applied. The Wbp, which implemented Directive 95/46/EC15, is
withdrawn on 25 May 2018.16 On that day the GDPR also became applicable17 and the UAVG in
entered into force.18
 
The AVG replaces Directive 95/46/EG19 and the Wbp. Where the GDPR gives room for further rules
these are laid down in the UAVG. According to the recitals to the GDPR, the objectives and
principles of Directive 95/46/EC maintained.20 Both Directive 95/46/EC and the Wbp and the AVG
aim to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons
related to processing activities and the free movement of personal data within the Union
guarantees. The material standards to which the processing of personal data under the regime of the
GDPR, have - broadly speaking - also remained the same as those from Directive 95/46/EC and the Wbp.
 
In this case it is important that there is a
obligation to report data leaks21 and that failure to comply with the obligation to report is subject to a fine. In the Wbp, the
obligation to report laid down in 34a, first and second paragraph, of the Wbp and in the AVG in Article 33, first paragraph and
Article 34, first paragraph. These provisions aim to safeguard the same legal interests. The authority to
imposing an administrative fine for a data breach is regulated in the Wbp in Article 66, second paragraph,
of the Wbp and in the AVG in Article 58, second paragraph, opening lines and under i, read in conjunction with Article 83,
fourth paragraph of the GDPR. There is no question of a (substantial) material change to the regulations. Also
there is no other way of thinking about the criminal nature of the obligation to report as such.22 This is the case
of an uninterrupted legal order. This means that, to ensure the continuity of the
legal order, for conduct that - as in the present case - took place under the regime of the directive
95/46/EC and the Wbp, compliance must be ensured with the rights and obligations as they applied
under that regime.23

                                                                        
15 Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995, Official Journal of the European Communities, 23
November 1995, No. L 281/31 (the so-called Privacy Directive).
16 Article 51 of the UAVG – which came into effect on 25 May 2018 – states that the Wbp is repealed.
17 Article 99, second paragraph, of the GDPR stipulates that the GDPR applies from 25 May 2018.
18 By Royal Decree of 16 May 2018 (Staatsblad 2018, 145) the time for determining the entry into force of the UAVG is
adopted on 25 May 2018. This decision is based on Article 53 of the UAVG, whereby the entry into force of the UAVG on a
time to be determined by Royal Decree has been made possible.
19 Article 94 of the GDPR repeals Directive 95/46/EC with effect from 25 May 2018.
20 Cf. recital 9 of the GDPR.
21 Although Directive 95/46/EC did not contain any regulations on a data breach notification obligation, the legislative history regarding the
introduction of the reporting obligation in the Wbp that the legislator, with reference to the recognition by the European Union of the
protection of personal data as a fundamental right, as evidenced by Directive 95/46/EC, a regulation for
regarded the obligation to report data breaches as an overriding requirement of public interest. The legislative history also shows that with
the introduction of the reporting obligation was intended to prevent the processing of personal data in violation of Directive 95/46/EC
(Parliamentary Documents II 2012/13, 33 662, no. 3 Reprint, p. 14.)
22 There is, however, a change in the sentencing.
23 In this context, the AP refers to European jurisprudence in this regard. cf. CJEU 29 March 2011 on ThyssenKrupp
(C-352/09 P), CJEU 18 July 2007 regarding Lucchini (C-119/05) and the judgment of the Court of Justice of 25 February 1969 regarding
Klomp (Case 23-68).

In a case where the continuity of the legal order is at issue, insofar as relevant here,
tested against the substantive law as it applied at the time when the conduct24 took place.25 In this
the case is the Wbp, more specifically article 34a, first and second paragraph. This also means that is
affiliated with the 'more favorable' penalty regime for the offender under the Wbp, compared to the AVG.26
After all, under the GDPR, a violation of the reporting obligation can be fined up to €10,000,000 or, if
this is higher, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover27, while under the Wbp regime this is, in view of
Article 66, second, third and fourth paragraph, of the Wbp, was in principle a maximum of € 820,000.28
 
Pursuant to the GDPR, the obligation to report can be fined on the basis of Article 58, paragraph 2, preamble and
under i, viewed in conjunction with Article 83, fourth paragraph, under a. As the AP explains in more detail in this decision,
would the present conduct - and which conduct in this Decree constitute a violation of Article 34a, first and
second paragraph, of the Wbp is qualified - if it would have occurred under the regime of the
AVG have resulted in a violation of Articles 33, first paragraph and 34, first paragraph, of the AVG.
 
3.1.3 Wbp as a basis of jurisdiction; transitional law UAVG
Article 48, eighth paragraph, of the UAVG provides for transitional law. Pursuant to that provision
legal procedures and legal proceedings where the Dutch Data Protection Authority29 preceded
is involved in the entry into force of the UAVG, the law applies as it applied before
to the entry into force of the UAVG.
 
Insofar as conducting an investigation is a legal procedure as referred to in Article 48, paragraph 8, of the
UAVG then also derives the power to impose an administrative fine from the Wbp. It
then this concerns a legal procedure in which the AP, prior to the entry into force of the UAVG -
so before May 25, 2018 - got involved. This legal procedure continues after the withdrawal of the
Wbp and the application of the GDPR and the entry into force of the UAVG. Also by the AP
report drawn up on 1 June 2018 and (the procedure that led to) the present decision are part

                                                                        
24 It should be noted that an act also includes an omission, such as in the present case not immediately reporting a
data breach.
25 Again, reference is made to European jurisprudence in this area. cf. CJEU 29 March 2011 on ThyssenKrupp (C-

Conclusion on jurisdiction

 
of this legal procedure. This means that, based on the transitional law in the UAVG, the Wbp
this case applies and the AP with regard to the violation of Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp - the
not immediately report a data breach to the AP - is authorized pursuant to Article 48, paragraph 8, of the
UAVG to impose an administrative fine in conjunction with Article 66, second paragraph, of the Wbp.
 
3.1.4
The foregoing leads to the conclusion that the AP derives its authority from Article 58, second paragraph, opening words
and under i, in conjunction with Article 83, fourth paragraph, sub a of the AVG30 for violation of the
obligation to report referred to in Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp and as included since 25 May 2018 in
Article 33, paragraph 1 and Article 34, paragraph 1 of the GDPR.
 
3.2
 
3.2.1
It has been explained above that UBV and UTI use personal data in the sense for the benefit of their services
of the Wbp. In the context of the question of whether the reporting obligation as referred to in Article 34a has been complied with,
paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Wbp, it is important who can be regarded as the responsible party. The
after all, the controller is the standard addressee.
 
'Responsible' within the meaning of Article 1, preamble, and under d, of the Wbp, is understood to mean:
 

Responsible for data processing

Introduction

“the natural person, legal entity or any other body or administrative body that, alone or jointly with
others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;" 31

 
It follows from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the purpose of this provision - die
constitutes the implementation of the concept of 'controller' from Article 2(d) of
Directive 95/46/EC - consists in providing effective and complete protection for data subjects
insurance via a broad definition of the term 'responsible'.32
 
In this context it is also noted that the AVG in Article 4, paragraph 7, de
defines 'controller' as (materially) equivalent to Directive 95/46/EC and the Wbp.
 
3.2.2 UBV formal legal responsible
When answering the question of who is responsible, the formal-legal authority plays a role
determine the purpose and means of the data processing play an important role.33 In case of
corporate relationships, as at issue here, the legal entity under whose jurisdiction the

                                                                        
30 This power is enshrined in national law in Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG.
31 This description corresponds, where relevant, to the definition of 'controller' in Article 2, under
d, of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of natural
persons in relation to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

operational data processing takes place as seen by the controller.34 In the
processor agreement of 31 March 2016 (‘Data Processing Agreement’) between UBV and UTI, among others,
UBV is regarded as responsible (‘controller’35) for the processing of (personal) data
that it collects and processes from data subjects outside the United States, including data subjects in
Europe. UTI is then referred to therein as a processor ('processor')36 that for the benefit of UBV
processes personal data.37 The AP is of the opinion that it can be deduced from this that UBV has formally
has legal authority to determine the purpose and means of the data processing and thus
can be regarded as responsible within the meaning of Article 1, preamble, and under d, of the Wbp. This
does not rule out, as explained in more detail below, that in addition to UBV, UTI can also be used as
can be regarded as responsible.
 
3.2.3 UBV and UTI are jointly responsible
The AP is of the opinion that UBV not alone, but together with UTI aims and means for the
processing of personal data. UBV and UTI are therefore jointly responsible
to note. Each of the responsible parties, both UTI and UBV, is liable for the entirety of the
data processing and compliance with the related obligations.38 Substantiated below
the AP takes that position and also includes Uber's view of the AP report. Uber itself
considers UBV to be - solely - responsible.39
 
The controller is the organization that determines the purpose and means of data processing
determines. He can do this alone, but also together with others. The AP believes that UBV and UTI are too common
regarded as jointly responsible.
 
Although UBV has formal legal control under the processor agreement, this is not the case
by definition decisive for the question of whether UBV is (solely) responsible. As the Article 29-
working group - the independent advisory and consultative body of European privacy regulators and currently
called the European Data Protection Board - noted in its opinion of 16 February 201040, the
provisions in a contract often provide more clarity, but they are not always decisive. The term
'controller' is a functional term, intended to denote responsibilities
place where the actual influence lies.41 On the basis of this factual assessment, the
AP that UTI and UBV (jointly) make decisions regarding goal setting and
means of data processing.

With regard to UTI, these are:
 

- The joint determination of the purpose of the data processing;
- Adoption of the information security policy;
- Decisions on data storage, and
- Developing and offering the Uber app as well as performing updates.

 
These factors will be explained below.
 
Joint determination of the purpose of the data processing; uniform privacy policy
UBV and UTI primarily determine the purpose of the processing of the personal data. In the letter dated 7
February 2018 Uber states that the preparation of the privacy statement is a joint effort
of UBV and UTI.42 The introductory paragraph of the privacy statement shows that the
privacy statement applies to both personal data collected in the United States and abroad
are collected. It therefore has a worldwide application range. In the privacy statement, under
'Use of Information' states for what purposes the information can be processed. The by the users
information provided, including personal data, is used for the purpose of:
 

carry out internal work;

- enable, maintain and improve services;
-
- send messages or enable communication;
- send messages that Uber believes will be of interest to users;
- personalize and improve services.

  
Back-ups are made of the personal data processed by the Uber group
are stored in its AWS S3 storage in the United States.43 The processing of personal data
for making backups takes place as part of the regular (daily) business process of the
Uber group and can be regarded as such as part of the normal service to
users of the Uber app. The data breach saw personal data in the backups stored in the
(external) AWS S3 storage.44
 
From the above, the AP concludes that UTI and UBV 'together' have the purpose of processing
determine personal data. The advice of 16 February 2010 of the Article 29 working group states that who
determines the purpose of the processing in any case if becomes responsible for the processing
considered.45 Now that it appears from the foregoing that UTI and UBV jointly pursue the purpose of processing
establish personal data, they are already jointly responsible on that basis.

for drivers (‘drivers’) and were dated July 15, 2015 with (almost) identical purposes.

Information Security Policy
In addition to the purpose, UTI also (partly) determines the means for the processing. It is important to note that
notice that even if someone merely determines the means, he can be responsible. The Article 29-
In its aforementioned advice, the working group indicates that only van
responsibility exists when that determination relates to the material aspects of the
resources.46
 
The Uber group, of which UBV and UTI are part, uses a worldwide
information security policy (Information Security Policy) applicable to all entities of the Uber
concern. This policy, which includes security measures with regard to the protection of
information and (personal) data have been included, has been determined by UTI.47 This concerns, for example
for measures with regard to encryption, security procedures in the field of (rights to) access
to information48 and security requirements for Uber's information systems. From the
information security policy also shows that the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UTI is responsible for all
aspects of the security of information, including personal data. It
information security policy states in this regard: “Uber's information security training, guidance, direction,
and authority shall be delegated to the [CONFIDENTIAL].”49 So this is not just about technical or
organizational matters that could be delegated to a processor in themselves.50
 
The AP is of the opinion that UTI hereby establishes an essential aspect of the resources and this (partly) to it
contributes that UTI together with UBV the purpose of and the means for the processing of personal data
51 Nevertheless, the AP emphasizes that - as explained above - UTI is (partly) the goal of the
processing and can therefore already be jointly responsible with UBV
qualified.
 
View of Uber and response AP
Uber notes in its opinion on its working method that the controller determines how and why
personal data are processed. That the processor has a certain discretion about details
of the execution of the processing does not make the processor, Uber argues, yet responsible.

                                                                        
46 Working Group “Article 29”, Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of “controller” and “processor”, p. 17.
47 This can be deduced from the fact that in the Information Security
Policy Version 1.0 of March 9, 2014 on the front page states that “This document is the property of Uber
Technologies, Inc.”. The Information Security Policy Version 0.1 dated August 31, 2016 lists the front page author as "Uber lnc."
named. In the introduction, the document is introduced as “The Uber lnc (“Uber”or “the company”) Information Security Policy”.
In the subsequent version of the March 2017 information security policy, the front page reads UTI. In the
information security policy that applied at the time of the data breach reported by UBV, it is stated:
“Uber’s information security training, guidance, direction, and authority shall be delegated to the Chief Security Officer (CSO).”
48 For example, the Article 29 working group indicates that the entity that decides, for example, for whom the processed data
must be accessible can be regarded as responsible (recommendation 1/2010 on p. 18).

Uber hereby refers to the letter of May 14, 2002 from the Dutch Data Protection Authority (CBP).
and the guidelines of the ICO.
 
The AP does not follow this view and notes that establishing the security policy is not considered "details
of the execution of the processing' can be considered. The AP notes that in the letter from the
CBP from 2002 is explained in general terms that to answer the question who
controller, more weight is given to determining the purposes of the processing
then to determine the details of the processing and that for the demarcation
controller/processor determining the purposes of the processing and control
be decisive. In the AP's opinion, the content of this letter cannot be inferred
that the way in which UTI in particular (actually) operates should lead to the conclusion that UBV and UTI
cannot be considered jointly responsible. On the contrary, as before
noted, UTI also determines the purposes and means of the processing.
 
In its opinion, Uber also quotes a passage from the guidelines of the ICO, from which, according to Uber
appears that a processor has a certain discretion about details of the implementation of
data processing. The guidelines give an example of a bank that is an IT company
enable data storage.
In response, the AP notes that this example does not warrant the conclusion that UTI is not present in this case
can be regarded as jointly responsible. The role of UTI goes as detailed below
beyond just taking care of the storage as mentioned in the guidelines of the ICO
example. Moreover, being jointly responsible is also determined by handling
of a uniform privacy policy and the determination of the information security policy by UTI as well
the development, offer and updates of the Uber apps and the handling of the
data breach by UTI.
 
Storage of personal data
The storage of personal data plays an important role in the processing of personal data. Also
with regard to storage, UTI takes important decisions and has a large degree of control.
For example, it is UTI that has entered into an agreement with Amazon for storage for backups. 52
It has been agreed that use will be made of the Amazon storage service AWS S3. In that
connection has also been selected by UTI for the United States as the location for that storage, where

From the above, the AP concludes that UTI is committed to the storage of personal data
autonomous from UBV and has had a decisive influence on the way in which the storage -
a means of processing personal data - takes place. UTI has (in fact) a big one
degree of control over the way in which the processing of personal data takes place.
It was more than a mere supporting role and it makes sense when combined with the other facts and
circumstances - applying a uniform privacy policy, establishing the
information security policy as well as the development, offer and updates of the
Uber apps, and the handling of the data breach by UTI - that UTI and UBV are jointly responsible
are.

View of Uber and response AP
In its view on the storage, Uber states that it disagrees with the AP's conclusion that UTI is the
determining influence of UTI on the location and performance of the data storage as an indicator
considered to designate UTI as responsible for data processing. She points out that the
processor agreement allows storage by UTI and that UTI as processor also has a sub-processor (in this
case Amazon) can enable. In doing so, UTI has ensured that the same obligations apply
between UTI and Amazon as between UBV and UTI. According to UTI, this is also a common construction.
 
In this regard, the AP notes that the circumstance that the storage of personal data by UTI
is possible on the basis of the processing agreement and a processor may also use a sub-
processor, this does not mean that decisions that UTI has actually made about the storage of
personal data - and in combination with the other facts and circumstances mentioned - with it
would be irrelevant to the question of whether UBV and UTI can become jointly responsible
marked. The AP is of the opinion that this is not the case. In this regard, the AP emphasizes that UTI
has independently taken the aforementioned decisions with regard to the storage without involving UBV in this
know. It does not alter the type of decisions and the autonomous occurrence of UTI in combination
with the other aforementioned facts and circumstances play a role in the assessment that UBV and
UTI are jointly responsible.
 
Uber app development, offerings and updates
The Uber group offers a service that makes it possible for users to travel via a special purpose
developed app (Uber app) to purchase passenger transport. Users are linked to a
driver (driver) who can hire customers via another app (Uber Driver app). The special
developed mobile applications essentially form the core service of the Uber group.53 UTI54 has developed the
Uber app - which serves as the basis for other apps - developed and has licensed UBV to develop the app
while Uber app updates are also performed by UTI. 55 With that, UTI
contributes to the determination of the purpose and means for the processing of personal data.56 Furthermore, UTI is also
the provider of the Uber app in the Apple App store and Google Play Store. That UBV - to Uber in her

viewpoint - is responsible for adding new functionalities, does not matter
off. Rather, it emphasizes shared responsibility. The circumstance that UTI developer,
provider and implementer of updates to the Uber app is still one of the elements that is relevant
for the question whether UBV and UTI can be regarded as jointly responsible. That also applies
with regard to Uber's argument in its view that the provider of the app and the identity of the
developer of the Uber app is irrelevant or not decisive for who is the processor or
is responsible.
 
Interim conclusion joint responsibility
Based on the aforementioned circumstances, the AP concludes that UBV and UTI jointly
be responsible.
 
The handling of the data breach by UTI
The AP sees itself confirmed and strengthened in its judgment that UTI and UBV are jointly responsible
due to the autonomous and independent role that UTI has taken in handling the data breach. In that
In this context, the AP notes that the actual decisions about the handling of the data breach - about which UBV
has been informed - independently and solely by it - almost a year after the data breach took place
personnel of UTI have been taken. There are by the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UTI, without UBV herein
knowledge and to give it the opportunity to influence it, specific and important
measures taken. These measures relate to the encryption of files in the AWS S3 buckets and
requiring two-factor authentication for services used by the Uber group and those
be accessible via the internet.57
 
Uber's position in its view that the independent handling of the data breach by UTI without
involving UBV only demonstrates that UTI is not the obligations under the agreement
fulfilled, the AP does not follow. In doing so, Uber fails to recognize that this actual course of action is precisely the conclusion of
the AP confirms that UTI makes decisions independently and thus actually has control over the way
on which a data breach is handled.
 
UTI also has - as Uber indicates in number 2.23 of its opinion - a law firm
[CONFIDENTIAL]requested to engage [CONFIDENTIAL], an external forensic expert. Also
UBV is not known in advance (or immediately afterwards). That it is according to Uber - as it is in its view
states -it was logical that UTI independently conducted an investigation because the incident related to
more US users than Dutch users or that of any other country and UTI the
is responsible for the processing of personal data of users in the United States,
not convincing. According to the AP, it would have been obvious to involve UBV precisely because it is part of the storage
of personal data in the United States also includes personal data collected and
processed from data subjects outside the United States and for this in accordance with the processing agreement
UBV responsible.58

UTI has notified the notifiers of the data breach for the protection of user data59
reward paid. This involves a considerably larger amount than is usually paid.60 UBV
is not involved and not known in the decision-making process. The in this regard with the reporters concluded
agreement has been signed by UTI personnel and on behalf of UTI. UBV was out there.
 
View of Uber and response AP
In its opinion, Uber notes that the payment to the reporters and the agreement concluded with them
there is no indication that UTI is responsible because it says nothing about determining the purposes
of the processing of user data.
The AP does not follow this argument. UTI's [CONFIDENTIAL] has made it known why
this payment was made: “our primary goal in paying the intruders was to protect our consumers’ data.” It forms
in other words, a means of protecting the (personal) data of the customers of the Uber
concern. That this is done by paying a considerably larger amount than usual and without
Involving UBV in this also shows that UTI goes further than a processor can be
expected.
 
In its view, Uber points out that the circumstance that UTI staff - without UBV
inform - has dealt with the data breach and taken measures, does not mean that UTI
is responsible.
The AP notes that the way in which UTI actually operates and makes decisions where the
handling of the data breach is one of the factors relevant to whether UTI as
jointly responsible. The role that UTI plays in handling the incident
does not stand on its own.
 
3.2.4 Conclusion of joint responsibility
In view of the above, the AP concludes that UBV and UTI are jointly responsible in the sense
of article 1, preamble, and under d, of the Wbp. The AP has taken into account the
processor agreement, whereby UBV is designated as responsible. Furthermore, it has been found that UTI
together with UBV has determined the purpose of the data processing, UTI itself
has established an information security policy, has taken important decisions independently
regarding the storage of personal data and has developed and also offers the Uber app and
updates for it. The AP's judgment is further strengthened by the independent manner
on which UTI has dealt with the data breach in question. Joint responsibility brings with it
Please note that each of the responsible parties, i.e. both UTI and UBV, is liable for the entirety of the
data processing and compliance with related obligations. Note in this regard

Introduction

 
3.3.1
As appears from subsection 2.1.5, as of 1 January 2016, pursuant to Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp
a duty to report data breaches to the AP. Pursuant to this duty to report, the controller must submit to the AP
to immediately notify a breach of security, as referred to in Article 13, of the Wbp, which
leads to the significant chance of serious adverse consequences or has serious adverse consequences for the
protection of personal data. This duty to report contributes to conservation and recovery
of public, customer, market, government and regulatory trust in the
relevant institution or company when handling personal data.61
 
3.3.2 The responsible party is the standard addressee
It has been explained with reasons that UBV and UTI are jointly responsible
to notice. Both are jointly responsible for compliance with the Wbp for the whole of the
processing. This means that both UBV and UTI have an obligation to immediately report a data breach
to which Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp related. Uber's position in its view that the
obligation to report does not apply to UTI because UTI is not responsible - and therefore none
standard addressee - the AP therefore considers incorrect.
 
3.3.3
Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp refers to a breach of security as referred to in
article 13 Wbp (currently article 32 of the AVG). Article 13 concerned a security regulation to which the
responsible had to abide by and aimed against 'loss or any form of unlawful
processing of personal data. Unauthorized access is a form of unlawful
processing62 against which the security measures must provide protection. In the present case
as explained below, unauthorized persons from outside the Uber group have access to the
data storage provided by Uber. For example, they could download files that gave them access to,
and could take cognizance of, personal data. Thus, there was a form of illegality
processing.
 
From October 13, 2016 to November 15, 2016, personal data stored in the AWS S3
storage of UTI accessible to unauthorized persons from outside the Uber group.
 
In its opinion on page 18, under 3.5, Uber expressly states that it "does not dispute that in that period
there was a breach of security within the meaning of Article 34a Wbp'.63 In this context it is noted that
UTI forensic expert [CONFIDENTIAL] investigated this data breach and her
reported findings.64 [CONFIDENTIAL] was asked to determine to what extent the

unauthorized access to the data stored on the AWS S3 storage:
“[CONFIDENTIAL] was instructed to determine the extent of these outside actors’ access to Uber’s data stored on S3.”
 
[CONFIDENTIAL] has found that unauthorized users have stolen a total of 16 files from the AWS S3 storage
of the Uber group65 and thus had access to and could take note of
of the data contained therein. According to the unauthorized persons, they could access the so-called
private GitHub repository from Uber using previously leaked usernames and
passwords. This eventually allowed them to access the aforementioned AWS S3 files66.
These unauthorized persons have for the first time on October 13, 2016 and for the last time on November 15, 2016
files downloaded from this AWS S3 storage.67 The data breach therefore lasted almost five weeks.
During that period, these unauthorized persons could in any case gain access to personal data
Uber customers. This included unencrypted personal data such as first name,
surname, email address and telephone numbers of Dutch Uber users.68 Uber disputed
not, incidentally, that there was a breach of security. This constituted an infringement
on the security as referred to in Article 13 of the Wbp, as it applied at the time.
 
With regard to Dutch Uber users, UBV has made a representative selection of
personal data of ten Dutch riders and drivers as they are in the back-ups of the databases
downloaded by the unauthorized. This shows that, among other things, first name, last name, e-mail address and
telephone numbers of Dutch Uber users are present in the downloaded database backup
were.69
 
3.3.4
Pursuant to Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, there is first a notifiable breach of the
security if that breach “leads to the significant likelihood of serious adverse consequences or serious adverse
has consequences for the protection of personal data”.
 
Because in this case unauthorized people have downloaded files from Uber on its AWS S3 storage and
thus had access to and could take cognizance of the personal data contained therein
Uber customers were involved in unlawful processing and have adverse consequences for the
protection of personal data has actually manifested itself. That is why it is judged

there is a data breach that must be reported.70
 
With regard to the scope of the personal data involved in the data breach, the AP notes that forensic
expert [CONFIDENTIAL] found that 57,383,315 Uber users were involved in the data breach
involved, of which 25,606,182 American and 31,777,133 non-American.71 It also appears from
information from Uber that approximately 174,00072 Dutch Uber users have been affected by the data breach.
With regard to the personal data involved in the data breach, the AP also notes that it concerns - as can be
are taken from the research carried out by [CONFIDENTIAL] - 31 species
personal data, as shown in the section 'facts and process'.
 
The size of the personal data involved in the data breach, the large number of different types
personal data, the type of personal data (names, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers) as well as the
fact that it concerns personal data of customers of one specific – globally operating –
company, make the personal data extra attractive, for example to be resold73
for activities such as '(spear) phishing'74, unwanted advertising (spam) and/or unwanted
telephone canvassing.75
 
Apart from the fact that unauthorized persons have gained access to Uber's storage and therefore already
it can be argued that there is a (considerable chance of) serious adverse consequences, as referred to in
Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, this is all the more the case, at least in view of the
the scope of the personal data involved, the type of personal data and the fact that it originates
goods of customers of one company, which is moreover active worldwide. As a result was Uber
required by law to report the data breach. Uber's argument that of serious adverse consequences,
at least the considerable chance of this would not exist, the AP therefore considers incorrect.
 
 Merely by way of illustration, the AP notes the following in this regard. If Uber actually meant it
that it should not have reported the data breach, the AP is surprised that UTI has nevertheless decided to

otherwise processed does not mean, according to the AP, that, as Uber argues in its opinion,

3.3.5 Data breach not reported immediately
If there is a data breach that is subject to a notification requirement, Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp obliges the
controller to inform the supervisor of this 'immediately'. What in a concrete
case should be regarded as 'promptly' depends on the circumstances of the case. Rational is that
the controller must be given some time to investigate the breach. The legislator
has left it to the supervisor to further define the term 'immediately'.83 The AP has this
done in the aforementioned policy rules 'Notification obligation data breaches in the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp)'
of 8 December 2015.84 The notification of the data leak must - according to paragraph 6 of the policy rules -
to the AP without undue delay, and if possible no later than 72 hours after discovery
done. The main rule is therefore that the notification must be made without undue delay, whereby 72 hours
in principle applies as the ultimate limit. In this context, it should also be noted that a provisional notification
can be done.85 In practice, this will not easily give rise to not complying with the stipulated
period of 72 hours to report a data breach.
 
As stated earlier, UTI and UBV are regarded by the AP as jointly responsible. On
Monday, November 14, 2016 UTI has been made aware of a vulnerability in her
data security. After all, on that date the then [CONFIDENTIAL]from UTI received an e-mail
mail message from a person86 who informed the [CONFIDENTIAL] that he had a major vulnerability

”to run the moment you, or a processor you have engaged, becomes aware of an incident
that may fall under the obligation to report data breaches.”90

 
UTI and UBV are jointly responsible and therefore the duty rested on both UTI and UBV separately
to report the data breach no later than 72 hours after UTI was notified of it on November 14, 2016
to report to the AP. The data breach was first reported on November 21, 2017, making it 371
days after its discovery, which exceeds the prescribed period of 72 hours
exceeded. An immediate notification as referred to in Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp is therefore
no way. The AP does note that, now that UBV has reported the data breach to the AP on November 21, 2017,

(again) to do.
 
Apart from that, the AP notes that the period for reporting on the basis of the policy rules is now (partly) extended

As explained above, the importance of an immediate report lies, among other things, in the

of the data leak can by no means be spoken of, there is a situation in which that confidence is in high
mate is ashamed. In this context, it is emphasized once again that a data breach is also possible subject to conditions
be reported and can be supplemented or withdrawn if necessary.
 
View of Uber and response AP
The explanation given by Uber for not reporting to the AP within the 72-hour period of the
data breach has been regarded in the investigation report as insufficiently motivated. Uber has indicated that
was not reported in time, but that it cannot explain why this was not done.96 Uber's position in
her view in which she indicates that UBV, after being informed by UTI of the data breach
has reported the data breach to the AP within an 'adequate' period of 21 November 2017 (and via its
authorized representative on November 20 of the intention to report to the AP) is convincing
the AP does not. As noted, (also) UTI, as (jointly) responsible on November 15, 2016,
in any event no later than 72 hours after UTI became aware of the data breach on November 14, 2016
stated, can and must report the data breach.
 
In its opinion, Uber also states that the notification form was not made for foreign users
companies and is specifically aimed at Dutch companies. The AP notes in this regard
that it cannot be concluded from this that this would dismiss UTI, as joint controller
of its obligation to report to the AP or that this would be an impediment to (immediately) report the data breach.
UTI could have contacted AP about this. The AP remarks superfluously that

                                                                        
92 Ditto.

already occurred in 2016.

the website of the AP also has an English version that points to the possibility with the AP
to get in touch. Moreover, UTI could have used UBV as a point of contact or one
authorized representative in the Netherlands.
 
3.3.6 Conclusion
From the above, the AP concludes that UBV and UTI, as (jointly) responsible on 15
November 2016, at least within 72 hours after UTI was notified on November 14, 2016
of the data breach pursuant to Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, the data breach was/were obliged to
report to the AP. However, the notification to the AP only took place on November 21, 2017 and was
not immediately as referred to in that paragraph. In view of this, there is a violation of Article
34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, whereby UBV and UTI are both offenders. As far as it should be
assumed that - in the interpretation of Uber - only UBV is responsible and UTI processor,
does this assumption not lead to a different conclusion, now that the period of 72 hours is based on the policy rules
runs from the time the processor (UTI in this case) becomes aware of the incident, te
know November 14, 2016.
 
3.4

Violation of reporting obligation to the person concerned

Introduction

Infringement is likely to have an adverse impact on privacy

3.4.1
As can be seen from subsection 2.1.5, as of 1 January 2016, pursuant to Article 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp
a duty to report data breaches to those involved. Pursuant to this obligation to report, the controller must
notify the data subject without undue delay of a security breach if the breach is likely
will have unfavorable consequences for his privacy. Both UBV and UTI is, as jointly
responsible, standard addressee thereof. In this context, the AP refers for the sake of brevity to what is stated in
has already been considered above about the violation of the obligation to report to the AP. The same applies to
regarding the security breach.
 
3.4.2
Pursuant to Article 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp, a notifiable breach is defined as the breach
is likely to have unfavorable consequences for the privacy of the data subject(s) who use it
concerns. Because in this case unauthorized files of Uber from its AWS S3 storage
downloaded and thus had access to and could take cognizance of the contained therein
personal data of Uber customers, in the opinion of the AP, there are unfavorable consequences for the
privacy of the data subjects whose personal data it concerned. The AP notes with respect
of the scope of the concept of personal privacy, which becomes personal data
protected as part of privacy within the meaning of Article 10 of the Constitution and
as part of the right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR.97 Everyone
has the right to have his personal data processed in a lawful manner, in order to prevent
that he suffers from this.

In addition to the fact that unauthorized persons had access to Uber's storage - and therefore to the
stored personal data of Uber customers – makes the scope of the data breach involved
personal data98, the type of personal data (names, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers) as well
the fact that it concerns personal data of customers of one specific - globally operating -
company that there is even more (probable) adverse consequences. Through this combination of
factors, the dataset becomes extra attractive, for example to be resold99 for the benefit of
activities such as (spear) phishing100, unwanted advertising (spam) and/or unwanted telephone canvassing.
 
When in mid-November 2016 Uber became aware of the data breach and the personal data that
involved, there was sufficient reason to report to those involved because of
foreseeable adverse consequences, such as the risk of (spear) phising, for example. At that point it was
a real risk and could not reasonably be excluded.
 
Based on the foregoing, the AP concludes that Uber in this case, pursuant to Article 34a, second paragraph,
Wbp, was obliged to report the data breach to the data subjects concerned. In this regard, the

3.4.3 Data breach not reported (immediately).
The AP establishes that the data leak was not reported to the parties involved and therefore there was also no
an immediate notification, as required by Article 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp. What in a specific case
to be regarded as prompt depends on the circumstances of the case. In the several times
the aforementioned policy rules on data leaks, the AP indicates that reporting immediately means that after the
discovering the data breach, some time may be taken for further investigation so that those affected
can be informed in a proper and careful manner by the responsible party. From the
policy rules also shows that, just as with the notification to the AP, it is possible to opt for the
to inform those involved in the first instance on the basis of the information available at that time
so that those concerned can take measures in advance. One measure can already mean that

this background, and with reference to what has been noted about this in this decision with regard to the violation
of the obligation to report to the AP, it is noted that Uber was informed of the data breach on November 14, 2016

inform the parties involved of what the AP has considered with regard to the obligation to report to the AP
should and could have made of the data breach. That didn't happen.
 
3.4.4 How should the data breach be reported to data subjects?
Pursuant to Article 34a, paragraph 5, of the Wbp, the notification to the data subject is made in such a way
manner done that, taking into account the nature of the infringement, the detected and the actual
consequences for the processing of personal data, the circle of data subjects and the costs of
implementation, a proper and careful provision of information is guaranteed.
 
Reporting a data breach to those involved should - as follows from the policy rules on data breaches and the
legal history102 - to be done on an individual basis, such as in a personal e-mail. By far the most
In some cases, the controller will have and will be able to provide contact details of the data subjects
data subjects are also informed individually. In the case of more extensive incidents, a
combination of general and individual information provision are appropriate, such as a notice on the
company website and an individual email to affected customers. The main thing is that so much
potentially involved parties are reached and informed about the measures to be taken by him or her
measures to limit the consequences for privacy as much as possible. With just one
as reported in the media, that goal has not been achieved.103 In the opinion of the AP, in view of the for
Uber available contact details make it possible to approach affected Uber customers individually and
reporting in a press release alone was not sufficient.
 
3.4.5
In its view, Uber states that the data breach did not have to be reported to those involved because there was
various technical and organizational security measures have been taken. Regarding that
the AP notes that the security measures taken by Uber were aimed at preventing the data leak
close and prevent recurrence. However, this does not mean that it should be concluded that
during the period of the infringement there was no situation that made the infringement likely
will have adverse consequences. As explained above, the AP is of the opinion that there is a
infringement likely to have adverse consequences. Also justify the hit by Uber
measures do not invoke Article 34a, paragraph 6, of the Wbp on the basis of which a notification to
person concerned can be omitted. Lots of personal data - including names, email addresses and
telephone numbers - were after all unprotected (unencrypted) and accessible to
and in the possession of unauthorized persons. The measures to which Uber refers were, as said, afterwards
taken to close the leak and prevent recurrence.
 
Uber also indicates that it was unlikely that the data breach would have adverse consequences
because it is not about sensitive data.

In the event that personal data of a sensitive nature has been leaked, it must be assumed that the
data breach must be reported not only to the AP, but also to those involved.104 It is with others
words a very important indication that a report must be made to data subjects. Based upon
of the policy rules shows that in all other cases the controller is responsible on the basis of the
circumstances of the case will have to be weighed up. The circumstance that a data breach is not
concerns sensitive data, this does not mean that a notification to data subjects can therefore be omitted
to stay. In this case, there were sufficient reasons for which Uber was held accountable for the data breach
inform those involved.
 
Uber further argues in its view that there is no evidence that more than two individuals during one
had access to the relevant personal data for a short period of time, which made Uber login data unusable
created and implemented two-factor authentication. According to Uber, everything indicates that the
unauthorized persons have deleted the downloaded files without sharing them with others. Uber has
confidentiality agreements signed with the unauthorized persons and knows their identity. That determined
personal data were available for a short period of time to two individuals, according to Uber, it does not matter
likely that the conscious personal data (names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers) for spam
whether phising are used, quite apart from whether this can be seen as a breach of the
personal living ambiance.
 
The AP does not follow Uber in its argument. That there are indications that the unauthorized persons have the files
removed, they have signed a confidentiality agreement and have disclosed their identity, and
according to Uber, it is unlikely that the personal data in question is for spam or phising
used, does not alter the fact that the personal data were accessible to unauthorized persons and that this, such as
previously considered, given the scope and type of personal data and the fact that it concerned customers
of one company represented a significant risk of further dissemination. By the way, this also applies
It cannot be ruled out at the moment that the data in question is not yet available somewhere - outside of Uber
are. The data breach lasted for five weeks. During that period, the unauthorized
access to the relevant personal data without Uber having any influence. That has, like
set out above, entails risks. That was the opinion of the AP
sufficient reason to conclude that the data breach had been reported pursuant to Article 34a, second paragraph, Wbp
should be made available to those involved.
 
Finally, in its view, Uber states that it derives from the passage of time and the lack of any indication of
the AP regarding notification to data subjects - the AP has since the notification of the data breach to the AP
November 2017 Uber not obliged to report the data breach to the person concerned - was allowed to open
that the AP also believes that it is unlikely that the data breach could have adverse consequences for the
data subjects.
 
The AP does not follow Uber in its argument. To this end, the AP notes first of all that it is up to UTI and UBV as
is responsible for assessing whether a data breach should be reported to those involved and not to the data breach

Seriously culpable negligence

 
AP.105 That assessment must be made at the time the data breach was known to Uber. That
was already on November 14, 2016. As explained above, there was sufficient reason to do so
data subjects to report the data breach. In hindsight, this has not yet been proven
unfavorable consequences as a result of, for example, phishing activities, in the opinion of the AP
not different. The assessment of whether the data breach has or will have serious consequences for the protection of
personal data must be created at the time of the data breach.
 
3.4.6 Conclusion
From the above, the AP concludes that UBV and UTI, as jointly responsible parties involved
wrongly and contrary to Article 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp
of the data breach. Therefore, there is a violation of 34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp, whereby UBV and
UTI are both offenders.
 
3.5
 
3.5.1
For this, the AP has concluded that UBV and UTI are jointly responsible in the sense of
Article 1, preamble, and under d, of the Wbp, as a result of which UBV and UTI are both standard addressees of the
obligation pursuant to Article 34a, first and second paragraph, of the Wbp. Failure to timely
reporting the data breach to the AP and timely notification of those involved is, in the opinion of
the AP the result of seriously culpable negligence. The AP explains its position below. To that she will

becomes to have. Subsequently, the AP will review the Uber group's knowledge of the seriousness of the data breach
judge. Subsequently, the AP will indicate facts and circumstances that, in the opinion of the AP, make that
the failure to report the data breach to the AP in a timely manner and to notify it in a timely manner
involved is the result of seriously culpable negligence.
 
3.5.2 Legal framework
At the time of the violation, Article 66, third and fourth paragraph, of the Wbp read, insofar as relevant, as
follows:
 

Introduction

“(…)
3. The Board will not impose an administrative fine for violation of the provisions of or pursuant to the Article 66,

second paragraph, said Articles, then after it has issued a binding instruction. The College can
set a time limit within which the instruction must be complied with.
 The third paragraph does not apply if the violation was committed intentionally or is the result of serious
culpable negligence.

4.

(…)”

 
According to the parliamentary history of 'seriously culpable negligence' as referred to in Article 66,
paragraph 4 of the Wbp if “the violation is the result of seriously culpable negligence, that is to say

is the result of gross, significantly negligent, negligent or injudicious acts.”106 In this context
it is noted that “acting” as referred to above also includes an omission.107
 
Both in the parliamentary history and in the Policy Rules on the obligation to report data breaches from 2015
examples of data leaks that must be reported to the AP. By way of illustration, below
more mentioned:
-
- on the website of a telephone company, customers can log in and enter their financial data and

a company suffers a hack in which customer data and passwords have been stolen;

view call details. A third party has gained access to the database with login names and
associated scrambled (blacked out) passwords. However, it is possible that certain
passwords can be retrieved. 108

 
The Policy Rules on the obligation to report data breaches also address the question of when a data breach is required
are reported to the AP. According to Article 34a, first paragraph, of the Wbp, this must be done “immediately”.
The AP has specified the term “immediately” in the Policy Rules on the Data Leak Reporting Obligation.
For the sake of completeness, the AP quotes the relevant passage in full.
 
 

 
“6. When do I have to report the data breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority?
You must immediately report the data breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (article 34a, first paragraph, Wbp).

 

 

Reporting without delay means that you are allowed to take some time after discovering a possible data breach
further investigation in order to avoid an unnecessary report.

What qualifies as 'promptly' in a specific case will depend on the circumstances of
the case. Below you will find the principles that the Dutch Data Protection Authority has in mind
uses supervisory and enforcement powers.
 
The period for reporting the data breach starts when you or a processor you have
becomes aware of an incident that may fall under the data breach notification obligation.
 
Without undue delay, and if possible no later than 72 hours after discovery, report to the
Dutch Data Protection Authority, unless your investigation has already shown that the incident has occurred at that time
does not fall under the obligation to report data breaches. If you report the incident later than 72 hours after discovery to the
supervisor, you can, if asked, motivate why you made the report later.
 
You may not have full insight into what happened and for what reason 72 hours after the discovery of the incident
personal data it concerns. In that case, you make the report based on the information you have at that time
features. If necessary, you can supplement or withdraw the notification afterwards.

To be able to report data leaks in a timely manner, you will have to make good agreements with the processors you may use
so that they inform you in a timely and adequate manner about all relevant incidents.”

 
The AP takes a position with regard to the knowledge that a standard addressee (UBV and UTI jointly) has of the
applicable laws and regulations is deemed to have the position that is based on te
market parties bear their own responsibility to comply with the law.109
The AP has also provided ample information to market parties about the applicable laws and regulations, so that
it can be assumed that Uber was also aware of this. In addition, there is extensive attention in the media
spent on the obligation to report data breaches.
From the legal framework set out above in conjunction with the explanatory notes and the Policy Rules
obligation to report data breaches, which Uber could have become aware of before the data breach, follows to the
the AP's opinion is sufficiently clear that Uber attributed the data breach to both the data subjects and the AP
must report and that this without delay, but in any case no later than 72 hours after the discovery on 14
should have taken place in November 2016. Moreover, the report to the AP could have been conditional
be made, in the sense that the notification could be supplemented afterwards. That possibility
is expressly provided in the policy rule.
If doubt had arisen about the scope of the commandment, then, also according to settled case law, te
apply that may be expected of a professional and multinational market party such as Uber
that it informs itself properly or is informed about the restrictions on its conduct
subject, so that she could have tailored her behavior to the scope of that from the outset
commandment.110
 
3.5.3 Science of the Uber group about (the seriousness of) the data breach
In the opinion of the AP, UTI's management was aware of the seriousness of the data breach. like that
is firstly apparent from the speed with which UTI has agreed to pay an amount to the
reporters of the data breach. Furthermore, the amount paid to the notifiers is substantially higher than usual.
In addition, this is apparent from the additional agreements that are concluded with
the notifiers are closed with the intention of keeping the data breach secret. The AP explains this as follows.
 
3.5.3.1 Payment approval speed
On Monday, November 14, 2016, UTI was made aware of a vulnerability in her
data security. After all, on that date the then [CONFIDENTIAL]from UTI received an e-mail
mail message from a person who informed the [CONFIDENTIAL] that he found a major vulnerability in the
data security of the Uber group.111 On the same day, the reporter informed UTI
made it known that he and his team received “high compensation” for signaling the data breach to UTI
to expect.

On Tuesday, November 15, 2016, the reporter will report to [CONFIDENTIAL], who will terminate contact with the reporter
maintained, knowing: “I am happy that you guys finally found the issue, it was the aws keys that have been leaked, ALL
INTERNAL data was able to be downloaded and seen, your security steps are very poorly done, the lack of negligence and
care here is zero to none. Your employees are careless and don't care about security. Me and my team found that your team
lacks 2 step authenticator on github.”
 
The [CONFIDENTIAL] asked on November 15, 2016 about the seriousness of the data breach: "I'm trying to get
some idea on payout amount - can you provide a full list of things you were able to access? That will help me understand
impact and then I can pitch an award amount to management.”
In response, the reporter says: “Let me tell you this looks bad. I suggest you speak with employees on re-
using passwords. My team was able to access a lot of internal information. [CONFIDENTIAL]."
 
Already on Friday 18 and Monday 21 November 2016, agreements were signed by the
[CONFIDENTIAL] of UTI and two individuals. These agreements regulate the payment of – in total
– $100,000 for reporting the data breach to UTI.112
 
UTI's [CONFIDENTIAL] filed a copy of the agreement with UTI on Tuesday, November 22, 2016
forwarded to the notifiers.113 The UTI employee confirmed this to the notifiers when asked
that the payment of the bug bounty could be made in bitcoin.114
 
On Friday, December 9, 2016, an amount of 65,508 BTC was sent to the bitcoin address of the reporter,
who confirmed on the same day that he had received the bitcoins.115 On Thursday, December 15, 2016,
once sent an amount of 64.02 BTC to the same address.
 
E-mail exchanges also show that on December 23, 2016, UTI's [CONFIDENTIAL]
was informed of the progress of measures taken in response to the data breach.116
 
3.5.3.2 Above-average remuneration
UTI paid the reporters a $100,000 reward for reporting the data breach. This amount is
paid through Hacker One's bug bounty program. This is a substantially higher amount than usual
for reporting a vulnerability is paid by the Uber group. Unlike Uber sets
in its view, this is equally a strong indication in the AP's opinion that UTI was aware
of the seriousness of the data breach. A different explanation for paying a significantly higher
amount than usual, Uber has not given. Despite the payment being made through HackerOne,
Uber has communicated that the payment was not made as part of the normal Bug Bounty

program of Uber.117 In the opinion of the AP, Uber deliberately made this report differently
than other vulnerability reports.
 
The HackerOne page of the Uber group states that the highest bug bounty is in a bandwidth
up to a maximum of $20,000. At the time of the data breach, a typical maximum of $10,000,118 was in effect
reporters have indicated that they want a “6 digits” bug bounty for sharing what they find
leak.119 While the $100,000 bug bounty paid through HackerOne in $10,000 instalments,
exceeds the limit of the indicated bandwidth, Uber declares that the amount to be paid
bug bounties is subject to the discretion of the Uber Group.
On February 6, 2018, at a subcommittee hearing, the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UTI
of the United States Senate. stated that the payment had the character of 'ransom' for it
remove the leaked data: “Our primary goal in paying the intruders was to protect our consumers’ data.”
He also states: “We recognize that the bug bounty program is not an appropriate vehicle for dealing with intruders
who seek to extort funds from the company. The approach that these intruders took was separate and distinct from those of
the researchers in the security community for whom bug bounty programs are designed. While using the bug bounty
program assisted in the effort to gain attribution and, ultimately, assurances that our users' data were secure, at the end of
the day, these intruders were fundamentally different from legitimate bug bounty recipients.”120
 
From the speed with which the $100,000 payment was agreed to, that a
substantially higher amount than usual, and the later statement of the [CONFIDENTIAL], appears
in the opinion of the AP that the management of UTI was aware of the seriousness of the data breach
at the time of that decision-making, and therefore felt compelled to provide the reporters with what they requested
amount to prevent further damage to Uber users.
 
3.5.3.3 Confidentiality
That UTI's management was aware of the seriousness of the data breach at the time of decision making
in connection with the handling of the reported data breach, in the opinion of the AP, it is also clear from the
additional agreements concluded with the reporters with the intention of keeping the data breach secret
at least with the intention of preventing public disclosure.
 
Confidentiality obligations and obligations to delete research data and no further
are not uncommon when reporting vulnerabilities to organizations and companies,
also known as 'responsible disclosure'. However, not all bug bounty programs require complete ones
secrecy of the investigation, some organizations make the findings of the researchers
public.
 
At the time of the data breach, it was Uber's policy in its HackerOne bug bounty program
that researchers were allowed to publish about the vulnerabilities they discovered after the vulnerability

was solved by the Uber group. Fixed some of the bugs by the Uber group via HackerOne
vulnerabilities have been published by the Uber group itself. The Uber group has via a blog post
information about the first hundred days of its bug bounty program. In that blog post
also highlighted a number of vulnerabilities that have been resolved through the bug bounty program.121
 
In the present case, however, UTI has concluded additional agreements with the notifiers, which it
forbade the reporters to go public in any way whatsoever with what they discovered
data breach. This additional agreement supplemented the Uber group's policy for HackerOne, and
exhaustively arranged the agreement between the reporters and UTI where there were conflicts between the standard
policy of the Uber group and the agreement in question existed. A provision about
confidentiality is included in the agreement governing the payment of the bug bounty. In
this agreement stipulates that “[researchers] have not and will not disclose anything about the vulnerabilities or
your dialogue with us to anyone for any purpose without [UTIs.] written permission. This includes any analysis or post-
mortem in any medium or forum.”
The agreement further states: “[Researchers] and [UTI[ promise that if [researchers] break [researchers’] promises
to [UTI]. [researchers] will repay to [UTI] the bounty reward.]”122
 
Further internal communication from UTI staff shows that the secrecy of the data breach by the
reporters is deemed essential by UTI. In commentary on a paper on the handling of the
data breach is written as follows: “ensuring that the research isn't written about, presented on, etc.”123
 
Based on the above, the AP determines that UTI's management was aware of the severity
of the data breach and it was important to her to keep the data breach a secret, at least to
prevent publicity.
 
3.5.4 Seriously culpable negligence
As jointly responsible, both UTI and UBV were liable for the entirety of the
data processing and related obligations. This rested on both UBV and UTI
pursuant to Article 34a, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Wbp, the obligation to report the data breach without delay
to both the AP and those involved.
 
UBV and UTI, as jointly responsible, acted seriously culpably negligently by the
not immediately report a data breach to the AP and those involved. That UBV and UTI have failed it
to report a data breach to the AP in a timely manner and to inform those involved of the data breach in a timely manner is the result of
grossly, significantly carelessly, negligently or injudiciously. The AP points out in this regard
considered in relation to the following facts and/or circumstances.
 
First, as described above, UTI's management was already on November 14, 2016
level of the data breach. On that date, UTI's then [CONFIDENTIAL] received an e-

                                                                        
121 URL: https://eng.uber.com/bug-bounty-update/ (last accessed October 10, 2018).

mail message from a person who informed the [CONFIDENTIAL] that he found a major vulnerability in the
data security of the Uber group.
 
Second, as described above, UTI's management acted almost immediately, at least shortly after
the initial report aware of the circumstances from which it reasonably follows that there is
a security breach leading to a significant risk of serious adverse consequences, or
has serious adverse consequences for the protection of personal data.
 
Thirdly, as described above, that of a large multinational company applies
like the Uber group, it may be expected that it adheres to the legal requirements applicable to it
obligations in the countries in which it operates. The AP assumes that UTI is aware of it
was that the obligation to report data breaches, as regulated in Article 34a Wbp, applied to it at the time of the
data breach. Least of all, UTI should have known about the obligation.
 
With reference to the violation part of this decision, the AP is of the opinion that UTI is already on 14
November 2016, at least no later than 72 hours after the discovery on November 14, 2016, the data breach to the AP
should have reported.
 
Despite the knowledge of the data breach, the seriousness of the data breach and the clarity of the applicable
legislation in mid-November 2016, the Uber group was apparently all about the data breach
to keep secret, at least to prevent public access and the data leak is only more than a year after
discovery of the data breach at UTI on November 21, 2017 reported by UBV to the AP. In light of it
the AP cannot conclude otherwise than that there is serious culpable negligence
on the part of UBV and UTI as jointly responsible.
 
Even if Uber were to be followed in its argument that only UBV should be responsible
are regarded and UTI as a processor, then according to the Policy Rules there is still a data breach notification obligation
It always applies that the data breach occurred on November 14, 2016, or at least no later than 72 hours after its discovery on November 14, 2016.
November 2016, should have been reported to the AP. In the Policy Rules reporting obligation data breaches is in this
included that: “The period for reporting the data breach starts the moment you, or a
processor you have engaged becomes aware of an incident that may fall under the data breach notification obligation.”
 
The opinion of UBV, that on 4 November 2017 a first meeting took place between UTI and
UBV and that on 10 November 2017 UBV first became aware of the fact that it was
downloaded files (also) concerned personal data of Dutch users, does not matter either
the above judgment of the AP.
Under the processor agreement concluded between UTI and UBV on March 31, 2016, UTI was obliged
“[to] promptly notify Uber B.V. about: (ii) any accidental or unauthorized access.”124 Considering the joint
responsibility, the group relationship and Policy rules on the obligation to report data leaks, UBV can adhere to
not excuse the AP's judgment with the fact that UTI failed to inform UBV.

Incidentally, the AP notes that the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UBV was informed on October 25, 2017
of what Uber calls in its view an “IT security incident in 2016, that it was being investigated, and that it
could potentially create a media cycle.”125 In the opinion of the AP, UBV cannot have a justified appeal
act on ignorance, which consists in the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UBV not having “knowledge of the scope of
the incident, or if personal data was involved” had126. With the information that was known on October 25, 2017
at the [CONFIDENTIAL] of UBV – an IT security incident that could potentially attract media attention
cause - in the opinion of the AP it was reasonably on its path to continue critically
questions in order to find out whether there was a data breach, or whether personal data were involved
involved and what the relevance of the IT security incident was for UBV. By failing to do so, UBV
equally seriously culpably negligent.
Even if the AP were to agree with UBV's view, namely that on November 10, 2017 it
first took note of the downloaded files with personal data of Dutch
users and should therefore have reported it to the AP no later than 72 hours after that knowledge, the
The AP has established that UBV reported the data breach far too late with its report on November 21, 2017.
The AP also finds that UTI and UBV wrongfully failed to notify those involved without delay

The AP sees no reason for the other circumstances put forward by Uber in the opinion

data breach should have been reported to the AP and those involved should have been informed of the data breach

3.5.5 Conclusion
In the opinion of the AP, all of the above shows that UTI and UBV grossly, significantly negligently,
have acted negligently or injudiciously, as a result of which there is serious culpability

The AP has established 'Fining Policy Rules for the Authority for Personal Data 2016' (Fining Policy Rules)
regarding the interpretation of the power to impose an administrative fine, including determining
of the level thereof.127 In the Fining Policy Rules, a categorization and bandwidth has been chosen
system.
 
The fineable provisions, the compliance of which is supervised by the AP, are per statutory maximum fine
of € 820,000, € 450,000 or € 20,500 divided into a number of fine categories, and linked to them in
increasing fine bandwidths.
 
The fine categories are arranged according to the seriousness of the violation of the aforementioned articles,
where category I contains the least serious offenses and category II or III the most serious offences.
Violation of Article 34a, first paragraph, Wbp and violation of Article 34a, second paragraph, Wbp are both
classified in category II.
 
Within the bandwidth, the AP sets a basic fine. The starting point is that the AP sets the basic fine
set at 33% of the bandwidth of the fine category linked to the violation.128
 
The AP then adjusts the amount of the fine to the factors referred to in Article 6 of the
Penalty policies, by lowering or increasing the base amount. In principle, within the
bandwidth of the fine category linked to that violation. It's an assessment
of the seriousness of the offense in the specific case, the extent to which the offense is imposed on the offender
can be blamed and, if there is reason to do so, other circumstances, such as the (financial)
circumstances in which the offender finds himself. The AP can do so, if necessary and depending on the degree
in which the factors referred to in Article 6 of the Fining Policy Rules give rise to this, the
Apply penalty bandwidth of the next higher or the next lower category respectively.
 
4.3
It follows from Appendix 1 to Article 2 of the Fining Policy Rules that the violation of Article 34a,
first paragraph of the Wbp and the violation of article 34a, second paragraph, Wbp are classified in category II. The
AP sets the basic fine for violations subject to a statutory maximum fine of € 820,000 and
which is classified in category II fixed within a fine range between € 120,000 and € 500,000. In this
case, the basic fine per violation is set at € 246,500.
 
Severity of the violation
According to Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Policy Rules, the AP takes into account the seriousness of the violation. Bee

society.129
 
Pursuant to Article 34a, first paragraph, Wbp, as that provision applied at the time of the violation, the
responsible to immediately inform the AP of a security breach, referred to in
Article 13 Wbp, which leads to the considerable chance of serious adverse consequences or serious adverse consequences
has consequences for the protection of personal data.
Pursuant to Article 34a, second paragraph, Wbp, as that provision applied at the time of the violation, the
responsible to immediately inform the data subjects of a security breach, if
the breach is likely to have adverse consequences for his privacy.
The purpose of the reporting obligation is to prevent data leaks and, if they do occur, the consequences
as much as possible for those involved. The duty to report contributes to the
maintaining and restoring trust in the handling of personal data.130
Transparency about the nature of the data breach, its probable size and nature of the possible
damage, the efforts made to repair the damage and advice to the public and
customers to enable themselves as best as possible to bear the consequences for their own interests
oversee the necessary measures to maintain and restore that confidence. That confidence
is supported by the fact that the AP must be enabled to form its own picture of the
facts, to be able to give an opinion on the measures taken, under certain circumstances confidentially with
to be able to consult the person responsible and to intervene if necessary.131
For the sake of completeness, it is noted in this respect that, having regard to recitals 85 to 88 of
the preamble to the GDPR, with the notification obligation based on Articles 33 and 34 GDPR having a similar purpose
is pursued.
 
In the period from November 15, 2016 to at least November 21, 2017, UBV and UTI failed to
to immediately inform those involved of the data breach. It was not until November 21, 2017 that UTI released the
informed by means of a news report. As a result, those involved are unable to do so (in time).
to oversee the consequences for one's own interests, for example by being alert to the risk of
(spear)fishing. In addition, those involved do not have, or at least did not have timely,
can take precautions to mitigate potentially adverse consequences of the data breach. This
considers the AP serious.
 
When assessing the seriousness of not immediately reporting the data breach, the AP also has the
size of the data breach taken into account. The data breach affects a large number of people, 57 million
stakeholders worldwide and 174,000 Dutch stakeholders. Only the size of the data breach had UTI
and UBV must give cause to inform the AP and those involved. The data breach also concerns
a large amount of personal data including names, email addresses and mobile
phone numbers. These circumstances mean that the data breach has serious adverse consequences for the

protection of personal data, or at least could have. In the opinion of the AP, it is through
the violation has seriously damaged confidence in the handling of personal data.
 
In addition, UBV and UTI will, in any case, have until 72 hours after discovery of the data breach on November 14, 2016.
November 21, 2017, failed to notify the AP of the security breach. Thus it is
the AP was not aware of the (extensive) data breach for a longer period of time. The AP
has therefore not (in time) been able to form its own picture of the facts and the possible actions by Uber
measures taken, both towards those involved and with regard to the necessary handling of the
(acute) security breach. This failure of UTI and UBV has severely hampered the AP in her
supervision, which indirectly also affects the interests of those involved.
 
On balance, the AP sees reason to adjust the basic amount of the fine, based on the degree of seriousness of the offense
violation, to be increased by one third per violation to €327,845.
 
Degree of culpability of the offender
According to Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Policy Rules, the AP takes into account the extent to which the
violation can be attributed to the offender.132 If the violation was committed intentionally or the
is the result of seriously culpable negligence as referred to in Article 66(4) of the Wbp
assumed that there is a considerable degree of culpability on the part of the offender.
 
As the AP has already explained above, the AP is of the opinion that there is serious culpability
negligence on the part of UTI and UBV. In short, it comes down to being within the top of
the Uber group was aware of the data breach, they were aware of its seriousness and there
there could be no misunderstanding that the AP and those involved were immediately aware of the data leak
must be stated. Nevertheless, the Uber group was committed to keeping the data leak a secret
hold, for which Uber has been prepared to pay a substantially higher amount of money than usual
pay to reporters and to agree additional confidentiality obligations with the reporters.
Only more than a year after the discovery of the data breach at UTI, the data breach was discovered by UBV on November 21, 2017.
reported to the AP and a news item was published on Uber's website by the current CEO of
UTI informing the public about the data breach. In view of the foregoing, the AP is of the opinion that
there is a considerable degree of culpability.
 
The AP therefore sees reason to set the basic amount of the fine, based on the degree of culpability
per violation by one third.
 
With the previous steps, the fine amount comes to € 409,190 per violation, so that the total
fine would amount to € 818,380.
 
proportionality
Finally, the AP assesses on the basis of Article 5:46 of the General Administrative Law Act
codified proportionality principle or the application of its policy for determining the amount

of the fine, given the circumstances of the specific case, does not lead to a disproportionate outcome.
Application of the proportionality principle is possible according to the Fining Policy Rules of the AP, among other things
play in the accumulation of sanctions. If the AP for distinguishable, but related
wants to impose two or more fines for violations, the total of the fines must still match the
seriousness of the violations.133
 
In this case, the AP proceeds to impose a fine for violation of both Article 34a, first paragraph and second paragraph
member of the Wbp. In the opinion of the AP, these are separate violations. After all, article 34a,
paragraph 1 of the Wbp requires that the AP be notified immediately of a data breach while Article
34a, second paragraph, of the Wbp requires that the data subjects are immediately notified of a
data breach. At the same time, the AP recognizes that the essence of the relevant provisions is
equivalent, namely transparency with a view to building trust in dealing with
retain and/or restore personal data. Furthermore, the AP is of the opinion that the conduct that
the underlying offenses are essentially based on the same set of facts. This gives
reason to moderate the above-mentioned fine amount on the basis of proportionality.
 
In assessing proportionality, the AP also takes into account the fact that, despite the
the passage of time and the absence of a binding indication, the data breach is ultimately public
and its settlement has received the necessary media attention so that those involved are aware of it
have been able to take.
 
The AP thus sets the total fine amount at € 600,000. This amount can Uber given its financial
carry position.
 
5.
 
The AP will jointly submit to the UBV and UTI, due to violation of Article 34a, first and second paragraph, Wbp,
an administrative fine in the amount of € 600,000, for the payment of which they are jointly and severally liable
are.
 
UBV and/or UTI must transfer the amount to a bank account within six weeks
[CONFIDENTIAL] on behalf of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, stating the case number
[CONFIDENTIAL]. UBV and UTI will not receive a separate invoice for this amount.
 
The fine must be paid within six weeks of the date of this decision.134 If UBV and/or UTI
object(s) to this decision, the obligation to pay the fine is suspended until the
objection has been resolved. That obligation is also suspended if UBV and/or UTI after the objection procedure
appeals, until a decision has been made on the appeal.135
