Dear Mr Wenselaar,
 
Below you will find the decision of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) to impose an order under
penalty to Coöperatie Menzis U.A. (Menzis). This decision is part of the new decision
of today to the objection of Civil Rights Association Vrijbit (Vrijbit). This new decision on objection is
taken after the investigation carried out by the AP in response to the interim ruling of the
Midden Nederland District Court (the District Court) of 7 July 2017, ECLI:NL:RBMNE:2017:3421 (the
interim statement). This case started with an enforcement request that Vrijbit submitted to the Board
protection of personal data (CBP).
 
Vrijbit's enforcement request relates to the way in which Dutch health insurers apply
currently process personal data relating to health. According to Vrijbit, this method is in
conflict with the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp), the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union (the Charter) and Article 8 of the Convention on Human and Human Rights
fundamental freedoms (ECHR). In summary, Vrijbit lays the basis for this that health insurers still
always work in accordance with the Code of Conduct for the Processing of Personal Data Health Insurers (the code of conduct),
while the AP has withheld its approval of that code of conduct as a result of a
judgment of the court of Amsterdam from 2013.1
 
The course of the procedure between Vrijbit and the AP, the legal framework, the ruling of the
District Court of Amsterdam, the interim ruling, the original decision on the objection of 1 June 2016, the
design of the investigation and the course of the investigation are set out in the new decision op
objection. The AP refers to this for the sake of brevity.
 

                                                                        
1 Court of Amsterdam 13 November 2013, ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2013:7480.

Findings
The AP's findings are appended to this decision to impose the order subject to periodic penalty payments
attached. First of all, the code of conduct and the privacy policy applied by Menzis are discussed
order (1). Subsequently, the aspects digital declaration without diagnosis information (2),
purpose limitation (3), unauthorized access to personal data (4), processors (5) and medical
professional secrecy (6).
  
Offence
In the findings, the AP comes to the conclusion that Menzis violates Article 13 of the Wbp. The AP has in
observed the following in that context:
- Menzis has organized its corporate culture in such a way that only employees have access
may have access to personal data concerning health insofar as this is necessary for
the purpose for which the employees process the personal data. For example, through
Menzis has laid down that marketing employees do not store any personal data concerning health
allowed to process.

- However, the investigation by the AP shows that marketing employees of Menzis do in fact have access

to personal data concerning health. Being able to consult
personal data can be regarded as the
processing of personal data.

- Menzis therefore does not have sufficient technical means to guarantee that

employees do not have access to personal data that is not necessary for the purpose
for which they are processed. In that context, the AP points out that Menzis, for example, does not have a
keeps log files about access to personal data, including special
personal data.

- The foregoing leads to the conclusion that Menzis does not have suitable technological equipment
measures as referred to in Article 13 of the Wbp. The AP has that from underlying documents
not showing how a marketing campaign is carried out at Menzis
found indications for the conclusion that marketing employees actually
process personal data concerning health for a marketing campaign. However, it does
does not alter the conclusion that Article 13 of the Wbp has been violated because of the technological measures
that Menzis has affected are not appropriate.

 
Duty of principle to enforce
From Article 65 of the Wbp, viewed in conjunction with Article 5:32, first paragraph, of the General Act
administrative law (Awb) follows that the AP is authorized to impose an order subject to periodic penalty payments in the event of a violation
of Article 13 of the Wbp.
Pursuant to Article 5:2, first paragraph, opening words and under b, of the Awb, the order subject to periodic penalty payments is aimed at
ending the established violation and preventing recurrence.
  
In view of the public interest served by enforcement, the AP will, in the event of a violation of
a statutory provision, as a rule, must make use of its enforcement powers.
Special circumstances in connection with which enforcement action must be waived
not occur in this case.

Order subject to periodic penalty payments and grace period
The AP orders Menzis to set up its system in such a way that unauthorized access to
personal data is prevented.

The authorization matrix and accompanying documents in which they are the logical

To ensure adequate technological control systems on the basis of which it guarantees

 
To this end, it must in any case:
1.
access security of its systems must be adjusted. This
documents should be amended or re-drafted in such a way that it clearly follows
what access rights employees have. The authorization matrix serves as a clear overview
of the authorizations and view roles associated with a function or role by means of
including an unambiguous use of terminology. Menzis must record for this
what function or role the processing of personal data concerning health is necessary
is and for what purpose and to review this document with revised business judgments if necessary
to fit. Furthermore, the authorizations of Menzis employees are permanently submitted in fact
to be brought into agreement.
2.
that employees only have access to special personal data, including
personal data concerning health, when such access is necessary for the
activities of an employee. In any case, this concerns logging of access and
changes, so that - whether or not as a result of incidents - it can be checked whether
employees have gained access while access to this data is not necessary
for their activities. This also means that the authorizations must be periodically
checked and immediately adjusted if an inspection shows that an employee is at
is wrongly authorized to access personal data, including
personal data concerning health.
3.
takes place at least once every six months – by the Data Protection Officer and
the Compliance officer(s) to the management showing whether any incidents have occurred and so on
yes, what measures have been taken:
a.
b.

Menzis must also provide periodic written feedback – which is at least

with regard to what is stated under 1;
with regard to what is stated under 2.

-benefit period and penalty amount with regard to parts 2 and 3b
In view of what Menzis has put forward about its wish to set up its system in such a way that
technically and largely automated it is ensured that employees do not have access to more
personal data than is necessary for their work, the AP connects to part 2 and
part 3b of this charge has a grace period ending December 31, 2018.
 
If Menzis does not meet the obligation before the end of the beneficiary period referred to under 6,
she forfeits a penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at an amount of
€ 150,000.00 for each (whole) week, after the last day of the set term, on which
Menzis fails to comply with part 2 and part 3b of the order, up to a maximum of € 750,000.00.
Considering the fact that the penalty should be an incentive to comply with the order, the amount of the turnover

of Menzis, the large number of insured persons and the seriousness of the violation, the AP is aware of this
coercion appropriate.
  
-benefit period and amount of penalty with regard to parts 1 and 3a
With regard to part 1. of this burden, the AP is of the opinion that with its implementation less
efforts are involved. The AP therefore connects to part 1 and part 3a of the load one
beneficiary period ending May 26, 2018.
  
If Menzis does not meet the obligation before the end of the beneficiary period stated under 0,
she forfeits a penalty. The AP sets the amount of this penalty at an amount of € 50,000.00
for each (whole) week, after the last day of the set term, on which Menzis fails to pay
part 1 and part 3a of the burden, up to a maximum of € 250,000.00.
Considering the fact that the penalty should be an incentive to comply with the order, the amount of the turnover
of Menzis, the large number of insured persons and the seriousness of the violation, the AP is aware of this
coercion appropriate.
 
-interim report
The AP advises Menzis to communicate once per quarter on the basis of a concrete schedule
to do to the AP about the progress of the measures it is taking to comply with the
imposed load.
 
-post-check
The AP requests Menzis to provide documentary evidence to the AP in good time before the end of the beneficiary period
evidencing that the payment has been made on time and in full. Timely submission of
documentary evidence does not alter the fact that the AP is authorized to conduct an investigation, including an investigation
on site, if appropriate.
 
Explanation of the burden
The AP notes the following by way of explanation.
 
In the document 'CBP Guidelines. Security of personal data' (Stcrt. 2013, 5174, hereinafter also: de
guidelines) the question of when security measures are 'appropriate' in the sense of
Article 13 of the Wbp. The guidelines make it clear that for that assessment first of all
the reliability requirements to be set must be taken into account. This must be based on the nature of
the data to be protected is determined what an appropriate level of protection is. The nature of the
personal data is important here. Also the amount of processed personal data per person and
the purpose for which the personal data are processed must be taken into account.
  
In this case it concerns the processing of data concerning health, being special
personal data. This means that the consequences of an unlawful processing of that data,
can be serious for those involved. As a result, for the processing of personal data
Menzis requires a high level of security.

After the reliability requirements have been established, the responsible party must make appropriate
take security measures that guarantee that the reliability requirements are met, so
is in the guidelines. Security standards provide guidance when actually meeting
appropriate measures to cover the risks. A very widely used security standard is the
Code for Information Security, NEN-ISO/IEC 27002+C1(2014)+C2 (2015). Here are specifics
security measures included. Security standards provide guidance during the actual encounter
of appropriate measures to cover the risks. What security standards for a particular
processing are relevant and which security measures based on these security standards
should be taken, however, must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
  
The Code for Information Security mentions the following relevant measures in this context:
9.4.1 Information Access Restrictions
Access to information and system functions of applications should be restricted in accordance with it
access security policy.
12.4.1 Record events
Event logs that record user activities, exceptions, and information security events
record, should be made, kept and regularly reviewed.
 

17 Irrespective of the structure of the access security policy, the nature of the

personal data that a health insurer such as Menzis processes and the extent of that processing, that is
at least log files are kept in such a way that at least a reactive check of
the log files is possible. In particular, the AP is concerned that actions in the form of
consultations or changes in the systems that employees are authorized to access
(special) personal data are not logged, as a result of which access to that is controlled
data – for example as a result of incidents – is currently not possible.
  

18 As noted above, the AP found during the investigation that marketing employees
of Menzis actually have access to personal data concerning health, while Menzis
it has been established that this is not the intention. In its response to the intention to enforce, Menzis has stated the
acknowledged the correctness of these findings and declared to be committed to the opinion of the AP that this
leads to a violation of Article 13 of the Wbp. Menzis has stated that it will receive the
to take necessary action to end the violation. She has a plan for this with the AP
of the measures it intends to take. This planning seems realistic to the AP.
The AP therefore has the aforementioned beneficiary periods for the various parts of
the order subject to periodic penalty payments is aligned with Menzis' planning.
