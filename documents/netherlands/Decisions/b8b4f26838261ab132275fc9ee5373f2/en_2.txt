Your letter from

Dear Mr Wildeboer,
 
You will hereby receive the decision of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) on the objection of 10
January 2019, supplemented with the grounds by letter dated 5 March 2019. The objection is directed against the decision
of the DPA dated December 3, 2018 (reference xxx), whereby the DPA accepted the request of your client, objector,
dated March 24, 2017 to take enforcement action. The decision of December 3
2018 is hereafter referred to as the primary decision.
 
In this decision on your notice of objection, your objections are partially upheld. Both foundation
Benchmark GGZ (hereinafter: SBG) as the Alliance for Quality in Mental Health Care (hereinafter: Akwa
GGZ) have processed personal data about health within the meaning of Article 4, parts 1 and 15, of
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). SBG has insufficient information that it received
anonymised, so that the risk of indirect traceability was insufficient
taken away. At the beginning of 2019, SBG transferred data to Akwa through an 'impoverished dataset'
mental health care. SBG and Akwa GGZ cannot rely on any of the statutory provisions for the processing
grounds for exception as included in Article 9, paragraph 2, of the AVG, which prohibit data
about health could lift. As a result, it is for SBG based on
Article 9, paragraph 1, GDPR was prohibited to use the dataset containing personal data about health
and for Akwa GGZ to take over an impoverished dataset from SBG. The AP will only have one
impose an enforcement measure on Akwa GGZ in the form of a reprimand, because SBG as
legal entity no longer exists.

1 Introduction

1. On March 24, 2017, your client, the objector, requested the AP to take enforcement action

towards SBG. The objector requested the AP on the basis of the Protection Act at the time
personal data (Wbp) and the Medical Treatment Contracts Act (WGBO)
to take enforcement action against the unlawful collection and processing of special
personal data by SBG, as this data is processed without the consent of the
patient. The objector requested the suspension of the processing of the data by SBG and
believes that the AP should supervise the immediate destruction of the data as stored in the
SBG database.
 

2. After the objector gave the AP notice of default on November 16, 2018, the AP on 3

December 2018, a primary decision was taken on the enforcement request. In the primary decision
the circumstance that SBG is transferred to Akwa GGZ is discussed. Considering the fact
that the investigation into SBG has not yet been completed, there was no possibility for the AP at that time
to take enforcement action against SBG. For that reason, the AP has accepted the enforcement request from
objector rejected.
 

3. An objection was lodged against the rejection of the enforcement request on 10 January 2019. During the

objection procedure, the investigation into the enforcement request has been completed. In the
Report as a result of an investigation into data processing by SBG (hereinafter: the investigation report),
definitively established on July 26, 2019, it has been concluded that SBG personal data about health
has processed within the meaning of article 4, part 1 and 15, of the AVG, or - before the AVG of
was applicable - within the meaning of Article 2, preamble and under a, of the Wbp. SBG has data that it
received insufficiently anonymised, which increases the risk of indirect traceability
insufficient amount was removed. SBG could not rely on any of the processing criteria
legal grounds for exception that would prohibit the processing of health data
can lift. As a result, for SBG, pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 1, GDPR
was prohibited from processing the dataset containing personal data about health. The
findings from the investigation report have prompted the AP to issue a
to issue an enforcement intention, addressed to both SBG and Akwa GGZ, including a
processing ban.
 

4. This decision on the objection concerns both the grounds of the objection against the decision of 3 December

2018 as on the views of SBG and Akwa GGZ on the intention to enforce and the
investigation report on which the intention to enforce is based.
 
2. Course of the procedure

5. On March 24, 2017, the objector submitted a request for enforcement to the AP.

 

6. In a letter dated 25 August 2017, SBG responded to the request from the

AP for information.

 
7. By letter dated 16 November 2018, the objector has given the AP notice of default due to the failure to

decide on the request.

8. By decision of December 3, 2018, the DPA has requested enforcement from the objector

rejected because the investigation into SBG had not yet been completed.
 

9. By letter dated 10 January 2019, the objector pro forma objected to the primary

decision of the AP. The grounds of the objection were supplemented by letter dated 5 March 2019.
 

10. In a letter dated 16 January 2019, SBG and Akwa GGZ responded separately in response to

of the AP's request for information.
 

11. On May 21, 2019, the AP adopted a provisional version of the investigation report.

 

12. By letter dated 28 May 2019, received by the AP on 3 June 2019, Akwa GGZ informed the AP

notified that the depleted dataset has been quarantined.
 

13. On May 29, 2019, an intention to enforce against both SBG and Akwa GGZ was issued to

following the research report.
 

14. On June 27, 2019 and on June 28, 2019, the AP received an opinion from SBG and from Akwa GGZ

with regard to the content of the research report.
 

15. On July 3, 2019, the AP held a hearing. The objectors and applicants were included

for enforcement, your colleague at the time mr. H.W. Dekker as a lawyer and xxx as an expert
present. On behalf of SBG and Akwa GGZ, mr. M.C.L. Rooke and mr. O.F.A.W. van Haperen as
lawyers and xxx as director of Akwa GGZ. A record of the hearing was made,
which you will find enclosed as Appendix 1.
 

16. The view as put forward by the lawyers of SBG and Akwa GGZ during the

hearing, the AP has given cause to adjust the investigation report. By letter dated 26 July
In 2019, your former office mate, Mr. Dekker, as the objector's lawyer, as well as the
lawyers of SBG and Akwa GGZ (a copy of) the amended final investigation report
received. The lawyer of the objector has also been given the opportunity to file a
to provide a substantive response to the investigation report and the case within a period of three weeks
related documents.
 

17. In a letter dated 8 August 2019, Akwa GGZ informed the AP that the depleted dataset

has been definitively destroyed.
 

18. In a letter dated 13 August 2019, Mr. Dekker, on behalf of your client, provided a substantive response to

the amended final investigation report and the documents relating to the case.
 

19. In a letter dated 29 August 2019, the lawyers of SBG and Akwa GGZ submitted a substantive response

given on the amended final investigation report and the documents relating to the case.
They also submitted a statement from Info Support B.V. that the depleted database, inclusive
backup files, has been permanently deleted.

Legal framework

20. The relevant legal framework is included as Annex 2 to this Decision. The request for enforcement is
submitted by the objector on March 24, 2017, before the GDPR came into force.
The primary decision pursuant to Article 7:11 of the Awb will be completely reconsidered
on the basis of the facts as they exist at the time of review (ex nunc
review). This means that in connection with the application of the GDPR as of May 25
2018, the assessment of the objection takes place on the basis of the GDPR.
 
4. Judgment of the AP

21. In the opinion of the AP, both SBG and Akwa GGZ have personal data about health

processed within the meaning of Article 4, part 1 and 15, of the GDPR. SBG has data that it received
insufficiently anonymised, so that the risk of indirect traceability is insufficient
was taken away. SBG and Akwa GGZ cannot rely on one of the following for the processing
legal grounds for exception that would prohibit the processing of health data
can lift. As a result, for SBG, pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 1, GDPR
was prohibited from processing the dataset containing personal data about health and for
Akwa GGZ to take over an impoverished dataset from SBG. The AP will only be an enforcer
impose a measure on Akwa GGZ in the form of a reprimand, because SBG as a legal entity cannot
more exists.
 
5. The investigation

22. Following your client's enforcement request, the DPA has launched an investigation into the

method of SBG with regard to the processing of personal data and is this processing
tested against relevant laws and regulations. SBG makes data from the healthcare sector measurable so that
in mental health care can be benchmarked with the aim of maintaining and increasing the quality of care
improve. Mental health care providers have patients complete questionnaires for this purpose, after which this Routine
Outcome Monitoring (ROM) data are supplied to the ZorgTTP foundation. The supplied data
consist of 29 mandatory data categories per patient. These 29 mandatory data categories
are pseudonymised on location at the mental health care provider by four of the 29 data categories
to hash.1 After ZorgTTP has applied encryption to these four categories of data, SBG receives
these processed data.2 At the beginning of 2019, SBG transferred an 'impoverished dataset' to Akwa GGZ. This
dataset consists of 19 data categories per patient instead of the original 25
data categories per patient provided to SBG.3
 

                                                                        
1 Hashing is a scrambling or mutation of data using a mathematical function known as a hash function.
called function. A hash function has the following properties:

-
-
-
-

The result always has the same size regardless of the input.
It is not possible to obtain the input based on the result. A hash function therefore only works in one direction.
The same input always leads to exactly the same result. The smallest change (1-bit) leads to a completely different outcome.
Hash functions are not necessarily secret and accessible and useable for everyone.

It is therefore possible to calculate the output for predictable or frequent inputs. This is a link
between the input and the corresponding output. This is called a link table. In a link table the result can be
searched and the corresponding input.

23. The investigation report, finalized on July 26, 2019, concluded that SBG

has processed personal data about health within the meaning of Article 4, parts 1 and 15, of the
AVG, or - before the AVG was applicable - within the meaning of Article 2, preamble and under a, of the
Wbp. SBG has insufficiently anonymised the data it received, which increases the risk of
indirect traceability was insufficiently removed. SBG could handle this one
processing does not rely on one of the legal grounds for exception as referred to in Article 9,
second paragraph, of the AVG that could prohibit the processing of health data
to cancel. As a result, it is prohibited for SBG under Article 9(1) of the GDPR
was to process the dataset containing personal data about health. Both SBG and
Akwa GGZ can be qualified as a controller within the meaning of Article 4, part 7,
of the GDPR. The findings from the investigation report have prompted the AP to decide on 29
to issue an enforcement intention in May 2019, addressed to both SBG and Akwa GGZ,
containing a processing prohibition pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, preamble and under f, of the
AVG.
 
The objector's position with regard to the investigation report and the intention to
enforcement

24. By means of an opinion during the hearing and by means of a written opinion

of August 13, 2019, the representative of the objector has stated the position with regard to the
investigation report and the intention to enforce. The objector argues that she
interested party and that the request for enforcement by the AP must therefore become admissible
declared. The objector endorses the AP's conclusions from the final
investigation report in response to its enforcement request. The enforcement action of the
AP should not only consist of imposing a processing ban on SBG and Akwa GGZ
pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, opening words and under f, of the GDPR, but in addition the AP
apply Article 58, second paragraph, opening lines and under g, of the GDPR, being the deletion of the
personal data.
 
SBG's position with regard to the investigation report and the intention to enforce

25. According to SBG, the investigation report was drawn up carelessly and the conclusions cannot be drawn

the AP draws are not supported by the contents of the investigative report. The AP makes
insufficient distinction between the four different data processing activities carried out by
SBG are performed. In these data processing activities there is no direct or
indirectly traceable data to a person. The AP fits the Breyer judgment in the investigation report
of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)4 incorrectly, because the traceability of the data to a
person is not or only possible for SBG with a disproportionate use of money, manpower or
resources. SBG cannot be qualified as an independent controller either
within the meaning of Article 4, part 7, of the GDPR, because SBG itself does not define the frameworks within which it operates
has established. SBG does qualify as a processor that processes the
data supplied is processed for benchmark reports.
 

26. In the hypothetical situation, according to SBG, that personal data is involved, SBG

subsequently set out in the opinion on the basis on which a healthcare provider should act as

controller and SBG as processor can invoke. For
data processing activity 1, namely the onward delivery by SBG of the legally required
performance indicators (“measuring instruments”) on behalf of the affiliated healthcare providers
Zorginstituut Nederland, the healthcare provider can invoke article 6, first paragraph, sub c AVG
(legal obligation) yo. Article 9, second paragraph, part i GDPR (reasons of public interest op
the field of public health). The data processing activity 2 consists of two levels.
The first level is the processing of ROM information by SBG to benchmark against intra-
institution level, at which the healthcare provider can invoke Article 6, first paragraph, under b (implementation
of agreement) and c AVG jo. Article 9, second paragraph, part h in conjunction with Article 30, third
paragraph, preamble and under a UAVG (processing when providing health care or social
services or treatments or managing healthcare systems and services). At the
second level, additional setting benchmarking with ROM information, the healthcare provider can do
based on article 6, first paragraph, sub c AVG and potentially sub b jo. Article 9(2)(h) in
coherence with article 30, third paragraph, opening lines and sub a UAVG. The third data processing activity
consists of offering the digital safe for scientific research. Thereby
can the healthcare provider invoke article 6, first paragraph, sub b AVG jo. article 9, paragraph 2,
part h GDPR. Data processing activity 4 constitutes Argus record keeping,
whereby the healthcare provider can, according to SBG, invoke Article 6, first paragraph, sub c AVG jo. article
9, second paragraph, part i GDPR (the processing is necessary for reasons of public interest on the
field of public health). SBG is of the opinion that the objector has been declared inadmissible
should have been included in its request for enforcement, because SBG does not process personal data.
 

27. With regard to the intention to enforce, SBG is of the opinion that this is based on a

incomplete and careless research report and that SBG does not process any personal data. These four
data processing activities take place in accordance with the (U)AVG, whereby SBG
is a processor. Not SBG, but a (a delegation of) patients from mental health care, healthcare providers and
health insurers jointly determine the type of data, the method of supply and the purpose and means
of the data processing activities. Only in respect of one data processing activity
SBG may be considered joint controller. This is about it
processing of ROM information by SBG at intra or extra institution level. For this
data processing activity, the processing prohibition must be imposed on the healthcare provider.
The AP should also refrain from enforcement action because it is disproportionate in relation to
the interests to be served by this, now that SBG no longer has the data and because SBG already
has been dissolved. There is a definitive processing ban for those that have already been discontinued
data processing activities that can no longer be resumed by SBG. It was better
if the AP had imposed a reprimand or an order subject to periodic penalty payments, pursuant to art. 58,
second paragraph, sub b, of the AVG.
 
Akwa GGZ's position with regard to the investigation report and the intention to enforce
28. Now that Akwa GGZ has meanwhile destroyed the impoverished dataset obtained from SBG and, insofar as it

Akwa GGZ is concerned, the study only relates to the impoverished persons taken over from SBG
dataset, according to Akwa GGZ there is no longer any relevance to discuss the content
research report. With regard to the intention to enforce, including a
processing ban, Akwa GGZ is of the opinion that this prohibition is insufficiently clear and specific.
The intended processing ban can only relate to the depleted dataset, but

Akwa GGZ has definitively destroyed the impoverished dataset including backup files. Because of this
enforcement action is so disproportionate in relation to the interests to be served by it, that of
action in this specific situation should be refrained from.

Judgment of the AP per component

29. In the following, the AP will discuss the various relevant parts with regard to

the objection procedure.
 
Health data

30. An important point of dispute in this objection procedure is the question whether the data that SBG (via ZorgTTP)

has received from healthcare providers is a processing of personal data about health
the meaning of article 4, part 1 and 15, of the GDPR. The applicant for enforcement on the one hand and SBG and
Akwa GGZ on the other hand agree that the data cannot lead to direct identification
of a person. The applicant for enforcement endorses the conclusions of the investigation report
of the AP, namely that the data processed by SBG and Akwa GGZ are insufficiently anonymised
as a result of which it concerns indirectly traceable personal data about health. SBG argues that
the data processing activities are not indirect to a natural person
traceable health data. According to SBG, the AP fits the judgment in the investigation report
Breyer of the CJEU incorrectly, because the traceability of the data to a person pre
SBG is not possible or only possible with a disproportionate use of money, manpower or resources.
 

31. Article 4(1) of the GDPR defines “personal data” as “any information about a

identified or identifiable natural person (“the data subject”); becomes identifiable
considered a natural person who can be directly or indirectly identified, in particular
by means of an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
identifier or one or more elements characteristic of the physical, physiological,
genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
Article 4(15) of the GDPR defines “health data” as “personal data that
related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including
data on health services provided that provide information about his state of health
will be given'.
 

32. In the Breyer judgment, the CJEU explicitly stated that for the question whether a piece of data is

'personal data' can be qualified, it is not required that all information on the basis of which
the data subject can be identified, belongs to one and the same person.5 A piece of data can
however, cannot be qualified as personal data if the identification of the data subject is
is prohibited by law or is impracticable in practice, for example because, given the time required,
costs and manpower- an excessive effort is required, so that the danger of identification in
reality seems insignificant.6
 

33. In the research report, all steps of the data delivery process of the

patient up to and including the processing of the relevant data by SBG and the related

involved parties. The research report shows that the healthcare providers are obliged to 29
provide categories of data, such as gender, year of birth, name of the healthcare provider and the
start and end date of the care process. The SBG dataset exists per record upon receipt
(related to one data subject / patient) from four hashed attributes and 25 pseudonymised
attributes.
 

34. The investigation report of the AP shows that SBG does not use any form of

randomization techniques, at the time SBG receives the dataset. This means that there are none
technique is applied so that the data is sufficiently random, i.e. random or
indefinite, making it no longer possible to trace them back to a specific person.7 Well
SBG applies generalization to certain data categories from the dataset, resulting in
avoid individualizing a data subject by merging the data subject with
a number of other persons. For example, the date of birth is not stored in the dataset, but it is
year of birth. However, there are 25 data categories, so individualization is still possible
based on data such as the location of the healthcare provider, gender, start and end date
of the treatment, etc.8
 

35. With regard to four data categories, namely the BSN, link number, DBC trajectory number and

Zorgtrajectnummer, SBG applies a pseudonymization method that is a combination of a
hash function and encryption. It is true that only ZorgTTP has a key, but this key remains
equal, so that the results of this pseudonymization process per unique BSN, link number,
DBC trajectory number and Care trajectory number are always the same. In other words, a unique BSN,
coupling number, DBC trajectory number and Care trajectory number, will be added after the pseudonymization process
ZorgTTP, always lead to the same pseudonymised values. This makes it possible for SBG
to add new data to the same pseudonymised BSN, link number, DBC trajectory number and
To be able to continue to link the care pathway number.9 Containing the data transferred to Akwa GGZ
19 attributes, including three pseudonymized attributes.
 

36. The AP establishes on the basis of the research report that SBG based on the pseudonymised dataset
has taken insufficient technical safeguards to adequately mitigate the risks of traceability
extent, so that it cannot be qualified as an anonymous dataset.10
Considering the detailed nature and amount of data provided by SBG or Akwa GGZ about one
patient is processed, (the risk of) indirect tracing at multiple parties and on the basis of
public sources cannot be prevented and it is therefore impossible to speak of an anonymous one
dataset.11 The mere fact that four categories of data becomes both the hash function and encryption
applied and that the secret key is known to a trusted third party, namely ZorgTTP,
who does not share it with SBG, Akwa GGZ or any other party, does not make it traceable
prohibited by law or impracticable in practice.

37. The AP has objected to what SBG or Akwa GGZ have put forward in the objection procedure.

no reason to reconsider the research report and the conclusions drawn therein
conclusions. SBG argues that the relevant question is whether a 'motivated intruder', given his
knowledge and available resources such as time, money and manpower, is reasonably able to
identify natural persons from the SBG dataset. Apart from the fact that the
'motivated intruder' test comes from the UK's protection regulator
personal data and as such has no legal force in the Netherlands, the AP deems it plausible
that a motivated intruder who has access to SBG's database can proceed to indirect
identification, based on data from various healthcare providers. Both the Minister of
Public Health, Welfare and Sport as the audit reports of external organizations believe that
the SBG dataset does not contain any personal data. That others believe that this is not the case
of the processing of personal data is irrelevant because it is ultimately up to the AP, the
independent supervisor in this area, which independently assesses whether there is
personal data. Finally, SBG refers to a letter from the Protection Board
Personal Data (CBP) from 2009. One of the conditions for adequate anonymization is that the
processed data must not be indirectly identifying. In the opinion of the AP, such as
set out in the investigation report and in this decision on the objection, is in the case of SBG and
Akwa GGZ is out of the question.
 

38. The AP thus concludes that the dataset of SBG and the depleted dataset of Akwa GGZ

are personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR. Now the dataset that SBG (via
ZorgTTP) and the impoverished dataset that Akwa GGZ manages also processes the name of the healthcare provider,
include the start and end date of a care pathway as well as the Primary diagnosis code, contains the
SBG dataset also includes health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) of the GDPR.
 
Controller

39. Subsequently, SBG argues in its opinion that it cannot be qualified as

controller within the meaning of Article 4, part 7, of the GDPR, but that SBG
must be regarded as a processor within the meaning of Article 4(8) of the GDPR. Not SBG,
but (a delegation of) patients from mental health care, care providers and health insurers together
determined the type of data, the method of supply and the purpose and means of the
data processing activities. The applicant for enforcement endorses the conclusions of the
research report of the AP, namely that SBG should be qualified as
controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the GDPR.
 

40. In Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the controller is qualified as the

legal entity that, alone or jointly with others, has the purposes and means of the processing
establishes personal data. Pursuant to Article 4, part 8, of the GDPR, the processor
qualified as the legal person acting on behalf of the controller
processes personal data.
 

41. It appears from the investigation report and the information submitted by SBG that SBG has various

conditions and protocols. For example, healthcare providers must provide their data to SBG
in accordance with the manner prescribed by SBG in a data protocol. Being in the data protocol
the nature and specifications of the raw data, the level to which the raw data relates, the manner and

the time of delivery and the minimum required data. In a drafted by SBG
The quality document specifies which quality requirements the healthcare provider must meet. There
For example, audits are carried out on the quality of information security, privacy and the
services. The management of SBG is also ultimately responsible for the information security
policies that apply to SBG's internal environment as well as to the exchange of
data with organizations and individuals.12
 

42. Although it appears from the above that healthcare providers are responsible for the correct delivery

of the data, the AP finds that SBG itself prescribes in the data protocol which type of data to which
must be provided by healthcare providers. The quality document also shows that
SBG carries out audits and that the management of SBG is ultimately responsible for the
information security policy. The AP thus establishes that SBG is responsible for the
provision, the management including the quality and security aspects and the correct analysis of the
information that SBG receives from healthcare providers and health insurers. That SBG in her
has built in internal governance checks and balances so that parties from the field, such as mental health
patients, care providers and health insurers can influence the policy pursued,
does not change this because SBG, as a legal entity, is ultimately responsible for the policy pursued
with regard to the dataset it manages and the purposes and means of the processing
of the personal data.
 

43. Akwa GGZ has taken over a so-called impoverished dataset from SBG, which contains 19 per person

contains attributes instead of the 25 attributes as processed by SBG per data subject. Already out of it
fact that Akwa GGZ informed the AP by letter of 28 May 2019 that the impoverished dataset in
quarantine has been placed and by letter dated August 8, 2019 that the impoverished dataset is final
destroyed, it appears that Akwa GGZ is ultimately responsible for the policy pursued with regard to
the impoverished dataset it manages and thus the purpose and means of processing
of the personal data.
 

44. Based on this, the AP qualifies both SBG and Akwa GGZ as a controller
within the meaning of Article 4, part 7, of the GDPR because SBG and Akwa GGZ as a legal person, alone or
determines, together with others, the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

 

Applicability of grounds for exception to the ban on processing special personal data

45. SBG and Akwa GGZ dispute that they process personal data about health and hereby

processing can be regarded as a controller within the meaning of Article 4(7)
of the GDPR. According to SBG and Akwa GGZ, the controller is the healthcare provider. In the
view, SBG has put forward that, in the event of the processing of
personal data about health, the healthcare provider can invoke article 9, second paragraph,
part h of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 30, third paragraph, opening words and under a, of the UAVG
with regard to the ROM information for benchmarking at the intra-institution level. Furthermore, the
healthcare provider for additional institution benchmarking with ROM information also rely on
Article 9, second paragraph, under h, of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 30, third paragraph, opening words and under
sub a of the UAVG.

46. The AP has determined in marginal number 38 that the dataset of SBG and the depleted dataset of Akwa

GGZ contains personal data about health within the meaning of Article 4, parts 1 and 15, of the
AVG. Pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, it is in principle prohibited to use special
categories of personal data, including health data. This prohibition is
not applicable if SBG or Akwa GGZ can rely on a statutory
ground for exception from Article 9, paragraph 2, of the GDPR jo. Articles 22 to 30 of the
UAVG. The option given in Article 9, second paragraph, part h of the GDPR is limited by
Article 9, third paragraph, of the GDPR.13
 

47. The Dutch legislature has given substance to the provisions of Article 9(2)(h) of the
AVG yo. Article 9, third paragraph, of the GDPR, possibility offered by means of Article 30, third paragraph,
of the UAVG. SBG invokes in particular article 30, third paragraph, under a of the UAVG.
This provision is aimed at care providers, health care institutions or facilities or
social services. The Explanatory Memorandum to the UAVG explains: 'This
means that health data may not only be processed by hospitals and
other medical institutions, but also by social institutions
services insofar as proper treatment of the data subject makes this necessary or
when it is necessary for the management of the institution or facility in question. At
think of nursing homes and agencies for youth care. Furthermore, this provision allows that
individual care providers who do not work at the aforementioned institutions, but for example a
practice independent practice, process health data.”14
 

48. According to the AP, it does not appear from the legislative text and parliamentary history that SBG has an appeal

pertains to Article 30, third paragraph, sub a of the UAVG. SBG and – insofar as relevant – Akwa GGZ are covered
namely not among the aforementioned standard addressees of Article 30, third paragraph, under a of the UAVG. SBG
or Akwa GGZ is or has been a foundation that wants mental health institutions to be independent and reliable
benchmarking in the field of treatment effect and customer satisfaction. With that they are none
healthcare or social services institutions. The processing by SBG and
Akwa GGZ is also not necessary for proper treatment of those involved or for management
of the relevant institution or facility. SBG or Akwa GGZ are therefore unable to act
relying on Article 9, second paragraph, part h of the GDPR jo. Article 30, third paragraph, sub a of the UAVG.
SBG and Akwa GGZ cannot invoke any of the other general terms either
grounds for exception within the meaning of Article 9, second paragraph, of the GDPR.

 
49. Based on the above, the AP concludes that both SBG and Akwa GGZ cannot appeal
on one of the general grounds for exception as included in Article 9, second paragraph, of the GDPR.
As a result, both SBG and Akwa GGZ have the general processing ban on special
categories of personal data, as included in Article 9, first paragraph, of the GDPR.
 
Processing basis

50. Now that SBG and Akwa GGZ cannot rely on one of the general exceptions such as

included in Article 9, second paragraph, of the GDPR on the prohibition of processing of special categories

of personal data pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 1, of the AVG, the AP is also not entitled to a
assessment of the basis for the processing of personal data as referred to in Article 6,
first paragraph of the GDPR.
 
Sanction

51. The letter of 12 July 2019 from the lawyers of SBG to the AP shows that on 1 April 2019 a

dissolution decision has been taken with regard to SBG. In the opinion of the AP, it is imposing
of a sanction to SBG superfluous, now that SBG has been dissolved and no longer has the
personal data. In the opinion of the AP, having an impoverished dataset,
taken over from SBG by Akwa GGZ, eligible for a reprimand under section 58,
second paragraph, preamble and under b, of the AVG. For a substantiation of this decision, the AP refers
refer to appendix 3, which contains the reprimand.
 
6. Grounds for the objection

52. In the following, the AP will discuss the grounds of objection, as submitted to the AP by letter

of 5 March 2019. The notice of objection consists of the following grounds:
1. The unreasonably long decision period is contrary to Article 4:14, third paragraph, of the General Act

administrative law (Awb). In this provision, the reasonable term is set at eight weeks. Doing
investigation does not suspend the decision period.

2. The careless decision-making by the AP is contrary to Article 3:2 of the Awb. The primary
decision in no way reflects what the AP's findings have been. The AP
should have shared the information from SBG with the objector as the applicant for enforcement.
3. The decision is inadequately substantiated and is therefore contrary to Article 3:46 of the Awb. From the

decision does not make it clear why the AP is refraining from any form of enforcement.

4. The AP has failed to apply the duty of principle with this request for enforcement

to enforcement.

 

7. Assessment of the objection
The unreasonably long decision period is contrary to Section 4:14(3) of the Awb

53. You argue that the unreasonably long decision period on your client's request for enforcement is contrary

is with article 4:14, third paragraph, of the Awb. In your opinion, conducting an investigation suspends the decision period
not on.
 

54. A request for enforcement is a request to make a decision. Pursuant to Section 4:13,

paragraph 1 of the Awb, a decision must be made within the statutory period
specified period or, in the absence of such a period, a reasonable period after receipt of the
application. Pursuant to Section 4:13(2) of the Awb, the reasonable term within which a
decision must be given at eight weeks, unless a notification as referred to in
Article 4:14, third paragraph, of the Awb has been done. Article 4:14, third paragraph, of the Awb stipulates that the
administrative authority, if the decision cannot be made within a period of eight weeks,
must inform the applicant of this, stating a reasonable period within which the
decision can be expected.

55. The request for enforcement was submitted to the AP by your client on March 24, 2017. By letter of 1 May
In 2017, the AP asked your client for further substantiation. By letter dated May 30, 2017, Mr
AP informed that an investigation is being launched at SBG, but that this investigation would take some time
and your client would be informed of its outcomes. A notice of default from the
AP, filed by letter dated April 18, 2018, was subsequently withdrawn by your client. Then has
your client, by letter dated November 16, 2018, once again served notice of default on the AP. The AP notes that the
decision period on the request for enforcement has been unreasonably long.
 
The careless decision-making by the AP is contrary to Article 3:2 of the Awb

56. You argue that the careless decision-making by the AP is contrary to Article 3:2 of the Awb. In

the primary decision is too sparsely motivated why the AP refrains from any form of enforcement.
The decision also in no way reflects the AP's research findings
been. Finally, you argue on behalf of your client that the DPA already has the information obtained from SBG
during the investigation should have shared with the objector as the applicant for enforcement.
 

57. Article 3:2 of the Awb contains a partial codification of the principle of due care and carries
the administrative authority, when preparing the decision, to gather the necessary knowledge about the
relevant facts and the interests to be weighed. In case of a request for enforcement rests on the
administrative body has an obligation to investigate.15 By letter dated 1 May 2017, the AP has your client as the applicant
requested further information until enforcement. In response to requests made by the AP for
information, SBG has provided information by letter of 25 August 2017 and by letter of 16 January
2019. Akwa GGZ also responded to a request for information by letter dated 16 January 2019
by the AP.
 

58. The AP is of the opinion that, by means of information requests to both your client and SBG and

Akwa GGZ, has fulfilled the duty of investigation resting on the administrative body in a
request for enforcement. In the opinion of the AP it does not follow from Article 3:2 of the Awb that the
applicant for enforcement, already during the phase that the AP conducts an investigation as an administrative body
to possible violations of the GDPR by SBG or Akwa GGZ, the requested information in the
within the framework of that investigation with your client as the applicant for enforcement so that they have the opportunity
is required to respond to it. The ability to respond to requested information does
in the opinion of the AP if a decision is made and the investigation report that
on which the decision is based can be provided to the parties, which in the remainder of the
procedure has also been done. Because Article 3:2 of the Awb pertains to the preparation of the decision
the administrative body, the AP will include your ground for objection insofar as it relates to the content of the decision
evaluate the following marginal numbers.
 
The inadequate motivation of the decision is contrary to Article 3:46 of the Awb

59. You argue that the primary decision is inadequately reasoned and is therefore contrary to Article

3:46 of the Awb. The appeal argues that it is not clear from the decision what
the research findings of the AP have been and why the AP is refraining from any kind of
enforcement.

60. Pursuant to Section 3:46 of the Awb, a decision must be based on proper motivation. The
proper reasoning refers on the one hand to the aspect of the correct determination of the facts, on the other hand
the decision taken must be based on the established facts. In the primary decision has
explained to the AP that the assets and liabilities of SBG will be transferred to Akwa GGZ and that at the same time
the SBG database is reduced to a set of statistical data that is used by Akwa GGZ
brought in. The AP has also put forward that these new facts and circumstances will affect the AP
necessary to conduct further investigation, precisely also to do justice to the principle of due care,
as included in Article 3:2 of the Awb. Because the investigation at the time of the primary decision
had not yet been completed and therefore no violation of the GDPR could yet be established, there was
no possibility for the AP to take enforcement action against SBG at that time. Therefore became
rejected the enforcement investigation while simultaneously announcing that the investigation into the
legality of SBG's data processing was continued. In the opinion of the AP
does the primary decision therefore meet the motivation requirement as included in Article 3:46 of
the Awb.
 
The AP has failed to apply the principle duty of enforcement in this request for enforcement
61. You argue that the DPA failed to apply your client's request for enforcement

indicate the duty of principle to enforce. According to you, the AP wrongly failed to
to take enforcement action and this is not further explained in the primary decision.
 

62. According to settled case law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State, one applies
duty of principle to enforce, which means that the competent administrative authority in the event of determination
of a violation of a statutory provision is in principle obliged to act against this,
because of the public interest served by enforcement.16 It is only possible in two cases
administrative body refrain from taking enforcement action, namely if there is a concrete prospect of legalization or
if enforcement action is disproportionate to the interests to be served by it. A
administrative body may take enforcement action on its own initiative or on request.
 

63. At the time of the primary decision, enforcement was not possible because the investigation had not yet been completed

completed and no violation of the GDPR could be identified. On May 21, 2019, the AP issued a
investigation report, the conclusion of which is that both SBG and Akwa GGZ
have processed personal data about health within the meaning of Article 4, parts 1 and 15, GDPR,
in violation of the prohibition to process such data as referred to in Article 9(1) of the
AVG. This research report has been amended and finalized on July 26, 2019. On May 29, 2019,
issued an enforcement intention to both SBG and Akwa GGZ in response to the
findings from the research report. The AP has established that it does not respond to your request for enforcement
has failed to apply the duty of principle to enforce, now that it is on the basis of
the enforcement request and shortly after adoption of the investigation report an intention to
enforcement, which now results in a reprimand being imposed on
Akwa GGZ.

Conclusion

64. Pursuant to Section 7:11(1) of the Awb, the DPA reconsidered the contested decision to

reason for the objections raised. During this review, the AP assessed whether it was justified
has decided to deny your request for enforcement. In view of the foregoing, the AP comes to
the conclusion that your objection is well founded. The AP therefore sees reason to 3
December 2018 (attribute xxx), and make a new decision instead.
 
Part II of the decision on objection: today's decision to impose a reprimand

65. Instead of the primary decision of 3 December 2018 revoked by today's decision, the DPA has
today's decision imposed a reprimand on Akwa GGZ. This is appended to this Decree as Annex 3.
 

66. To inform the parties, the AP notes the following. The present decision and the decision
from today to the imposition of a reprimand together form the AP's decision on the objection of
objector. Interested parties may appeal against this decision on objection to the
court.
 
8. Reimbursement of litigation costs

67. In the supplementary notice of objection dated 5 March 2019, you submitted a request for reimbursement of the
costs incurred by your client in connection with the handling of the objection. Pursuant to article
7:15, second paragraph, of the Awb, the costs are only reimbursed insofar as the contested decision
is revoked due to unlawfulness attributable to the administrative authority. The contested decision
however, is not revoked because of an unlawful act on the part of the AP, but because of a
change of circumstances, namely a completed investigation resulting in a
research report. This investigation was at the time of the decision of 3 December 2018
not yet completed, as a result of which the AP has rightly ruled that the enforcement request on that
was not eligible for allocation at this time. There is an allowance for legal costs
therefore no reason.
