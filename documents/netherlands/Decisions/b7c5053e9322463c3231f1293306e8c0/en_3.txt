Subject
Decision on objection regarding fine and order subject to periodic penalty payment Haga Hospital
 

 

 

Dear [CONFIDENTIAL]
 
You will hereby receive the decision of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) on your notice of objection dated 29 July
2019 and supplemented by letter and fax dated September 10, 2019. The objection is directed against the decision of the
AP of 18 June 2019 (reference: z2019-07604) imposing an administrative fine as well as an order
subject to periodic penalty payments to your client Stichting Hagaziekenhuis (Hagaziekenhuis). The decision of 18 June 2019
is hereinafter (also) referred to as the primary decision.
 
1.
 

Course of the procedure

1. On April 4, 2018, the AP received a report of a data breach from Haga Hospital.

 

2. In response to the aforementioned report, the AP has launched an investigation. In that context, on 31

October 2018 an on-site investigation took place at Haga Hospital.1

 

3. The investigation resulted in a report of preliminary findings in January 2019. On it has

Haga Hospital responded in writing on February 4, 2019.

 

4. Subsequently, the AP - taking into account the response of Haga Hospital - has the research report

definitively determined and sent to Haga Hospital by letter dated 26 March 2019.

 

                                                                        
1 With regard to the course of the investigation, reference is made to p. 2 and 3 of the primary decree as well as to paragraph 1.2, p. 4
of the AP's final investigation report referred to below.

5. In a letter dated April 4, 2019, the AP has an intention to impose an administrative fine and/or order

sent to Haga Hospital under penalty. Haga Hospital has both on that intention
in writing (by letter of 18 April 2019) and orally (during a hearing on 25 April 2019) its
viewpoint given.

 

6. Taking into account the view of Haga Hospital, the AP has decided by decision of 18 June 2019

to impose both an administrative fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments for violation of
Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR.

 

7. In a letter and fax dated 29 July 2019, HagaZiekenhuis lodged an objection on grounds to be adduced

against the aforementioned decision and requested a period of 6 weeks for supplementing the grounds.

 

8. In a letter dated 31 July 2019, the AP gave Haga Hospital the opportunity by 11 September 2019 at the latest

to complete the grounds of objection.

 

9. By letter and fax dated September 10, 2019, as well as by letter and fax dated October 4, 2019, Haga Hospital

its grounds of objection.
 

10. On October 16, 2019, a hearing took place at the offices of the AP. Of hearing is one

report made. This report is appended to this decision.

 

11. On October 17, 2019, an on-site investigation took place at the offices of Haga Hospital in

The Hague to verify whether Haga Hospital has complied with the cease and desist order.

 

12. In response to what was discussed during the hearing on October 16, 2019, Haga Hospital has

letter, fax and e-mail dated 5 November 2019 in further detail her appeal to limited financial capacity
substantiated.

 

13. In a letter dated 2 December 2019, the AP Haga Hospital informed Haga Hospital that at the time of the

on-site investigation of October 17, 2019 complied with the burden. 2

 

14. In a letter dated December 5, 2019, the AP asked you whether the aforementioned letter from the AP of December 2, 2019
there is reason for Haga Hospital to withdraw the grounds for objection against the order subject to periodic penalty payments. In
In response to this, you indicated in a letter dated December 13, 2019 that Haga Hospital is not a reason
sees its grounds for objection with regard to the order subject to periodic penalty payments withdrawn.

                                                                        
2 Earlier, in a letter dated 22 August 2019, the AP has already concluded that Haga Hospital, when implementing the measures set out in its letter,
of 9 August 2019 (reference: 2019/0177/CvdW/PM/rv) the proposed measures are complied with that
relates to the control of log files. By letters from Haga Hospital dated 24 and 30 September 2019 (reference:
2018/0109x/CvdW/PM/cb and 2018/0109z/CvdW/JP/rv respectively) Haga Hospital has explained how it has implemented
given to the burden.

Legal framework

15. The relevant legal framework is included as an appendix at the end of this decision.

 
 
3.

The primary decision

16. Pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, opening words and under d and i, in conjunction with Article 83, paragraph 4, opening words and

under a, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Article 14, paragraph 3, of the
Implementation Act General Data Protection Regulation (UAVG), the AP is (among other things) authorized to
to impose an administrative fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments with regard to infringements of the GDPR.
  

17. In the primary decision on Haga Hospital, the AP has imposed an administrative fine and an order

penalty imposed for violation of Article 32, paragraph 1 of the AVG, read in conjunction with
Article 3, second paragraph, of the Electronic Data Processing by Healthcare Providers Decree and the
determined under 12.4.1 of NEN 7510-2 because the requirement of two-factor authentication has not been met and the
requirement to regularly review the log files.
 

18. The amount of the administrative fine has been set at € 460,000. The AP has based this on the

Fining Policy Rules of the Dutch Data Protection Authority 2019 (Fining Policy Rules 2019).3

 

19. Article 32 GDPR is, as follows from Article 2.3 of the Fining Policy Rules 2019, classified in category II.

A fine bandwidth of € 120,000 – € 500,000 and a so-called basic fine of
€310,000. This basic fine serves as a (neutral) starting point for the further determination of the
fine.4 The AP then adjusts this further provision to the factors described in Article 7 of the
Fining Policy Rules 2019. This allows the base fine to be increased or decreased.

 

20. In the primary decision, the factors from Article 7, opening lines and under a (nature, seriousness and duration of the

infringement) and b (intentional/negligent nature of the infringement), of Article 7 of the Fining Policy Rules 2019 de
reason to increase the fine twice by € 75,000.
 

21. In addition to an administrative fine, an order subject to periodic penalty payments has also been imposed on Haga Hospital due to

the same violation. The burden extends to Haga Hospital - within fifteen weeks of the date of the
primary decision - to allow access to its hospital information system exclusively with
application of two-factor authentication, and that the log files are regularly checked for
unauthorized access or use of patient data. The amount of the penalty is
set at € 100,000 for every two weeks after the end of the beneficiary period, up to one
maximum amount of € 300,000 in total.

 

                                                                        
3 Stct. 2019, No. 14586, March 14, 2019.
4 The amount of the basic fine can be calculated by dividing the minimum and maximum amount of the relevant fine
adding the bandwidth together and then dividing it by two (cf. art. 2.4 Fining Policy Rules 2019).

Grounds of the objection

22. In summary, Hagaziekenhuis put forward the following grounds for objection.

 
No grounds for maintaining NEN standards
 
Lack of legal basis for enforcement

23. Haga Hospital believes that the AP has no legal basis to take enforcement action. Otherwise

than the AP suggests, neither follows from the GDPR nor from the Processing Additional Provisions Act
personal data in healthcare (Wabvpz) that the obligation to take 'appropriate measures' should be
are completed on the basis of NEN standards 7510, 7512 and 7513. Reference is made to these standards
in Article 3, paragraph 2 and Article 4 of the Electronic Data Processing by Healthcare Providers Decree
(Begs).
 

24. The power to set further rules for the processing of

personal data (article 26 Wbp) has lapsed with the introduction of the AVG. It follows that
the disappearance of the basis of the Begz, namely article 26 Wbp, not (exclusively) with article 15j
Wabvpz could be restored. After all, this does not yet grant the AP authority to
to lay down more detailed rules in a particular sector. The Wabvpz is therefore not an elaboration of the AVG, but
stands on its own, next to the AVG and its predecessor, the Wbp. The AP is not authorized to take enforcement action
due to alleged violation of the NEN standards on the basis of the Begz/Wabvpz. To that end, only the
Authorized Healthcare and Youth Inspectorate.

 

25. It follows from paragraph 2.4 of the explanatory memorandum to the UAVG that the material standards for

data processing follow directly from the GDPR and should no longer be at national level
captured. The AP can therefore not fill in the open standards in the GDPR with national laws
regulations, by means of NEN standards. Haga Hospital refers to considerations 8, 10 and 13
of the preamble to the GDPR. The GDPR requires an autonomous interpretation from the member states. The AP can
therefore do not impose a fine or order subject to periodic penalty payments on the basis of the (U)GDPR for violation of the
NEN standards.

 

Violation of the principle of legality

26. HagaZiekenhuis is furthermore of the opinion that the contested decision is contrary to the principle of legality.

 

27. The AP can only take enforcement action due to violation of the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR

included open standard. At the time of the alleged violation, this standard was according to Haga Hospital
not specified. From the principle of legality laid down in Article 7 ECHR and Article 5:4, paragraph 2, Awb
follows that the AP could not take enforcement action. A sanction can only be imposed for an at or
conduct prohibited by law. In addition, in view of the lex certa-
principle to be sufficiently clear, foreseeable and knowable. According to Haga Hospital, that is not the case here
case because the content of the open standard in Article 32 (1) GDPR could not be known by a concrete
application in practice. The AP should have clarified this open standard first. The reference of the

AP to a report by the Dutch Data Protection Authority from 2013, the AP cannot benefit because
this report is based on the Wbp and the NEN standards.

 

28. The mere fact that Haga Hospital has taken the NEN standards as a starting point in its policy,
does not mean that the AP can enforce compliance on the basis of the (U)GDPR. Article 5:4, paragraph 2
Awb requires a legal basis. Internal policy is insufficient.

 

29. Insofar as it would be allowed to test against the NEN, Haga Hospital argues that the AP has

omitted to clarify when 'regular review of log files' is involved.
Haga Hospital explained during the opinion session how the control of the logging within
Haga Hospital takes place and has explicitly asked the AP for a concrete interpretation of the standard.
That should have been reason for the AP to concretize this standard. The AP's argument
paragraph 5.2 of the contested decision, in which it substantiates why it has not given any substance
to the standard 'regularly', therefore does not apply because it boils down to the necessity of the size of
controls depends on the way in which control takes place. And the AP knew the method of control.

 

30. Haga Hospital finds the NEN-7510-2 so vague that it is in conflict with the legality and

principle of legal certainty cannot be enforced with a fine or an order subject to periodic penalty payments.

 

31. In its letter of October 4, 2019, Haga Hospital provided additional reasons why it believes that

the AVG does not offer any scope for further detailing Article 32 AVG by means of NEN standards. She refers
in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EC from which it follows that Member States do not
may add substantive rules or binding interpretation provisions to a regulation.5 The AP
does this according to Haga Hospital by applying the NEN standards (which are national standards). This
stands in the way of a uniform application of the GDPR in the EU. The GDPR has no provision that it
makes it possible to set further national rules with regard to Article 32 GDPR.6
 
Objections to the amount of the fine and the amount of the periodic penalty payment
 
Haga Hospital has not been negligent

32. Haga Hospital claims not to have been negligent. In this regard, she points to the following affected

measures:

o An extra warning appears when an employee opens a file;
o There is a mandatory e-learning course for all employees who have access to it

electronic patient record;

o All employees are made aware of professional secrecy and the

importance of confidentiality of patient data;

o Additional information is provided at the introduction meeting for new employees;
o The employment contract has been tightened;

                                                                        
5 ECJ 18 February 1970 (Bollmann, 40/69), ECJ 6 July 1972 (Schlüter & Maack) ECJ 10 October 1973 (Variola, 34/73) and ECJ 31
January 1978 (Fratelli Zerbone, 94/77).
6 In that context, Haga Hospital refers to the judgment of the CJEU of 11 January 2001 (Azienda Agricola Monte Arcosu, C-403/98).

o There is an option for patients to protect their patient data additionally;
o Where possible, authorizations will be tightened;
o We are working on a customized solution for checking the logging.7

33. Haga Hospital also indicates that the conclusion that it was negligent is not correct because the AP
goes beyond the fact that implementing two-factor authentication is not a measure that prevents unauthorized access
in patient files by employees. After logging in with two-factor authentication is
after all, it is still possible for employees to view a patient file without authorization.
 

34. HagaZiekenhuis also notes that the AP's statement that the hospitals affected by HagaZiekenhuis

measures do not relate to regular checking of the logging, is not correct. Haga Hospital has,
as laid down in the report of the opinion session, the number of samples increased from four to
six.
In this context, Haga Hospital also notes that it is contrary to the principles of proper
governance in general and the principle of legal certainty in particular to collect an administrative fine
on the basis of an unclear standard (the NEN standard with regard to logging is open) and that standard
has not been specified by the governing body.
 
AP has wrongly fined Haga Hospital twice

35. The DPA has imposed a basic fine of € 310,000 on Haga Hospital. This basic fine is by the
AP subsequently increased twice by an amount of € 75,000 because, according to the AP, there is
“a structural violation that still persists”. The AP's substantiation for the former
increase of the basic fine amounts to the same as the substantiation for the second increase. The
After all, the continuous violation established by the AP is the result of the fact that
Haga Hospital has taken no or insufficient measures. According to Haga Hospital, it is not in
accordance with the Fining Policy and it is also not reasonable to pay the base fine twice
increase due to the same fact. The double increase is therefore also contrary to the ne bis in idem principle.
principle (Article 5:43 Awb).
 
Fine wrongly not reduced

36. Article 7, preamble and under c, of the Fining Policy Rules gives the AP the option to set the basic fine

lower if measures have been taken by the controller to reduce the
mitigate the damage suffered by those involved. In this context, Haga Hospital refers to the
measures taken.

 

37. The fine imposed by the AP on Haga Hospital is directly at the expense of the (scarce) resources that

can be used for patient care. This means that the fine is at the expense of the possibility to
invest in healthcare and innovate, on the basis of which Hagaziekenhuis remains able to provide sustainable healthcare

                                                                        
7 This custom solution (a software application specially developed for Haga Hospital called [CONFIDENTIAL] ) is
implemented and active. Please refer to the letter from Haga Hospital dated September 24, 2019 (reference:
2018/0109x/CvdW/PM/cb) as well as to the letter from the AP dated 2 December 2019 containing the findings in response to the
on-site investigation on October 17, 2019 to verify compliance with the burden.

to deliver. Haga Hospital also believes that a reduction of the basic fine is justified for this reason
is.

 

38. HagaZiekenhuis finally appeals to reduced financial capacity and requests this
reason for punishment. In this regard, Haga Hospital points out in its letter of 5 November 2019
report from accounting firm [CONFIDENTIAL] and a report from the financial strategic
consultancy [CONFIDENTIAL], and further refers to the financial figures of Haga Hospital
about 2019.
 
Penalty sum set too high

39. The DPA has attached a penalty of € 100,000 to the order for every two weeks that is not (fully)

the burden has been met, up to a maximum amount of € 300,000 in total. Haga Hospital is committed to it
position that these amounts are disproportionate to the alleged conduct. That concludes the decision
conflicts with the principle of proportionality within the meaning of Article 3:4 Awb and also with the specific provision
in Article 5:32b, paragraph 3, Awb.

 

40. The order subject to periodic penalty payments is at the expense of the opportunity to invest in healthcare and to innovate.

That cannot be the purpose of enforcement. Haga Hospital also believes that a reduction
of the periodic penalty payment is justified.

 

41. The amount of the periodic penalty payment is contrary to the principle of equality. The AP has since the

entry into force of the GDPR, various orders subject to periodic penalty payments have been imposed. The penalty that on
Haga Hospital is by far the highest.

 

42. The periodic penalty payment is contrary to the principle of proportionality, because one penalty amount is attached to

a load consisting of two parts. This means that Haga Hospital also forfeits penalty payments if
part 1 is complied with, but part 2 is not. According to Haga Hospital, this is unreasonable.

Judge AP

43. Haga Hospital processes data in its hospital information system electronically and on a large scale

(medical) personal data. This (often) involves extremely sensitive health data. This
qualify data as a special category of personal data within the meaning of Article 9, paragraph 1,
GDPR for which, in principle, a processing prohibition applies unless there is an exception as stated
in the AVG and UAVG. It is very important for patients to have confidence in a healthcare provider
this personal data is handled with the utmost care and that it is adequately secured.
Hospital patients - who are often in a vulnerable position - must always be able to access it
trust that their personal data will be treated confidentially and that this will be prevented
employees who have no treatment relationship with the patient or who do not need data for the
management of care provision or treatment, unauthorized patient files can
consult. Against this background, the AP conducted research at Haga Hospital. In response to
of the results of that study, it has been established in the primary decision that Haga Hospital none, then

has not taken sufficient appropriate technical and organizational measures as referred to in
Article 32, first paragraph, of the AVG and an administrative fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments have been imposed. In
The present decision on the objection is made by the AP in response to the arguments you have put forward
grounds of objection do not lead to a different conclusion.
 
Appropriate measures; two-factor authentication and logging control

44. The violation of Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR comprises two aspects. The first concerns non-compliance

the requirement of two-factor authentication. It has been found that for users of the
hospital information system was possible to access the data in the digital
patient records with only something a user knows (namely a username and password).
In that case, one-factor authentication is used.8 The hospital information system of
Haga Hospital did not have the built-in obligation, but only the option to use two factors
login authentication. As a result, Haga Hospital did not correctly meet the two-factor requirement
implemented authentication in its business operations.9 This has also been recognized by Haga Hospital.10

 

45. The second reason why Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR has been violated, is related to not regularly

checking the logging of access to patient files. Logging means that a
care institution structurally keeps track of who has consulted which patient file and when, so that
unauthorized access can be detected and measures can be taken if necessary. It
policy of Haga Hospital provided for a check on the logging of a random sample every year
six patient files.11 In the relevant period covered by the AP's investigation - January 2018 to
October 2018 - there has been one proactive check for unauthorized access12 and 6 checks for
request from patients and staff.13 14

 

46. One audit in the period from January 2018 to October 2018, compared to the number

patient visits 15 that Haga Hospital receives annually and in 2017 (rounded) amounted to 381,50016 and the

                                                                        
8 In general, three factors are distinguished: something the user knows (a password or PIN); something that
the user has (e.g. a token); or something the user is (a biometric). (Source: NCSC, Use
two-factor authentication. Passwords alone are not always enough. Factsheet FS-2015-02, version 1.1. October 22, 2018).

This concerns a total of (rounded off) 381,500 patient visits in 2017, which are divided into 28,500 admissions, 158,000 first
outpatient visits, 52,000 first aid consultations and 143,000 nursing days.

number of employees who have (potential) access to patient files17, in the opinion of the AP
not be regarded as 'regular' control and therefore not as an appropriate measure in the sense
of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR. In addition, the AP notes that in that period the Haga Hospital
reactive checks carried out neither independently nor in combination with the proactive check of
the patient file of the well-known Dutchman - can be regarded as a regular check-up.
After all, such reactive checks are solely dependent on an (explicit) request from one
patient or employee.18

 

47. Also the six (proactive) checks on the logging that Haga Hospital announced19 and carried out20

in 2019, the AP finds, again compared to the number of patient visits - which always result in
consultation of a patient file21 - and the number of employees, insufficient to be regarded as regular
can be designated.

 

Consistent explanation of 'appropriate measures' under the Wbp and the GDPR

48. Both the requirement of two-factor authentication and the requirement of checking the logging are not new. It's alright

for a continuation of the way under the old regime of Directive 95/46/EC and the Wbp
what was regarded as 'appropriate measures' was implemented and was derived from the NEN standard
7510-2.22 The AP has continued this explanation in the context of the interpretation of Article 32, first paragraph, GDPR and
has always been transparent about this.23 The AP is of the opinion that this explanation also applies under the GDPR
correct interpretation of the standard 'appropriate measures' from Article 32, first paragraph, GDPR. Because
Haga Hospital has not acted in accordance with this explanation, the AP believes that an enforcement order should be imposed
measures appropriate. After this, the AP will present its position against the background of the objections of
Haga Hospital further motivation.

Review

49. Pursuant to Article 7:11 of the Awb, the AP assesses on the basis of your objection whether it is involved in the primary decision

rightly so that the order subject to periodic penalty payments and an administrative fine has been imposed.
 

                                                                        
17 During the hearing (p. 6 hearing report), Haga Hospital stated that 3,500 people are employed at
Haga Hospital.
18 The AP notes in this context that the check performed by Haga Hospital is also not in accordance with its own
authorization policy.

Jurisdiction, Article 32 GDPR and lex certa
 
Authority

50. Haga Hospital states that the AP can only impose a fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments

based on the AVG and the UAVG and not on the basis of the Wabvpz and the based on it
Begz, with the NEN standards included therein.
 

51. In this regard, the DPA notes the following. It has been determined in the primary decision that Haga Hospital de

(security) standard as laid down in Article 32, first paragraph, GDPR has been violated because insufficient
appropriate technical and organizational measures have been taken to ensure a risk-based approach
level of security for the processing of personal data. So it's that standard
Article 32, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, which the AP has found to have been violated by
Haga Hospital.24 Although the primary decision considers that Article 32 of the GDPR in
connection should be read with Article 3, second paragraph, of the Begz and the provisions under 12.4.1 of
NEN 7510-2, but it cannot be concluded from this that the Begz or the NEN standards
are regarded as the violated regulations on the basis of which the AP proceeded to impose
of enforcement measures.25 That is also not the case. In the present case, however, the NEN
7510-2 contained the requirement of two-factor authentication as well as the requirement to regularly update log files
assess, the concrete implementation/interpretation of what is in this case 'appropriate technical and
organizational measures' within the meaning of Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR apply. The AP has the
fine and the order subject to periodic penalty payments are therefore also not imposed on the basis of and because of a violation of the
Wabvpz and/or the Begz and the NEN standards contained therein, but on the basis of not taking
appropriate technical and organizational measures within the meaning of Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR.
 

52. In its notice of objection, supplemented by letter of 4 October 2019, Haga Hospital also points to
European jurisprudence26 This jurisprudence essentially pertains to the prohibition of further
to set (binding) rules in national regulations in case a European regulation applies. A
however, such a situation does not arise in the present case. No further rules have been set. That doesn't take away
that in a specific case Article 32 GDPR must be applied and interpreted. The application and
interpretation is - in view of the task assigned to it in Article 6, paragraph 3, UAVG to supervise
compliance with the GDPR - to the AP. That is what the AP has done and what it is obliged to do.
It is ultimately up to the national court and the Court of Justice of the EU to assess whether the AP has the

                                                                        
24 Pursuant to Article 58, second paragraph, opening words and under d and i, of the UAVG, in conjunction with Article 83, fourth paragraph, opening words and under a,
of the AVG and Article 14, third paragraph, of the UAVG, the AP is authorized to impose an administrative fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments
if there is a violation of article 32, first paragraph, of the AVG.
25 In this context, the AP also notes that Haga Hospital is bound to the Begz and therefore, in view of Article 3, second paragraph,
Begz, is legally obliged to comply with the NEN standards mentioned therein. That, according to Haga Hospital states in its appeal, the
authority to set further rules for the processing of personal data for a specific sector (article 26 Wbp) with the
introduction of the GDPR has been canceled, the AP denies. In the opinion of the AP, Article 6, second paragraph and/or third paragraph,
AVG, specifically the possibility to do so.

interpretation given by it of the standards from the AVG is legally correct.27 This means that a
autonomous interpretation guaranteed.
 
Article 32 GDPR and lex certa

53. With regard to HagaZiekenhuis' assertion that the primary decision is in conflict with the

principle of legality contained lex certa principle because - as Haga Hospital argues - there would be
a vague standard, the AP considers as follows.
 

54. The lex certa principle requires the legislature, in order to ensure legal certainty, to

describes a norm or prohibited behavior in the clearest possible way.28 Someone must be able to know ter
for what conduct or omissions he may be punished. This requires the implementation of a legal
provision must be sufficiently clear, specific and knowable. However, that doesn't mean it's use
of a vague or open standard is not possible. On the contrary, the legislature can suffice with such
standards. Open norms can be necessary and therefore acceptable because the law must be too
can function under changed circumstances.29 In the so-called Krulsla judgment, the
Supreme Court that when describing crimes, it uses a certain vagueness, consisting in
the use of general terms is sometimes unavoidable in order to avoid behaviors that
be punishable fall outside the scope of the offense description.30 Cannot always be foreseen
how the interests to be protected will be violated in the future and why, if so
provided, otherwise descriptions of offenses would be too refined, resulting in a lack of clarity
disappears and thus harms the importance of the general clarity of the legislation. In addition to the
The Supreme Court also interprets the lex certa principle in this way in the (highest) administrative courts.31
 

55. With regard to the question whether the relevant standard from Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR (the obligation to take
of 'appropriate technical and organizational measures') is contrary to the lex certa principle, notes the
AP the following.

 

56. First of all, according to the text of Article 32(1) GDPR, the measures to be taken must be taken into account

the state of the art, the implementation costs, as well as the nature, size,
context and the processing purposes and the varying likelihood and severity of the risks to the
rights and freedoms of individuals. Furthermore, Article 32, first paragraph, opening words, and parts a-d, AVG
made a further specification of what constitutes the 'appropriate technical and organizational measures'
includes32:
 

                                                                        
27 Cf. House of Representatives, session 2017–2018, 34 851, no. 3, p. 53
28 The lex certa principle is laid down in Article 5:4 Awb, Article 7 ECHR and Article 15 ICCPR as well as in Article 49 of the Charter of
the fundamental rights of the European Union.

(ECLI:NL:CRVB:2019:26).

laid down in Article 5, paragraph 1, opening lines and under f, GDPR.

64. d) 65. a procedure for testing, assessing and evaluating effectiveness at regular intervals

The second paragraph of Article 32 GDPR further stipulates that in the assessment of the appropriate
security level, in particular taking into account the processing risks resulting from
unauthorized access to transmitted, stored or otherwise processed data, either by
accident or wrongful.
 

57. Thus, Article 32, GDPR, partly in conjunction with the preamble33, already provides a further interpretation of the standard
'appropriate technical and organizational measures' and it is indicated that they are specifically taken into account
must be kept. Including ‘guaranteeing integrity’34 and ‘unauthorised

further elaboration/interpretation of those concepts. In view of the foregoing, in the opinion of
the AP, requiring two-factor authentication and regular auditing of logging under it

that Article 32 GDPR provides a standard that is addressed to all data controllers, regardless of
which market segment they are active. The GDPR therefore covers all areas and all forms of
cover data processing. All data controllers must therefore comply with this standard

future-proofing of the standard, and that justifies it – against the background of the above

                                                                        
33 Recital 83 in the preamble to the GDPR is very similar in text to what is stated in Article 32 GDPR:

In order to ensure security and prevent the processing from infringing this Regulation, the
controller or the processor to assess the risks inherent in the processing and take measures, such as
encryption, to mitigate those risks. Those measures should provide an appropriate level of security, with
including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the implementation costs
against the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the
data security risks, attention should be paid to risks that arise with
personal data processing, such as the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or the
unauthorized access to the data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, either accidentally or
unlawful, which can lead in particular to physical, material or immaterial damage.

cited case law listed under marginal number 52 – in this case there is (more) open
standards as included in Article 32 of the GDPR.36
 

58. With regard to the question whether the explanation given by the AP to the standard 'appropriate technical and

organizational measures' is sufficiently clear, determined and knowable, is furthermore the following
interest. In general, this applies to the material standards that govern the processing of personal data
must comply with under the GDPR regime, have broadly remained the same as those under the directive
95/46/EC and the Wbp.37 Specifically with regard to the wording 'appropriate technical and
organizational measures' - as included in article 32 AVG - there is a continuation of
which already applied under Directive 95/46/EC and the Wbp.38 There is no question of a material change. below
in those circumstances, it is obvious - also with a view to legal certainty - that in the past
to continue the interpretation followed in the interpretation of Article 32, paragraph 1, GDPR. That means that the already in
past interpretation via the requirements of two-factor authentication contained in the NEN standards
the regular assessment of the log files are maintained.39 The AP is also always clear
propagated that the NEN 7510, as a generally accepted security standard within the practice of the
information security in healthcare, an important standard for information security under the AVG regime
remains in healthcare and these guidelines must be followed.40 In a similar sense, the GDPR
Helpdesk for Care, Welfare and Sport communicated this. 41
 

59. In view of the foregoing, the AP is of the opinion that the European legislator has sufficed with the
standard laid down in Article 32 GDPR regarding the appropriate technical and organizational to be taken
measures.
 
A closer look at the 'regular inspection' standard

60. Specifically with regard to the requirement of regular checking of the logging and the objection of

Haga Hospital that this standard is too vague, the AP also notes the following. The AP is from
opinion that the (proactive) monitoring of the logging in the period from January 2018 to October 2018

                                                                        
36 In this context, the AP also refers to the explanatory memorandum to Article 13 of the Wbp (the predecessor of Article 32 GDPR): (…)”In the
concept <<appropriate>> implies that the security is in accordance with the state of the art. This is initially one
question of professional ethics of persons charged with information security. The standards of these ethics are set out in this provision
provided with a legal capstone, in the sense that a legal obligation is attached to it for the controller. It is
not for the legislator to provide further details about the nature of the security. Such details would be highly time-bound and
thereby undermining the desired level of security. “ (…). (emphasis added by the AP). See TK 1997-1998, 25
892, no. 3, p. 98-99.
37 According to recital 9 in the preamble to the GDPR, the objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain valid.
38 Article 13 Wbp and Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46/EC already used the terminology 'appropriate and organizational measures'
to prevent loss or unlawful processing.

of one file (regarding the file of the well-known Dutchman)42 compared to the 381.50043
patient visits and associated file consultations at the Haga Hospital in 2017 (evidently) not as
'regular' can be qualified. This also applies to the - at the time of the imposition of the
administrative fine announced44 and partially implemented45 - random check on the logging of
six files for 2019. The idea behind it is that sufficient attention is paid to the
number of patients and staff present at the hospital. That generates a very large processing
amounts of data. Haga Hospital has to deal with a large number of patient visits and has a lot
employees who (potentially) all have access to the patient files.46 The 'open'
considering the character of a hospital (everyone can visit a hospital; well-known and
unknown patients), the sensitivity of the personal data and the fact that good care was provided
should prevent access to - and therefore processing of - medical data
may be an impediment, (precisely) this means that a regular check on the logging is proportionate to
the number of files and file consultations is necessary for good security. One (manual)
random sample of 6 patient files does not give evidence of sufficient feeling of this in the opinion of the AP
urgency and does not indicate that Haga Hospital is 'in control' in this area. Haga didn't have one
automatically organized control process, but used a manual control that, moreover, on
was carried out on a very occasional basis. As stated, this method does not fit in well with the large number
patient visits/file consultations and the associated risk of possible unauthorized access
file consultations. In the AP's opinion, therefore, it is not possible to speak of a suitable one
measure. Haga Hospital should also have realized that and should have been clear in view of the standard that the
AP also used before the entry into force of the GDPR. Seen against that background is of a te
vague/unclear standard, as Haga Hospital states, is out of the question.
 

61. That the AP did not indicate in advance how many files in the case of Haga Hospital

must be assessed, does not mean, as HagaZieknhuis argues, that this means that the standard is too
is vague and violates the principles of legality or legal certainty. How many
dossiers to be assessed depends in part on the facts and circumstances of the case
concrete situation, such as the number of loggings in relation to the number of patient files and the number
employees that can access, and can therefore be different on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the AP notes that it op
quantifying in advance what is 'regular' is often not possible and/or desirable because that is
may undermine the required level of protection in a specific case. This would, also considering
the time-bound nature of the state of the art, the ability to respond in a timely manner
changed circumstances and future developments, the application of the regulations in high
degree can hinder. It is therefore not inconceivable that it will become possible in the near future
by means of, for example, specific software applications in a simpler manner and on a larger scale

assess files on logging. The software currently used by Haga Hospital
[CONFIDENTIAL] for the purpose of checking the logging confirms this position.47
 
More is expected from professional parties

62. Finally, the following is noted in connection with the foregoing - unnecessarily. For a
successful appeals to the lex certa principle are being made more by professional parties, such as Haga Hospital
than expect from non-professionals. When it comes to professional parties, it may be required that they
have insight into the meaning of (open) norms addressed to them and, if necessary, show due diligence
information about the restrictions to which their behavior is subject.48 This is all the more pressing now that the
concerns the processing of health data, which, as said, qualify as special
category of personal data and for which a processing prohibition applies in principle, unless there is
a ground for exception and care has been taken for extra guarantees. It was on the way
Haga Hospital, if it was unclear about this, to ascertain the explanation if necessary
of Article 32 AVG by means of the two-factor authentication contained in the NEN standards and
regular checks on the logging.
 

63. In addition, the AP emphasizes that Haga Hospital itself was very aware of the measures to be taken on the ground
of Article 32 of the GDPR. The AP deduces this from the assessment made by Haga Hospital itself
its authorization policy, entitled 'Authorization of Digital Patient Files'. Haga Hospital makes this
explicit mention of the security obligation in the AVG and it is noted that healthcare providers to
must fulfill this obligation by applying the existing NEN standards, including NEN
7510.49
 
Conclusion lex certa

64. In view of the above, the AP concludes that there is no question of a violation of the lex certa principle

is. The objection in this regard is unfounded.
 
Two-factor authentication and unauthorized access
 

65. Haga Hospital states that the measure of two-factor authentication is not a measure that is unauthorized

access to patient files by employees can be (completely) prevented.
 

66. In this regard, the AP first notes that this does not alter the fact that this measure - as above

set out with reasons - one of the mandatory measures to be taken is appropriate measures within the meaning of Article 32
of the AVG and Haga Hospital must therefore also take that measure. In addition, the AP notes that the
two-factor authentication is a concrete (care-specific) control measure that, together with others
control measures, the aim is to prevent unauthorized access to systems and applications as much as possible

prevent.50That this measure, as Haga Hospital states, is not a measure that guarantees that
unauthorized access to patient records by employees no longer occurs, but the
is a measure that contributes significantly to the prevention of unauthorized access. In this
framework, the AP emphasizes that applying two-factor authentication - and also checking the logging -
does not stand alone, but must be considered in conjunction with all other appropriate considerations to be taken
measures. It is the combination of these measures that enables Haga Hospital to provide the
to manage the protection of personal data as well as possible and to prevent infringements as much as possible
prevent.
 
International value NEN standards
 

67. In its notice of objection, Haga Hospital also points to the national character of the NEN-

standards. Application of a national standard would hinder the uniform application of the GDPR in the EU
to stand.
 

68. With regard to this ground for objection, the AP first notes that - as above under marginal number
52 has already been noted - is obliged to monitor compliance with the GDPR and in that context in a
specific case must also explain the standards included in the GDPR, even if it concerns more
open standards as laid down in Article 32 GDPR. The AP has done so in the primary decision and
in this decision by requiring two-factor authentication and requiring log files to be regularly
judge. This does not mean that (in advance) there is a situation that goes against one
autonomous interpretation of the GDPR. Whether this explanation stands in the way of the uniform application of the GDPR is possible
if desired, be submitted to the national court and (ultimately) to the European Court of Justice
Justice.
 

Apart from that, the AP notes the following. The relevant NEN standards in this case concern the
Dutch rendering of the European and international standard NEN-ISO / IEC 27002+C1+ C2:2015 and
NEN-EN-ISO 27799:2016 (en).51 These standards have been developed in an international context by
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) or IEC (International Electrotechnical
Commission). ISO and IEC together form a system of bodies specialized in worldwide
normalization. National organizations that are members of ISO or IEC participate in developing
International Standards through technical committees established by the appropriate organization
for the benefit of standardization in specific technical fields. Technical committees of ISO and
IEC work together on topics in which they have a common interest. Others
international organisations, both government agencies and NGOs, in cooperation with ISO and IEC,
also participate in this work. In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have a
joint technical committee established, ISO/IEC JTC 1.
 
The documents - and the standards contained therein - that have been accepted by the Netherlands are then given
the NEN-ISO or NEN-IEC code. Standards with the coding: NEN-EN-ISO are accepted in Europe.52

In short, the relevant NEN standard is therefore about standards at international and European level
are accepted and used.53
 
Amount of the fine and periodic penalty payment
 

69. HagaZiekenhuis puts forward various objections which, in its opinion, should lead to

penance moderation. These are discussed below.
 
Negligent culpability

70. Haga Hospital states that it has not been negligent and points to the measures it has taken.

 

71. With regard to this ground for objection, the AP notes that, notwithstanding the Hagaziekenhuis

measures taken, Haga Hospital should also have taken other measures to ensure an appropriate
to ensure a level of security. As set out in the primary decision, the negligent
culpability for not using two-factor authentication and not regularly checking
the log files. Those measures should also have been taken, and with regard to those
The AP Haga Hospital accuses the measures of negligence. To that extent, these measures are therefore independent of the
measures taken by HagaZienkenhuis.

 

72. The AP has motivated why the number of random checks carried out by Haga Hospital is ten
for the purpose of checking the logging (evidently) cannot be regarded as 'regular
control” and is therefore contrary to Article 32 GDPR. That the AP does not have in advance in that regard
indicating how many random samples are sufficient does not mean that, such as Haga Hospital
argues, because of conflict with the general principles of good administration or the
principle of legal certainty, an administrative fine could not have been imposed.54 Also the statement of
HagaHospital that manual checking is very time-consuming does not mean that HagaHospital
would thus be released from the obligation under Article 32 GDPR and would therefore suffice with a random check
of six files. Moreover, with regard to Haga Hospital's statement, the AP points out that it is manual
checking is time consuming, on the capabilities of specific software applications that do this in important
degree can be overcome. The AP is of the opinion that it would have been on the road from Haga Hospital here
show initiative sooner by acting actively and adequately.

 

Ne bis in idem

73. HagaZiekenhuis further argues that it has wrongly increased the basic fine twice

occurred. According to Hagaziekenhuis, the substantiations for these increases are the same
down. And that, in the opinion of Haga Hospital, is contrary to the AP's fining policy rules and with
the ne bis in idem principle contained in Article 5:43 Awb.

74. The AP cannot follow HagaZiekenhuis in its argument and considers this as follows. The AP has

in the primary decision increases the basic amount of the fine based on two factors. This fine
aggravating factors are listed in Article 7, under a and b, of the Fining Policy Rules and are derived from Article
83, second paragraph, under a and b, of the AVG.55

 

75. The first increase of the basic fine by €75,000 based on the factor 'nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement'

(Article 7, under a, of the Fining Policy Rules) is related on the one hand to the nature and seriousness of the
violation and, on the other hand, the duration of the violation.
With regard to the nature/severity, it is important that it concerns the lack of two suitable ones
(fundamental) security measures, namely a mandatory two-factor authentication56 and the
regularly checking and reviewing log files. In addition, the seriousness of the violation
further colored by the number of employees who have had unauthorized access to the relevant data
patient file57, the number of patients included in the hospital information system,58 the type
personal data (health data) contained therein as well as the trust of
hospital patients who are greatly embarrassed by this.
In addition to the aforementioned nature and seriousness, the duration of the violation also contributed to the (first) increase
of the basic fine by €75,000. In that context it is important that the violation existed since in each
case January 2018 and had not yet ended at the time of the imposition of the fine on 18 June 2019.
 

76. The second increase of the basic fine by €75,000 is based on Article 7, preamble and under b, of the

Fining Policies. It is an increase due to the negligence of Haga Hospital. Despite the
management of Haga Hospital was aware of the unauthorized inspection of the file in question,
has she wrongly seen no reason to take timely measures aimed at a correct
implementation of using two-factor authentication and regularly checking the
log files. In that regard, the AP notes that the argument put forward by Haga Hospital from
lack of time is not a legitimate argument to refrain from taking security measures and thus
to allow the violation to continue.59 In the opinion of
the AP the second increase of the basic fine by € 75,000.
  

77. In conclusion, the DPA notes that the reason for the first increase in the basic fine differs from that one

for the second increase. The increases are based on various factors from the GDPR and the
Fining policy rules that are taken into account when determining the amount of the fine. Of a
there is therefore no question of a double fine and the ne bis in idem principle is therefore not at issue here. It
The objection raised in that context is without merit.

                                                                        
55 The AP is obliged to take these factors into account when determining the amount of the fine in a specific case.
56 The hospital information system does not have the built-in obligation, but only the option of two-factor
login authentication.
57 According to Haga Hospital's own investigation 'Final Report Investigation of Unlawful Access to Patient Files' of May 2018, (p. 27
at the top) it concerns 85 employees of HagaHospital who have had unlawful access to the patient file of the
famous Dutchman. See also AP Research Report March 2019, p. 4.
58 As noted earlier, there were a total of (rounded off) 381,500 patient visits in 2017.
59In this context, the DPA refers to the WP 253 Guidelines, which mention as an example of the “negligent nature of the infringement”:
not applying technical updates in a timely manner (WP 253, 2016/679, p.12).

Penalty mitigation

78. Haga Hospital is of the opinion that there is a fine-reducing circumstance as referred to in

Article 7, preamble and under c, of the Fining Policy Rules because of the measures it has taken to
limit the damage suffered by those involved.

 

79. The AP does not follow HagaZiekenhuis in its argument and considers as follows. Article 7, preamble and under c, of

the Fining Policy Rules gives the AP the option to reduce the basic fine if the
measures have been taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects
to limit. The measures taken by Haga Hospital are aimed at complying with the op
Haga Hospital has an obligation under Article 32, first paragraph, of the AVG, but lead to it
In the opinion of the AP, the damage suffered by the parties concerned is not, or insufficiently, limited. In
in this regard, the AP notes that HagaZiekenhhuis, with regard to the two-factor authentication and the
check on the logging after they have been set by Haga Hospital itself
investigation was aware of the unauthorized access and subsequently by the AP in the final
investigation report of March 2019 also pointed out the observed violations60
has made insufficient efforts to take sufficient and appropriate measures in a timely manner. The AP then also sees
no reason to mitigate the fine imposed on the basis of Article 7, preamble and under c, of the
Fining Policies.

 

80. According to Haga Hospital, there is also a reason for reducing the fine because the fine is directly at the expense
of the (scarce) resources that could otherwise have been used for patient care, as well as at
at the expense of the ability to invest and innovate. Haga Hospital also has in this regard
expressly invoked reduced capacity and she has stated her position in this regard
substantiated with two reports in which various hospitals, including Haga Hospital, by
[CONFIDENTIAL] and [CONFIDENTIAL] were assessed on their financial health.61

 

81. The AP also sees no reason to moderate the fine in this regard. When determining the height of the

administrative fine must be taken into account pursuant to Section 5:46(2) of the Awb
proportionality principle. In this context, the administrative body must take into account, if necessary
the circumstances under which the offense was committed. From parliamentary history at the Awb
it appears that the carrying capacity can be such a circumstance.62 This is also the case in case law
confirmed.63

 

82. It follows from case law that if it appears on the basis of financial data submitted by the offender

that the offender is disproportionately affected by the fine, the fine should be moderated.64 De
However, the AP does not consider Haga Hospital's financial situation to be such that it should be concluded

concluded that Haga Hospital is disproportionately affected by the amount of the fine and
reduction of the fine due to reduced capacity is indicated. The AP has hereby submitted the annual accounts of
2018 as well as the information provided by Haga Hospital in a letter dated 5 November 2019 and
further documents.65

 

83. The operating result of € 622,892 for the 2018 financial year is not such that Haga Hospital

cannot bear a fine of € 460,000. The return for 2019 is now forecast at
€ 947,00066 In addition, the annual accounts show that Haga Hospital had access to
€ 24,011,362 in freely available liquid assets.67 68 The circumstance that [CONFIDENTIAL] the
financial health of Haga Hospital - in the context of a benchmark in which the financial
researched the position of Dutch general hospitals - rated it with a 4 (2017)
and a 569 (2018) because its return is below the 2% standard and also below the market average of
1.48%, Haga Hospital cannot benefit either. Although the AP acknowledges that the financial situation of
HagaHospital is worse compared to other hospitals, this does not mean that
Haga Hospital is insufficiently able to pay the fine imposed on it. The AP considers the
argumentation put forward by Haga Hospital in view of the financial resources at its disposal
insufficient to mitigate the fine in view of the ability-to-pay principle. The same goes for
assessment of [CONFIDENTIAL] who has the return and EBITDA70 of Hagaziekenhuis
assessed.
 

84. That the fine is directly at the expense of the (scarce) resources that would otherwise be used for other purposes
could have been used, the AP acknowledges and endorses Haga Hospital's statement
the scarce resources of a hospital should in principle be spent on care. Nevertheless, this is possible
argument Haga Hospital in this case to no avail. The protection of personal data is also important
to be properly anchored in the daily practice of a hospital where
worked with special personal data. In addition, following the lecture of Haga Hospital
ultimately result in a healthcare institution not being fined at all.

is suspended until the appeal period has expired or, if an appeal has been lodged, until a decision has been made on the appeal. Moreover

85. Haga Hospital states that it will maintain its objection to the order subject to periodic penalty payments,

notwithstanding the letter from the AP dated December 2, 2019 in which the AP states that the order has been complied with.
She points out that in that letter the AP makes a reservation with regard to compliance with the order
in the future.
 

86. The AP notes the following about this. The conclusion of the aforementioned letter states that71:

 
The AP concludes that at the time of the on-site investigation of October 17, 2019, Haga Hospital was suffering from
satisfied. It should be noted that the checking process with [CONFIDENTIAL] is dynamic and on
subject to change. The business rules used in conjunction with [CONFIDENTIAL] serve
to be continuously improved. This improvement should be part of the PDCA improvement cycle.”

 
It is stated in the above quote that it appeared that Haga Hospital complied with the order. At this time
there is no reason to judge otherwise. In short, Haga Hospital meets the burden. What the
AP wanted to make clear with the aforementioned passage about the verification process with [CONFIDENTIAL],
is that the way in which the mandatory checking of the logging should take place - as a result of the
duty to take appropriate measures under Article 32 GDPR - is dynamic in nature. That holds
due to the time-bound nature of the prior art, and the ability to respond in a timely manner
to be able to respond to any changed circumstances and future developments (see also
for this marginal number 57). Against that background, Haga Hospital is based on the resting on her
obligation pursuant to Article 32 GDPR to continuously monitor the control process and, if necessary, to
improve, specifically when it comes to refining the business rules. That depends on the
finding that Haga Hospital currently meets the burden. However, what now becomes appropriate
considered, this need no longer be the case in the (near) future. It is also for that reason that it is required
that controllers go through the PDCA improvement cycle in order to comply with Article 32
AVG and at the time article 13 Wbp - a permanent appropriate security level in the organization
guarantees.72 That is what the AP wanted in its letter of 2 December 2019 to Haga Hospital.
give, but that does not detract from the fact that the AP is of the opinion that Haga Hospital
meets the load. It is true that, as the AP also indicated in its letter of December 2, 2019,
the order subject to periodic penalty payments has not been lifted and can re-investigate in the (near) future whether the order
is still adhered to. This follows from Article 5:34, second paragraph, of the Awb.73
 
height penalty; principle of equality and proportionality

87. HagaZiekenhuis also takes the position that the amount of the penalty payments is disproportionate

to the alleged conduct. According to Haga Hospital, the contested decision is therefore in conflict with
the principle of proportionality within the meaning of Article 3:4 Awb and also with the specific provision in Article

5:32b, paragraph 3 Awb. In the opinion of the AP, this ground for objection has been put forward in vain and
considers in this regard as follows.
 

88. It is assumed that Haga Hospital has complied with the order and no penalty payments have been forfeited.
For this reason, the AP does not see what interest HagaZiekenhis still has in the grounds of objection put forward
with regard to the order subject to periodic penalty payments. Separately, the AP notes the following.

 

89. The amount of the periodic penalty payment must be in reasonable proportion to, on the one hand, the seriousness of the

interests violated by the violation of the statutory provision and, on the other hand, the intended effective
operation of the penalty. It is important that the periodic penalty payment provides such an incentive
must assume that the imposed order will be complied with and forfeiture of the periodic penalty payment will be avoided.
The AP is of the opinion that a penalty has been imposed in this case, which is reasonable
relationship in the aforementioned sense and considers as follows.
 

90. With regard to the seriousness of the interest violated by the violation of the statutory provision
the AP emphasizes that this concerns extremely sensitive health data. Qualify this data,
as noted several times, as a special category of personal data within the meaning of Article 9,
first paragraph, GDPR for which a processing prohibition applies in principle, unless there is an exception such as
stated in the AVG and UAVG. It is very important for the confidence of patients in a healthcare provider
It is important that this personal data is handled with the utmost care and that it is secure in terms of security
meet the highest standards. In that context, it should be noted that the issue in this case is the lack of
two fundamental security measures and that, despite the fact that the management of Haga Hospital on
was aware of the unauthorized inspection of the file in question, wrongly had no reason to do so
has seen to take timely measures to ensure proper implementation of the handling of
two-factor authentication and checking the log files regularly. These circumstances
therefore, in the opinion of the AP, justify the amount of the penalty as stated in the contested
decision have been established.
 

91. HagaZiekenhuis is of the opinion that the penalty imposed is contrary to the principle of equality and
points to earlier orders imposed by the DPA in which lower penalty payments have been set. This
In the AP's opinion, the ground for objection does not serve any purpose and explains that position as follows.

 

92. In general terms, it should be noted that the mere circumstance that the periodic penalty payment in the case of

Haga Hospital would be the highest compared to periodic penalty payments previously imposed by the AP,
does not mean that the penalty in this case is therefore too high or contrary to the principle of equality. The
amount of a penalty is specifically assessed and determined in a case-by-case basis, taking into account
all relevant circumstances of the specific case.

 

93. With regard to the penalty payments imposed on other healthcare providers in 200974, and to which
Haga Hospital with an appeal to the principle of equality, the AP notes that cases

- two-factor authentication and regular logging - which have not been applied. Moreover, in case of
Haga Hospital a serious security incident in advance, with which the context is also clearly different

earlier in 2013, after research at various healthcare institutions, it was found that no provision was made
sufficiently appropriate measures with regard to access to patient files (treatment relationship) and ten
with regard to checking the logging.75

 

94. When it comes to the penalty in the case of the National Police, and where Haga Hospital points out
that in that case it was a penalty of € 50,000 every two weeks, the AP notes that in that case it
one violation and not two as in the present case. This circumstance makes all the difference
the imposed penalty payments are explicable in the opinion of the AP. In addition, the maximum amount
of € 320,000 in case of the National Police comparable. Finally, it should be noted that in the case of
Haga Hospital has actually experienced a serious security incident.

  

95. In addition to the above and to illustrate the case-specific nature of the amount of a

The DPA also points out the order subject to a penalty imposed on VGZ in 2018. The height of the
Penalty payment there amounted to € 150,000 per week and with a maximum of € 750,000, due to a fact that
VGZ employees actually had access to personal data concerning health while
that was not necessary for their work (without it being established that this
employees actually consulted this data).76 It follows that the AP also higher
imposes penalty payments in a case that is comparable in important respects to the present order under
penalty.

 

96. According to HagaZiekenhuis, the imposed penalty payment is also in conflict with the principle of proportionality

because one penalty amount is linked to an order that consists of two parts, which also means that
penalty payments are forfeited if the first part of the order is, but the second part of
the load is not executed. The AP cannot follow Haga Hospital's point of view and notices it
next on.

98. Haga Hospital finally points to the enormous challenge of Haga Hospital to be financially sound

and argues that the penalty order is at the expense of the ability to invest and to
innovation in healthcare. According to Haga Hospital, that cannot be the intention of enforcement and that
justifies, according to Haga Hospital, a reduction of the penalty. The AP follows the argument of
Haga Hospital is not and is considering the following.

without a penalty being forfeited.77 This point of view does not relate to the determination of
the periodic penalty payment takes into account the fact that the periodic penalty payments are forfeited
at the expense of the opportunity to invest and innovate in healthcare, because then the incentive to
burden to carry out too much is removed. In this context, the AP draws a comparison with the ruling
of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State of 6 February 201978 from which it follows that a
penalty that would be determined according to means, does not provide the offender with sufficient incentive to
load to end. It also follows from previous case law that the financial circumstances of the

Conclusion

100.

Pursuant to Section 7:11(1) of the General Administrative Law Act, the AP contested it

decision reconsidered in response to the objections raised. In this review, the AP
assesses whether it has rightly decided to impose a fine and an order subject to periodic penalty payments.
 
101.

In view of the foregoing, the AP is of the opinion that it is justified in taking the primary decision

until the imposition of the fine and order subject to periodic penalty payments has been made. Nor is there one
change of relevant facts and circumstances since the primary decision, so that there is no reason
to revoke the primary decision and to take a different decision.
