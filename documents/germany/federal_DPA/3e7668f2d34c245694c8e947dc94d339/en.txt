EDPB adopts guidelines on the right to information
On Tuesday, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) published guidelines on the rights of data subjects under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The focus is on the right to information, with which those affected can find out, among other things, which data companies and authorities have stored about them.

The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI), Professor Ulrich Kelber, welcomes the joint guidelines: The right to information is the fundamental right of data subjects and is frequently exercised by citizens. However, the corresponding article of the GDPR alone leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. The EDPB is now ensuring more clarity and uniformity here.
In particular, the guidelines specify which data is covered by the right to information and that data subjects are generally to be provided with a copy of the data and not just a summary
is. In addition, those responsible for data processing must take appropriate measures to identify persons behind requests for information so that no unauthorized third parties can access the data. On the other hand, no higher hurdles may be set up than required for identification.
Likewise, a request for information may not be rejected solely with reference to a high processing effort. The motivation behind a request for information is also not a criterion for fulfilling the right to information. The guidelines provide additional information and examples of the time intervals at which data subjects can assert their right to information again against a company or an authority without their request being rejected as excessive or being subject to a fee.
The EDPB will conduct a public consultation on the guidelines.
The guidelines will be available shortly on the EDPB website.
