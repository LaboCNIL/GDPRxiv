The BfDI will pay particular attention to advising the federal government on the further development of the Freedom of Information Act into a transparency law. The BfDI, Professor Ulrich Kelber, said: "This is where the IFK will be able to develop its strengths as a competent advisory body. We need administrative processes in which the publication of information is taken into account right from the start. In Rhineland-Palatinate and Hamburg there are already transparency laws and a lot of experience with the design and implementation. We saw there that switching to proactive publications can give the entire administration a digital boost. Other areas will then also benefit from this.‚Äù
In addition to the BfDI, the freedom of information officers of the federal states also belong to the IFK. There are currently fourteen state commissioners, as Bavaria and Lower Saxony do not yet have a general and unconditional right to access information.
The IFK meets twice a year. The meetings of both bodies are generally open to the public. The IFK makes resolutions and recommendations for action on current topics of freedom of information in order to provide new substantive impetus and expand official openness. You can find more information on the IFK overview page.
