  BfDI to query the vaccination and test status by employers
The BfDI, Professor Ulrich Kelber, calls for legal clarification to query the vaccination and test status of employees: I recommend a nationwide regulation that prevents a patchwork quilt. The legislator is now obliged to act.

The BfDI is already in contact with the federal ministries involved. With a few exceptions, such as in the health sector, employers and employers are currently unable to ask about the vaccination or test status of their employees or order any kind of testing obligation. The BfDI emphasizes that data protection-friendly regulations should be made here in the sense of the informational self-determination of the employees: Depending on whether one decides for 2G or 3G, the employer does not even have to know what specific status their employees have. It would then not be necessary to differentiate the evidence.
In order to create the required legal clarity, the BfDI will continue to advise the federal ministries involved intensively.
