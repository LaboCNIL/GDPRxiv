The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI), Professor Ulrich Kelber, welcomes the progress towards more uniform supervision in these areas.
The BfDI said: A well-made and fair website does not need a cookie banner because it only uses technically necessary cookies. However, if website operators absolutely want to collect personal data, then they must not obtain consent for this by unfair or illegal means. Following the guidelines on deceptive design patterns, I have now agreed with my colleagues at the EDPB on how we can implement this as uniformly as possible in supervision. The results of the final report of the Task Force Cookie-Banner now largely correspond to what we in Germany have already recorded in the Telemedia Orientation Guide.
The EDPB also carried out its first coordinated enforcement action. The EDSA members examined the use of cloud services in public institutions. Professor Kelber sees himself encouraged by the results of the study: My authority advises the federal government on the subject of sovereign clouds, for example, in the committees of the IT Council and the IT Planning Council. We repeatedly emphasize that data protection must be considered from the outset, particularly in view of the difficulties involved in international data transfers in cloud projects. The EDSA ensures that we also have a uniform Europe-wide line here.

          Private companies are mostly supervised by state authorities, but there are some exceptions. Private organizations such as clubs and associations also fall into this category.

          Special responsibilities apply in these areas. Churches and public broadcasters have e.g. B. via their own data protection officers. The federal and state supervisory authorities are not responsible for other organizations either.
