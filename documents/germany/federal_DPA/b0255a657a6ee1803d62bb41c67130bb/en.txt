In the reporting year, the BfDI chaired the conference of independent data protection supervisory authorities and sees room for improvement in many laws and projects: "There is still too much attention paid to how data protection can be adapted to projects, instead of looking for legally compliant solutions from the start . We have therefore advocated digital solutions that citizens can trust. We also need strong international cooperation for uniform standards. I have campaigned for this, for example, in the G7 group and the so-called Berlin Group.‚Äù
In addition to health issues such as the e-prescription, the electronic patient file or the handling of research data, the BfDI has dealt with the European digital legal acts, the Facebook fan page of the federal government and the so-called "chat control". Last year, the BfDI received 10,658 reports of data protection violations and 491 submissions related to the right to information. Citizens contacted the Federal Data Protection Commissioner with 6,619 complaints and inquiries.
When advising the supervised bodies, the BfDI was increasingly able to convince them of data protection-friendly alternatives, for example in the design of cookie banners or the use of data protection-friendly social media from the Fediverse such as Mastodon.
