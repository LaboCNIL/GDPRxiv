The pandemic situation also determined the issues of data protection and freedom of information last year. BfDI Professor Kelber said: But that doesn't mean that the rest of the world hasn't moved on. On the contrary: At the end of the legislative period, the old federal government presented a whole series of extensive laws, for example the IT Security Act or the new telecommunications laws TKG and TTDSG. My authority has also received many draft regulations from the Federal Ministry of Health, almost always with too short a deadline for comments.
In addition to pandemic issues such as questions about querying test, vaccination and convalescence status at work or updates to the Corona warning app, the BfDI has also dealt with the regulation of artificial intelligence and the handling of research data. In addition, the BfDI received 10,106 reports of data protection violations and 622 submissions related to the right to information in the past year. Citizens contacted the Federal Data Protection Commissioner with 6,829 complaints and submissions. The BfDI sees the introduction of cell broadcasting in Germany, which was decided in 2021, as particularly positive. With this technology, authorities can warn quickly and in a data protection-friendly manner in an emergency.
In the activity reports section you will find the current but also all previous activity reports of the BfDI.
