  EDPB calls for implementation of PNR Directive ruling
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has called on EU member states to implement the PNR ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) without delay in order to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. The BfDI, Professor Ulrich Kelber fully supports this demand. According to the judgment of the ECJ, Germany should quickly adapt the passenger data law.

The BfDI said: "In June, the ECJ decided that the directive on so-called passenger name records or PNR data is still valid, but must be interpreted much more restrictively in the future. To the best of my knowledge, nothing has changed in Germany or in many Member States since this landmark judgement. My authority has been pointing out to the legislator for years that there is a considerable need for improvement in the national implementation. That is why my authority played a leading role in the EDPB's joint statement."

The German Air Passenger Data Act does not currently comply with all the requirements of the ECJ. For example, all data is collected from passengers on flights within the EU. In 2021, a total of 73 million passengers were transported in Germany, more than 40 million of them on so-called intra-EU flights, the general inclusion of which the ECJ found fundamentally inadmissible. In addition, passenger data is stored for a period of five years. The processing purposes do not justify these long storage periods. The measures to be taken immediately to protect fundamental rights should also include the processing of passenger data by the responsible bodies, such as the central passenger data office at the Federal Criminal Police Office.
The BfDI's statement on the 2017 Air Passenger Data Act has therefore lost none of its topicality.
