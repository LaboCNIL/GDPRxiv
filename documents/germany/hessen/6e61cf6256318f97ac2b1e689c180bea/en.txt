05/25/2018





Today is propagated in data protection law as a turning point. As of today, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. At the same time, the new Federal Data Protection Act and the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act come into force. The General Data Protection Regulation applies directly in all member states of the European Union and is characterized by efforts to reconcile the protection of fundamental rights in the processing of personal data with the concerns of the data economy. This effort has already characterized the previous German data protection law, which in this respect has a model character for the General Data Protection Regulation. According to Prof. Dr. Ronellenfitsch covered. The new law does contain some tightening of the data protection requirements and sanction options for the data protection supervisory authorities. But if you already behave in the best possible way in accordance with data protection regulations, you have nothing to fear. The rampant scaremongering is unjustified. The protection of personal data from state intervention has not mutated into protecting the economy from data protection officers. Rather, the protection of such data has become a central task of modern statehood in the age of digitization. The data protection supervisory authorities have to take all these aspects into account. The future will show whether the GDPR provides sufficient tools for this.
