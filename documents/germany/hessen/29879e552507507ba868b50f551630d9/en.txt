This was said by the Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Prof. Dr. Michael Ronellenfitsch, on the occasion of the 1st anniversary since the GDPR came into effect.
The birth pangs have passed. Many of the questions that arose at the beginning have now been answered. However, after just one year, no valid statements can be made about the implementation status.
The dissatisfaction with this set of rules expressed in many places is certainly also due to the fact that the GDPR is a work of compromise with which everyone can never be satisfied. The opposite of compromise is postponing problems to the future. However, the European legislator has not postponed the problems, but has initiated the GDPR. It is becoming increasingly evident that the GDPR is a stable factor on which to build.
