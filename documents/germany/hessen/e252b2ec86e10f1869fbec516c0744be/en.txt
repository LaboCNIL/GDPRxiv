The derivation of a data

therefore be assumed to be known that even before the enactment of the Volks-
census judgment the designation and construction of the informational
self-determination had been the subject of controversial discussion in the literature. Whom
is to be attributed to the formation of concepts (cf. Steinmüller, basic questions of the
data protection, report prepared on behalf of the Federal Minister of the
Interior, Bundestag printed paper VI/3826 [1971], p.5 ff.; Christoph Mallmann, data protection in
management and information systems: on the proportionality of
exchange of individual information in the norm-executing administration,
1976), ultimately no longer plays a role. Also the arguments of the time
minority opinions are outdated. The criticism of this opinion, however, is
still up to date. So Otto Mallmann saw the danger that an exaggerated

protection discussion, JZ 1973, 274). This is still claimed to this day.
The Federal Constitutional Court did not allow itself to be drawn into this controversy
but instead initiated informational self-determination independently
from its previous case law on the general right of personality.
By linking Art. 1 Para. 1 GG with Art. 2 Para. 1 GG that became

of the Data Processing Association Act (DV-Verbundgesetz) is used as a replacement
for the respectively required, individually concluded order contracts

other legal instrument i. s.d. Art. 28 Para.3 DS-GVO created, the one
more effective procedure when placing orders.

The Hessian Center for Data Processing (HZD) is in accordance with Section 1 Paragraph 1
DV-Verbundgesetz the central service provider for the Hessian state association
administration. Legally, this service is classified as order processing i. s.d.
Art. 28 GDPR. This means that for every service that
the HZD as a processor for a department as the responsible party
provides, a contract according to Art. 28 Para. 1 DS-GVO would have to be concluded. This
would have required immense administrative effort. That's why after
looking for a way to meet the requirements of the Basic Regulation
fill, but to reduce the administrative effort.
I have therefore proposed to the state government that the DP Association Act
be expanded in such a way that individual contracts are no longer required.
The state government has taken up this suggestion and
proposal for success submitted to Parliament:

Section 1 (2) DV-VerbundG is worded as follows:
"The Hessian Center for Data Processing can be managed by the state government or
the competent state authority in the case of central or other joint
are commissioned to drive, binding for all agencies involved in the operation of the country
of the procedure for automated data processing as a contractor in the sense
of Art. 28 of Regulation (EU) No. 202016/679 of the European Parliament and of
Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal
personal data, the free movement of data and the repeal of Directive 95/46/
EG (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ EU No. L 119 S.1, No. L 314 S. 72, 2018 No. L 127
S. 2) and § 57 of the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act of 3
May 2018 (GVBl. p. 82), amended by law of September 12, 2018 (GVBl. p. 570),
to perform. To fulfill the tasks provided for in this law
and maintains an operating manual tailored to the respective process, from which
the guarantees, rights and
Obligations of a processor arise."

The Hessian state parliament passed the law on December 11th, 2019 in the second reading
decided unchanged.
It will be my job to regularly check whether the HZD
the operating manual to be kept in accordance with this provision,
which would have to be placed on individual contracts is sufficient.

3.1
International Data Transfers - 3rd Annual Privacy Review
shield
In the year under review, one HBDI employee, as a member of the Dele-
gation of European supervisory authorities together with the European
Commission and the US Department of Commerce and other US agencies
the practical implementation of between the European Commission and
conditions negotiated by the US government for a transfer of personal
Son-related data from the EU to the USA under the EU-US privacy
Shield checked.

The two reviews of previous years have already been reported on (cf.
46. TB, clause 4.1 and 47. TB, clause 4.2.1). In the present reporting year, the
Checking back in Washington D.C. instead of. The roughly 40-strong delegation
tion from the US was led by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. The
European delegation was made up of eight representatives of the European
Data protection supervisory authorities and representatives of the European Commission
together.
As with the review last year (47th TB, Section 4.2.1, p. 94 f.)
the test included questions about the practical implementation
of the Privacy Shield. Here the focus was primarily on the process and content of the
(Re)certification process and the mechanisms with which
should be made that the certified company the conditions
also actually fulfill and ensure, for example, that those affected
the rights to which they are entitled under the Privacy Shield
can exercise.
Its report on the third annual Privacy Shield review was published by the
European Data Protection Board (EDPB) at https://edpb.europa.eu/
our-work-tools/our-documents/eu-us-privacy-shield-third-annual-joint-review-
report-12112019_en published. Overall, it was found
that the US Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission
We continue to strive to fulfill the commitments made in the EU-US Privacy Shield
implement.
However, this year's report also identifies areas in which
more work is needed: The biggest criticism remains the concern that oversight
about the certified organizations rather limited to formal aspects
could be and there are not enough substantial controls. Another
A point that still requires closer examination is the transfer

7

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
48th activity report on data protection

Communications from Privacy Shield-certified companies to third parties or in
other third countries. From the EDPB's point of view, it must be ensured here that
that the conditions set out in the Privacy Shield for this purpose are in reality
also be complied with so that the Privacy Shield does not become a loophole
for uncontrolled forwarding of data to non-certified organizations
organizations within the USA or recipients in another third country
can be used without an adequate level of data protection. Finally
should continue to be the area of employee data and recertification
fication process must be kept in mind.
In addition to the practical implementation questions, the question increased again
State access to data that is transferred to the USA under the Privacy Shield
a large room. Here, too, it can be stated
that some conclusions of the European Data Protection Board
from the past year were picked up by the US authorities.
In the meantime, the Office of the Ombudsperson, set up by the EU-US
Privacy Shield was created in the first place. Also is the
Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board now fully staffed again.
The task of this body is to ensure that the US authorities
privacy in their counter-terrorism efforts
and give due consideration to civil liberties.
Overall, it continues to be the case that the field of international data transfers
is fraught with serious uncertainties. As before, there are procedures
pending before the ECJ, the outcome of which will have far-reaching implications for the
Admissibility of data transfers to countries outside the EU will have. In the
first quarter of 2020 is in the case C-311/18 Facebook Ireland and Schrems
(Schrems II) to expect a decision of the ECJ that will influence
international data transfers and the instruments available for this
ments according to Chapter V of the GDPR.

3.2
Europe-wide cooperation with the other European ones
Supervisory authorities under the General Data Protection Regulation
(see also 47th activity report, item 4.2.2)
With the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
as already described in the 47th activity report, numerous innovations for
the cooperation of the supervisory authorities in Germany and Europe
result. Due to the new European legal requirements, in the reporting
period, a significant intensification of cooperation and an increase
to observe the examination effort. Those at the HBDI in the past
The European and International Office that was set up last year acts as a

Link for communication between the HBDI and various
Jobs outside Hesse in Germany, Europe and the world.

Due to the GDPR, the supervisory authorities in cases of cross-border
progressive processing of personal data to a closer
committed to cooperation. Cross-border processing lies
according to Art. 4 No. 23 DS-GVO, if processing within the framework of

The so-called one-stop shop
According to the newly introduced concept of the so-called one-stop shop, a
Supervisory authority (usually the supervisory authority of the so-called head office
of the person responsible or processor, Art. 56 Para. 1 DS-GVO)
as the so-called lead supervisory authority, the only contact person for the
Responsible or processor according to Art. 56 Para. 6 DS-GVO,

not that the lead supervisory authority decides alone. Much more

complaint was filed. The lead supervisory authority and the
The supervisory authorities concerned work together in the cooperation process
and try to reach a consensus (Article 60 (1) GDPR). After
Examination of the case, the lead supervisory authority submits the data subject
supervisory authorities before a draft decision (Art. 60 para. 3 sentence 2 DS-
GMO), against which the supervisory authorities concerned can object if necessary
(Art. 60 Para. 4 DS-GVO). In case of disagreement
the matter will be referred to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
in the consistency procedure according to Art. 63 DS-GVO for a binding decision
submitted.

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
48th activity report on data protection

New forms of cooperation: mutual assistance and joint
Measures
In addition to the general idea of the one-stop shop, the GDPR
with mutual administrative assistance (Art. 61 GDPR) and so-called joint
Measures (Art. 62 DS-GVO) further possibilities of cooperation
before. First experiences have now shown that administrative assistance
request in the course of case processing and for the exchange of information
frequent use is made. For example, the HBDI has 28 in the reporting period
Processing requests for administrative assistance from other European supervisory authorities and
nine requests for administrative assistance to other supervisory authorities.
Overall, the new procedural regulations serve to
progressive data processing as uniform as possible throughout Europe
interpretation and application of the GDPR. In addition, should
communication with the supervisory authorities for both those responsible
and processors as well as for data subjects are simplified.

Example "Binding Corporate Rules"
A clear example of the increased cooperation between supervisory
authorities under the GDPR provides the modified approval procedure
of Binding Corporate Rules (German: binding internal data protection
regulations; in short: BCR). BCR are measures to protect personal
personal data that a group of companies agrees to comply with
or group of companies obliged to collect personal data
within the group of companies in so-called third countries (i.e. countries outside
half of the European Economic Area) to transmit the on and for
do not offer an adequate level of data protection. This way should
a group-wide uniform level of data protection can be established
reflects the high standards of the GDPR.
BCRs are developed in a Europe-wide cooperation process, i. H. from up
checked jointly by the supervisory authorities of several Member States. Here acts
a supervisory authority as lead or so-called BCR lead and coordinate
dines the procedure. One or two more regulators will be
supporting as a so-called co-examiner. In addition, all European
Supervisory authorities in accordance with the consensus set out in Art. 63 GDPR
be included and opportunity for examination and
Receive comment from the BCR.
While under the previous Data Protection Directive still a procedure of
mutual recognition (“Mutual Recognition”) took place, the
EDPB to issue an opinion on the BCR. Only if this is positive

10

Europe, International

fails, an approval can be given by the BCR Lead, which then for
all other regulators are binding. All European regulators
authorities are thus held more accountable and obliged.
The aim of the process innovation is greater standardization of the
BCR, which also means a new and increased examination effort for the
supervisory authorities.
Over 125 BCR approval applications are currently pending. For

4.2
Written form requirement for agreements on
order processing
Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, I have often been
asked whether, according to the new legal situation, the agreement on
processing requires a written form.

Until May 25, 2018 came as an electronic replacement for the § 11 paragraph 2
sentence 2 BDSG a. F. Mandatory for order data processing contracts
Written form only an electronic document in question, which the name of
Declaring contained and with a qualified electronic signature after
§ 2 No. 3 Act on Framework Conditions for Electronic Signatures (SigG)
was provided (§ 126 a BGB).
Whether the GDPR, which has been in force since May 25, 2018, also includes other electronic
Permits forms for agreements on commissioned data processing
cannot be clearly inferred from the wording of Art. 28 (9). the up
data processing agreement or other legal instrument (e.g. a
legally binding declaration of commitment by the processor).
according to this regulation in writing, which can also be done in an electronic
cal format can be done.
The written form requirement of Art. 28 Para. 9 GDPR is not identical to
the written form according to § 126 BGB. Accordingly, it does not have to be as per Section 126 (1).
BGB mandatory a document signed by the exhibitor
to be created. From the functions of the BGB formal requirement, warning function,
Proof function with identity, authenticity and verification function, information
tion function (Palandt/Ellenberger § 125 No. 2 ff) it only pursues the
latter purpose. That the contracting parties are not protected from ill-considered or
must be protected from hasty commitments is obvious, for on-
Contract processing relationships are not entered into spontaneously, but
are the result of negotiation and selection processes. There are too
hardly expected situations in which the content of the order, the identity
of the contracting parties or the authenticity of the agreements can be proven
would have to. This is likely to apply all the more if the Commission and the
supervisory authorities should have developed standard contractual clauses in the future
(Art. 28 Para. 7 and 8 DS-GVO) and the contracting parties as expected in
usually use these. With the one set out in the GDPR
Written form should ensure that those involved have the opportunity
have permanent and reliable information about the content of the order processing
agreement or a unilateral declaration of commitment.

14

cross-section

The text form also fulfills this permanent information function, as
§ 126b BGB (Palandt, loc. cit.).
The exchange of computer faxes or emails with or without PDF attachments
therefore satisfies the written form requirement of Art. 28 Para. 9 GDPR. The
Processors could also place a contract text on their website
set and the person responsible the declaration of acceptance by clicking
of a box (cf. correspondingly for the submission of a
Declaration of consent EC. 32 GDPR). In this case,
shall be that the person responsible saves and prints out the contract
can. The GDPR does not require that a download actually takes place.
On the other hand, the text form according to § 126 b BGB is different, it is for declarations
only preserved on websites if the recipient prints out the declaration
or stored on a data medium. In the opinion of the
BGH (NJW 2010, 3566, 3567 No. 19) in the case of cancellation instructions on a
Website in the necessary text form if the recipient does not see the page
download or print out.
The systematic consideration of the GDPR also supports the view that
that “electronic format” in Art. 28 Para. 9 does not mean a
BGB electronically signed document can be meant. In Art. 30 Para. 3
DS-GVO there is one for keeping the processing directory
verbatim written form regulation. However, there is no reason why
half a list of processing activities with a qualified
electronic signature should be provided. But there aren't any
Evidence that the Union legislature uses the term "electronic for-
mat” in the two regulations with different content.
In the literature, too, the prevailing view is that
electronic format permitted as written form by Art. 28 Para. 9 DS-GVO
does not require a qualified electronic signature under German law,
but in relation to § 126 b BGB even a somewhat larger
faster text form is meant. (J. Hoffmann in A. Roßnagel, Europäische
General Data Protection Regulation, p. 180 (text form), J. Albrecht / F. Jotzo, Das

Design of citizen surveys by public authorities
In the past year, the HBDI has repeatedly contacted public bodies
Advice on the design and implementation of surveys. Here acted
These are diverse topics, ranging from a simple citizen survey to

went to a survey on the experience of violence in public administration.
The following is intended to provide information on the main contents of the consultation.

Description of the surveys as anonymous - midwife survey
In a large number of surveys, the collecting body
said that the survey was "completely anonymous". here
was unfortunately often disregarded, that precisely the interaction
of the collected data very well leads to a personal reference. At-
A planned survey of midwives should be mentioned playfully.
Based on the present questionnaire, it was no longer possible to say that an "ano-
nymen questioning” can be assumed. That's how it was for me based on
four questions possible to identify a specific person. The mentioned
Questions were as follows:
 – Are you a member of a professional association or a specialist society?

(Answer: No or Yes, namely the association to be named)

 – In which district or in which urban district are you mainly

actually active?

 - In which year were you born?
 – Which services that are not remunerated according to § 134a SGB V offer

you at?

The questions were checked using an example and given as an example
answered. The selection was made by a member of the association of freelance midwives
Germany's e. V. (BfHD), which is active in the Schwalm-Eder district and
haft was born in 1960. The association's website gave
ultimately only one person who also offers acupuncture as an additional service
offers. As a result, it was clear that only one person completed the questionnaire
could have filled out accordingly.
Further examples of this kind were conceivable, so that in the entire do-
cuments the concept of anonymity should have been emphasized.
Likewise, the assurance that no conclusions could be drawn was to be withdrawn
individuals are possible. The same applied to the assurance that
the data collection and the measuring instruments used are not suitable

My House believes that the raised
Data may be personally identifiable under certain circumstances, but that by means of
technical/organizational measures remove the personal reference and
no attempt is made to achieve re-identification. The corresponding
Risk must therefore be clearly and transparently identified.
In addition, it should always be considered in such surveys whether individual
Questions with a high re-identification factor can be deleted
or whether these are actually required for later evaluation. The
Necessity must be justified accordingly.
Alternatively, the possibility should always be considered of larger category
to form rias in which the participating respondent can enter. So are
to form birth cohorts and to indicate roughly rastered time periods
instead of an exact year. This reduces the risk of further disclosures
to achieve a re-identification of the participant.
As a result, the responsible body expressed the wish
to continue to call the survey anonymous.
For this purpose, the specific professional association or the specialist society was no longer
shank queried. The question of obtaining the midwifery exam was also raised
roughly gridded. Likewise, the age was now only in categories
queried. The gender question was also removed. Just at
midwives was to be assumed that there was only a very small
number of male midwives.
Also the question about the average distance of the workplace
from place of residence omitted. In the case of another study concerning the safety
sense of well-being among the population, it was also pointed out that it
makes sense to only include districts that also have a certain population
reach number. In this way, the risk of re-identification
also be minimized.

Special constellation in the survey on violence against employees
in public service in the state of Hesse
I finally had a special constellation during a survey, which
dealt with the experience of violence by public servants. At
the original design of the survey, it was mandatory
ensure that the interviewee also names the authority in which he works
is. This was particularly the case with smaller authorities, such as
my own department, poses a risk of re-identification. If here
also a combination of professional function (e.g. head of department)

and profession (e.g. fully qualified lawyer) is queried is almost 100%
assume identifiability. So I tried again with the
responsible body to clarify whether the specification of the specific authority
is actually required.
The addition that your own authority can only be used by a certain employee
is to be named, in my opinion the remaining residual
risk cannot be completely ruled out. Especially the term "very small authority"
is too vague for this. For the participants is ultimately not apparent from
when to speak of very small units, or whether their own place of it
is affected. In addition, re-identification is also used by authorities with more
than 100 employees, provided that they are named.
The responsible body then informed me again that it was for
the evaluations are fundamentally important that the sectors or
able to classify departments as "professional". But that was it in my opinion
the specification of the office is not decisive, but the occupational field. The
The query should therefore generally be: "Please enter the occupational field (roughly)
in which they work." A corresponding change was finally
taken, so that no longer the specific employer, but merely
the occupational field was queried (education, health and care, justice,
administration or other).

Consulting in the context of online surveys
I also often receive requests for advice on surveys in which the data
should be collected online. In this regard, I was also asked whether
appropriate online surveys with the Survey Monkey program
can carry out and whether this program is seen as a means per se
can be used to conduct anonymous surveys
can be.
For this I shared that Survey Monkey is a widely used tool
for relevant surveys. However, surveys with Survey Monkey are
not automatically anonymous. Here you need at least special settings
be made (see also How-do-I-make-surveys-anonymous
at help.surveymonkey.com). There are also server logs (see data
declaration). The statement that Survey Monkey is used and
the fact that no personal data is requested is not sufficient.
Additional measures are required here.
Incidentally, I agree with the corresponding online survey
encountered that the questionnaire was advertised as anonymous, the
At the same time, participants are informed on the last page that

Deletion of incomplete data records in POLAS-Hessen
Insofar as personal data records on criminal offenses in the police

The Hessian police operates on the legal basis of § 20 paragraph 6 of the
Hessian Law on Public Safety and Order (HSOG)

were obtained in connection with the prosecution of criminal offences, for
used to prevent crime.

Section 20 (6) HSOG

other legal provisions do not prevent personal data that you

is about persons who are suspected of having committed a criminal offense are the data
to be deleted as soon as the suspicion ceases.

Specifically, it is the database that is regularly
wise for identity checks, but also for background checks
is queried. If personal data on criminal offenses are stored there
are always related to suspects, accused or convicted
Persons. If data about persons are available there, this is
fundamentally disadvantageous for the person concerned, in particular
especially in connection with background checks. These are
required by law in various areas, for example in connection
menhang with firearms permits, when taking up work in
sensitive areas of public authorities or even with privileged access
to high-risk events.
A special feature of this database is that the data that was

administration or a court, the outcome of the proceedings is determined in accordance with section 482
StPO transmitted to the police and deposited in POLAS-Hessen, as far as they
does not immediately lead to the deletion of the relevant data record.

§ 482 StPO
(1) The public prosecutor informs the police authority that was involved in the matter

(2) In the cases referred to in subsection 1, it shall inform the police authority of the outcome
of the procedure by notifying the decision formula, the decisive body

according to paragraph 2 not communicated ex officio.
(4) If a judgment is sent that has been contested, it must be stated who the legal

Therefore, these records as long as there is no notification of the
outcome of the proceedings is deposited, an exit still subject to reservations
significant. This period of time between the time the data was recorded by the police and
a notification of the outcome of the procedure is therefore data protection law

This can be done by the public prosecutor's finding that the suspicion

How to deal with (anonymous) whistleblowers to the
social administration
Dealing with information from the population to the social administration
opens up a field of tension that does not exist for the official whistleblower

the data protection principle of direct collection from data subjects
as well as the priority of the requirements of social data protection over those of the
social administration procedure.

that information was available according to which there was a further right to benefits

find out who gave the information failed. The social welfare office
referred to the person concerned on informant protection and a higher
res interest of the whistleblower worthy of protection compared to the interests
of the person concerned to a provision of information. He complained about this

or intervention at the social welfare office.

Clarification of the facts
At my request, the social welfare office first took a position on the case.
Thereafter, the person concerned received benefits under the third chapter of the
SGB XII, as indicated by an anonymous letter on April 22, 2019
received by the authority, after which the person concerned on the same day to a
had left for a stay abroad of several months. Because a grant
of benefits after a stay abroad of more than 28 days
§ 41a SGB XII is not permissible, he was then informed by notification

Legal Assessment
In the fifth and tenth social code (SGB V and SGB X) are the
data protection powers of the health insurance companies comprehensively and
finally settled. Accordingly, there is also a legal
basis for the described activities of the health insurance company. Already in 1989
§ 66 was added to SGB V, which allowed health insurance companies to

to support treatment errors.
Even according to the current version of the law, it is part of § 66 SGB V

Through a press inquiry and reports in various media
I notice a service offered by a startup company

(KI) developed a system that allows written communication over the Internet
(e.g. via instant messenger) and was able to recognize content therein,
which can be problematic for children.
Using this technology, the company offered an app-based service

communication partners (e.g. cybergrooming, sexting, etc.).
and informed the legal guardians of the specific danger. The parents
could register with the service for a fee and establish a connection
between the service and an app installed on the child's mobile phone
of a specific, widely used messenger. This became one
interface used by the provider of the messenger for its web
based usage provides. Once this connection was established,
de the child's entire communication conducted via this messenger
transferred to the server of the service provider and analyzed there by the AI.
If the algorithm found evidence that the communication for
the child's welfare could be dangerous, the legal guardians were
advised of this fact and to review the process and
requested support of the child.
Although the purpose of this service is of course welcome and
is worthy of support, its design also entailed considerable risks for
the personal rights of those affected.
The service was particularly problematic from a data protection point of view
by the fact that the entire communication conducted via messenger
automatically forwarded to the service provider and stored by them
and processed. This necessarily affected not only the municipalities

When designing the accompanying data protection processes
Those responsible always take other framework conditions into account,
e.g. B. deadlines to be met or available mechanisms for determining the
Identity of data subjects. The two examples above represent two
opposite extremes in terms of the level of automation for
the implementation of accompanying data protection processes. In practice
the actual implementations are likely to move in between.
This is also the case in the case I examined. Like many other responsible people
the person responsible already had significant parts of his IT landscape in mind
the entry into force of the GDPR in use. From this it followed that the concrete
ten requirements from the area of the rights of data subjects

and the associated IT systems could not yet be taken into account.
Accordingly, the data protection regulations listed above were
sliding processes largely of a manual nature and by means of organizational ones
measures implemented. This resulted in, in addition to the comparatively
high effort for the manual implementation of the processes, including challenges
demands related to compliance with the relevant deadlines.

The influence of technology design
Art. 25 GDPR requires data protection through technology design and
through data protection-friendly default settings. In Art. 25 Para. 1 GDPR
it is specified that the person responsible both at the time of the
Determination as well as appropriate technical at the time of processing

In principle, the GDPR does not require those responsible to ensure compliance

done in the right direction. The Article 29 group had, as in the 46th

established a permanent task force, the Task Force Fining. to theirs
Main tasks include the harmonization of the calculation of fines
(https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=610112).
The task force has been dealing with since its first meeting in December 2017
the harmonization of the sometimes very different practices in
the member states and discuss how to proceed.
A common Europe-wide framework for setting fines
there is no such thing as yet. Rather, the Member States have individually for
the transition period developed national approaches. So did the Netherlands
in Official Gazette No. 14586 of March 14, 2019 guidelines of the authority for personal
Sun-related data from February 19, 2019 to determine the amount of
Fines (Personal Data Authority Fines Guidelines
2019) published. In Germany, the DSK has dealt with the question of
monization of the assessment of fines at national level and a
first concept for setting fines for violations of the GDPR
based on the models from national antitrust law and
Securities and stock law drafted. The fine concept of the DSK was
under TOP 16 topic at the 2nd interim conference in June 2019 (protocol:
https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/pr/20190622_pr_mainz.

for the assessment of fines and asked the AK sanctions, the
concept taking into account the practical experiences made with it
independent federal and state data protection supervisory authorities
to be further developed (16 in favor, 1 abstention, 0 against).
At the 3rd interim conference of the DSK on September 12th, 2019 in Mainz

The DSK felt compelled to review the concept for the assessment of fines

Fines are assessed in proceedings against companies in five

DSK resolution on attribution
The fine concept of the DSK took an important step towards harmonization
subject to the fine according to DS-GVO. At the 97th Conference of Independents
Federal and state data protection supervisory authorities on April 3, 2019
the DSK passed the resolution "Companies are liable for data protection
shocks from their employees!” (see also Appendix I 1.1).
The background was that the old national liability rules had not yet been
have been adjusted to conform with the new legal situation. § 41 para. 1 of the
new Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) refers to attribution
restrictive regulations in the OWiG. The national law with the underlying

also traditions. Under Art. 83 GDPR, companies are liable for

It remains to be seen to what extent the agreements from the coalition

of German corporate sanctions law would then also correspond to this
European antitrust law and the established international standard.

In view of the fact that a discharge report and thus health

have become and that between the knowledge of the incident and
a week had elapsed since the notification was given, the reasoning was higher

Recommendation
In order to avoid late reports according to Art. 33 Para. 1 DS-GVO,
I recommend all responsible bodies to set up a procedure internally in writing

In particular, the instructions should provide information about:
 - which people and departments when and how in corresponding

cases are to be involved (e.g. also the IT department),

 – such as the substitution rules in the absence of individuals

 – how the reporting processes are to be carried out in detail.
It is important here that a corresponding document is not “dead” paper

needs to be revised/adjusted. The employee on a Friday

The hope that the wave of complaints and requests for advice

Had the total number of receipts to be processed increased in 2018 after the

Data protection requirements for artificial intelligence
For the development and use of AI systems in which personal

With the Online Access Act, the federal government has an extensive
Digitization program started for administration in Germany.
The federal and state governments are obliged to improve their administrative services in the future
electronically via administrative portals. There should be user accounts

available electronic administrative services from the federal and state governments
can be identified uniformly.
In this context, the National Regulatory Control Council (NKR)
spoke out in favor of modernizing the German register landscape
and recommended that certain basic data from citizens and businesses
only have to be notified once ("once only" principle). The NKR has
also encouraged to use data protection-compliant identification numbers for
Individuals, companies as well as buildings, apartments and parcels of land

Citizens can keep an eye on all government data flows.
The introduction of such identification numbers for people is becoming topical

first plenary session according to its task in Art. 70 para. 1 lit.
k) DS-GVO the guidelines for the application and determination of fines
within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Article 29 Working Party
from 03.10.2017 (WP 253) confirmed. This particular place the uniform
Interpretation of the provisions of Art. 83 DS-GVO and outline
uniform concept for the principles of setting monetary
atone However, the guidelines are not exhaustive and the specification
the determination methodology is reserved for later EDPB guidelines.
The concept relates to the assessment of fines in proceedings against companies
within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It
does not apply in particular to fines against clubs or
natural persons outside their economic activity. The concept
is neither for cross-border cases nor for other data protection
binding on EU regulators. Furthermore, it develops no bond
seen in the setting of fines by courts.
The independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments
may at any time revoke, change or expand their concept

with significant maximum fines, while addressing a variety
companies of different sizes, the turnover of a company
a suitable, appropriate and fair connection to ensure the
effectiveness, proportionality and deterrence.
Against this background, fines are assessed in proceedings against
Business in five steps. First, the company concerned
assigned to a size class (1.), after which the mean annual
rate of the respective subgroup of the size category (2.), then a
basic economic value determined (3.), this basic value by means of a
factor dependent on the severity of the circumstances of the crime multiplied (4.) and
finally the value determined under 4. based on perpetrator-related and other
adjusted for circumstances that have not yet been taken into account (5.).
This procedure guarantees a comprehensible, transparent and individual
case-based form of fine assessment.

1. Categorization of companies according to size classes
Based on its size, the affected company is assigned one of four
assigned to exterior classes (A to D) (Table 1).
The size classes are based on the total advance achieved worldwide
Annual turnover of the company (cf. Art. 83 Para. 4 to 6 DS-GVO) and are
divided into micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
as well as large companies. It applies according to recital 150 of the
DS-GVO the term "company" within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU
(so-called functional company concept).
The size classification of the SMEs is based on the previous year's
principle based on the Commission's recommendation of May 6, 2003
(2003/361/EC).
The size classes are used to more concretely classify the companies
divided again into subgroups (A.I to A.III, B.I to B.III, C.I to C.VII,
D.I to D.VII).

decisions of the ECJ on dynamic IP addresses and the judgment of the
BGH of May 16, 2017 on the required directive-compliant interpretation of the

requires according to the BGH that § 15 Abs. 1 TMG to that effect
is to be interpreted that "a provider of online media services

In addition, it should be noted that §§ 12 and 15 TMG are not implemented
of Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy Directive, but rather an implementation
of Art. 7 Data Protection Directive 95/46/EG (GDPR). According to Art. 94

The collision rule of Art. 95 GDPR also refers to

As a result, it can be stated that Art. 95 DSGVO for § 12 and § 15

Unlike the federal government, the BGH takes in its order for reference
of October 5, 201714 with regard to the implementation of Art. 5 Para. 3

against the background that Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy-RL also the storage

Implementation of Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy Directive is therefore a dispute

not the case since May 25, 2018. The contradiction solution does not fulfill
the requirements for consent in accordance with Art. 7 GDPR.

Since Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy Directive has not been implemented in Germany and

for telemedia service providers in Germany no sector-specific

For the assessment of admissibility, however, the sole decisive factor is whether a
certain processing activity is carried out lawfully and the

a) Article 6(1)(a) GDPR – Consent
Art. 4 No. 11 and Art. 7 GDPR require a self-determined and informed
Consent of the persons concerned in the respective data processing.
This presupposes that any data processing is transparent and
have to be enforceable. Especially if at
data collected from the data subject by the respective service provider
(incl. integrated services) merged across websites and
are evaluated, it must be taken into account that the persons concerned
for an effective consent in advance about any form of the carried out
ten data processing and all recipients are informed in detail
and must be given the opportunity in the individual forms of
to specifically consent to data processing. In cases where there are several
(joint) controllers want to base on the requested consent
or in which the data is transmitted to or by other responsible parties
are to be processed by other controllers, these organizations must

organizations are adequately described. In these cases must
all actors involved check whether an effective consent for their
activities and whether these can be proven by you
(Article 5 (2) GDPR).21 Processing of personal data without
sufficient knowledge of the persons concerned
 – about the respective data processing operations,
 – about the third parties involved as well as
 – without the possibility of separate consent
leads to the ineffectiveness of the consent and therefore takes place without legal reason.
It is essential to provide data subjects with information
provide functions to obtain effective consent from them
to be able to Only in this way is it possible for data subjects to make decisions in
knowledge of the specific situation and the scope of consent
to understand.
Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR further requires an “un-
Misleading declaration of intent in the form of a declaration"
or any other unequivocal confirmatory action with which the
data subject indicates that they consent to the processing of them
relevant personal data expressly agrees.
This can be done, for example, by ticking a box when visiting

Opt-out procedures are not sufficient for this. In this respect, recital
32 GDPR explicitly states that implied behavior such as "silent

do not represent consent.

Note: "Cookie Banner" & "Consent Tools"
Through an upstream query when you first visit a website or
a web app can e.g. effective consent for consent-requiring

Art. 11 para. 1 GDPR does not require users to do this directly

This test structure is intended to verify the requirements of Art. 6
Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR facilitate and is based both on the legal
opinion of the ECJ as well as the opinion of the European
inspection authorities.

1st stage:
Existence of a legitimate interest of the person responsible or a
third party
Providers of telemedia services can use a large number of legitimate
have food.26 The GDPR defines the concept of “legitimate interest”
not and only gives isolated examples of a legitimate interest. The
legitimate interest is closely related to the processing purpose
and can be of an economic, non-material or legal nature. The concept of
"legitimate interest" can be considered the main motive for the processing
be understood and reflects the benefit that the person responsible for
want to withdraw from processing.
This includes, for example, the provision of the service in a form that
enables a user-friendly perception of the online offer.
In recital 47, the GDPR also expressly states the prohibition
fraud prevention and direct marketing as possible legitimate interests.
Legitimate means that the interest is in accordance with the law.
This means that in any case illegal or discriminatory motives
under no circumstances can justify a legitimate interest.
Other interests held by telemedia service providers for processing
of usage data include:

26 p. in detail example WP 217.

214

 – Provision of special functionalities, e.g. B. the shopping cart function

using a so-called session identifier

 – Free design of the website, also with efficiency and cost savings
security considerations, e.g. B. Embedding content hosted on other servers
be hosted, use Content Delivery Networks (CDN), Web
Fonts, map services, social plugins, etc.

 – Integrity and security of the website (IT security measures are e.g.
the storage of log files and in particular IP addresses for one
longer period in order to be able to recognize and ward off abuse)

 – Reach measurement and statistical analysis
 – Optimization of the respective web offer and personalization/individual

of the offer tailored to the respective user

 – Recognition and attribute assignment of users, e.g. e.g.

funded offers

 – Fraud prevention, repelling requests that overload the service

(denial of service attacks) and bot usage

A notice:
The examples given can be a legitimate interest on the first level
justify. For the admissibility of data processing for these purposes
but it depends on the necessity and the balancing of interests.

2nd stage:
Necessity of data processing to protect the legitimate
Interests
The mere existence of a legitimate interest is not sufficient to
to legitimize data processing. It is imperative that the respective data
processing is necessary to safeguard this interest. necessity
means that the processing is suitable for the interest (motive/benefit of the
processing) of the person responsible, with no milder, equal
effective means are available. That means the responsible
limit the processing to what is necessary.

Example:
The person responsible runs a website and would like to know how
Online offer is accepted and whether improvements may be made
required are. To do this, he would like to know how many users the website is in
a certain period of time, which devices the users use

215

48th activity report on data protection

and what language settings they have. The person responsible requires
this information in order to optimize its website and the presentation
adapt to the end devices.
The measurement of reach and the resulting information
are suitable for adapting the website (legitimate interest).
If the website operator uses an analysis tool for this, which data

social networks or external analytics services that collect usage data about the

can also be achieved with milder, equally suitable means that clearly
collect less personal data and do not transfer this to third parties
media (e.g. without the involvement of third parties via a local implementation of a
analysis software).

3rd stage:
Weighing against the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the
data subject in a specific individual case
The legitimate interests of the person responsible are the interests as well as
fundamental rights and freedoms of users.
This not only includes the right to protection of personal data
according to Art. 8 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (GRCh) or
the right to confidentiality of communication according to Art. 7 GRCh, otherwise
but also the freedom of expression and the interest in one
free information gathering, Art. 11 GRCh. Also other freedoms and
Interests of the persons concerned must be taken into account, for example
the interest in not suffering any economic disadvantages (e.g. in the case of personal
nalized pricing).
The right to confidentiality of communication protects against the use
Creation of unique identifiers, such as e.g. B. IMEI number, IMSI number,
MAC address or Ad-IDs (device-specific advertising numbers). There-
In addition to being protected, the (device) integrity is also protected. Will e.g. B. identifier

is at the core of the balancing of interests.

216

The identified conflicting interests are to be weighted.
No general rule can be established for this. responsible
can, however, be guided by the following principles:
 – A specific, constitutionally recognized interest, e.g. B. Right
on the protection of personal data in accordance with Art. 8 GRCh, has a higher priority
weight, as an interest that only simple law in the legal order
tion is recognized.27

 – An interest is more important if it not only serves the person responsible,
but at the same time also to the general public, e.g. B. in research activities
s whose findings are to be used for preventive medicine.
It should be noted that within the scope of the consideration, existing
Obligations from the GDPR, e.g. B. Information requirements or the security of
Processing by pseudonymization, not in favor of the person responsible

It is relevant whether the users can be determined via their online identifiers or

can also be done by separating (recital 26 p.3).
In order to apply Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f) GDPR in individual cases, i.a. the
Recitals of the GDPR can be used in support. Out of
they result in particular from the following criteria, which apply in individual cases
The following are to be used in the context of the balancing of interests:
a. Reasonable expectation of data subjects and foreseeability

b. Possibilities of intervention for the persons concerned
c. concatenation of data
i.e. Actors involved

Provision of individual usage profiles for the purpose of range

to be rated low with the result that the weighing of interests in favor

b) Options for intervention by the persons concerned
As part of the balancing of interests - possibly also as a compensation measure -
take into account, in which form the data subjects
have opportunities and be informed about the personal

In doing so, e.g. B. the form of the identifier with which devices or users

to restrict. In the browser settings, for example, users can
delete cookies. With device fingerprinting, on the other hand, it is practical
impossible to prevent a (re-) recognition by the user.
In addition, the data subjects can, via Art. 21 GDPR
Additional - non-mandatory - rights of objection are granted
become. Art. 21 GDPR provides that the data subject

the person responsible, on the other hand, grants the user from the outset a
unconditional right of objection, this can contribute significantly to
that the balancing of interests is in favor of the person responsible.

Example – range measurement:
The website operator integrates a range measurement tool. The user

If personal data is processed in order to operate direct advertising,
However, there is anyway a right of objection without conditions, too
for profiling in connection with direct advertising (Article 21 (2) GDPR). In
In these cases, granting the right to object does not affect the
balancing of interests. From Art. 25 Para. 2 GDPR and the recital

also be complied with. A technical bypass of the desired
Preferences, such as the use of Deadline Party cookies
due to blocked third-party cookies, is not permitted.

c) concatenation of data
It is necessary to consider the possibilities of linking, duplication
of data records (e.g. due to a higher number of data processing
actors) and enrichment of data sets, in particular purpose-independent
pending, exist and what the resulting risks are for the persons concerned
develop.
It can also play a role in the context of data concatenation

Linking usage data and content data (e.g. from customer accounts)

Bring sites and devices together.
In addition, these procedures must be designed technically and organizationally in such a way that
a personal reference is removed as soon as possible and usage profiles - if
at all – are created under pseudonyms. However, this turns out to be the case
usually already from the requirements of Art. 5 DSGVO and its
technical and organizational implementation according to Art. 25 GDPR, in particular
special Art. 25 Para. 2 GDPR (privacy by default).
These requirements, like the fulfillment of the transparency requirements
12 et seq. GDPR, so that these

are eligible. In addition, the requirements

d) Actors involved
The more controllers, processors and other recipients in the
processing activities are involved, the greater the impairment
for the person concerned. This is due to the fact that, on the one hand, due to the increasing

On the other hand, the person responsible has regular opportunities to intervene

phase could e.g. B. also lead to compensation in other areas.
For example, the scope of information collected about the user falls within the
Balancing interests is less important the shorter the users are separated
and can be recognized.

f) data categories
The evaluation must take into account which data categories are collected
and the level of detail in which information is recorded (e.g. pro-
logging of which files were accessed, typing history recording
tion, recording of the scrolling, collection of texts from started
forms, even if they are not sent, search queries
Etc.). The processing of pseudonymous data is generally less
distressing, since the identity of the person concerned is veiled and thus
the probability is lower that the data subject by third parties
is identified. Therefore, in the context of the weighing of interests, it is also
take into account whether the data subject is directly or indirectly identifiable.
It also plays a role whether and in what form usage profiles are created
are collected, in particular what amount of usage data
adds and whether additional interests and characteristics are subsequently assigned
be used to locate the user in a specific target group and
finally to address specific target groups (profiling e.g. for purposes
advertising or personalized information). This form of profiling
takes place largely across services and devices and can thus become one
comprehensive, profound and long-lasting invasion of privacy
of the user. Extensive processing creates risks
for the rights and freedoms of users resulting in a physical, material
material or immaterial damage. For example, the
user profiles created for discrimination, identity theft,
financial loss, damage to reputation or other significant
lead to economic or social disadvantages. This risk is

forecasts is regularly classified as a high risk.

g) Scope of data processing
The scope of the data processing must also be taken into account. This
results from Art. 24, 25, 32 and 35 GDPR. The larger the amount of
processed data, the higher the risk for rights and freedoms
the person concerned. The more data processed, the greater
the risk that through the accumulation of large amounts of data more information

How biometric recognition works
2.2.1
general description
Biometric recognition methods are always part of a larger one
biometric system. With the biometric recognition is to be determined
whether a presence compared to a biometric detection system
animal biometric characteristic with a known biometric
reference matches. Examples of biometric systems are in chapter
5 shown. It can be determined whether a person is known
i.e. H. whether biometric data are available from her, or whether even more extensive ones
Data such as name, address, etc. are known. Depending on the result of
Testing is then continued in the system.
Three phases can be distinguished in biometric recognition:
In the initial phase, the biometric characteristics are determined for the first time
recorded, features calculated and references saved. in case of a
Enrollments, this biometric data is linked to other data.
The actual (re)recognition takes place within the framework of the biometric
system takes place if, after re-entering the biometric characteristics
tika the characteristics are calculated and compared with the existing ones
Reference data is used to determine whether the person is known.
The final phase is deleting the biometric feature and
the associated data.

as well as characteristics are calculated, which in the case of an enrollment by further
Data is supplemented and then stored in a reference database.
In this phase, a recording device (cf
Section 3) a biometric characteristic belonging to a person
cum presented. From this, a sample or template is generated and
in a decentralized database, for example the access control system

the biometric data is stored on a data medium (chip card).
that is in the possession of the data subject. In addition to
In addition to the biometric data, information about the person is also stored.
In the case of travel documents, an image of the fingerprint is created as a sample
and this image is stored (signed) on a chip of the document.
There are also developments, templates in addition to a pure access
control in such a way that they can only be used in a specific system
can be used (biometric template protection).
The amount of personal data stored may vary
differ significantly by application; see the
different scenarios from Chapter 5.
There may be errors in enrollment known as FTE (Failure to Enrol Rate)
be referred to; for example, there is the biometric feature
"Fingerprint" Persons whose fingerprints are not sufficiently pronounced
are and therefore cannot be recorded.
Regardless of these very technical aspects, it is also relevant whether the
Collection of the data without the knowledge of the data subject (such as when searching
according to criminals of whom only one biometric feature is known),
with knowledge (as with a reference to the use of video technology) or
through a conscious presentation of the person concerned (as with access control
systems) takes place.

2.2.3
Match Check
After the recording, i.e. usually the enrollment, the refer-
benchmarks available. If within the framework of the biometric system
a biometric characteristic is presented to a recording device,
the characteristics are generated from this. These are associated with the characteristics
compared, resulting from the data of the reference database or from the

presented chip card. The result of the comparison is in the form
a percentage spent.
A threshold value must therefore be specified when configuring the process
must have been established from which a match between the references
and the value just calculated is accepted. As a result of this system
technical blurring, there are cases where there is a match
is accepted although it was not available (FAR: False Acceptance Rate),
and there are cases when a person was not recognized (FRR: False
rejection rate). Depending on the application, the threshold value must
are set and this results in FAR and FRR. For example, will
one with an access control system to a high-security wing
want to prevent unauthorized access with high probability, why
the threshold is set high. This reduces the FAR. At the same time increases
the FRR, i. H. there will be more cases in which an actually legitimate
person is prevented from entering.
Depending on the biometric characteristic used, the cooperation

The fingerprint can often even be added later in places where
the person concerned has stopped, taken and opposite
procedures are presented.

2.2.4
resistance to adulteration
Another area to consider is circumventing the procedure.
These can be concealers of an identity or non-authentic persons,
i.e. H. Individuals presenting fake biometric characteristics.
Keywords here are live detection and non-falsification. Straight
biometric procedures in which the cooperation of the data subject for

Systems for capturing biometric characteristics
A large number of technical systems already exist in which
NEN biometric characteristics a central part of the processing
are. Biometric systems, the purpose of which is the biometric recognition of
Individuals through biometric characteristics, can be based on the
systematize the following criteria:
 – Which specific biometric characteristics are used in the respective
cell system is used (biological characteristics, see Chapter 3.1,
and behavioral characteristics as well as medical data as
specific subset of biological characteristics)?

 – With the help of which sensors that are part of a biometric detection system
councils, the biometric characteristics are recorded (optical,
acoustic or other sensors, see chapter 4)?

 – For what purpose is the processing of biometric characters

carried out?

It can be assumed that the number of these systems and the inte-
integration of the systems into complex applications over the next few years
will gain significantly in importance since
 – the users are willing to use these systems (e.g. use of
Wearables for activity tracking, smartphone unlocking by
fingerprint or face recognition),

 – the integration of sensors into digital infrastructures is increasing (e.g.
Contact lenses that can measure and transmit blood sugar values) and
 – innovative, new business models are being developed, the biological

A distinction is made between the following characteristics of the fingerprint: basic

Based on these characteristics and their distribution within a finger
impression, a unique distinguishability can be guaranteed.
A special algorithm is used to extract the minutiae,

Short Paper No. 20
Consent according to the GDPR
This short paper by the independent federal data protection authorities and
of the countries (Data Protection Conference – DSK) serves as a guide, in particular
others for the non-public area, as in the opinion of the DSK
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applied in practice
should be. This view serves as a summary or supplement
the Guidelines on Consent of the European Data Protection Board
(WP 259 rev.01 “Guidance on Consent under Regulation
2016/679").

Prerequisites and differences to the until May 24, 2018
applicable law
Even under the GDPR, consent is a key legal
basis for the processing of personal data. General Rules
ments to this can no longer be subject to the Federal Data Protection Act
(BDSG), but directly from the GDPR (Art. 4 No. 11, Art. 7).
A consent is only effective if it is voluntary and related
in a specific case – is given in an informed manner. The writing is
not mandatory; rather, an unequivocally given
Bene expression of will in the form of a declaration or other clear
confirmatory act by which the data subject gives their consent
granted unequivocally for data processing. The confirming act
If these requirements are met, it can also be done electronically, by "clicking
cken” of a field on the Internet, or also verbally. At the election
the appropriate form, it should be noted that the person responsible for the issuance
must be able to prove consent (see below).
From Recital (Recital) 32 of the GDPR it can be seen that
Silence, already ticked boxes or inaction of those concerned
person does not constitute consent. This is also not the case in my opinion
of the European Data Protection Board for easy continued use
of a service. For the granting of consent is rather an active
behavior of the persons concerned required. Different than before
issued case law (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of July 16, 2008, VIII ZR 348/06; Federal Court of Justice,

A cross was not set to deny consent.

(see recital 42). This is not usually the case, for example, if
the fulfillment of a contract from consent to data processing
is made dependent, which is not necessary for the fulfillment of the contract
(Art. 7 para. 4 in conjunction with recital 43 GDPR, so-called ban on coupling).
In addition, consent does not regularly provide a valid legal basis,
if there is a clear agreement between the data subject and the controller
imbalance and it is therefore unlikely that the
consent was given voluntarily. This also results from Recital Gr. 43
Consent must be given in an informed manner. In recital 42 of the DS

how to grant.

Survival of Consents
Consents granted before the GDPR came into effect are effective according to recital
171 of the GDPR, insofar as they are of the type according to the conditions of the GDPR
are equivalent to. This includes the following points in particular:
 - The granting of an effective consent must, according to Art. 7 Para. 1
DS-GVO can be proven, which is a corresponding do-
documentation required.

 - The consent must have been given voluntarily (Art. 4 No. 11 DS-
GMO), whereby the special requirements according to Art. 7 Para. 4 DSGVO
i. V. m. ErwGr. 43 DS-GVO must be observed.

 – A declaration of intent is required for the specific case, in
in an organized manner and in an unambiguous form (Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR),
whereby the requirements according to Art. 7 Para. 2 DSGVO i. V. m. ErwGr. 32
and 42 GDPR must be observed.

 – The person responsible must have mechanisms in place that allow the revocation

If the above conditions are not met, previously granted consent

Freedom of information in Hessian municipalities and ministries

2. Freedom of information for Hessian municipalities and

ministries

Freedom of information in Hessian municipalities and ministries
Freedom of information is developing well in Hesse. This is shown, for example
at the municipal level, but the same also applies to the ministerial level
Area.

municipal level
In the case of complaints received here that were directed against municipalities,
was positively noticed that - unlike in the first months after the start of validity
of the Hessian Freedom of Information Act, i.e. the fourth part of the
HDSIG (sections 80 et seq. of which regulate freedom of information) – the municipalities,
for the lack of a corresponding resolution in the articles of incorporation
freedom of action does not apply, the rejection of the request for information correctly
substantiate the reference to Section 81 Paragraph 1 No. 7 HDSIG instead of, as is often the case, at the beginning
of the Hessian freedom of information in May 2018 not at all on the
to respond to requests for information.

this is known to me. For the relevant municipalities there is a case
of a statute resolution introducing freedom of information no this
relevant reporting obligation to the Ministry of the Interior or my authority. In
usually, the introduction is known via media or may particular
be researched on the internet.

Darmstadt case – scope of the statutory reservation
The statutory municipal statute reservation for the validity
of the freedom of information (§ 81 Abs. 1 Nr. 7 HDSIG) supports the
municipal self-government guarantee, but the reservation applies

307

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
2. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

not only on self-government tasks of the municipalities, but also on
Instruction tasks and order matters.
A citizen requested information from the city of Darmstadt about the number of
Traffic offenses reported by private individuals and about the
Number of violations punished as a result for the years 2017 and 2018. The
The City of Darmstadt rejected the application, citing as justification that
that they do not affect the applicability of the Hessian freedom of information law
determinative statutes within the meaning of Section 81 (1) No. 7 HDSIG
and therefore no access to information was given.
The person concerned then turned to me and submitted that the
reserves within the meaning of Section 81 (1) No. 7 HDSIG only refers to municipal
nal self-government tasks, but it does not affect the constellation as
here, namely if the mayor does not have a municipal self-government
performance task, but in the context of traffic monitoring
instead, tasks to fulfill instructions/order matters
have to do.

Legal Assessment
It is true that the Hessian municipal law between self-
administrative tasks and those to fulfill according to instructions and instructions
carrying matters differs. The legal influence
of the state to the municipalities are in the case of self-government to the
Legal supervision is limited, while in the case of instructions and orders
technical supervision possibilities exist, viz
in the form of general instructions and instructions for individual cases (§§ 4,
135 Hessian Municipal Code (HGO)).
For the freedom of information issue of access to official companies
In Hesse, however, it is irrelevant which municipal branch of responsibility
is affected. Because the wording of § 81 Para. 1 No. 7 HDSIG refers
clearly to municipal bodies as such and precisely not differentiated
according to which task division it is.
It is not only the wording of the regulation that does not see any task-related differences
cation, but also the justification of the draft law does not give any
Reason to take part in the position-related regulatory character of § 81 Para. 1 No.
7 HDSIG (cf. Landtagdrucks. 19/5728 p. 150 to § 81).
Therefore, the mayor and mayor are also subject to the
Regulation of § 81 Para. 1 No. 7 HDSIG if - for example within the framework of the
local traffic surveillance - tasks of the local regulatory authorities

308

Freedom of information in Hessian municipalities and ministries

and district regulatory authorities as a matter of commission (§ 4
Paragraph 2 sentence. 1 HGO).
Something else only applies if originally municipal organs
lich exceptionally assigned to the state administration, in this
context then not act as a municipal body and to that extent also
no longer subject to Section 81 Paragraph 1 No. 7 HDSIG relating to municipal authorities
fall under. An example can be found in the area of municipal supervision, if
the district administrator belonging to the municipal level specifically in his function
as a municipal supervisory authority over the municipalities here as a country
of the authority is legally qualified (§ 136 Para. 3 HGO).

§ 136 HGO
...
(3) The supervisory authority for the other municipalities is the district administrator as the authority of the state
administration.

This organizational legal assignment of the municipal administrative
organs district administrator for state administration in the context of municipal supervision
but is not made by law, insofar as it is in the area of
Traffic surveillance to prevent regulatory activities on the ground
position of the Hessian law on public safety and order
goes (HSOG) goes. This follows from Section 85 HSOG, to which the
had informed complaining citizens about the refusal to provide information.

§ 85 HSOG
(1) General regulatory authorities are...
3. the district administrators in the districts and the mayors in urban districts as

District regulatory authorities…

I have therefore informed the complainant that his
view, in matters of instructions and orders is the reservation of the articles of incorporation
of § 81 Para. 1 No. 7 HDSIG not affected because the regulatory administration

pointed out that such a procedure is not permissible, but the
Information is required from the body that has the requested information.
This is already clear from the information request
Regulation § 85 HDSIG.

§ 85 HDSIG
(1) Access to information will be granted upon application to the body that has the requested information
regulations (body subject to the obligation to provide information), granted.

Conversely, to be separated from this is the aspect that in the case of exclusion
of access to information to certain bodies of this exclusion
cannot be frustrated by the fact that information from these bodies is still available
are also available from other bodies, Section 81 (3) HDSIG.

§ 81 HDSIG
(3) Insofar as access to information is excluded according to paragraph 1 or 2, this also applies to

Administrative offenses Frankfurt Airport

3. Administrative offenses at Frankfurt Airport (delayed

landings)

Administrative offenses Frankfurt Airport
In relation to authorities that are responsible for fines, there is in this respect
no right to access information.

A citizen requested access from the Darmstadt Regional Council regarding
fend documents of completed administrative offense proceedings
delayed landings at Frankfurt Airport. The responsible government
Presidium Darmstadt rejected this because the HDSIG was
offenses law (OWiG) and is therefore not applicable
may be. This led to a complaint to my authority.

Evaluation
The Darmstadt Regional Council is to be agreed insofar as that
Hessian freedom of information law is then not applicable, insofar as Aus-
future claims are regulated by special law. This subordination of
Hessian freedom of information law (the fourth part of the HDSIG, viz
the §§ 80 ff.) against special information claims is also in the HDSIG
expressly standardized, Section 80 (2) HDSIG.

§ 80 HDSIG
(2) Insofar as special legal provisions regulate the provision of information, they go to the
provisions of Part Four.

However, the Administrative Offenses Act does not contain any provisions on the
Information regarding completed procedures. In addition, the HDSIG
with a view to two provisions, it is clear that regulatory
adversarial proceedings as a subject matter of the regulation. On the one hand, this should be done
the right of access to information cannot be effected by the expiration of

"Protection of special public interests" is u. a. the administrative offense
data protection against specific disadvantages of access to information,
§ 82 No. 2. d) HDSIG.

2. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

§ 82 HDSIG
There is no access to information...
2. for information, the disclosure of which could have adverse effects on ...
d) the success of ... administrative offense or disciplinary proceedings ...

In the case of completed administrative offense proceedings, this success can
but no longer affected.
In addition to this factual regulation, there are other, namely
regulations that these bodies are responsible for implementing
of administrative offense proceedings and are therefore responsible for fines,
exempt from access to information, namely § 81 Para. 1 No. 4 HDSIG
Reference to Section 40 (2) i. V. m.
Section 40 (1) HDSIG. And this exclusion also applies to authorities
which are not police authorities per se, but function as administrative offense
authority to become active (cf. on administrative offense proceedings also
Justification of the draft law, Drucks. 19/5728, p. 136 to § 40).

§ 81 HDSIG
(1) In accordance with Article 2, Paragraphs 1 to 3, the provisions on the access to information
go for too

4. the courts, criminal prosecution and enforcement authorities and others in Section 40

The Law on the Protection of Trade Secrets

4. The Law on the Protection of Trade Secrets
The Law on the Protection of Trade Secrets
The law on the protection of trade secrets allows the information
freedom untouched. However, it defines the term "trade secret"
which is also important for access to information.

At the federal level is the Trade Secrets Protection Act
(GeschGehG) came into force on April 18, 2019. It also contains regulations
relating to freedom of information:
On the one hand, the stipulation made in Section 1 (3) No. 2. GeschGehG is important.
tion to the scope of the law, according to which freedom of information
remains untouched.

§ 1 GeschGehG

(3) The following remain unaffected: ...
2. Exercising the right to freedom of expression and information
according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (OJ C 202 of 07/06/2016,
p. 389), including respect for freedom and pluralism of the media, …

In addition to this provision, the regulations in § 4 GeschGehG,
of the prohibition to act, and the exceptions standardized in § 5 GeschGehG
men of the prohibitions on action of importance. This clarifies that
legitimate requests for freedom of information are not covered by the prohibitions on action
of § 4 GeschGehG are recorded.

§ 5 GeschGehG
Obtaining, using or disclosing a trade secret does not fall
under the prohibitions of § 4 if this is done to protect a legitimate interest,

1.

to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information,
including respect for media freedom and pluralism…

The law on the protection of trade secrets is now decisive,
as far as the freedom of information right to the legal concept of business
mystery. So it is regulated in § 82 No. 4 HDSIG that a claim
access to information does not exist for the personal area of life
related secrets or trade or business secrets,
unless the data subject has consented.

315

2. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

§ 82 HDSIG

Trade secrets, unless the data subject has consented.

What is to be considered a trade secret (the term trade secret is
merged into the concept of trade secrets), now regulates § 2 GeschGehG.

§ 2 GeschGehG
For the purposes of this law
1. trade secret a piece of information
a) neither in total nor in the exact arrangement and composition of their
components of the people in the circles who are usually familiar with this type of information
bypass information, is generally known or readily accessible and therefore
is of economic value and

b) the subject of the circumstances after reasonable confidentiality measures

by its rightful owner and

c) who have a legitimate interest in confidentiality ...

It is obvious that regulation c) in particular will lead to debates
can; in the previous entries according to the Freedom of Information Act
for me, however, the topic of trade secrets has not yet been addressed
played a bigger role.

in particular between politics and business, it must be made clear
thus making hidden influence more difficult and public control

For this reason, some states already have regulations on the management of
lobby registers. From the point of view of the freedom of information officers in Germany
it is required for a democratic community, mandatory register

activities are to be entered. It contains at least the names of the natural

Acceptance of political – especially legislative – decisions.
The Conference of Freedom of Information Officers calls on the Federal
