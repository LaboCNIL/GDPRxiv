The use of video conferencing systems is the order of the day in Hessian schools in times of lockdown. Unfortunately, there are always incidents in this context in which strangers unauthorizedly join video conferences between teachers and their students. Once they have entered the conference, these people confront the students, for example, with pictures and videos with pornographic content and content that glorifies violence, without the teacher being able to prevent this.
In many cases, the use of a video conference system with too few setting options is the reason that unauthorized third parties get into the video conferences between students and their teachers. However, existing administration options are often not used by the teachers in order to prevent third parties from gaining unauthorized access to the conferences. This usually happens out of ignorance that in most video conferencing systems there is the possibility that individual teachers can make settings on the system that make it more secure against intrusion by third parties.
The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information would like to support schools in selecting a video conferencing system suitable for teaching children and young people. In addition, the teachers should be shown the administrative possibilities offered by video conferencing systems and sensitized to using these possibilities. He has therefore published "Instructions for safe teaching with video conferencing systems" on his homepage.
