Jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice
National data protection law and the activities of the supervisory authorities
are increasingly being influenced by the case law of the European Union

on data protection and the interpretation of the DS-GVO and by them
existing disputes resolved. But every decision is focused

European legislative initiatives
2022 was a year of European legislative initiatives on digitization

of data protection law (see also 50th activity report, Chapter 1).
On the one hand, the supervisory authorities work in the European data protection

The number of complaints, which is leveling off at a high level, leads to
the resources of the supervisory authority to the dilemma that the
supervisory authority can only cope with the increasing workload
when it uses means of work rationalization. However, this can
bring about peace among those who have lodged a complaint, and
to an increase in lawsuits against the supervisory authority. This in turn

There are also commitments to digital sovereignty as a political goal

For them, however, digital sovereignty is not just a question of security,

New transatlantic developments
The discussion about digital sovereignty is being driven by the efforts of a
new "Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework" between the USA and the
EU revives. On October 7, 2022, the US President issued an Executive Order

For the other aspects of digital sovereignty presented above
however, nothing changes as a result of the framework and its recognition.
The EO attempts to address the two central criticisms of the ECJ in its original

way "any signals intelligence collection technique" limited by
previous regulations are permitted (Sec. 2 e). The powers under Section
702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which the ECJ considered not
declared compatible with European fundamental rights continue to apply.
With regard to legal protection, the EO also sees a two-stage process

Implementation of digital sovereignty in Hesse
It therefore makes sense to stick to the goal of digital sovereignty in the long term
to orient. For this reason, the EU Commission, the Federal
government and the state governments this goal in their initially mentioned
Digitization strategies for public administration included. In
Implementation of these strategies have been around at the federal level by now

Above all, the digitization push caused by the corona pandemic has
increased use of video conferencing systems (VKS).
In the process, the pressure to find quick solutions resulted in many systems
selected that do not meet the data protection requirements.
This is especially true for many widely used VKS made by US American
niche providers. These transfer personal data to
the USA and thereby cause a loss for the persons concerned
in exercising their fundamental rights (see 50th activity report, Chapter 3.1).
However, they also often violate other data protection regulations because they

are to be classified, I asked this question for the data protection conference

The consequences of this differentiation can be practical in the following

The same applies when they are using video conferencing with their partners, clients

of video conferencing does not have a market where they can

use these. They are therefore not providers of telecommunications services.
It should therefore be noted that the providers of video conferencing services

This result also fits with the regulations of telecommunications secrecy
in the TTDSG. According to Section 3 (2) TTDSG, “providers of publicly accessible

committed to telecommunications secrecy. After that, telecommunications secrecy applies
for providers of video conferencing services such as Zoom, Cisco, Microsoft and others.
They offer public telecommunications services to anyone in the market
and they provide them permanently to third parties, i.e. in a business-like manner.
On the other hand, associations, universities, schools, administrative authorities, medical
practices and legal offices as well as companies that want to
conducting video conferences for own purposes to communicate with
Members, employees and contractual partners use, not to protect
committed to telecommunications secrecy because they do not
provide services for a fee. However, you must have the fundamental right to
protect the informational self-determination of all data subjects. With
this fundamental right are in practice largely the same level of protection
and the same requirements as with telecommunications secrecy.

the regulations in the TKG and the data protection regulations therefore apply
in §§ 1 to 18 and 27 to 30 TTDSG. This supremacy of the ePrivacy Directive
however, only applies insofar as the ePrivacy Directive addresses the respective legal issues
specifically regulates. The ePrivacy Directive contains such regulations, e.g. B.

Art. 28 and 44 et seq. GDPR.
On the other hand, the use of video conferencing services as a whole is covered

Main focus of the activities of the European and International Office in the

and this development is also having a greater impact on work

to be expected that the complainant or the person responsible

increasing need to document procedural steps - with the
corresponding additional work in the complaints procedure.

The impact of the pandemic continued to be felt during the reporting period.
One focus of the processing in the fine office was the punishment

be completed.

The subject of the procedure was the sending of an e-mail in the open mailing list
to approx. 100 people, whereby no sensitive data was affected. Although
the person responsible on the same day from an e-mail recipient
had been informed of the incident, they saw no reason to
to initiate further measures. Through the unlawful disclosure
of the numerous e-mail addresses, the company violated Art. 6
Para. 1 GDPR. In addition, it violated the documentation requirements

the decision was due, among other things, to the constructive cooperation
with the supervisory authority and the expressed insight of the
company. In addition, the appointment of a data protection

times data protection violations against the company became known
which is taken into account as a mitigating factor in the assessment of fines. Therewith

The developed method of calculating the amount of the fine is divided into
five steps that "climb along" Art. 83 DS-GVO:

Step 1
In a first step, the processing operations of the individual case are closed

on the assessment according to the principles of specialty, of subsidiarity
and consumption.

step 2
This is followed by setting the starting point for further calculations
the amount of the fine (chapter 4 of the guideline). The EDPB is of the opinion
that the calculation of the fine is based on a harmonized
point should begin. The starting point is defined by three elements:
a. the classification of the violation in accordance with Article 83 (4) to (6) GDPR,
b. the severity of the violation according to Art. 83 (2) letters a, b and g GDPR,
c. the company's turnover as an important element in terms of

it is important to understand how the term "company" within the meaning of Art. 83
DS-GVO is to be understood. Recital 150 GDPR is based on

if necessary, be adjusted accordingly with regard to Art. 83 Para. 1 DS-GVO,
however, without exceeding the applicable statutory maximum
(Chapter 7 of the guideline). Anything in excess of this maximum amount will

The next step is now for the EDPB and the responsible working group to
incorporate the feedback from the consultation phase into the guidelines.
This work has already started. Hesse is next to the federal government and

LT-Drs. 20/8129 to comment. Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity
my data protection concerns at an early stage within the framework of the
to contribute to the drafting of the law.
My comments focused in particular on the proposals to amend
amendment of the Hessian law on public safety and order

Hessian Constitutional Protection Act (HVSG). But he had
not yet the new requirements of the judgment of the BVerfG, 1 BvR 1619/17, dated
April 26, 2022 on the Bavarian Constitutional Protection Act, which as part
was classified as unconstitutional, implemented with regard to the HVSG.
Therefore, the hearing was also limited to the proposed changes
to the HSOG.
My full opinion can be found in the INA committee proposal

for my statements in the public oral hearing of the

In particular, I encountered the following problems:
 – The large number of potential actors (federal government, 16 federal states, 294
Counties and approx. 11,000 municipalities) may lead to the need for the
conclusion and the maintenance of a plethora of - on data protection law -
legal legitimacy - necessary contracts.

 – In order to counteract this problem, individual federal governments have
different legal opinions and "data protection law
tive implementation models” emerged, some of which are incompatible with each other
are compatible – such as the conclusion of administrative agreements or
the municipal representative model.

The complex situation creates considerable legal uncertainty

and citizens can lead. Because if already for those responsible

Statements in meetings of municipal bodies
In the case of statements made in meetings, in particular by municipal councils and

to designate this or that person as a “member of faction x”. If-
also personal (exaggerated) statements within the framework of the
political battles of opinion are permissible, it must be borne in mind that
as a result of the principle of openness to meetings of a large
effect of such statements - possibly also in the media and via the
Internet - is to be assumed and the person concerned with any
confronted with negative consequences outside of municipal activities
could be. Such personal statements can therefore
infringe the privacy rights of the data subject.

Photographs of bulky waste by a municipal waste company
Processes are also used in everyday waste disposal
increasingly automated and digitized. So e.g. B. to the management of
Logistics processes or customer relationships are increasingly becoming digital solutions
used, which are subjected to a data protection analysis
must.

A complaint situation often goes through the communication of my service
transition smoothly into a counseling situation with the person in charge who
to increase the level of information and data protection in particular
can lead to the establishment and further development of digital processes.
During the reporting period, I received a complaint against a waste
disposal company, which in terms of bulky waste disposal for a
public waste management company operates.
The field staff took photographs as part of a pick-up order
of bulky waste and then linked them in the customer management system
with the pick-up order of the client. In the context of a complaint
case the complainant found out about the photographs and doubted the
legality of this action. In this regard, he stated
that he had not received any information about the taking of photographs.
In order for the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation to be open,
it is first necessary that the procedure described is
is a "processing of personal data". According to Art. 2 Para. 1
DS-GVO, it depends on whether personal data is completely or partially
wise be processed automatically or whether in the case of a non-automated one
Processing a storage in a file system is to take place.
The terms "personal data" and "processing" are defined in Art. 4
No. 1 and 2 DS-GVO defined.

Art. 4 No. 1 and 2 GDPR
For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:
(1) "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); as identical
tifiable is a natural person who directly or indirectly, in particular
by assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, a status

While a digital photograph is unproblematic in the technical sense
falls under the processing concept, but it was questionable whether with a view to
the bulky waste personal data are processed. For bulky waste
it is a collection of objects. A photograph
of bulky waste initially contains only information related to
these items. Acts without connection to a natural person
it is therefore so-called factual data in which initially no personal
according to Art. 4 No. 1 DS-GVO (Taeger/Gabel/Arning/Rothkegel,
4th edition 2022, GDPR Art. 4 para. 10). A personal reference can, however
only arise in the course of further processing of the data. so can
various data with a factual reference are brought together and combined in this way
that the person becomes identifiable, i.e. a personal reference is made
(Taeger/Gabel/Arning/Rothkegel, 4th edition 2022, DS-GVO
Art. 4 para. 13). This is even more the case if exclusively factual
data is linked to other personal data.
Therefore, linking the photograph to it changes the quality of the data
the pick-up order in the customer management system, since there is a connection here
of information with identification data of a natural person
becomes. In other words: at the moment when the image of the objects
assigned to the sales order and linked to it, receives that
Material date a personal reference within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 DS-GVO.
I have contacted the disposal company as part of the complaints procedure
process to comment and to answer various questions
regarding the fulfillment of the information obligations, for the purposes and the
Background of the procedure as well as the actual and technical
processing prompted.
In its opinion, the disposal company has the basics
and processes related to the photographic recording of bulky waste in detail
set out. In particular, it explained that the photographs of the blocking
müll's documentation purposes and used in the event of a complaint
become. They are only made in the following cases:

 – if there is no bulky waste at the collection point,

In this regard, it was stated that after the relevant

The photographs should therefore ensure that the statutory

and, should there be any inconsistencies, the garbage and the amount of garbage
can be assigned to the right person. As in the underlying

According to § 20 Para. 1 KrWG, the public waste management authorities have

Households and waste for disposal from other areas of origin
to eliminate.
The legal entities obliged to waste disposal under state law
(Municipalities, towns and districts or associations as special purpose

the disposal company had Art. 6 in its data protection information
Paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 letter b DS-GVO (contract-related data processing)
listed as the legal basis for data processing. In this regard
I have given a notice to that effect.
The examination of the data protection information has also shown that
already explanations for the creation and linking of photographs of the
bulky waste were included. To provide the data protection information
assured the person responsible, in addition to the possibility of retrieval on the
website, upon transmission of the telephone, electronically or by post
the agreed collection date, the corresponding data protection information
to transmit. The pick-up date is sent by e-mail or
in writing by post. The establishment of an automated transmission is
initiated.
The examination of the processing processes themselves has also shown that
the technical and organizational measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR
ensure an adequate level of security.

Conflicts of interest of the data protection officer in a municipality
Personnel or technical management functions and responsibility for
Relevant data processing operations in municipalities usually lead
to a conflict of interest with the function of data protection officer
within the meaning of Art. 38 Para. 6 S. 2 DS-GVO, § 7 Para. 2 S. 2 BDSG and § 7
Paragraph 2 p. 2 HDSIG.

The existence of conflicts of interest is one of the most common questions raised
asked me about the position and the tasks of the data protection officer
becomes. When appointing data protection officers, there is often the
Tendency to delegate this position to an already trusted manager.
Apparently, it is assumed here that the exercise of the function
of the data protection officer by trusted executives gently and im
in the sense of the mayor. However, such a transfer
inadmissible because the existing conflict of interest involves personal and professional
Executives and those responsible for data processing
excluded from the function of data protection officer.
In a case to be examined by me, the function of the data protection
assigned to a person who simultaneously held the functions
Main office manager with responsibility for IT system administration and
Digitization, Head of Tax and Real Estate Management, Head of
security service, IT security officer, digitization officer,
Anti-corruption officer and complaints office according to the AGG.
There was a conflict of interest within the meaning of Art. 38 Para. 6 S. 2 DS-GVO,
Section 7 (2) sentence 2 BDSG and Section 7 (2) sentence 2 HDSIG.
Although the activity of the data protection officer does not have to be exclusively
be practiced. The data protection officer can also have other functions
perceive. However, there must be no conflict of interest. When exactly
The law does not define a conflict of interest. In general is
acknowledged, however, that Data Protection Officers do not exercise any functions
which they monitor themselves in the role of data protection officer
would. Therefore, members of the top management level cannot

be a data protection officer in good time. The same applies to people who

In this function of a municipality, leaders are responsible for content

All of the management functions mentioned above therefore include the function of the
data protection officer a conflict of interest. Every single one of these
Functions would already have been suitable due to the data subject
an existing conflict of interest from the function of the data protection officer
to exclude commissioners.
The functions in the representative system can also create a conflict of interest
include. The digitization officer primarily has an interest
in digitization and thus the simplified processing of personal
related data. The IT security officer is usually on
processing large amounts of personal data
interested in being able to monitor IT security. Both functions
therefore contain a conflict of interest in the function of the data protection officer
wore The same applies to the anti-corruption officer, who also
similar to a money laundering officer, involved in the processing of as many as possible
is interested in data in order to be able to identify corruption when in doubt. The three
therefore also include the aforementioned functions in the officer system
a conflict of interest with the function of data protection officer.
It was no longer necessary to check with the complaints office
there is a conflict of interest according to the AGG, as this is no longer relevant.
However, there is no obvious conflict of interest.
In the case to be processed, the municipality was referred to the existing
Conflicts of interest pointed out, an exchange of the data protection officer
However, this did not happen despite several reminders. This exchange
took place only after the municipality pursuant to Art. 58 Para. 2 Letter b DS-

With a role and authorization concept, schools can ensure
that only those persons processed by the schools
have access to personal data who are authorized to do so. It
serves to simplify internal school organization and communication.
With such a concept, the allocation of access authorizations

that only absolutely necessary access authorizations are distributed.
It is therefore imperative that the schools in Hesse in the future

Scope of work as part of the testing activity
To get an idea of the scope of the test and the associated
wand to get for my agency is the representation of some numerical values
helpful: It took around 18 man-days to complete the 33 Hessian
check collection points. In addition, the evaluation of the test
results about eight person days. There were also two exam dates

Appointments for this took place in 2022.

Online-first strategy of the statistical offices
Like the 2011 census, the 2022 census was primarily one

Separation from other administrative units
In § 6 of the Hessian census implementation law it was regulated that the

In the district of Groß-Gerau, the collection point was divided into three rooms "com-

The required spatial separation was partly generous.
There was no shortage of curiosities either. The city of Fulda, for example, judged
their collection point at the municipal cemetery. The building was
used by the employees of the cemetery administration; some rooms have been
assigned to the census collection agency. You could do the separation requirement
nevertheless implement it appropriately. The district of Fulda was also able to
claim a unique selling proposition for his collection point. This was
housed on the 11th floor of an administration building, which is the highest
location of the city.

Spatial accommodation
As expected and the experiences from the 2011 census
confirming that the spatial accommodation was exemplary in many cases,
on the other hand also borderline. This does not only concern matters
of data protection, but also the working conditions to which the
lifting point personnel was exposed. Considering also at least in

It was found that a large number of survey points on the visitor

assumed that the citizens' interest in making contact would increase

Digitization and transmission of the questionnaires to the ITZBund
The questionnaires completed by the person obliged to provide information were sent to the
company Rhenus Docs to Data forwarded. The Processor
scanned the sheets and sent the digital copies to the ITZBund. The

processing of the documents after the incoming mail in the company itself.
So were the input documentation, i.e. the logging of the

Rhenus was given a questionnaire to external service providers in advance
which was to be answered. In addition, my employee made his way
to Schleswig-Holstein to hold further talks on site and the

Ultimately, it was also about the storage and, later on, the
filing of the documents with the scan service provider. As in 2011, there were none
complaints. The census documents of the federal states were based on the
video-monitored premises in a hall separate from others there
stored documents. The destruction of the bows took over
a subsidiary under a subcontract. The documentation

to criticize the manufacturing processes taking place in Schwarzenbek.
On the other hand, there were probably shortcomings at the ITZBund. The transmission

Acknowledgment of receipt of the digitized questionnaires did not work.
The result was an interim transmission backlog, which the company

Cooperation with the Hessian Statistical Office

Large-scale surveys such as the 2022 census are data protection-
legal issues evident. Cooperation with the responsible
employees of the HSL was as cooperative as it was trusting. In particular
with regard to order processing, my employees were always up to date
informed. All necessary documents were available in advance
placed. Regular meetings prior to the survey were aimed at

to find solutions. This is not a matter of course, but in Hesse it is
established for many years.

Cooperation with the other supervisory authorities
From the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)
An ad hoc working group on the 2022 census was set up.
This facility had already proven itself in 2011. The group consisting
from the federal government and the states of Hamburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Hesse,

and the countries were further processed and reached a decision.
The cooperation was suitable, scarce human resources
to be used in a concerted manner and for as uniform a language as possible
of the supervisory authorities to take care of the official statistics.

Preliminary conclusion
For a huge data processing project like the 2022 census, the

Backgrounds. This assessment applies both to the collection agency

a higher complexity of the data processing processes and meant
a considerable increase in effort for my employees. Nevertheless succeeded

A register-based procedure in the future

in which no additional surveys are necessary. The data

Advice to the Hessian state parliament

Advice to the Hessian state parliament
At the request of the President of the Hessian State Parliament, I advised the State

The guide is intended as a working aid for members of the Hessian state parliament
for the question of how personal data - here in particular names

The starting point is § 9 Para. 1 DSO, which protects the right to information

New regulations on employee data protection
It is therefore to be welcomed that the federal government in its coalition agreement
has already announced that “regulations on employee data protection
create in order to achieve legal clarity for employers and employees
and to protect personal rights effectively" (coalition agreement between
SPD, Bündnis90/Die Grünen and FDP, 20th legislative period, p. 17).
The DSK has also been calling for legal standards for several years
the employment relationship (DSK resolution of March 27, 2014
"Employee data protection now!" and from April 29, 2022 "The time for a
Employee Data Protection Act is "Now"!", https://www.datenschutzkon-
ferenz-online.de/entschlussungen.html).
As far as possible new regulations for employee data protection are concerned,
Is it therefore convenient that in the last legislative period
de by the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (BMAS) with the
Advisory Council on employee data protection convened an expert commission
was to provide recommendations for action on the question of the need for a
to develop an independent law on employee data protection and
to examine initial content-related proposals for such a law. The Advisory Board
published its report on employee data protection in January 2022
(https://www.denkfabrik-bmas.de/focus/beschaeftendatenschutz/

data protection).
He comes to the conclusion that the general clause-like regulation
of § 26 BDSG often no accurate statements about the admissibility
of specific processing in the employment relationship, but
leave this up to the case-by-case analysis of the courts, and demands concrete
regulations (report of the advisory board on employee data protection

According to the DSK, § 26 BDSG is not sufficiently practicable,

I took the complaints as an opportunity to contact those responsible
to hear about the processing procedure. It turned out that the
information provided by the employees was correct. My investigations

To justify the data processing procedure, the data subjects should
sign a consent form but did not have the opportunity to do so
to reject, but only to "revoke" them. The explanation was how
follows (excerpt):

"I agree that the with the installed in the company vehicle

Consent?
The principle of the lawfulness of data processing from Art. 5 Para. 1
Letter a DS-GVO in connection with Art. 6 DS-GVO requires for the legal
compliance with data processing has a legal basis or consent
of those affected.
Art. 88 DS-GVO provides for the area of employee data protection
opening clause, which enables the member states to
to issue regulations for the area of employee data protection.
With the provision of § 26 BDSG, the legislature has this possibility
made use of. In principle, according to Section 26 (2) BDSG (see Chapter 11.1)
consent to data processing also in the employment relationship
legitimize; However, this is only possible under very narrow conditions:
The data processing as part of the camera surveillance was not completed
a consent corresponding to the requirements of § 26 Para. 2 BDSG
justified. Because when assessing the voluntariness of consent
comes to the circumstance of the agreements existing in the employment relationship
pendency (so-called over-subordination relationship) is of particular importance.
For a voluntary and therefore effective consent, a
lawful alternative behavior (e.g. the refusal of data processing
procedure) be possible, so that the persons concerned have a genuine electoral
have possibility. In the case to be assessed, the cameras were already there
installed in the vehicles before the workers even had an opportunity
had to "consent" to the data processing procedure. The affected
Drivers were thus faced with a fait accompli from the start
asked. However, effective consent was due to the lack of voluntariness
not subject to consent.
After my hearing and the indication that the submitted declaration of consent
clarification did not meet the requirements of Section 26 (2) BDSG, appealed
controllers no longer rely on consent as a legal basis,
but on § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG (see Chapter 11.1).

Need for employment?
However, the monitoring of the employees was also not in accordance with Section 26 (1).
S. 1 BDSG lawful. According to § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG, personal
data collected from employees for the purposes of the employment relationship
processed if this is necessary for the decision on the justification
of an employment relationship or after establishing the employment
tenancy is necessary for its implementation or termination.

152

Employee data protection

The interests of the employer are included in the necessity test
and to weigh up and protect the interests of employees that are worthy of protection
to bring a balance between the two interests as far as possible
is fair (practical concordance).
This requires an examination based on the proportionality
principle, which in turn requires that on the part of the person responsible
a legitimate purpose is being pursued, the processing procedure for the
for the realization of this purpose, and it is the mildest of all
equally effective means available. In addition, must
it may also be reasonable after considering the circumstances of the individual case.
An open video surveillance is thus according to § 26 Abs. 1 S. 1 BDSG as
Measure within the framework of the implementation of the employment relationship
permissible if the purpose of the data processing is based on the
departure, implementation or termination of the employment relationship
is directed and the requirements of the principle of proportionality
is equivalent to.
Insofar as monitoring the driving behavior of the employees themselves

Filming the interior of the driver's cab - i. H. the manufacture of

and constitutes a material breach of the provisions of the

The video surveillance of the interior of the driver's cab is
is a performance and behavior control of the employees
which creates a permanent monitoring pressure. Because those affected have to

Possibility of documented observation, so that there is pressure to

the personality right in the form of a full control is data protection law
inadmissible.

memory limit?
Automatic storage of all recordings for a duration of 60
Hours also violates the principle of storage limitation
of Art. 5 Para. 1 Letter e GDPR. Thereafter, a personal reference may only
be allowed for as long as is necessary for the purposes of data processing
is required. If the data is no longer required for this purpose,
the person responsible is therefore obliged to delete them immediately. This
arises, concretizing the principle of memory limitation
Art. 17 DS-GVO (see short paper no. 11 of the DSK on the right to deletion,

accidents caused by third parties, the driving behavior of drivers

The starting point for any weighing of interests within the framework of Art. 6 Para. 1
Subsection 1 letter f DS-GVO are on the one hand the personal rights of the

that the person concerned stores their personal data on one of their

Data are made public if they are accessible to an indefinite
number of people without significant admission barriers
(Schulz in Gola/Heckmann, DS-GVO, 3rd edition 2022, Art. 9 para. 33). Public
made data can be found, for example, in freely accessible data
areas of the Internet, on your own website or in opinion forums.
It is crucial that the data is freely accessible without restrictions
not only made accessible within a closed group.

Also a significant violation of the in Art. 5 Para. 1 Letter a DS-GVO
contained principle of transparency, which i.a. through the information obligation
of Art. 14 GDPR is specified, was not given. Art. 14 GDPR
obliges those responsible to inform the data subject if the
personal data were not collected from the data subject.
This is the case with active sourcing, since the personal data -
as in the underlying case - not with the data subject himself,
but collected from another source.
Article 14 of the GDPR includes, among other things the obligation to provide information about the stored
th personal data, the legal basis of the processing, the
Contact details of the data protection officer, the purposes of data processing
tion, the duration of storage, a list of the rights of those affected,
the existence of a right of appeal and the source from which the data
come. In the case to be examined here, the information obligations were
observed. There was no information about the exact origin of the data.
The data source was informed of my request.

Summary and further information for practice
The case shows that Active Sourcing, in accordance with the provisions

Article 6 paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 letter f GDPR applies in particular to the processing
consideration; the regulations on employee data protection, on the other hand, can be found

If those responsible for data processing are based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Subparagraph 1
letter f DS-GVO, it is mandatory to carry out a weighing of interests
to lead. It should be particularly relevant here whether potential candidates
and candidates their personal data for professional purposes
have made generally available. The considerations also apply to
job-oriented networks, provided the users concerned
not make use of the possibility of privacy settings,
so that your personal data is generally accessible (Göpfert/

In the meantime, however, the legal situation has been changed by a judgment of the ECJ (judgment of

whether the person acting for the contractual partner is authorized to do so,

2. the clarification of whether the contractual partner is acting for a beneficial owner,
and, if this is the case, the identification of the beneficial owner
Subject to Section 11 Paragraph 5 and Section 12 Paragraphs 3 and 4; this includes in cases in
where the contractual partner is not a natural person, the obligation to
to find out the control structure of the contractual partner by appropriate means,
3. the collection and evaluation of information about the purpose and about the
type of business relationship sought, insofar as this information does not differ in individual cases
already unequivocally derived from the business relationship,

4. Using appropriate, risk-based procedures to determine whether the

Contractual partners and, if applicable, about the beneficial owner, about their
business activity and customer profile and,

b) if necessary, with the information available to the obligated party about the

source of assets;

As part of the continuous monitoring, the obligated parties must ensure
that the respective documents, data or information, taking into account the
respective risks are updated at appropriate intervals.

there was a coupling situation. Based on the guidelines of the EDPB

I did not share this perspective. Already the date of the accommodation

Also with regard to the amendment of the Hessian Hospital Act

background
During the reporting period, COVID testing centers were frequently the subject of
Complaints. Numerous test centers also asked for advice on
data protection-compliant design of their processes. As the COVID-
Test results according to Art. 4 No. 15 and Art. 9 Para. 1 DS-GVO in particular
health data to be protected is subject to the operators of
test centers high data protection requirements (see also Chapter 5.2).
Unfortunately, these legal requirements were not always met, so that
my intervention became necessary. Here I found that
the data breaches encountered are similar and regularly under one
of the following topics can be summarized.

Collection of unnecessary data
When registering online or on site, in principle
lich only such personal data from the persons to be tested
are queried and collected, to carry out the COVID test and
are required to fulfill the associated legal obligations.
Some test centers submitted during the supervisory procedure that personal
National IDs would be copied to verify information or to meet obligations
from the Coronavirus Test Ordinance (“TestV”).
However, the coronavirus test regulation does not require the preparation of one
Copy of the identity card nor the documentation of the identity card

adjustment is sufficient here.
Therefore, copies of ID cards are not allowed by the operators
of the test centers are generated. In individual cases, however, the collection of
ID card number may be allowed if required, e.g. B. at
the use of the identity card number for international test certificates
and if the data subject has consented to it.

Inadequate privacy statements
The test center has the persons to be tested when collecting their data
to provide the information specified in Art. 13 GDPR. You need to

In one case, the operator of the test center remained due to a lack of proper

Art. 13 Para. 1 Letter a DS-GVO the persons concerned could not

whom they can exercise their rights. Also in this case I click the
fulfillment of the information obligations. In addition, I check
further supervisory measures against the person responsible.

Inadequate discretion and lack of access protection
According to Art. 5 Para. 1 Letter f and Art. 32
DS-GVO obliged to protect the personal data of the persons concerned

Zen. Therefore, the premises of the test centers must be designed in such a way that
the customers cannot see the screens of the test center
have. The test results are only to be disclosed to the tested person,
so that the calling out of the test result is in front of the people waiting
of course forbidden. Also the documentation of the test results
and the test certificates must be kept safe. Appropriate
Paper documents are in particular also outside the opening hours
of the test center in a safe and locked place.
These basic rules on discretion and access protection in the
Test center were unfortunately ignored by some test centers. in one
case, the test certificates were in an unlocked box in public

Incorrect delivery of test results

not uncommon that due to an oversight or a typo
a test result is sent to the wrong person. As far as the technical
cal protective measures such as the encryption of the test result (see

Conclusion
The business model of the COVID test centers has now existed for more than two
years, so that data protection-compliant processes have now been established here
should have. When it comes to data protection, however, the operators have
still some catching up to do. Test center operators
in Hesse should be aware that the determination of a serious
major data protection violation to a not inconsiderable fine
can lead. For some operations I already have the opening of a

Legal Assessment
I followed the reasoning of practice and have some processing
accepted on the basis of Art. 9 Para. 2 Letter h DS-GVO.

a treating doctor is part of the treatment contract and
the scope required for the treatment according to Art. 9 Para. 2 Letter h

exists rather between the responsible person issuing the order
and its processor an "internal relationship". Processing by
the processor is therefore in principle the person responsible
attributed. For the transfer of personal data to the
contract processor and the processing by the processor
there is usually no further legal basis within the meaning of Articles 6 to 10
DS-GVO as the one to which the person responsible carries out the processing himself

Exemplary problem areas from supervisory practice
Based on the comparable injuries reported to me in the reporting
With regard to the protection of personal data, I have found that
the cooperation between processors and controllers
while dealing with this type of incidents in different areas
has potential for improvement. The following are some of these
Possibilities for improving processes are described.
The first avoidable delays and deficits often arise in
the initial supply of information to those responsible by the
contract processor. The termination of an IT security incident had in the
Usually a high priority for processors. The data protection law
Obligations were therefore always given priority. At the beginning
the treatment of an incident, it was often not yet known what exactly
had happened and the extent of the incident. It therefore happened
that processors should initially inform those responsible
put back, for example in order not to worry their own customers unnecessarily.
However, this meant that those responsible under data protection law
were informed too late and were only able to react too late.
Inadequate preparations and contingency plans also made themselves felt
negatively noticeable in successful ransomware attacks. So there was
for example processors who had difficulties, controllers
to contact since they have access to the contact information of the customers
and had lost their communication infrastructure and for this case none
had provided alternatives. There were also isolated cases in which
contract processors first provided information to the controllers,
which did not reflect the actual extent of the incident. Through this
those responsible were weighed with a false sense of security.
As shown in the scenario, the information situation can change
complex data breaches such as ransomware attacks successively
change. These changes were another source of delays,
if the processor does not promptly and
communicated appropriately prepared to those responsible, for example in the event
the announcement of the release of exfiltrated data. If at ransom-
ware attacks did not actively monitor the attackers' websites on the dark web
were, this usually led to the actual publication
of data was not known or only became known with a delay.
When data is published, it usually has to be analyzed
to personal data contained therein and those concerned
to identify people. Since published data but by the attackers

and the associated costs for such an analysis are very high.

genes or even lead to the analysis not being carried out at all.
Further delays may arise if a processor

before informing those responsible that a data disclosure

The scenario considered was used to show how the communi-

between the processor and the controller on the one hand

that the notification of the persons concerned does not only take place in larger

In the event of an assumed high risk to rights and freedoms,
averting possible damage should be a primary concern for people affected

technical requirements of the GDPR. Therefore, special attention should be paid
to prompt and appropriate notification of those affected
people and their required support.
Elaborated and regularly practiced processes as well as emergency manuals
support the effective and efficient handling of IT security
incidents. When designing this, the implementations of the
data protection requirements as part of the planned processes
be ensured. In particular in the case of order processing
interlocking processes between processors and those responsible
required for data breach reporting chains that are shared

For a timely response, it is essential that the processor

to encrypt them as well or make them unusable. In my
50th activity report (chapter 18.2) for the year 2021, I have dealt with
somware attacks in more detail.

Examples from supervisory practice
The following examples of data protection incidents reported to me in the

The first example relates to a small company that is

This also included backing up the data on this same system. Through
a successful ransomware attack on this server were all

Backup, demonstrates the second example from a larger IT company,
which was also affected by a ransomware attack. The company
had a dedicated backup system as a so-called online backup.
The backup system was integrated into the normal IT infrastructure and
was able to back up data directly from the other IT systems.
However, the attackers managed to gain access to this online backup
to provide system. You were thus able to not only all backups

An obvious measure would be to create offline backups, like

– primarily served the Data Governance Act and the drafts for a
Data Act and to regulate a total of 13 European data
men. He found that data protection in these legislative
files are not systematically taken into account. So he advocated
a moratorium to safeguard against adverse effects on
adequately adjust fundamental rights. Prof. Dr. Hannes Federrath from
of the University of Hamburg showed in his lecture “Privacy Protection
Methods of research data processing” on how the most modern methods
of computer science can contribute to effective research processes without
to allow privacy issues. As protection possibilities he gave five
Privacy design strategies: Minimize (restriction to necessary data
ten), Separate (decentralized data analysis at the storage location), Aggregate (from
abstract personal reference), pertubate (personal reference through noise
exclude) and hide (prevent access to personal data).

51. Activity report on data protection

From Hesse to the world
With the topic "From Hesse into the world: The development of data protection
in the interplay of communication technology and law” dealt with am
2 November 2022 an event organized by my authority in cooperation
with the Forum Privatheit and the Museum for Communication in Frank-
furt organized. At the dialogue event, Dr. H. c. maritime
Hansen, State Commissioner for Data Protection Schleswig-Holstein, and I
as spokesman for the "Privacy Forum" and Hessian representative for data
protection and freedom of information moderated by Dr. Ulf Buermeyer
LL. M. (Chairman of the Society for Freedom Rights e. V. and host of the
Political podcasts "State of the Union") with 50 years of data protection history
te apart. The history of data protection law began with
Hessian data protection law of 1970, the first data protection law
of the world. That a lot has happened since then and data protection has changed
Hessen made its way around the world showed our common
mer lecture - a path that was characterized by an interplay between
Innovations in information and communication technology on the one hand
and in data protection law on the other hand. We found that
new technical developments always new challenges
mean for data protection law, which in turn with new
regulations and laws. This in turn stimulate new technical
Developments to meet the legal requirements - or to them
evade. Marit have this interplay between technology and law
Hansen from the point of view of the computer scientist and I alternately illustrate
light. Telecommunications took place in 1970 at the time of the first Hessian
Data Protection Act still anonymous and without data storage. Today,
at the time of the European General Data Protection Regulation, in the
electronic communications collected so much data that with them by
complete interest, relationship and movement profiles for all users
are possible and there are interests of state and private bodies, these
evaluate for their purposes. The focus was on questions such as E.g.: Which
Risks to fundamental rights are associated with the development of information technology
tied together? What regulations does data protection law have against these
developed? How can law and technology work together to
improve privacy? And: How can they do this – given global
operating companies – do worldwide?
In addition, at the end of the year under review, the website of my
authority updated. HZD IT support for the old site has expired.
The new site is more modern and thematically more attractive. Current
the departments revise their contributions and thus guarantee that
next year a lot of new interesting content.

Supplementary explanations of facts and figures
The following illustrations explain and supplement the evaluations
in chap. 19.1 also in comparison with the previous year and the other work
offer in the reporting year. Overall, the number of cases stabilized at seven
years after the entry into force and five years after the entry into force of the
GDPR at a very high level. It can be observed that
in many areas the quality of the complaints and the need for advice
changes. While at the beginning questions about more formal requirements
of the GDPR were in the foreground (e.g. after the obligation to place an order
a data protection officer, on information and access rights
of the person concerned), there are many questions that I dealt with in the reporting year
had to deal with in more depth and raise fundamental questions.

Complaints and Advice
Even if the complaints and requests for advice in connection with
COVID have declined, the pandemic still has a lasting impact
on the workload in my agency. As before, he gets through
the digitization push triggered by the pandemic also via the pandemic
In addition, there is a very fundamental and very labor-intensive need for advice
with himself. In the year under review, it became apparent that technical solutions
such as video conferencing technology, which is quickly used in the pandemic
were brought to schools, colleges, factories and administration
to keep it running, also be used beyond the pandemic
men. Since the introduction had to be done in a hurry, we now had to do it afterwards
the requirements of data protection are brought to bear. Also

Online Access Act, which obliges the federal, state and local governments to

In almost all areas in which my authority is active,

It is gratifying that the number of complaints is declining in some areas.

I observe, for example, that more and more websites offer the possibility

Citizens who are affected in their freedom of information

This regulation for the implementation of freedom of information is as follows
objective based. In a democracy, public administration may
no longer be a closed area, but their actions must be open and
make transparent. On the one hand, citizens should be able to

can contribute. Opposed by the right of access to information
public authorities give citizens the opportunity to
to gain direct insight into the processes of public administration.
This allows you to understand decisions made by the administration,

democratic and constitutional function, strengthens civic

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
5. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

The Federal Republic of Germany and thirteen federal states have since
many years freedom of information laws restricting access to information
open to all public bodies. In some federal states, these
laws have since been developed into transparency laws that
public administration oblige themselves to provide as much information as possible
to make public. The current coalition agreement between SPD, Bündnis90/
The Greens and FDP also see a federal transparency law for the federal government
before (coalition agreement, p. 11).
Hesse was a latecomer in this development and only did five years ago
enact freedom of information regulations. It has its own rules for this
development concept that has only been adopted by Saxony and itself
from the regulatory concepts of all other freedom of information laws in
Germany differs. The right of general access to information
does not apply to all public bodies in Hesse, but only to the
state administration. The communities and districts that have the most civil
have contacts should each decide for themselves by statute,
whether they provide access to information about their files. Such information
So far, however, only a few districts, cities
and communities approved. Applies to most administrations in Hesse
therefore no freedom of information. Accordingly, the information
Freedom of freedom in administrative practice in Hesse, even to a lesser extent
Measures pronounced and must still develop in the future (see Chapter 2).
In the meantime, however, it has become apparent that the data on public authorities
available, not only of great importance for democracy and the rule of law
are, but also business and science benefit greatly from them
could pull. Therefore, all digitization strategies look to Union,
federal and state level to oblige public authorities to
to make suitable data publicly available. Accordingly sees
the coalition agreement for the federal government an open data regulation (coalition
contract, p. 17). In Hesse, the parliamentary groups of the CDU and
Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, after the draft for an open data law of the
FDP parliamentary group failed in the previous reporting year (see 4.
dir, chap. 5), on January 23, 2023 a draft law on open
Data from the public administration bodies in the legislative process
submitted (LT-Drs. 20/10379).
In the Union, the legislature has in Art. 3 et seq. of the Open Governance Act dated
May 30, 2022 (EU OJ L 152 of June 3, 2022, 1) Regulations on further
use of data held by public bodies.
In the draft for a Data Act of February 23, 2022, the European
Commission (COM(2022) 68 final) Rules for fair access to data

introduction

and a fair data use of this data proposed (see also
51. Activity report on data protection, chap. 1). The Commission aims to
to create a total of 13 public data rooms, and has to for the
the first European data room on health data on May 3, 2022
Draft regulation (COM(2022) 197/2).
In these developments towards open data, it is always also - even primarily
gig – about the free use of data from public authorities. As far as it goes
personal data, this always requires an agreement
with the requirements of data protection. As far as this succeeds
this development in the interest of the protection of fundamental rights, of participation
and development opportunities in business, science and civil
welcome social engagement. That fits into this development
restrained regulatory model of freedom of information in Hesse
hard in.
As Freedom of Information Officer, I had many interesting
te answer questions about freedom of information, supported citizens
and citizens in enforcing their claims, I participated in the

It presents the development of freedom of information in Hesse in the reporting year
dar (Chap. 1), examines the question of how freedom of information by design
Implementation of freedom of information through technology design can promote

development of freedom of information

1. Development of freedom of information
development of freedom of information
On the positive side, the country's public authorities are quite familiar with the domestic
information access to official information and records discontinued
have. A negative aspect is that the municipal area in particular
largely excluded from access to information. Especially in this one
There is a need for legislative, or at least municipal, action.

Freedom of Information Officer as “Complaints Office”
As a freedom of information officer, I deal in particular with
Submissions from citizens who object to their right to information
mation access violated.
In § 89 paragraph 1 sentence 1 HDSIG it is regulated that anyone who is in his information
freedom of information according to §§ 80 ff. HDSIG violated,
can “call” me as Freedom of Information Officer. From this right
the citizens made annually in the middle two-digit range
area use. Responds to requests for advice, mostly from authorities
are similar in numbers.
If I am called within the meaning of Section 89 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 HDSIG, I will deal with it
me with the subject of the complaint. I come to the conclusion that
access to the information is wrongly denied, then according to § 89
Para. 3 S. 3 HDSIG request the public body to internalize this violation
to be fixed within a certain period of time. This request is legal though
not a (binding) administrative act within the meaning of § 35 HVwVfG, but a
Appeal to the body by the law according to § 89 Abs. 3 S. 4 HDSIG
planned notification of the supervisory authority of the public body
of course contains a certain emphasis.
By and large, information access requests become out of sight
of the freedom of information officer of the public authorities correctly
destined Violations of the provisions of Section 87 HDSIG are more common
statutory notice periods. In terms of content, they behave
public authorities but mostly correct.
The question of whether in the case
against a rejection by me as freedom of information officer
about the complainant, according to § 89 para. 3 sentence 3 HDSIG against the body
to take action, the complainant then took legal action against me
can proceed. On the other hand, the legislature in § 87 para. 5

from whom information is requested, but not in Section 89
HDSIG to the Freedom of Information Officer.
Quite apart from that, however, a judicial
hen against the freedom of information officer the need for legal protection
are missing because, as I said, this is not the point anyway,
may oblige to provide information. This obligation can, however, precisely in the case
administrative court action against the public body itself
in the procedure according to § 87 para. 5 HDSIG in the case of the merits of the action
be obtained. This suggests that the judicial legal protection

is excluded in this respect. Of course, the administrative court can

Insufficient opening of information access
Persons who contact me as freedom of information officer about not
complained about the access to information granted, I often had to report that
the municipal area, unlike in the other federal states, from
Legislators are "privileged" at the expense of freedom of information. Only
if a municipality according to § 81 Section 1 No. 7 HDSIG in a municipal

Partly expressly determined by the articles of association.

This legal situation comes up against the citizens who contact me
turn, since the beginning of freedom of information in Hesse in 2018
justifiably to great misunderstanding.
The statutory special treatment of the municipal sector would have changed
then, of course, for freedom of information – at least in practice – not
particularly detrimental when the municipalities are overwhelmingly
Articles of association that provide access to information within the meaning of Section 81
Para. 1 No. 7 HDSIG would have met.

development of freedom of information

Unfortunately, however, the opposite is the case: In Hesse there are 21 districts and only
four of them have introduced information access since 2018 (Marburg-Bie-
denkopf, Groß-Gerau, Darmstadt-Dieburg and the Main-Taunus-Kreis).
almost exactly only a fifth of the counties. In the larger cities it looks
no better for freedom of information: Only Wiesbaden, Kassel and
Darmstadt have freedom of information. After all, the state capital
access to information, unlike the other municipalities
limits the area of self-government, but also the authority to issue instructions and
Order matters included.
But not only the municipal area, but also the design
of freedom of information regarding the state area still offers
Reason for criticism: In particular the rigorous exclusions of the information
access regarding the police authorities (§ 81 Para. 2 No. 1 HDSIG) and the
Chambers of Commerce (§ 81 Para. 2 No. 3 HDSIG) should be mentioned here.
In my capacity as Hessian Freedom of Information Officer
I therefore make another appeal to the state parliament and the state government
Times, the Hessian freedom of information law as in most others
Federal states to check in particular in these points. Simultaneously
I appeal to the municipal sector, access to information, so far

Freedom of information by design

2. Freedom of Information by Design
Freedom of information by design
In the area of freedom of information, the possible
Access to official information when carrying out digitization
planning projects to consider from the start. The contribution illuminates
what the so-called “freedom of information by design” is all about
and what opportunities and risks public authorities should consider.

In my last activity report, I explained why the
the provision and use of open data is to be promoted (4th activity report,
Cape. 5). In this connection I mentioned that the European
data strategy make the EU a role model for a digital society
should. The provision of open data is a so-called "obligation to deliver".
public sector when it comes to the provision of information
on goes through government agencies. That is the freedom of information as
so-called “obligation to collect” from the citizens. About this one
to facilitate the exercise of freedom of information rights and the trans-
the concept of promoting parency in public administration
of the so-called "freedom of information by design". The conference
the Freedom of Information Officer (IFK) in its 37th meeting on 12.
June 2019 created a position paper (https://datenschutz.hessen.de/
sites/datenschutz.hessen.de/files/2022-08/positionspapier_informations-
freedom_by_design.pdf). Similar to the basic idea of Art. 25 GDPR
(Data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly
Defaults) should already have freedom of information requirements
right from the start by public authorities in the design of their IT systems
and organizational processes. According to the IFK
According to the definition, “freedom of information by design” includes the entirety
technical and organizational instruments, taking into account the
State of the art required for the exercise and fulfillment of rights
the freedom of information and access to information laws, environmental information
mation laws and transparency laws of the federal and state governments

has not been the case in Hesse so far.
My agency is currently working with other representatives

freedom by design” with. These principles will be revised in due course

organizational measures, on the other hand on information-friendly
technical defaults.
Basically, the chances of "freedom of information by design" lie in
that the transparency of the public sector is further promoted. However
there are also often risks: On the one hand, checking the data quality is
difficult for citizens. Second is the data
not understandable without meta information. If you ask the interested
querying only columns of data available, with no other information
to provide their meaning, the data are not usable. This meta
information should also support “freedom of information by design” from the outset
to be considered. If the authority has an information advantage,
that is relevant to the interpretation or analysis of the data, it should
the applicant the necessary information on the
provide. In addition, the body responsible for information must be aware of this

must not be undermined by freedom of information – even then
Not if “freedom of information by design” is guaranteed.

(No) information access to economic chambers

3. (No) access to information from economic chambers
(No) information access to economic chambers
The absolute exclusion of information access to the industrial
and chambers of commerce and chambers of crafts is not legally stringent.
The rules already existing in the Hessian freedom of information law
measures to protect personal rights and business secrets
and other rights are sufficient. The chambers for z. B. Lawyers,
Notaries and doctors get by with these regulations.

The current legal situation
The Hessian state legislature has, in contrast to others
Federal states decided that the chambers of industry and commerce and the
Chambers of crafts to be completely excluded from access to information.
This regulation can be found in § 81 Para. 2 No. 3 HDSIG.

§ 81 HDSIG
(2) The provisions of Part Four do not apply to
(...)
3. the chambers of industry and commerce and the chambers of crafts,
(...)

Evaluation
In the legislative process it was definitely seen (LT-Drucks. 19/5728,
p. 150 f.), that the freedom of information in Hesse anyway
existing protective regulations, for example in Section 82 Nos. 3 and 4 and Section 83 HDSIG
in favor of the protection of data protection and the protection of business
secrets of the chamber members are sufficient in themselves.
That might also be the reason that other chambers in the area
professional self-government (Bar Association, Chamber of Notaries
and also the medical association) access to information in accordance with the
§§ 80 ff. HDSIG are subject.
Since the Hessian freedom of information law came into force
Hessian Freedom of Information Officer accordingly as a result of
Freedom of information complaints according to § 89 HDSIG information access
Applications have become known from professional chambers in Hesse
had to be approved in accordance with §§ 80 ff. HDSIG.

323

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
5. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

That the chambers of commerce are privileged in that they
access to information is absolutely impossible can be compared
to the other Chambers do not justify.
Therefore it is in the sense of an appropriate equal treatment of the
mers and, above all, adequate access to information
Chambers of Industry and Commerce and the Chambers of Crafts the others
Equal to chambers, where access to information is tailored
80 et seq. HDSIG has been opened from the outset. Also in the
most other federal states are subject to all professional associations
chambers for access to information.
Addressing this access to information, the Conference of Information
tion commissioners from the federal and state governments in 2015
Resolution drafted:

“Chambers are also obliged to transparency
Again and again professional chambers refuse the trans
parency requirements of the respective information access laws.
Professional chambers take on sovereign tasks
and country level true. There is one for each professional group
legal obligation to be a member, the chambers are responsible for
and often have far-reaching sanction options.
Information that arises in the course of their work falls under the
Federal and state information access laws. this is also valid
for annual financial statements and information on income, expenses and
Provisions of the chambers. For the obligation of the Chambers
It is irrelevant whether applicants are chamber members and which ones
motives that led to the application. Public Bodies
are in large areas not in competition with market
takers – Competitive disadvantages usually cannot arise.
Consequently, trade and business secrets worthy of protection
generally do not oppose access to information.
Claims for access to information must be made immediately, at the latest
but within the limits set forth in federal information access laws
or to meet the deadlines specified by the countries. A decision may
not postponed to committee meetings, but should be in the context
of the regular management. Incidentally are
information subject to transparency requirements from the professional chambers
to be published in the existing registers of information.

324

(No) information access to economic chambers

The freedom of information officers in Germany therefore call for the
professional chambers to meet their transparency obligations
to comply."

I therefore call on the state parliament and the state government to provide information
vis-à-vis the chambers of commerce in Hesse
open by law.

325

Excessive freedom of information requests

4. Excessive Freedom of Information Requests
Excessive freedom of information requests
Excessive freedom of information requests must be handled by public authorities
not disclosed in accordance with the Hessian freedom of information law
become. This is also appropriate because even in data protection law
those affected (after all by data processing) have no claim
have access to information in the event of excessive requests for information.

An example
At the beginning of 2022, the Darmstadt regional council informed me about
the following freedom of information request that he had received, and
asked for advice. The request was worded as follows:

“A request is made to allow me access to information on the following
grant questions:
1. How many external service providers does your authority have in 2019

and commissioned in 2020?

2. Which specific external service providers have been commissioned?
3. For which specific tasks/consultation/services

were the external parties commissioned?

4. Which respective costs (total in gross, net and sales tax
he) are for the respective externals for which respective task/
Advice/service created?

5. What was the content of the respective contracts of the respective ex-

to the respective tasks/consulting/service?”

The Darmstadt Regional Council was of the opinion that the disclosure
this application is associated with a disproportionate effort, and
it therefore intended to reject this request for access to information
modest. I did not raise any objections to this, because the Hessian
Freedom of information sees in § 85 HDSIG for such constellations
refusal to proceed by the public authority.

§ 85 HDSIG
"(2) (...) An application that is aimed at general official action and relates to domestic
information relates to a large number of file processes or information carriers
need to be collected, may be refused if access to information
would only be possible with disproportionate administrative effort."

327

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
5. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

This provision in the Hessian freedom of information law makes perfect sense.
Because even in data protection law, which after all is about the processing
12
Para. 5 DS-GVO excessive requests for information are not met.

Art. 12 GDPR
(5) (...) In the case of ... excessive requests from a data subject, the controller may ...
refuse to act on the application.

So if even in data protection law, when it comes to the processing of personal
son-related data of those affected, the responsible bodies
Excessive requests - despite the associated processing of the data -
the fundamental rights affected - do not have to comply, then it is only
quite appropriate to also provide for this in the right to information, because
there the freedom of information requests are basically “unconditional”,
i.e. without being legally affected, are permissible and according to § 87 HDSIG
In accordance with Sections 80 et seq. HDSIG.

Excessive freedom of information requests and municipal
Statutory autonomy
Subsequent to the process at the Darmstadt Regional Council
As a result of many municipal (advice) requests, it turned out that
the applicant, at least in Hesse, also submits his application across the board
had sent to other Hessian municipalities. Since most municipalities
in Hesse no freedom of information statutes within the meaning of Section 81 (1) No. 7
HDSIG have issued, they are not even to the decree of the
Applicant obligated (was) since the obligatory to the decision
Regulation of § 87 HDSIG for these municipalities without statutes also not
is applicable. Nevertheless, I have suggested to the municipalities that the applicant
to the non-applicability of the right to information in municipalities without
refer to the statute.
That excessive requests for information access in the municipal area
for the municipal motivation to enact freedom of information statutes,
are not conducive is evident and for my opposite concern
counterproductive, for a spread of freedom of information to local
ler level to plead. In this context, however, I can at least
mention positively that now the state capital Wiesbaden
issued a freedom of information statute.
