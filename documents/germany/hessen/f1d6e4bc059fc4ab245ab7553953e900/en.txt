The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI) Professor Ulrich Kelber said: "We have received questions as to how data protection can be implemented with legal certainty in this special situation. I am glad that the data protection supervisory authorities can now make a joint recommendation on this. Information about our health is very sensitive data. Anyone who collects or processes such data must be aware of their special responsibility. As long as the measures taken by employers and employers are proportionate, data protection does not stand in the way of infection control. Because the health of citizens Citizens are the focus now."
Data can be collected and used in accordance with data protection regulations for various measures to contain the corona pandemic or to protect employees. For example, personal data may be collected from employees in order to prevent the virus from spreading among the workforce as best as possible. It is also possible to collect personal data from guests and visitors.
