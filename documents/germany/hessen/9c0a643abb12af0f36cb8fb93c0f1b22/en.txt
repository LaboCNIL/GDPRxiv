The personal data collected on the basis of the Corona Contact and Operational Restriction Ordinance is to be used exclusively for tracking infection chains. The Hessian representative for data protection and freedom of information, Prof. Ronellenfitsch, expressly points this out again. The strict earmarking clearly results from Section 4 Paragraph 1 No. 2 b) of the aforementioned regulation, which merely repeats and reaffirms the constitutionally anchored general principle of earmarking when processing personal data.
The data collection forms circulated by the Chambers of Industry and Commerce and the Hotel and Restaurant Association rightly contain a reference to this earmarking.
Irrespective of the legal situation, Prof. Ronellenfitsch considers the use of the contact data collected in this context for investigative purposes by the police to be extremely problematic. In his opinion, the behavior supported by reason and a sense of responsibility on the part of the Hessian population and the acceptance of the serious restrictions on informational self-determination can be explained by the justified assumption that the interventions are only temporary, isolated measures. This trust should not be jeopardized by misappropriating the intervention measures. It should be taken into account that the provision of correct contact details could be jeopardized by improper use, which is to be expected at any time, and thus the important tracking of infections.
