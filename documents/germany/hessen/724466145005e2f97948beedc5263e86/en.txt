In the past, intervention in the personal data of those affected could be justified by their consent. The decision had to be voluntary and only served one's own interests. Volunteering is also required for the warning app. Consent is given here out of shared responsibility for the health of others. In the case of voluntariness, aspects other than personal interests must therefore be taken into account. Nevertheless, the voluntariness must not be misused by considering other purposes. For example, it must not be made an admission requirement for public or private institutions.
