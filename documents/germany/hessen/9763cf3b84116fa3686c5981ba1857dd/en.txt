Comments of the new HBDI Prof. Dr. Alexander Rossnagel
To revitalize data protection after the pandemic has subsided
Since March 1st, 2021 I have held the office of Hessian Commissioner for
data protection and freedom of information. In this respect, the responsibility lies with
the period that the present 49th activity report of the Hessian
Data Protection Officer and the 3rd Activity Report of the Hessian
mandates for freedom of information covers, with the previous incumbent
Prof. Dr. Michael Ronellenfitsch. Since both reports but during my term of office
be published, I would like for these reports some – rather forward-looking
directed – considerations on the tasks and organizational development
of the Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
hold onto.
The protection of the fundamental rights of persons affected by data processing
has gained importance and attention. Its importance increases
because digitization leads to more intensive processing of personal
gener data leads. Greater attention is paid to data protection because
the European data protection law new obligations of the persons responsible and
extended rights of the persons concerned also with effective action
and possible sanctions of data protection supervision.
Nevertheless, the implementation of data protection is becoming increasingly difficult and
causes new challenges for the Hessian data protection supervisory authority.
The main reasons for this are the following developments:
On the one hand, the risks for the fundamental rights to data protection and
informational self-determination qualitatively and quantitatively. The digital
le capturing of everyday life through the Internet of Things (e.g.
through networked automobiles, smart meters, smart homes and smart offices,
language assistants, health apps) and requires additional ones

and citizens uses.
On the other hand, digitization causes additional problems for those responsible

overwhelm. The demand for data protection obligations may, however, result

data protection-compliant solutions are found that also include data protection in
small and medium-sized enterprises and in small communities.
Thirdly, global networking brings with it new challenges,
if it should not lead to a reduction in data protection. Here
the European Court of Justice gives the data protection supervisory authorities new
Tasks. According to its jurisprudence, every responsible person who
personal data in countries outside the European Economic
schaftsraum, ensure that there the protection of fundamental rights
related to the personal data in a comparable way
is guaranteed. This requirement is for transmissions to many states
a problem. For the United States, the Court has expressly stated that
because of the unlimited access possibility of the security authorities and
intelligence services and because of the lack of legal protection for those affected
People from Europe do not have a comparable level of data protection there.
This creates the new challenge of transferring data in
to stop the United States. Indirectly, the Court has set the objective
to reduce the existing dependency on providers from the USA and in
the Union to achieve the greatest possible digital sovereignty:
Those responsible may only use information technology that
enables us to meet data protection requirements. Without
Making companies and authorities incapable of working can only do this
be achieved if functionally equivalent alternatives become available in the internal market
the information technology systems from the USA are offered.
Finally, the corona pandemic has made the implementation of data protection
legal requirements made difficult. She forced and forces to be more social

To revitalize data protection after the pandemic has subsided

digital solutions are used - without paying attention to data protection.
As a result, data protection has been reduced significantly and across the board.
Nevertheless, the supervisory authorities have these solutions due to the
temporarily tolerated due to social emergency. If the Corona
Pandemic is over and normal social conditions are back
prevail, these digital solutions will lose importance,
but not disappear because they have largely proven their suitability
have. But then it will also be necessary to use all the solutions found
put to the test and to the data protection requirements
adjust gene.
The Hessian data protection supervisory authority must meet these challenges
set in the years to come. She hopes for understanding and
even the support of public and private bodies
in Hessen. Because: Private offers and public fulfillment of tasks are
dependent on trust. This can only be achieved through a data protection
fair digitization. Therefore it is necessary in the development of
Information technology projects as early as possible, a data protection-compliant
to strive for and in the case of (corona-related) undesirable developments
seek constructive corrections.
In order to be able to master these challenges, the supervisory
authority in Hesse requires a suitable framework for action. This
is mainly determined by the Europeanization of data protection. The
The European legal framework offers fundamentally helpful foundations and
instruments. In order to be able to use them properly, however, there are organizational
Adjustments in data protection supervision required:

is also able to succeed in the subsequent court cases

and oversees the judicial process. This is why this one is too

Special government mailbox
The establishment of only one special authority mailbox per municipality
is not acceptable under data protection law.

According to § 6 paragraph 1 of the regulation on the technical framework
of electronic legal transactions and via the special public authority mailbox
(ERVV) can be the authorities and legal entities of the public
right (PO box owner) for the transmission of electronic documents
a secure transmission channel, a special electronic authority
use the mailbox used to communicate with the courts.
The city of Frankfurt drew my attention to the fact that the
Hessian Center for Data Processing (HZD) per municipality only
want to set up such an official mailbox. The city has this from data-
from a protective law point of view and the establishment of a central
PO box at the main office for all other offices (social welfare office, youth welfare office,
health department etc.) referred to as a step backwards under data protection law,
since previously the offices could be addressed individually. Especially where special
sensitive data would be processed would be through the "central post office" at
special authority mailbox, a body gain knowledge of data that
had not previously been accessible to her.

17

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information

I agree with this view and voiced my concerns
presented to the HZD. This argued that the restriction
to only one special electronic authority mailbox per authority
result directly from § 6 ERVV, since the authorities and "a"

The concept of authority is to be interpreted in the context of the procedural rules, i. H.,

that with the establishment of several special authority mailboxes at one
Municipality the risk of incorrect addressing increases.
The HZD's interpretation of the concept of authority is data-
not legally tenable. I already have in my activity reports
stated in the past that from the point of view of data protection from
functional authority concept is to be assumed. I have this against him

the opposite. Both are responsible for their own data protection
Bodies (albeit under the umbrella of the city administration) that are completely
different legal bases work and accordingly
the requirements of Art. 5 Para. 1, 24, 25 and 32 GDPR
have that their data is not available without an appropriate legal basis
be transmitted to the respective office. However, this would be just for one
the case. All data went through the main office.
However, a city government is not exactly an informational entity.

Incidentally, I have made the Ministry aware that
the notice from the Federal Ministry of Justice that there is only one per authority
there could be a special official mailbox, by no means nationwide
will be followed, since both federal authorities and local authorities in
other federal states have long since had several special official mailboxes

In any case, the federal government has regulatory competence for the municipalities
not to.

Commissioning of external service providers within the scope of Section 6a (3) KAG
The commissioning of external service providers within the scope of § 6a KAG is subject
the general data protection regulations.

In the summer of 2020, several citizens came forward and complained about
a letter from their local government to introduce a recurring
running road contribution. In this cover letter, the citizens were
and citizens are asked to provide information about their properties and their concrete
to do construction. For this purpose, an attached questionnaire should be filled out
and to a private service provider commissioned by the municipality
be sent. The complainants had reservations about this
course of action and asked whether this course of action was legally permissible
and whether they are obliged to a commissioned service provider
disclose their personal information. In the example to me
sent seven-page cover letter no explanation was found

no relevant data protection notice.
A basic option for commissioning external service providers

Official e-mail addresses for teachers
One of the demands I have made for years to improve data
protection in schools is the Hessian Ministry of Education (HKM)
complied with in the reporting year. The introduction of official e-mail addresses
for the Hessian teachers significantly improves their work situation
and makes their data processing more secure.

A business e-mail account with the name of the person concerned
is established in almost all areas of public administration.
Since then, teachers have been an exception. Maybe this was
due to the special work situation of the teachers, who have no
job in the traditional sense and essential activities,
such as B. the preparation of lessons or correction of exams, in the domestic
common area. In any case, the official e-mail account was over
for many years and despite my repeated interventions for the HKM
no problem. Therefore, it was partly the school authorities that gave the employees

After that, the data integration system creates a new user account for the

During the examination process it became apparent that the use of the biometric

GDPR violated. I have therefore informed the person responsible that I
intend to use my powers under Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO
close. Specifically, I considered the person responsible

45

49. Activity report on data protection

to instruct the processing method biometric timekeeping
by means of fingerprints by obtaining effective declarations of consent
to bring the employees' genes into line with the GDPR, cf. Art. 58
Paragraph 2 lit. d GDPR, or to impose a ban, cf. Article 58 Paragraph 2 lit. f
GDPR. In addition, I have informed the person responsible that
due to the identified violations of the provisions of the GDPR
Sanctions according to Article 58 Paragraph 2 lit. i i. In conjunction with Article 83 Paragraph 4 Letter a, Paragraph 5 Letter a
GDPR must be checked.
The person responsible then informed me that he
drive biometric time recording set and through an RFID
replaced the time recording system.
My decision was based on the following questions and considerations:

I. What are biometric data within the meaning of Art. 4 clause
14 GDPR and these are special
personal data within the meaning of Art. 9 DS-GVO?

The European legislator has introduced the concept of biometric data in
Art. 4 No. 14 GDPR defined. Biometric data are included hereafter
personal data obtained through special technical processes
the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a person
natural person who uniquely identifies that natural person
Enable or confirm person, such as facial images or dactylosco-
physical data (procedure for evaluating fingerprints). Typical
are personal characteristics within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 14 DS-GVO
like fingerprint, iris, retina, face, hand geometry or even that
palm vein pattern.
Art. 9 Para. 1 DS-GVO contains a general ban on processing for
special categories of personal data. This includes after
The wording of the regulation also includes the biometric data described above
to uniquely identify a natural person.

II. Biometric recording of working hours using fingerprints –

How does this work?

With the term fingerprint, the imprint of the so-called papillary ridges
described on the end phalanx of a finger. These papillary ridges can be
differentiated by various features: basic pattern, rough features
male, finer features such as forking and line endings (so-called minutiae)
and pore structure.

46

Employee data protection, social affairs

Due to the different characteristics as well as their individual
distribution is based on the uniqueness of each person’s fingerprint
went.
If the fingerprint is to be used - for example for recording working hours -
This usually means that using a fingerprint reader initially
fingerprint analysis is performed. Here the minutiae
filtered out. Using special algorithms, the minutiae are converted into a
mathematical form (feature vector 1). The feature vector 1
is then saved, e.g. B. in a database or on a
chip card. There is no specific fingerprint from feature vector 1
more reconstructable. If the fingerprint is then read in again
imprint, the system calculates a feature vector based on the minutiae
2 and a comparison value (threshold value) between feature vectors 1 and 2.
Exceeds the calculated comparative value of the two feature vectors
a certain degree of coverage, the person is recognized and the recording
planning of working hours started or ended using a fingerprint.
The position paper contains detailed information on this topic
on the biometric analysis of the conference of independent data protection
Commissioned by the federal and state governments from April 3rd, 2019, which is about the
DSK website at https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/
oh/20190405_oh_positionspapier_biometrie.pdf.

III. Why does the biometric recording of working hours using

fingerprint in the underlying case against the
Provisions of the GDPR?

1. The reservation of permission and the prohibition principle of the GDPR, see Article 5

Paragraph 1 i. In conjunction with Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 9 (1) GDPR

Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a to f DS-GVO describes the principles for the processing
processing of personal data. According to Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO
personal data lawfully, fairly and fairly
and processed in a manner that is comprehensible to the data subject
(“lawfulness, fair processing, transparency”).
The regulation of Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO determines that the
Processing of personal data only if there is a legal
permit is permissible (so-called reservation of permit). The rule
of Article 6 (1) lit. a - f) GDPR contains the permissions that
can justify the processing of personal data.
For the processing of special categories of personal data, where-
down also biometric data within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 14 DS-GVO fall,

47

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
49. Activity report on data protection

the legal requirements are even stricter: Art. 9 para. 1 sentence 1 DS-
GVO prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data
data (prohibition principle). A final list of exceptions
of the ban on processing contains Art. 9 Para. 2 DS-GVO.
Based on the case described, it follows that - if for the
biometric time recording system using fingerprints at the responsible
Literally no exception of Art. 9 Para. 2 DS-GVO applies - the
use of the system is prohibited, see Article 9 (1) GDPR.

2. Why are the prerequisites for an exception in the sense

of Art. 9 Para. 2 DS-GVO i. in conjunction with Section 26 (3) sentence 1 BDSG?

As already mentioned at the beginning, the person responsible within the framework of
Hearing procedure submitted that he was in favor of the introduction of the system
tems decided after it was used by the one previously in use
Time attendance system repeatedly subjected to abuse and manipulation
individual workers came. To remedy this - what
not least in the interest of law-abiding employees -,
a tamper-proof system had been introduced.
Due to the stated purpose, the person responsible represented the
Opinion that as the legal basis Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. b DS-GVO for
turn. The provision contains an exception to the prohibition of
Processing of special categories of personal data, e.g. for the
If the processing is necessary for the person responsible to
can exercise the rights to which he is entitled under labor law. through the in
The addition contained in the provision "insofar as this is required by Union law or the
law of the member states (...) is permissible" makes the European law
lender clearly that Art. 9 (2) (b) GDPR is a Union law or
member state regulation required. The rule is in itself
therefore no legal basis for the processing of special categories
personal data allowed.
For the area of employee data protection, such a rule contains
However, § 26 Para. 3 Sentence 1 BDSG applies. According to the wording of the provision, the
Processing of special categories of personal data within the meaning
of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR for employment purposes
Among other things, permissible if they are used to exercise rights under the
labor law is required and there is no reason to believe that
the legitimate interest of the data subject in the exclusion of
Processing predominates (cf. also BT-Drs. 18/11325, 102).

48

Employee data protection, social affairs

On the one hand, the concept of necessity is central here: According to the will
of the German legislator are part of the necessity test
the affected fundamental rights positions and conflicting interests
to weigh up the production of practical concordance and to reach a balance
bringing together the interests of the controller and those of the processing
affected persons as far as possible (BT-Drs. 18/11325,
101). This requires an examination based on the scale of the proportional
principle of responsibility, which in turn presupposes that on the part of the responsible
lichen a legitimate purpose is pursued, the processing procedure for the
Realization of this purpose is suitable and it is the mildest of all
means that are equally effectively available (cf. BAG, decision
from April 9th, 2019 – 1 ABR 51/17, 39 = NZA 2019, 1055 (1059)).
In addition to the proportionality test in the context of necessity
there must be no reason to assume that the interests worthy of protection
the employees concerned protect the interests of the person responsible
predominate (BT-Drs. 18/11325, 102).
Only if the above conditions are met can the
Processing of employee fingerprint data for the purpose of
Working time recording on the legal basis of § 26 paragraph 3 sentence 1 BDSG
be supported. Whether a biometric recording of working hours at all
can meet the requirements of Section 26 (3) sentence 1 BDSG is questionable.
As far as the biometric recording of working hours by means of fingerprints
Fulfill the purpose of preventing the manipulation of timekeeping data
should, the requirements of § 26 paragraph 3 sentence 1 BDSG are already in a
Overall view with § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 2 BDSG not fulfilled.
Although the recording of working hours may imply the exercise of rights arising from
serve employment rights, cf. § 26 paragraph 3 sentence 1 BDSG i. V. m. § 611 a paragraph 1 sentence 1
 and 2 BGB. As far as the employer the biometric recording of working hours

the statements of the LAG Berlin-Brandenburg, judgment of 4.6.2020 - 10
Sa 2130/19, 72)? Such an understanding would both of the legal
systematic as well as the sense and purpose of the provision.
In addition, it should be noted that an encroachment on fundamental rights of a high
Intensity can already be disproportionate as such if the intervention
occasion does not have sufficient weight (BVerfG, judgment of 27.02.2008
– 1 BvR 370/07, 244). As far as the intervention to ward off certain dangers
serves, it is decisive for the weight of the reason for the intervention
rank and the type of endangerment of the objects to be protected (as before). The one with the
biometric time registration by means of fingerprints
the personality right is already due to the assessments of Art. 9 Para. 1
GDPR of high intensity, so that the employer's interest in
a "tamper-proof" working time recording using fingerprints
on the other hand, must resign (also LAG Berlin-Brandenburg, judgment
from June 4th, 2020 – 10 Sa 2130/19, 72).

3. Could introduce a biometric time and attendance system

Section 26 (3) sentence 2 BDSG enables the person responsible to process the data

The requirements for an effective declaration of consent should be

In addition, the person responsible for compliance with the principles

(alternative behavior). Especially for the biometric recording of working hours
Therefore, an alternative way of recording time should be provided
(e.g. using a chip card or token).

 – Can an informed declaration of intent be assumed?
This presupposes that the employee is made to understand
the purpose of the processing of his personal data
and how the process works. Looking at accountability
of the person responsible, it is advisable to provide the information in text form in a
to provide clear and simple language. According to § 26 paragraph 3
Clause 1 BDSG, it must also be ensured that the consent
of the employees concerned explicitly to the processing of biometric
shear data.

 – Have the affected employees been informed of their right of withdrawal?
The information about the right of withdrawal is according to § 26 paragraph 2 sentence 3
BDSG in text form.

 – Is employee consent given on a voluntary basis?
§ 26 paragraph 2 sentences 1 and 2 BDSG measure the question of the voluntariness of
Consent is of particular importance in the employment context. This wears
account of the fact that between employer and employee

Therefore, the processing of employee data is not regularly considered (cf. also
Short Paper No. 14 Employee Data Protection of the DSK). Especially if
it is about the question of the voluntariness of the consent to the processing
whose categories of personal data are concerned is according to the will of the
legislator to apply a strict standard (cf. also BT-Drs. 18/11325,
102). Those responsible should therefore ask themselves whether the problem

affects the participant with regard to the planned data processing situation,

Perspective once again expressly and additionally sharpened by
the DS-GVO the special need for protection of children and young people
expressly mentioned in several places (see only e.g. Art. 6 Para. 1
lit. f, Art. 8 or Erw.Gr. 38 GDPR).
In this respect, it is and will remain an important topic for me,
accompanied by complaints and inquiries attentively and critically and,
if necessary, also emphatically towards responsible bodies
for solutions acceptable to data protection authorities.

Facts and legal assessment
In addition to his complaint, the complainant also handed me the
complete support contract of the institution, which he criticized. After
whose critical review I had to vague and
non-transparent regulations under a regulation on data protection
stating On the other hand, the statements made there and
Regulations on the "creation and distribution of photos and films"
in the eye, e.g. B. in particular the following passage:

"By signing this contract, the legal guardians agree
the distribution or public display of recordings on which
your child or yourself can also be seen for the following purposes - also after
Termination of the supervisory relationship – with the proviso that
no legitimate interests of the child and family are affected
become.
 – Using photos, slides created by the staff for
Printed products (e.g. facility concept, letters to parents, annual reports,
chronicles, photo gallery in the protected parent area).

 – Presentation of photos, films, slides that the staff or a
created on behalf of another person, at parents’ evenings, in local
tical committees and other circles of an interested public.
 – Publish photos and film recordings that the staff or

a member of the press created, in press reports about the facility.”

Without going into too much detail, large parts of the regulations for
Data protection and the handling of photo and film recordings to or completely
indefinite ("general statements"), so that e.g. B. effective consent

58

Employee data protection, social affairs

the parents/guardians could not be granted at all, because
they do not recognize the extent of data processing by the carrier and
could estimate. They simply weren't able to see
to know exactly what they should give their consent to.
Also the “unrestricted” possibility of use mentioned in the contract
of personal data for internal purposes or even among themselves
between the various subsidiaries (day care centers)
had to be addressed as unacceptable.
Finally and not least, this also applied to the passage quoted above,
which must be considered unacceptable under data protection law.
I therefore have the operator of the day-care center(s) with my concerns
confronted. In a short-term first reaction to my related
Letter from the legal counsel of the person responsible then -
quite fortunately – one of my concerns and clear indications
grateful, constructive processing of the contract as a whole
and the topic "Creating and distributing photos and films"
emerge as a focus.
The pronounced willingness to cooperate, especially in the form of opposing and
Recording my criticisms with immediate adjustment and implementation in
the contract there quickly turned out to be positively remarkable
reliable in terms of content.
In this way – a brief list of examples follows – one of the required

of the coupling ban according to Art. 7 Para. 4 DS-GVO - from the contract on the

designed to meet the requirements of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter a, Article 7 GDPR
and § 22 KUG is sufficient. Among other things, also certain situations
in which recordings are considered or made at all,
selected and precisely defined.
Also - also in connection with the photo and video recordings
– the IT security concept was again critically examined, revised and new
implemented.
The result was mutual and consistently constructive
Cooperation between the carrier and me within a short time both
the contract as well as the technical and organizational measures
revised in accordance with data protection regulations and quickly put into practice,

so that I do not use my powers under Art. 58 DS-GVO
had to do.

Conclusion
Contract regulations or declarations of consent in day-care centers
or kindergartens are from a data protection supervisory authority perspective
often problematic or even - in some cases - unacceptable because
they do not meet the data protection requirements. Because it is for this
for various reasons there is and cannot be a uniform pattern,
this topic will continue to concern me. However, this can
also give pleasure once in a while when I meet an approachable, cooperative

Conclusion
When using internal e-mail distribution lists in public or private

Data protection in connection with the obligation to wear a mask

Over the past year I have received a large number of inquiries related to
the implementation of the obligation to cover mouth and nose that has been in force since May 2020
in shops. The following post provides information on how I use the citizens
advised in this area.

When it comes to the obligation to wear a mouth and nose cover (mask

According to § 1 a of the Ordinance on the Restriction of Social Contacts
and the operation of facilities and offers due to the co-
rona pandemic (Corona Contact and Operational Restriction Ordinance,

The exceptions to this obligation can be found in Section 1a (3) CoKoBeV. There-

The principle of anonymity in transplantation law
The principle of anonymity applies in German transplantation law
between organ donors or their relatives and organ recipients.
It can also be done with the express consent of the data subjects
this principle cannot be broken. Correspondence is permitted
between relatives of the organ donors and organ recipients through
anonymous letters.

A relative of a deceased organ donor complained in his
Submission about the withholding of a letter by the German Foundation
Organ Transplantation (DSO). The DSO is the nationwide coordination
site for postmortem organ donation. She received a letter back in 2016
of an organ recipient, which was addressed to the submitter.
The DSO was initiating corresponding letters at the time due to the unclear
Legal position no further. Only after a corresponding change in the law
of the Transplantation Act, the letters were anonymized and sent to the
recipient sent. The submitter also received with some delay
the letter from the organ recipient. He questioned in his submission under

the DSO that, despite the corresponding consent, the cancellation of the
Anonymity is not allowed here.

Legal Assessment
In the German transplant system, the principle of anonymity applies between
cal organ donors or their relatives and organ recipients. In the
Transplantation Act (Act on Donation, Removal and Transfer
of organs and tissues from September 4, 2007, Federal Law Gazette I p. 2206, TPG)
§ 14 para. 2 sentence 3 regulates a strict earmarking requirement:

“The personal data collected under this law
may not be processed for purposes other than those specified in this law

Even the consent of the persons concerned can prevent the use of the

Strict prohibition of disclosure is punishable (§ 19 Abs. 3 Nr. 3 TPG).
Therefore, the withholding of the letters by the DSO was data protection law
not to complain about. Due to the anonymity requirement and the strict

not possible for anonymous communication.
Only with the introduction of the new § 12a TPG on April 1st, 2019 did it become clear

Legal background
The German legislator considers the anonymity between organ recipients

of those affected, but also the trust of the population in the
proper organ recipient selection and the organ and tissue
protect the people and institutions involved in the donation (Spickhoff/Scholz/
Middel, 3rd edition 2018, TPG § 14 para. 1). The impression of a not objective
selection of organ recipients based on certain reasons should be prevented

The anonymity between organ donors and their relatives and

Conclusion
There was no data protection misconduct on the part of the DSO. In the

The cases presented to me for examination concerned the sale of

In principle, the Bank is entitled, as part of a business
cal decision to determine that it will not collect claims itself,
but sold them to a third party. The sale of receivables itself represents
a legal purchase according to § 453 BGB. From this contractual constellation
the buyer of the receivables has a right to the transfer of the
Claim according to §§ 398 ff. BGB and for transmission of the claim data
by the seller in accordance with § 402 BGB, so that he can meet the claim
can assert against the debtor.

§ 402 BGB
The previous creditor is obliged to provide the new creditor with the information necessary to assert the

Deliver documents in his possession.

According to § 402 BGB, the previous creditor (receivable seller,
here the bank) obliged to pay the new creditor (receivables buyer,
here the debt collection company) the corresponding claim data and
to submit the necessary documents.
Since this is a legal obligation, the data
transmission based on the provisions of Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR i. in conjunction with Section 402
BGB are supported. Consequently, there is also consent to the transmission
not necessary on the part of the person concerned.

a signature of the guest is not permitted. manifestly incorrect information,
such as pseudonyms or "joke names" do not meet the requirements of the
CoKoBeV. However, since incorrect information was often given,
was introduced in a later version of the CoKoBeV (valid from October 19, 2020,
GVBl. p. 717) also added a regulation according to which the guests
are obliged to provide the data completely and truthfully and they

After the collection, the guest data is protected against inspection
to be stored by third parties, for example in a locked cupboard or safe,
to which as few people as possible should have access.

Since the guest data for a period of one month from the start of the visit
are to be kept available, it is advisable to keep the guest data accurate to the day and
to destroy them one month after the guest's visit. if the
competent authority the release of the guest data before the end of the
Month has requested, the guest data are to be handed over to them and
then to be destroyed immediately.
The guest data are regularly sent to the health authorities, in urgent cases
the local regulatory authorities, cf. § 7 CoKoBeV. The
Data may not be transmitted to any other body. These are too
not for any other purpose, such as making phone calls as a result of an unpaid

is that third parties do not gain knowledge of the guest data,
tearing it up by hand or simply throwing it away is sufficient

largely meet the data protection requirements.
The survey is carried out almost continuously in paper form on individual sheets.

mostly conscious. However, there were often uncertainties about
the correct retention period of one month. A release of
data was denied without exception.
Furthermore, in cooperation with DEHOGA Hessen e. V
corresponding information on the collection of guest data at restaurants
distributed.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of this data collection practice
and the intended use of Corona tracking data for advertising
I have pointed out to the restaurant operator that the

may only be used for the purpose of corona tracking.
Advertising use of the collected data is subject to the regulation

In addition, for effective consent in accordance with Art. 4 No. 11 DS-GVO

the framework set by the selected e-mail provider should only be difficult

The SDM includes the mentioned manual and will be gradually
reference measures added. Each reference measure includes a
provision of a technical-organizational measure by means of which a
data protection compliant processing is to be guaranteed.
In 2020, more reference measures were published, which frequently
also referred to as building blocks. The new building blocks relate
to the "retention", the "correction", the "restriction of a processing
processing" and "separating" as a specification of protective measures
for data protection-compliant implementation of processing activities. The
The designations now chosen for these measures are intended to clarify
that in the concrete implementation of data protection requirements
various activities by those responsible or the order processors
tern are required. Technical and organizational measures must be taken to ensure that
Measures regularly in the operation of the systems and services for a period of time
be subject to regular revision. This is in the already referenced
created data protection management. In addition, the reference measures

The SDM manual basically offers through the description of protective

Reporting data breaches to the police – application of the
Section 60 HDSIG in practice
Since the HDSIG came into force (May 25, 2018), there has also been a reporting obligation
for violations of the protection of personal data in the field of
Directive (EU) 2016/680.

Examples of reportable facts:
 – A police officer asks numerous questions without official reference
Cases of several family members in the police information system
and in the registration register.

 – A police officer asks his ex-wife in the Mel-
deregister to find out whether these
is remarried.

 – An employee of the police wants to organize a class reunion
and queries several people in the population register in order to
to obtain writings.

communicated the result to his wife.

 – An employee of the police wants to rent an apartment and
checks the interested parties in the police information system, since they

Repeated violations of the regulations on the rights of data subjects

legal problem in Hesse.

often happened in the past that employees of public bodies
fetch data from official systems and obtain them for official purposes
use information for private purposes. So I have in the reporting year
22 administrative offense proceedings against employees of the Hessian police
and two proceedings against employees of job centers
initiated in Hesse. Most of these operations are still in progress
investigation or hearing stage.
The number of procedures against employees of the Hessian police was
taken as an opportunity, in cooperation with the Hessian Ministry
of the interior and for sport as well as the individual police headquarters the processes
improve in the investigative process. I therefore expect a speedy one
completion of these cases.
Another essential part of the procedures I initiated dealt with

new proceedings pending.
Also issues related to the current corona pandemic
were the subject of the administrative offense proceedings to be punished by me.
These cases often involved improper use of data,
which were collected using so-called "corona lists". In individual cases
driving, where the seriousness of the offense as well as the overall circumstances
of the case allowed this, I decided accordingly for reasons of opportunity

Corona tests
After filing a criminal complaint by the person concerned and submission
of the proceedings by the public prosecutor's office, I was dealt with a case
which was about excess staff in the non-public area. The incident
occurred in a company that was in a test center COVID-19
tests performed. The affected employee contacted shortly after the test
a young lady via whatsapp to get to know her. The responsible
identified himself as an employee of the company and raved about
their "charisma", which is also the reason for the procedural
contact was. As part of the investigations carried out,
the identity of the employee can be established beyond doubt.
In the present case, the employee in question used the
conducting a corona test, the data provided by the complainant
for private purposes and thus violated the principle of earmarking
Article 5(1)(b) GDPR. After that, personal data for
specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and must not
processed in a way that is incompatible with these purposes
become. The contact details of the patients as part of the corona test
rens are to be collected and stored solely for the purpose of
to inform these persons of the test result and, if necessary
in a positive case, contact by the competent authorities
allow health authorities. The use of this data to others
purposes is not permitted. The procedural contact
via WhatsApp was present to fulfill the of the accused
tasks not required. An exception after
Art. 6 para. 4 GDPR was not relevant. There was also consent from
the complainant to the use of their data for other purposes
no time before.
This violation was not within the scope of entrepreneurial activity
attributable to the employer. The employee committed the irregular
Act from his workplace, using the resources available to him
available work equipment, but not in the exercise of his professional
activity, but exclusively for private purposes.
The violation was reported by me in accordance with Article 83 (5) (a) GDPR i. in conjunction with Art. 5

Due to the circumstances, a fine in the lower range appeared in individual cases
of the fine framework of Art. 83 Para. 5 DS-GVO with € 300.00 as effective,
sufficiently dissuasive and proportionate. The fine is
not yet legally binding.
In my 48th activity report, under item 15.1, I already reported
comprehensive about the excess of employees in the public sector. based on
Case described here, it becomes clear that this type of irregular
trade is also present in the non-public area and for self-

the same principles apply in this regard.

Fine for repeated violations of the duty to provide information
I was contacted against a small corporation based in Hesse
several complaints from citizens alleging violations of the
Rights of data subjects according to Art. 15 i. in conjunction with Art. 12 GDPR. After
two of these complaints were finally examined in the supervisory procedure and
If violations were confirmed, I initiated fine proceedings. In one case
the complainant requested the provision of information under Art. 15
DS-GVO and the deletion of his data according to Art. 17 DS-GVO. After

three months - informed.
In both cases, contrary to Art. 15 DS-
GVO no information on the personal data of the data subject
granted within the period of Art. 12 Para. 3 S. 1 DS-GVO. The two violations
were by me according to Art. 83 Para. 5 lit. b i. in conjunction with Art. 15 i. In conjunction with Art. 12 Para. 3

Among other things, the responsible company benefited from the fact that
only one customer was affected by the incidents
the facts have been admitted and regretted and the proceedings
lasted an average amount of time.
In order to increase the fine, however, it had to be taken into account that the two
violations at issue occurred in quick succession. This
indicated a systematic error or an organizational problem
in the company and an increased level of breach of duty by the person responsible
towards. This was supported by the fact that in both cases the lawful procedure
when processing requests for information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO
was secured. Furthermore, it had a negative impact on the company

So that the fine has the effect intended by Art. 83 Para. 1 DS-GVO

does not constitute a disproportionate burden. After weighing all the pros and

Development of remedial powers according to Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO
For supervisory practice and also for those responsible and
arbeiter was the remedial instrument according to Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO in
still new territory for the first two years. The development in the year under review shows
clearly that slowly a routine in the application of the available
existing wide range of measures according to Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO occurs.

Art. 58 Para. 2 GDPR

or to an international organization.

i)

j)

The concept of Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO is for the supervisory practice
big win to ensure compliance with GDPR norms.
From the conception of the standard it is clear that the supervisory authority does not
only fines are available for violations of the GDPR
to react. The remedial measures according to Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO are
in the overall package what the sharp blade of the sword of supervision
matters.
In addition to the possibility of warning according to Art. 58 Para. 2 lit
gives the supervisory authority the option to prevent a violation
take action, the remedial measures under Article 58 (2) lit. b to j
GDPR if a violation has been identified.
The powers of remedial action according to Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. b - j can in turn
divided into sanctions and measures.
The focus of supervisory action is on shutting down the
violation. This is usually followed by an examination as to whether there is a sanction
may, and the decision on which sanction in the specific individual case
should be applied. In exceptional cases, this can already be closed
take place at an earlier point in time.

Measures
The measures according to Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. c-h and j DS-GVO can be structured
tour They reveal a system that has escalation levels.
The instruction according to Art. 58 Para. 2 lit c DS-GVO refers specifically to the
Applications made in the context of the rights of those affected. If for example
wrongly refuses to provide information in response to an application under Art. 15 GDPR
then I can instruct the responsible body to deal with this matter
to fulfill. If the instruction is not fulfilled, I have the option of the
Combine decision with administrative coercive measures.
With Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. d GDPR, the regulation gives me the opportunity

specific manner and within a specific period of time in accordance with
bring the GDPR. If this measure is unsuccessful,
there is an escalation level for this. Because then measures according to Art.
58 Para. 2 lit. f DS-GVO may be suitable for a data protection
to achieve shape state. Then there is a situation that may
would justify the processing temporarily or under certain circumstances
to even finally restrict or even issue a ban on processing
to speak. This must be checked in each individual case.
I have not yet had to express measures according to the letters g, h, j
chen. Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. g DS-GVO grants me the right to have the correction
or deletion of personal data or restriction of
Processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and informing the recipient
catcher to whom this personal data is transferred in accordance with Art. 17 Para. 2 and Art.
19 were disclosed to inform about such measures. That would
basically the escalation level to a measure according to Article 58 (2) lit. c
GDPR. Art. 58 (2) lit. h GDPR will play a role in practice,
if the certification according to Art. 42 and 43 DS-GVO is filled with life.
No permits have been granted to date. According to Art. 58 (2) lit. j
DS-GVO I am allowed to suspend the transmission of data to a
Arrange recipients in a third country or an international organization.
But I did not make use of this in the year under review either.

sanctions
In addition to or in lieu of the appropriate measures taken pursuant to this
regulation were imposed, should the supervisory authority impose sanctions
eventually impose fines (see Recital 148 GDPR). In the
case of a minor infringement or if the
hanging fine a disproportionate burden on a natural
Person would cause, instead of a fine, a warning
be granted. The sanctions referred to in recital 148
can be found between the powers of remedial action in Article 58 (2) under letter b
and i DS-GVO again.
I have already heard about the fine proceedings in my 47th and 48th employment
report reported. The fine procedure is the ultima ratio. For minor
violations in the reporting year, I have the option of issuing a
warning exercised. There was always a consideration about that
appropriate, necessary and proportionate means.
In the year under review almost twice as many as in the previous year
warnings issued. The peculiarity of this warning is

163

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
49. Activity report on data protection

that it is pronounced without a warning money. The procedure over the
Warning is based on the Hessian Administrative Procedure Law
law and not according to the provisions of the Administrative Offenses Act. At
my decision on the type of sanction I have the requirements
from Recital 148 S. 3, which deals with the criteria according to Art. 83 Para. 2
DS-GVO largely covered, taken into account and included in my decisions
information about the type of sanction.

16.3
Development of the administrative court proceedings at the HBDI
Since the GDPR came into force in May 2018, the number of administrators has
court proceedings increased sharply. Those affected turned
in the field of credit bureaus against the final decision in the supervisory
procedures, in the field of video surveillance and employee data
protection were the measures adopted in accordance with Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO
and from the area of employee data protection, the determination of
attacked for violations.

Since the beginning of 2019, I have noticed a significant increase in lawsuits
against my supervisory decisions before the administrative court. With the
European data protection reform became the right in Art. 78 Para. 1 DS-GVO
strengthened on effective legal remedy against a supervisory authority and that
before May 25, 2018 rather informal action has turned into an administrative
formal action transformed.

Every natural or legal person has, without prejudice to any other
legal or out-of-court legal remedy, the right to an effective one
judicial remedy against a legally binding decision affecting them

Affected parties and court proceedings

To the statistics
Since the beginning of 2019, 46 administrative court proceedings on data protection
questions have become pending. At the end of 2020 I still had 24 procedures planned
open to the Administrative Court of Wiesbaden (Part I, Item 17.2.).
The court proceedings are carried out by my authority itself, through the legal

Complaints and Advice
The data protection implementation of the requirements of the Corona Ordinance
ments by those responsible, uncertainties on the part of employers and
employees on home office issues, the public discussion about
business models from credit agencies and products from software manufacturers
were topics that were present for almost the entire year.
The so-called Schrems solved further need for advice and inquiries

In addition to the written submissions,
the "quick" way of clarification by telephone information sought. The

non-public area – were urgent if they had to deal with the at short notice

Other miscellaneous tasks
Unaccounted for in the tables above, but no less noteworthy-
valuable tasks and topics that were dealt with in the reporting year
for example:
 – Activities of the internal data protection officer at the HBDI
  There were 35 requests for information from citizens regarding the
processing of their data at the HBDI and 21 corresponding ones
consultations carried out.

 – Regular consultations
  With the internally appointed data protection officers from various
public areas (e.g. of ministries, cities and municipalities and
the European data protection supervisory authorities) were exchanged
maintained and z. T. provided regular consulting services.

 – Press and public relations
  The number of press inquiries increased in 2020 with 153 inquiries

more than tripled compared to 2019 with 49 inquiries.

  Numerous publications and assistance were the responsibility
citizens on the homepage (e.g. in the health
area, for clubs and schools) of the HBDI.

 – training services
  Four trainee lawyers were elected in their elective or

Management stations trained.

 – Training and lectures
  15 data protection training courses, some lasting several days,
Seminars and training courses in the public and non-public sector
carried out.

 – Participation in conferences, working groups and working groups
  Consultations and coordination between the supervisory authorities
and in their bodies at state, federal and EU level, but also
overall with contact persons from non-European third countries,
are now essential for successful data protection in Hesse.
The committee work is sometimes very time-consuming, but no longer
bar. In the times of the Corona lock-downs, personal meetings were held
replaced by video conferencing. The Conference of Data Protection and
The Freedom of Information Officer (DSK) therefore met approximately every two months
on current topics. The 2020 results are in Appendix I

are no longer applicable in addition to the GDPR. A detailed justification
on this legal opinion was published by the DSK in the guidance for

With a view to Art. 5 Para. 3 ePrivacy Directive, the BGH sets § 15 Para. 3 TMG
to the effect that already in the absence of effective consent
such a contradiction can be seen, which is why an active consent
is required. Based on this interpretation of § 15 paragraph 3
TMG he applies this regulation in addition to the DSGVO. Ultimately the
BGH followed the preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice and
confirms the basic requirement of effective consent for
the setting of cookies.
Even the fact that the DSK and the BGH in a very practice-relevant
legal question agree in the result that a processing,
as presented to the courts for decision, requires consent,
however, differ in the derivation of this result
Represented views illustrates the extent of the legal ambiguity.
With the decision, the demarcation of the regulatory areas between

1 Objective of the test
 
Microsoft states that no telemetry data is transmitted to Microsoft if the
Windows 10 Enterprise operating system and the one provided by Microsoft
"Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline" (V1903)1 has been installed.
 
At the end of last year, a telemetry test without user interaction was carried out on Windows 10
Enterprise System (by the Lower Saxony State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD Nieder-
Saxony) and the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA)).
 
This test found that the tele-
metric data can be deactivated when using the Enterprise Version in the checked scenario.2
 
Since telemetry data may only be transmitted when there is user activity, this aspect should now be included in
are taken into account in the present test.
 
For this purpose, the data transmissions that occur are logged (Wireshark3 protocols).
 
It is then examined whether the logs contain connections to the Microsoft
specified endpoints (“Telemetry Connections”).

3 Description of the test procedure
The test simulates 72 hours of operation of the Windows 10 Enterprise notebook.
At different time intervals (which are recorded in a table to the minute),
manual activities on the Windows 10 Enterprise Notebook with different software
components as well as browser activities controlled by a script in order to
to simulate the activities.

A subcomponent of an automatically running PowerShell script is used for this.
The script called "Invoke-UserSimulator" was created to automate the simulation of
processes running on the PC. It is freely available via Github5.
Only the web browsing function of the script is used in this test.

The following user actions are performed:

Automated web browsing

The GitHub tool "Invoke-UserSimulator" automatically starts the browser and "clicks" scripted
controls automatically at certain, fixed intervals, randomly based on predetermined links
(i.e. also entered in the script) websites in order to then (again randomly controlled)
ert) to continue browsing.
In order to carry out the number of IP address requests to be expected in the Wireshark evaluation protocol
not to increase the automated web browsing unnecessarily (and thus the evaluation of the wire
shark protocol more difficult), only one website was selected for the test and
automatically "surfed" by the tool.
The following website was selected and used for automated browsing because this
Website does not connect to other host addresses (IP addresses) when started:

Manually performed activities on the test system during the 72 hours
Testing

In addition to automated web browsing, after a predetermined (and for
subsequent facilitation of the evaluation recorded in an Excel table) schedule over 72 hours
the following activities were carried out manually on the system:

• Create, save, modify and copy Notepad file.
•
•
• Copy and replace files multiple times from and to a connected USB stick.

Control Panel → Event Viewer "System" Randomly select and view events.
Create, save, modify and copy Paint file (drawing).

No third-party products or parts of the Microsoft Office package were intentionally installed
and used for the simulation, since further telemetry traffic to the software
manufacturer can be assumed.

5 test result

Test scenario 1

In the test period of 72 hours, with regular user activity on the system
(incl. web browsing) no connections to the addresses mentioned in chapter 4 were found
become.
A transmission of telemetry data did not take place in this scenario.
 

Test scenario 2

In the test period of only 30 minutes, with regular user activity on the system
system (incl. web browsing) already have connections to v10.events.data.microsoft.com and connections
Connections to settings-win.data.microsoft.com can be found. These connections could
even be detected in an additional 30 minutes test without any user activity
the.
A transmission of telemetry data thus took place as expected.

Test scenario 3

In the test period of 72 hours, with user activity, on the system (including web
Browsing) only connections to settings-win.data.microsoft.com are detected.
A transmission of telemetry data, in particular diagnostic data transmitted to v10
th, has therefore not taken place.

6 Conclusion
These tests could not refute Microsoft's statements that in
no telemetry data is transmitted with the configuration described above. From here
however, the conclusion cannot be drawn that telemetry data transmission is fundamentally
additionally does not take place. Therefore, those responsible are always obliged to check whether the
set of Windows 10 also in your individual system and processing situation
legally permissible.

Special attention should be paid to connections to settings-win.data.microsoft.com,
since there is a possibility that configuration data will be downloaded via this connection
that may cause changes in the behavior of the telemetry service.

the German federal and state data protection supervisory authorities are dealing with the
Question whether and under what configuration options the operating system Windows 10 from
Responsible in Germany can be used. Particular attention is paid to this
on the so-called telemetry data that Windows 10 automatically transmits to Microsoft.

On December 10/11, 2019, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision held a discussion on this topic
a meeting of representatives of the authorities with Microsoft for a technical exchange took place
which the BSI also took part from an IT security perspective. The aim was to make a statement
to find out whether Windows 10 Enterprise can be operated in compliance with data protection regulations. in one
Test setup should also be proven that no unwanted data,
in particular no telemetry data, are no longer transmitted to Microsoft.

The result was that no data was sent to Microsoft in the observed period
were transferred, where there is a particular data protection or IT risk
to go out. Due to the fact that in the experimental setup there was no user interaction and more
technical framework conditions (e.g. domain membership and updates) are reproduced
could be made, the interest was expressed to shed light on these partial aspects again.

The BSI did this in its own test setup with a view to IT security aspects

Since the electronic temperature measurement is aimed at people

such processing of personal health data takes place,
it is strictly forbidden according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. This basic

In addition to the basic processing ban and the exceptions

ferenz, Brief Paper No. 20, Consent according to the GDPR; European
Data Protection Committee, WP 259 rev. 01: Guidance in relation to the

the heat measurement just to detect a possible illness
serves; therefore, the data subject has given their express consent
to explain (cf. Art. 9 para. 2 letter a DSGVO).

Freedom of information is only gradually gaining ground. The number of
claims made for information are still limited. Also have the

Chairman of the Freedom of Information Conference carefully in the year under review
made and saw in it a confirmation of the Hessian model, which

Freedom of information towards the LvV and police authorities

police authorities

Freedom of information towards the LvV and police authorities
It is both for reasons of freedom of information and with a view to
Tasks of the police authorities and the State Office for Constitutional
protection inappropriate, freedom of information claims against them
to exclude positions entirely. As far as the performance of the tasks
of these bodies is not affected, freedom of information is imperative
to ensure.

Last year 2020 I chaired the conferences of the information
Federal and State Commissioner for Freedom of Information (IFK). A thing
of the discussions was the access to information in the federal and state governments
the protection of the constitution and the police. Unfortunately it turned out that
Hessen is not "in front" in this respect, but rather "behind".
This is due to the fact that Hesse has given these authorities any information

Hessian freedom of information regulations on these authorities
legally negated.

§ 81 HDSIG

Tasks of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Police

Support abroad and thus endanger Germany's foreign interests.
The authorities for the protection of the constitution are thus active in domestic reconnaissance.

253

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
3. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

The offices for the protection of the constitution are an important part of the executive branch
in our free democratic constitutional state, just like the police,
which, in particular, in accordance with the police law for security and
is responsible for the prosecution of criminal offenses under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Appropriate limitations on access to information
A regulation in the Hessian freedom of information law would be appropriate,

Such a regulation would become part of the Hessian freedom of information law

In addition, there is another alternative legislative option,
to soften the absolute exclusion of information access in favor of a

Access to information regarding insurance supervision

3. Access to information regarding insurance supervision
Access to information regarding insurance supervision
A right to information access to the Hessian Minis-
terium for social affairs and integration in its function as supervisory authority
for the Unfallkasse Hessen does not exist if the disclosure of the
Information adverse effects on this supervisory task of the
ministry can have.

The Hessian Ministry for Social Affairs and Integration reported to me about
a citizen's freedom of information request submitted to the Minister
terium had submitted and the area of responsibility of the ministry
as the supervisory authority for the Hesse accident insurance fund. Imagine the
Question whether the Ministry in this case as an insurance regulator
with a view to the Hessian freedom of information law, § 82
No. 2 c) HDSIG.

Legal Assessment
The thematization of the Ministry, whether it is in terms of the accident insurance
Hessen is to be classified as an insurance supervisory authority, had its
Reason in the determination of the Hessian freedom of information law that
in such a case there is no right to access information if
the emergence of adverse effects on the supervisory tasks
can have, § 82 No. 2. c) HDSIG.

§ 82 HDSIG
There is no right to access information
(...)
2. for information the disclosure of which may have adverse effects on

c) the control, enforcement or supervisory tasks of the financial, regulatory, savings banks,

insurance and competition regulators

(...)

The term insurance supervisory authority is not defined in more detail in the HDSIG,
and also in the explanatory memorandum to the bill there is reference to this term
no further information (cf. Landtag-Drucks. 19/5728 p. 151 on § 82).
After all, the savings bank supervision is explicitly mentioned in the justification
(loc. cit.), taking into account the regulatory text of § 82 No. 2 c)

257

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
3. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

HDSIG it is finally clear that in the official legal text behind "Sparkas-
sen” the separator was obviously forgotten. Just because of
(correctly meant) naming of the savings bank supervision in the regulation
With regard to savings banks as institutions under public law, it makes sense
that accordingly with insurance companies in this supervisory context
Public insurance companies, i.e. Hessian corporations
of public law are meant. An example here would be the
Unfallkasse Hessen as a statutory accident insurance institution within the meaning of
Social Code VII. Consequently, the Hessian Ministry for
Social affairs and integration with the term insurance supervisory authority in
§ 82 No. 2 c) HDSIG meant in the present context.
From the wording of the term "insurance
insurance supervision” should also consider the private insurance industry,
but it is precisely this insurance supervision that is not the responsibility of the state authorities
assigned, as is the case, for example, with the data protection supervisory
issue of the European General Data Protection Regulation in connection with the
Federal Data Protection Act is the case. Rather, this insurance

based on the Insurance Supervision Act (VAG).
So this shows that the issue of insurance supervision in the private sector
anyway a federal matter and not a state matter.
Against this overall background, it only makes sense to
Security supervision in the Hessian freedom of information law the Hessian
State supervision of the Hessian public insurance sector
understand. That's why I have the Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration
also confirmed in its opinion that in its function as supervisory
authority via the Unfallkasse Hessen an insurance supervisory authority

In early 2020, the civil rights group dieDatenschutz
Zer Rhein Main” states that they are based on a proposal from the alliance
"Freedom of information for Bavaria" a model draft for a municipal
have drawn up a freedom of information statute, with which they
munen in Hesse, especially in the Rhine-Main region,
to promote freedom of information at the municipal level.
In this regard, the civil rights group asked me to share their
comment on the draft design. This “model statute presented to me
Freedom of information for cities and communities in Hesse" is known as "Transpa-
statute on freedom of information for the city/municipality” and
contains eleven individual paragraphs. It is therefore a statutory
concept that is outside of the regulations of the Hessian data protection and
Freedom of Information Act lies.

Legal position of the Hessian freedom of information officer
I have informed the civil rights group that I have contacted their satellite
draft. This has the following background, which I
explained to the civil rights group.
The Hessian legislator regulates in § 81 para. 1 No. 7 HDSIG that the
regulations on access to information also apply to local authorities,
as far as the application of the information freedom regulations
of the law (fourth part, §§ 80 ff. HDSIG) by statute expressly
is determined.

Apart from this main municipal regulation, there are still in the HDSIG
a supplementary provision in § 88 para. 2 HDSIG, which stipulates that in this
In this case, i.e. the express application provision by the articles of association,
the costs are also charged in accordance with the statutes. In § 88 paragraph 2
HDSIG is in the official legal text as a result of an editorial error
not, as would be correct, referred to Section 81 Paragraph 1 No. 7 HDSIG, but
erroneously on "§ 81 sentence 1 No. 6". This error results from the fact that in
Draft law (LT-Drucks. 19/5728) the municipal statute reservation

in § 81 paragraph 1 No. 6 was provided and in the later change in
