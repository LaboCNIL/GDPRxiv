1.1
upheaval
This 47th activity report is the last activity report of the 19th election
period of the Hessian state parliament from 01/18/2014 to 01/17/2019. In this
period there was a fundamental transformation of the European (EU),
German and Hessian data protection law. On 05/25/2018, the day on
when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force
according to Selmayr/Ehmann a new era (DS-GVO commentary, 2nd ed.
2018, introduction para. 1). Even if you think that's an exaggeration, it is
noteworthy that on this day the GDPR and the EU directive for
Justice and Home Affairs (JHA Directive; JHA Directive) by a broader public
only and mostly skeptical.
The skepticism is mainly based on the fact that not only individual provisions
of the GDPR, but generally the requirements of data protection law
were misunderstood. The JL-RL remained largely unknown.

1.2
Consequences for reporting
As a result, the tasks of the data protection supervisory authorities are also reduced
including annual reporting. Until 05/24/2018
were the tasks of the Hessian data protection officer (HDSB) in
§ 24 HDSG 1999 regulated.

(2) The Hessian data protection officer monitors the effects of the automated

of local self-government and between the state and the local government

to prevent such effects.
...

From May 25th, 2018, the tasks of the Hessian supervisor
contributed to data protection and freedom of information from § 13 HDSIG.

§ 13 HDSIG
(1) The Hessian data protection officer monitors the public and not
public bodies and their processors the application of this law, the
Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 and other regulations on data protection, including
according to the legislation adopted to implement Directive (EU) No. 2016/680.
(2) In addition to the tasks under Article 57 of Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679, the
Hessian data protection officer the tasks,

...

The existing awareness-raising and
clarification task is expressly designed as a legal obligation (§ 13 Para. 2
#2 HDSIG). Even under previous law, the HDSB had one per year
submit a written activity report. This resulted from § 30 HDSG.

§ 30 paragraph 1 HDSG 1999
On December 31 of each year, the Hessian data protection officer gave the state parliament and
a report to the state government on the result of its activities in accordance with Section 24 (1) to (3).

Measures according to § 10 and suggests improvements in data protection. interim reports
are allowed. Simultaneously with the report according to sentence 1, the Hessian data protection
commissioned the state parliament to submit a report on its activities in accordance with Section 24 (4).

The reporting obligation of the HBDI is now regulated in § 15 HDSIG.

Section 15 (3) HDSIG
On December 31 of each year, the Hessian data protection officer
te the state parliament and the state government a report on the result of their or
of its activities and suggests improvements in data protection. the or
the Hessian data protection officer makes this report public, the EU

Interim reports for submission to the state parliament and the state government are permissible.

The addressees of the activity report have so far only been the state parliament and state

Their explicit mention makes them secondary addressees who

Hesse
In Hesse, the state data protection law was amended by the
Act to adapt the Hessian data protection law to the Ordinance
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and implementing Directive (EU) 2016/680 and
on freedom of information from May 3rd, 2018 (GVBl. 2018, p. 82). The law is
divided into articles; it is thus an article law. In the article laws
A distinction must be made between "Omnibus Laws" in which different regulations

and BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN for a Hessian adaptation law
of the Hessian data protection law to the regulation (EU) 2016/679 and
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/680 and freedom of information
deals with the adaptation of the Hessian state law to the VO 2016/79,
the implementation of Directive 2016/79 and freedom of information as different
material. But even with the subsequent changes affecting the specialist laws
changes, the law assumes the uniformity of data protection law
out of. In contrast, different objectives were set for data protection
and freedom of information accepted (LTDrucks. 19/5728); more accurate:
Data protection law was only used as a barrier to freedom of information
understood. The draft justification states:
“The citizens of Hesse have a legal right
for access to the official
information. It is not only the protection of operational or
Business secrets guaranteed, but also in particular by
personal data. Because of the close connection between
the information access right on the one hand and data protection
on the other hand, the regulations on access to information as
further part in the Hessian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Act
inserted."
In the course of the legislative process, however, the opinion prevails
by the fact that data protection and freedom of information are not opposites, but

Elements of a comprehensively understood informational self-determination

In the decision mentioned, the BVerfG 2016 redefined, under
what conditions the police authorized data for a purpose

whether regulations of the GDPR or the HDSIG in addition to the area-specific
HSOG regulations apply. The law itself
does not define which specific tasks are not within the scope of

Amendment of the Hessian Constitutional Protection Act
In June 2018, the Hessian state parliament passed extensive changes
ments of the legal regulations for the protection of the constitution. Next to
organizational questions, these also concern fundamental aspects in the
Context of the right to informational self-determination.

In November 2017, as part of a draft law by the Government
factions (LTdrucks. 19/5412) the long-awaited reform of the Hessian language
Constitutional Protection Act (HVSG) brought into the state parliament and then
in December as part of a change request (LTdrucks. 19/5782)
expanded.
A major change concerns the reorganization of the powers of the
protection of the constitution for information collection. A significant impact
on the rights of citizens, which also has the transformation of
information regulation. At the same time, parliamentary control became partial
restructured and regulated in a separate law, however
will not come into force until the beginning of the new legislative period in January 2019.
Before the regulations were introduced in the state parliament, I had no opportunity
to comment on the planned changes. Only during the hearing
in the state parliament I was able to comment on the extent to which it was intended
Regulations and the associated interference with the right to information

as well as that the essential decisions by the legislature itself
are meeting These requirements must be observed in particular
if detailed regulations can only be made through service regulations, also
as far as this is not from the state office, but from the responsible ministry
are to be enacted.
A special focus of my statement was therefore on the regulations
genes that serve to safeguard the rights of those affected. That applies above all
for the possibilities of checking the handling of personal data
data and, in particular, the right of citizens to information.
Here are, in my estimation, limitations of the informational
self-determination that does not do justice to the protection of fundamental rights
the. Clear regulations are also necessary because the general
Data protection regulations for public bodies for the protection of the constitution
do not apply or only apply to a very limited extent.

Criticisms of the new legal regulation
I will single out a few points for which I believe
there is still a need for improvement.

Design of data collection
In contrast to the old regulation, the possibilities for data collection are included

left to a service regulation of the Ministry of the Interior. The regulations

§ 26 HVSG

Data transmission to religious communities to determine the

The municipalities are not authorized to collect the data of all those subject to property tax A
to transmit to the church tax office, so that this the local church tax
can set for the evangelical parishioners.

Two municipalities have contacted my office and asked whether
it is permissible to send the data of all those subject to property tax A to the Evangelical
sche church tax office. The church tax office uses
of the tax data of the municipalities the local church tax for their
members.
Basically, the financial authorities are according to § 31 paragraph 1 sentence 1 tax

Tax amounts to corporations under public law, including
Religious communities that are corporations under public law,
to notify the determination of such taxes, which are due to this taxation

or attach tax amounts. The obligation to notify does not exist insofar as its fulfillment
would involve a disproportionate amount of effort.

This is how it was with the requesting municipalities. Both municipalities
commented that they did not have the necessary staff to process the data

communicated. The church tax office replied that other municipalities
under these circumstances, the data of all those subject to property tax A
would have made available to the church tax office. This then have the
Evaluation of the records taken and the data of the evangelical
Community members extracted.
With this procedure, the church tax office also receives tax
data of taxpayers of other denominations and beliefs
as well as non-denominational. The church tax office is for this group of people
but not authorized to set taxes. In other words: the data
are not necessary for the fulfillment of the tasks of the church tax office and
their transmission is in no way derogated from the legislation cited above
covered.
I have therefore informed the municipalities that I will no longer transfer the data
of the tax data of all those subject to property tax A to the church tax
office to be inadmissible. Only the data of the taxpayers who
belong to the Evangelical Church, would have permissibly belonged to the Church
may be transmitted to the tax office.
A consultation with the Hessian Ministry of Finance put me in
confirmed this view. The Ministry also referred to Section 8
of the Church Tax Act, according to which the state and municipal authorities

The consequence of this is that in this respect the social data protection law

West Hesse was to replace the temporary police facility with a permanently installed

police, but also by the public order office as a danger prevention authority

The design of the monitoring system was viewed critically. In

legal relevance and does not provide a parameter for the depth of intervention
The decisive factor is rather the necessity of the individual cameras

In the present case, the number of cameras was the special building
of the monitored area. It was necessary to avoid that due
areas that cannot be seen due to the somewhat confusing constellation of buildings
develop. Operation and access authorizations could also be clarified.
The now permanently installed system is used by the police and the public order office

This complaint was based on the following facts:
In February 2018, a school authority in Hesse published a

The HAD was founded at the end of the 1990s by the Hes-

all Hessian announcements can be found in full on the HAD.
Furthermore, important procurement regulations, whether guidelines or laws

Thus, the knowledge of the following personal data was also

for these children and the name of the school attended including the
school class of the respective child.
Due to the barrier-free access to this data,
enables companies that do not operate a transport business to
to process the data for your purposes. It would be conceivable here, for example

I reported this to the school board. Then he informed me
to proceed as follows in the future:
For tenders for transport contracts, it is from the school year

essence of the tender. After submitting a confidentiality agreement
the publication then takes place in the second step for the basis of calculation

In addition, such logs would sometimes contain sensitive third-party data

contain. After all, some of these are verbatim reports
which reference is also made to other similar cases.

Legal Acknowledgment
I have the chamber on the regulations of § 29 HVwVfG and § 18 paragraph 5
HDSG advised.

Section 18 (5) HDSG
Are personal data stored in files that lead to the person concerned
then he can inspect the files designated by him at the storing location
demand. ... Inspection is not permitted if the data of the person concerned with data
Third parties ... are connected in such a way that their separation is not or only disproportionately
great effort is possible. ... Incidentally, information can be granted to him instead of inspection.

Section 29 (1) HVwVfG
The authority must allow those involved to inspect the files relating to the procedure
allow, as far as their knowledge to assert or defend their legal
interests is required. ...

As part of a formal administrative procedure, the regulation on
Right of inspection of § 29 HVwVfG takes precedence over § 18 HDSG (see Dem-
bowski in: Schild/Ronellenfitsch/Arlt/Dembowski/Wellbrock/Müller/Piendl/
Topp/Wehrmann: HDSG, § 18, para. 20, 11/2015). That means that until
Completion of the procedure the parties under the conditions of
§ 29 HVwVfG can assert a right to inspect the files. After
At the end of the procedure, the right to information under § 18 HDSG applies
(Dembowski, loc.cit.). According to this, all those affected whose personal
gene data were processed in the process, for information or inspection
entitled under the conditions of § 18 HDSG.
Since the state regulations are higher-ranking law
acts, I informed the chamber that the very narrow provisions of the articles of incorporation
of the chamber for inspection of files were unlawful and therefore not applicable.

file term
Also the position of the chamber, the "non-public protocol of results"
was not part of the file, was not justifiable in my view.
The complaint file is a personal file of the chamber member
(§ 49 Para. 3 Health Care Professions Act). The data protection term "file"
is legally defined in § 2 Para. 7 HDSG:

50

Data protection report until 05/24/2018

§ 2 para. 7 HDSG
A file is any document used to fulfill the task that is not part of the automatic
ted data processing.

The legislature assumes a comprehensive concept of files. The
"Result protocol" gives the content and the result of the consultation of the
shot back to the case in the file. It is used for assessment
of the case and will also be used in the event of any subsequent complaints
kept against the chamber member. It therefore serves the purpose of
performance of the Committee's duties, namely the possible misconduct
of the chamber member to be able to pursue. Should this not be the case,
the record of results would have to be destroyed. The physical separation
of the result log from the file (e.g. through a folder or
a stapler) can be selected from the above reasons not cause this
does not become part of the file in terms of data protection law. Much more
would such a consideration arise from informational self-determination
circumvent the rights to inspect files and information resulting from this right.

Protection of third party data
The Chamber's argument that the "protocols of results" were partially
contain valuable data from third parties, I objected that the legislature
in § 18 para. 5 sentence 3 HDSG I have taken into account exactly such constellations:

§ 18 paragraph 5 sentence 3 HDSG
Inspection is inadmissible if the data of the data subject is combined with data from third parties...
are connected in such a way that their separation is not possible or only with a disproportionately large amount
effort is possible.

A case-by-case examination must always take place here. Allow individual data
cover before inspection or through individual documents for inspection
replace the exchange with partially blackened copies, the
effort are not classified as disproportionate. For that in the case
of the "result protocols" a separation or blackening is out of the question
would come because this involves a disproportionate amount of effort
would be, I saw no clues.

Result
The LPPKJP Hessen also granted the member access to the files
"non-public record of results". The data of uninvolved third parties were
blackened.
In the amended Rules of Procedure of the Complaints Committee and
Arbitration the following change was included:

Section 5 (5) Rules of Procedure of the Complaints and Arbitration Committee
After the procedure before the committee has been completed, it must be ensured that all case-related

The GS secures the file with a seal and keeps the process under lock and key.

Genetic patient data may be disclosed at will. Also within the

(HIS) is to be designed in such a way that employees in the hospital can only access

require.

The starting point was a data protection incident at Klinikum Höchst in
2016. At that time there was an incident on a ward where a patient
shot around with a pistol and several clinic employees
had hurt. This prompted the clinic management to carry out a precautionary check
of internal access to the electronic patient files of the
affected clinic staff. It turned out that
a whole range of employees – both medical
as well as nursing staff - from different departments
had accessed the medical records of the injured clinic staff.
In response to the incident and to prevent further similar ones

to adapt the role and authorization concept and
introduce trial controls of access to medical records. this one

For handling the patient data of their own hospital employees
There are no special legal regulations for them. For those affected
fenen, however, it is of particular importance that their patient data
remain protected and do not become known to unauthorized persons. Neither
the human resources department may have personally interested colleagues
gins or colleagues should be informed of the treatment data.
In principle, patient data may only be used in the hospital for the purpose
are further processed for which they were collected or stored,
i.e. H. specifically for the implementation of the treatment contract.
In Hesse, the Hessian Hospital Act 2011 (HKHG 2011)
expressly stipulated that in § 12 para. 2 HKHG 2011 specified
legal requirements for the transmission of data accordingly
also for the transfer of patient data within the hospital
apply between specialist departments (§ 12 Para. 3 HKHG 2011).
Access to a patient's data may therefore only be granted to those
house workers who are involved in the treatment

The requirements of the Online Access Act
The Online Access Act (OZG) of August 14, 2017 came into force on August 18, 2017.
In § 1 Para. 1 OZG, all federal and state authorities are obliged to

and to make them available via administration portals. According to § 1 paragraph 2 OZG
The federal and state governments must provide their administrative services in a portal network

§ 3 para. 2 OZG obliges the federal and state governments to provide user accounts in the portal

Bodies that set up and register user accounts.
This shows that an essential goal of the OZG is the provision
of interoperable user accounts for a uniform, convenient and
secure access to administrative services offered online. That's true
for the local, state or federal level.
An OZG implementation catalog is used as the starting point for recording/

divided into 55 life situations and business situation package (each
of these packages contains an average of ten administrative services)
and 1981 services currently to be implemented in Hesse.

The catalog should be continuously updated and updated.
About the Hessian law for the promotion of electronic administration
(Hessian E-Government Act - HEGovG) are also the municipalities
obliged to provide access for the transmission of electronic documents
(§ 1 Para. 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 3 Para. 1 HEGovG).

§ 3 paragraph 1 HEGovG
Every authority is obliged to provide access for the transmission of electronic documents,
even if they are provided with a qualified electronic signature.

The implementation of the OZG in Hesse
In order to meet the above requirements, the Hessian
state administration etc. the project "Implementation OZG" was launched.
The project is part of the HMDIS as a preliminary project.
In the "Implementation OZG" project, the necessary organizational,
substantive, temporal and financial specifications are drawn up.

Development of the Citizens and Business Service (BUS) Hessen
As early as mid-2015, the IT planning council decided in favor of a nationwide
proliferation of service accounts for citizens and businesses

such as the federal EGovG, the HMDIS had in mid-2016
Principles formulated, from which it resulted in particular which data
may be processed for this purpose.
The Hessian state administration then developed the "Digital Hessen" strategy
developed in which i.a. services for citizens and businesses
(e-Services) were examined. The EU regulation on the
direction of a central digital access gate (single digital gateway) and
the draft of the OZG is taken into account. Among the indispensable components
belonged to the identity module "Service account with post box", which as a service
account in BUS-Hessen. At the beginning of 2018, the situation was as follows
represents:
 – Interoperable service accounts are held at the country level

and are described as user accounts in the OZG.

 – Interoperable service accounts exist in the form: citizen accounts
for individuals or corporate accounts for legal entities.

 - Interoperable service accounts have interoperable mailboxes.
 – Interoperable service accounts can be transferred to a payment service provider

to be connected.

 – Interoperability has been successfully tested.
 – The interoperable service account Hessen uses the technology developed by
provided to the data center AKDB of the Bavarian municipalities
and will be installed on the ekom21.

 – A cooperation agreement with the federal government/Bavaria/Hesse has been concluded.

the statistics did not deviate significantly, despite initial inquiries about the GDPR
from 2017 onwards.
The following table contains information on the number of inputs and
Consultation requests are presented, which, in addition to the processing of fundamental
gen, statements on legislative projects and market observation in the
area of IT products make up a significant part of my work.
The statistics are largely automated with the help of the deployed
created a document management system. The number of phone calls
gave and deliberations that took more than 10 minutes to complete, however
were not reflected in files, were derived from the average data
of November 2017, as there are no significant deviations
could be determined.
The slightly increased number of written docu-
deliberations in the first half of the year showed the first signs that
that already some data controllers in the public
and non-public areas, the explosiveness of the forthcoming changes in the law
recognized.
However, the actual extent was underestimated by many. suddenly
attention changed on May 25, 2018, the day on which the
GDPR came into effect.

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection
47th activity report on data protection

In some areas, the number of submissions (complaints) rose sharply
to multiples (credit agencies, electronic communication, trade, etc.). In
other areas (internal data protection officers, schools, municipalities
organizations, clubs) my advice was in greater demand. In retrospect
I have to get the impression that only a few companies, associations
ne, retailers and traders etc. - but also public authorities and
facilities – were even remotely aware of the requirements
the DS-GVO would place on them.
The above overview shows the quantities up to May 24th, 2018.

3.6.2
sanctions
In the reporting period, a total of 53 administrative offense proceedings,
where violations of the BDSG a. F. underlying, completed.
This was despite the associated with the entry into force of the DS-GVO
significant workload much of the backlog from previous years
finally processed.
A total of eleven procedures resulted in a fine or

The infringements were subject to the fines of the
BDSG a. F., under the regime of the DS-GVO these are no longer
threatened with a fine. In the cases concerned, the change in
The legal situation means that the law on the time of the crime (BDSG a. F.) due to the in
Section 4(3) OWiG no longer standardized the principle of most-favoured-nation treatment
could be applied. These administrative offense proceedings had to
therefore be discontinued.
Apart from that, the completed proceedings mainly related to violations
against the facts of § 43 paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 BDSG a. F. perish. It
were violations of the obligation to provide information to those affected or
the supervisory authority and against the obligation to order a data
protection officer punished. Furthermore, numerous procedures related
to incidents related to unauthorized data collection or
-processing. There were no exceptional cases.

Cross-cutting issues of the GDPR
4.1.1
On the scope of the right to information under Article 15 GDPR
A claim to the release of individual copies - e.g. B. in the sense of a
Photocopy of certain documents - contains Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO in all

checking processing independently is inextricably linked to this.

Art. 15 GDPR

if this is the case, you have the right to information about this personal data

the information must be made available in a common electronic format,
unless otherwise stated.
(4) The right to obtain a copy under paragraph 3 shall not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others

In recent months, my authority has received an increasing number of inquiries that
with the right to information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO and in particular
deal with the scope of the regulation of Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO.
If those affected assert their right to information under Art. 15 DS-GVO, they are
According to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO, those responsible are also obliged to
“Copy of the personal data that is the subject of the processing
are” to make available. It must therefore be clarified on the one hand whether Art. 15
Para. 3 DS-GVO in synopsis with Art. 15 Para. 4 DS-GVO an own
permanent right of the persons concerned in addition to Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-GVO
person justified. On the other hand, there is the question of interpretation – and
ultimately the range – the copy concept.

Importance of the right to information
The right to information of Art. 15 DS-GVO pursues in data protection
different objectives: It follows from recital 63 that data subjects
by exercising the right of access, awareness of the processing
obtain and be enabled to access their personal data
should be able to check the legality of the data processing.
In addition, Art. 15 DS-GVO can pave the way for the exercise of further
data protection design rights, such as B. Right to Rectification
according to Art. 16 DS-GVO or right to deletion according to Art. 17 DS-GVO,
prepare or serve to assert claims for damages.
The right to information comes into play when enforcing the right to information
functional self-determination is therefore of crucial importance.

76

Data protection report from 05/25/2018

Scope of the right to information according to Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-GVO
According to the importance of the right to information, Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-GVO
states that the data subject has the right to obtain a
To request confirmation as to whether personal data relating to you
data are processed. If those responsible agree to the processing of personal
personal data, the data subject is entitled to the rights specified in Art. 15 Para
lit. a to h DS-GVO and paragraph 2 DS-GVO more detailed information
to provide.

No extension of the right to information according to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO
Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO obliges those responsible to “make a copy
of the personal data that are the subject of the processing".
To make available. In addition, Art. 15 Para. 4 DS-GVO speaks of
"Right to obtain a copy". Therefore it is represented that it is a
content expansion in the sense of an independent publication right
against the right to information contained in Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-GVO.
I am of the opinion that Art. 15 Para. 3 and 4 DS-GVO does not depend on Art. 15
Para. 1 DS-GVO is a separate right. Those responsible must be the person specified in Art. 15
Para. 3 DS-GVO therefore also without a corresponding obligation

thus clarifies the regulation contained in Art. 15 (1) lit. b GDPR

Furthermore, it should be noted that the European legislator

It is therefore not apparent why Art. 15 Para. 3, 4 DS-GVO is a
Art. 20 DS-GVO should justify the right of surrender.
The general standards of the

not permitted. It follows that Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO is not an additional
Right to receive a copy of the personal data means,
but requires that the right to information according to Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-
GVO the provision of a copy is sufficient. The right from Art. 15 Para. 4
DS-GVO does not go further than the required rights under Art. 15
Para. 1 and Para. 3 GDPR.

No general right of access to information/
right to inspect files
Due to the wording of Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO "Copy of personal
data that are the subject of the processing", arises for responsible
verbatim and those affected raise the question of the scope of the right to information.
If one deals with the meaning of the term "copy", one finds
e.g. B. the following definitions of terms: "Copy, duplicate of a document,
photocopy, imitation”. The understanding of what is stated in Art. 15 is therefore decisive
Para. 3 DS-GVO used copy term.
If in the "Copy of personal data that is the subject of the
processing", the duplication of a document or a photocopy is understood
den (hereinafter referred to as "copy"), this would result in
Affected persons according to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO e.g. B. a general claim

personal data contained therein.
I understand the copy concept of Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO in the sense of a
meaningfully structured summary. The person concerned must therefore

Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO only regulates the type of information

This also corresponds to the assessment of Art. 12 Para. 1 DS-GVO, according to which the
Responsible through appropriate measures all communications relating to
refer to the processing, in a more precise, transparent, understandable and easy
accessible form in clear and plain language.

Art. 12 GDPR
(1) The person responsible shall take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all information

Article 34, related to the processing, in more precise, transparent, understandable
and in an easily accessible form, using clear and plain language; this applies
especially for information specifically aimed at children. The transmission of

If requested by the data subject, the information can be given orally,
if the identity of the data subject has been proven in some other way.
(2) The controller makes it easier for the data subject to exercise their rights
in accordance with Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2),
the controller will only refuse based on the request of the data subject

The importance of the right to information is also fully taken into account
carried. Because those affected are thereby put in a position to
to become aware of the processing of their personal data and
to check the lawfulness of the data processing. You can theirs
exercise design rights under data protection law and - if they are

Scope and manner of providing information in the employment

the information can be provided through a structured summary of the data,
which are the subject of the processing, or a copy. Go
Responsible from the existence of the conditions of a restriction
of the right to information, those affected must be informed of this.

An employment relationship involves a large number of personal
related data processing justified. Therefore,

80

Data protection report from 05/25/2018

Data protection officers and those responsible contact me if on the part of
Employed requests for information have been asserted. As examples per-
Son-related data processing comes to the management of the personnel file
or the use of a personnel information system, the implementation of
Personnel development measures, time recording or video surveillance
under consideration. In addition, employees emit under consideration
their work, personal data, for example when using the
provided IT infrastructure (PC, laptop, mobile phone, tablet)
or business communication (creation of documents or
communication via e-mail). Since the employment relationship naturally
a certain duration is created, this data may overflow
for years and decades.
With a view to Art. 15 GDPR, I recommend those responsible and data
protection officer the following:
If those affected assert their right to information under Art. 15 DS-GVO,
is fundamentally detached from the exercise of the right to receive a
Copy according to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO also a structured summary

Background of the transparency anchored in Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a, 12 DS-GVO
to implement the principle (see also the article, Section 4.1.1).
Which approach seems particularly suitable depends on
of the data processing to be assessed, and therefore of the circumstances of the
on a case-by-case basis.
In the following constellations I have assumed that the requirement
requirements of Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO are met:
 – Provision of an excerpt of the profile of those affected when used

of a personnel information system by responsible persons

 – List of documents or file numbers stored for a person

when using a document management or filing system
If, with reference to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO, the copy of individual written
pieces or e-mail correspondence is requested, this claim
then exist if the right of those concerned, the legality of
to check data processing independently, inseparably linked to this
the is. In a synopsis of Art. 15 Para. 1 and 3 DS-GVO and
against the background of the importance of the right to information, it is likely to
my understanding usually suffice if the persons concerned have the in
personal data contained in a document are communicated.

Pursuant to recital 63 sentence 7 of the GDPR, those responsible can

Obligation to report data protection officers according to Art. 37
Para. 7 GDPR
Due to the European data protection reform, Hessian responsible
lic and processors since May 25, 2018 in accordance with Art. 37 Para. 7 DS-GVO
obliged to provide the contact details of the data protection officer
Notify the Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
Violations of the obligation to notify the competent supervisory authority
can be punished with a fine.

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection is responsible for processing the reporting obligation
and Freedom of Information (HBDI) introduced an online reporting process that
at https://datenschutz.hessen.de/service/benannenung-eines-datenschutzbe-

took place on May 14, 2018. Since then, around 15,000 reports have
13,470 positions were received.
In addition to all public bodies that, according to Art. 37 Para. 1a, 4 DS-GVO i. V. m.

Acknowledgment of information according to Art. 13 and Art. 14 GDPR
The duty of the controller to inform the data subject about the data processing
to inform does not lead to an obligation of the person concerned to receive it
to acknowledge the information with a signature.

A citizen contacted my office and complained that
that a municipality asked him to receive the information
Art. 13 DS-GVO to be confirmed by his signature. Neither Art. 13 nor
Art. 14 DS-GVO see such a confirmation by the recipient
of the information. The municipality took the position that
only through the signature of the recipient according to their accountability
Art. 5 Para. 2 DS-GVO can comply.

Art. 5 Para. 2 GDPR
The person responsible is responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and must
Demonstrate compliance (“accountability”).

It is therefore sufficient if the person responsible documents that

The information that is often made available on the Internet is also used

Online trading was checked on site. At the appointment were next to the

that changes have already been made to that situation,
presented by the complainants during the verification process.
In the meantime, consents signed by the employees

In addition, the following measures were subsequently implemented:
 – The camera, which was aimed directly at the office workstations, was

removed.

 – So-called “private zones” were used for the rest of the monitoring
directed, or existing zones were expanded so that no jobs
affected by the continuous monitoring.

 – The open-plan office was structurally redesigned. So became a mirror wall
through which the workplaces could be seen far and wide.
 – The signage has been expanded to include the name and contact details
of the person responsible, the contact details of the data protection officer,
the purpose of the processing, the legitimate interests and the
extended storage time.

 – In addition, a large screen was installed in the open-plan office,
which depicted the surveillance monitor of each camera and with it
guaranteed full transparency.

The cameras in the storage room were exclusively on the storage aisle and
directed to the delivery gate and not objectionable.

In the period under review, there were countless requests for advice on admission

Unfortunately, the legal situation in this regard has not been very clear since the data protection reform
is, there is uncertainty among many responsible persons as to what the conditions are

Over the entire reporting period, dozens of written
physical and telephone inquiries on the question of under what conditions
the production and publication of photos and videos according to the new
data protection law is permissible. Some of the inquiries came from professional
photographers, but above all from companies, private individuals and associations,
who for various purposes photos and videos on their websites, blogs
and wanted to publish in company or association magazines. In
There was obviously a lot of uncertainty about this question, which certainly wasn't
most recently through publications with partly questionable content and lively ones
discussions on internet forums and social networks.
It was not uncommon for fear or anger to be expressed that
due to the DS-GVO no more photos were supposedly taken
or may be published if the people depicted are not
had expressly consented thereto in writing. Of course this is not
the case.
Digitally captured photos and videos depicting individuals
recognizable and identifiable contain personal data. The
Photographing or filming (data collection) and the publication of the
Images (data processing) therefore fall within the scope of the
GDPR. Just as under the old law, however, two cases are (largely)

GDPR requirements.
Taking and publishing images is hassle-free afterwards

publication is permitted or not. After that, it has to be weighed

wants to use images, and on the other hand the rights and interests of
person(s) depicted. As a rule, the person or agency that
wants to take or publish images, legitimate interests in doing so,
for example for artistic reasons or because they use them for their
business activity required or would like to use for their external presentation.

much more. The stronger the rights and interests of the people depicted

The review took place in Brussels in the year under review. The approximately 40-strong
The US delegation was led by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.
The European delegation, led by Commissioner Jourová, sat down
seven representatives of the European data protection supervisory authorities and
representatives of the European Commission.
As in the review last year (46th activity report, point 4.1,
p. 55 ff.), the test initially included questions about the practical implementation
of the Privacy Shield. The focus here was mainly on the process and content
the (re)certification process and the mechanisms with which
should be made that the certified company the conditions
also actually fulfill and ensure, for example, that those affected
the rights to which they are entitled under the Privacy Shield
can exercise.
Its report on the second annual Privacy Shield review was published by the
European Data Protection Board (EDPB) at https://edpb.europa.eu/

their report on the first review of the EU-US Privacy Shield for this
field were all accepted and it was worked on
worked to further improve the practical implementation in this sense.
However, this year's report also identifies areas in which
more work is needed: The biggest criticism remains the concern that oversight
about the certified organizations rather limited to formal aspects
could be and there are not enough substantial controls. Another

94

Data protection report from 05/25/2018

A point that should be considered more closely in the coming year is the
ter transfers from Privacy Shield certified companies to third parties.
From the EDPB's point of view, it must be ensured here that the privacy

become. Finally, the area of employee data should continue
and keep an eye on the recertification process.
In addition to the practical implementation questions, the question also took up again
after government access to data under the Privacy Shield in the USA
were transferred, a large room. Here, too, can be held
are that some conclusions of the Article 29 Working Party
from the past year were picked up by the US authorities.
These were just prior to the second annual Privacy Shield review
enough new members for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Over-
sight board appointed to make the body quorate again.
However, it should also be noted that the position of the ombudsperson, who
was created specifically with the Privacy Shield to provide a way for
to open up to those affected to assert their rights in the event of state access to personal
enforce related data effectively, still only on an interim basis
is occupied. The European Commission has prompted this to the USA
in their conclusions on the second Privacy Shield review
set an ultimatum. If the USA does not have a candidate by February 28, 2019
have nominated for the office of ombudsperson, announces the European
Commission, "appropriate measures under the General Data Protection
regulation” to take. A possible measure would then also be the

is at https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/report_on_the_second_

Supervisory authorities under the General Data Protection Regulation
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) results in

rich innovations. The new European staff unit set up at the HBDI
and international acts as a link for communication between
the HBDI and various offices outside of Hesse in Germany,

The DS-GVO forces the individual supervisory authorities to a much narrower

uses a procedure or uses a procedure at only one branch that
but significant impact on data subjects in more than one
member state has to deal with only one supervisory authority (lead supervisory

However, the one-stop shop also applies to those affected: they have
the opportunity to lodge a complaint with any supervisory authority
authority (which thereby becomes the supervisory authority concerned within the meaning of Art. 4

it is not responsible for the body against which the complaint is directed.

is the fact that the work is almost exclusively in English.

to offer tale.
Essential targets of the OZG are
 – the rapid digitization of online access to administrative services

until 2022,

 – the linking of individual administration portals to form a portal network and
 – the provision of interoperable user accounts for a uniform,
convenient and secure access to administration services offered online

 – In the following implementation plan, in particular, the requirements
of Art. 25 GDPR data protection through technology design and through
data protection-friendly default settings ("Privacy by design" and "Privacy

 – At the end of the implementation plan, it is checked whether the data protection

Direct mail according to the General Data Protection Regulation
The data protection authorities have the "Application instructions of the data
protection supervisory authorities for the collection, processing and use of
personal data for advertising purposes". Result
is the guidance of the supervisory authorities on the processing of personal
Son-related data for direct marketing purposes under the validity of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The conference of independent data protection authorities of the federal and
of the federal states (DSK) decided on the orientation guide on November 7th, 2018.
It is aimed equally at those affected as well as at advertisers and
the address trade and is the "successor" of the "application notes of the
Data protection supervisory authorities for collection, processing and use
of personal data for advertising purposes”, which is to be understood in
September 2014 under the validity of the Federal Data Protection Act a. F. (BDSG

In a comparison of the new and the old legal situation

Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR represents the central legal basis for the
Data processing in the advertising sector. The regulation is
relevant for any processing within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 2. She captures the
Data processing for own advertising purposes as well as for advertising purposes of third parties and
equally also the commercial data processing for the purpose
of transmission and address trading.
With recital (ErwG) 47, sentence 7, the European legislator
already made a weighing of interests in favor of the advertising industry,
based on the fact that the need for protection tends to be low
publicly accessible address data exists, at least these are not the basic
legally secured positions of the advertiser from Art. 12 and 14 GG
and Art. 15, 16 and 17 GRCh (professional freedom, entrepreneurial freedom,
freedom of ownership) prevails. The legislature has a corrective to this
Art. 21 Para. 2 DS-GVO created, where the persons concerned have a right at any time
Right of objection is granted.
According to the supervisory authorities, a weighing of interests will then be carried out
not in favor of the advertiser if data from a
online imprint for the purpose of advertising.
Although this data is generally accessible, it is not collected voluntarily,
but published due to legal obligation.
In the future, a compatibility check will be carried out in the event of a change of purpose in accordance with Art. 6
Para. 4 GDPR required.
Added to this is the duty of the person responsible, the data subject
to facilitate the exercise of their rights (Article 12 (2) sentence 1 GDPR).
From this it is derived that for the filing of an advertising objection
(also) an electronic communication channel is to be offered. Further that

applicable. It applies to any type of processing of personal data
through organizations. Only in the private and family area is the
DS-GVO not applicable. The GDPR also applies to clubs.
Data is personal if it relates to an identifiable
refer person. In clubs, this is usually the data of their own
nal members or members of other associations, e.g. B. at competitions,
be. A processing of the data is present in every form of their use, be
this through the collection and storage, through the display or the
Disclosure to other members or coaches or through confiscation
of posts. Deletion also constitutes processing. Every association
processes personal data.
The processing of personal data is only permitted if it is for this
there is an explicit legal basis. The possible legal bases
are included in Art. 6 GDPR. Usually the processing of the data
permitted to the extent necessary for the purpose of the association. This

includes accounting, membership administration and implementation
of club activities.
In addition, the data can be processed if this is the inter-
required by the articles of association and the rights of the affected
do not oppose open persons. There is a balancing of interests for this
necessary.
For the processing of personal data that is not strictly necessary

can only voluntarily, i. H. without compulsion to be granted. consents must

The consent is also freely revocable. Therefore it is not possible

Consent is therefore required for all processing that is absolutely necessary,
no suitable legal basis.
It is also important that the persons concerned are aware of the scope
be informed in detail of the processing. This can be in an information sheet
and the membership applications. The exact scope of the necessary
Information results from Art. 12, 13 and 14 DS-GVO.
In order to be able to meet the requirements of the GDPR, you must first
be determined which personal data is currently in which way

can then be clearly checked whether this is for the purposes of the association

The appointment of a data protection officer is necessary for ten or more persons
manoeuvrable, who are constantly involved with automated data processing.
These are primarily the association bodies and people in accounting,
but also trainers and supervisors who receive electronic lists of members or players
be made available. Even if a data protection officer
is not absolutely necessary, this can be very important for compliance with the GDPR
to be useful.
It is also necessary to check whether data security is guaranteed in club life

Despite the essentially unchanged legal situation, the entry into force
the DS-GVO are extensively reported. This has increased the
perception of data protection among club representatives. Unfortunately has
this also to some actions in the permission and use of
photographs that are not justified by the GDPR.
Clubs and their members would like their results in writing and
post image. The interests of the persons concerned are also important
take into account. Have the persons concerned in the publication
of text and images, this is permissible. Consent can
be included in participation applications or player passes. The Consents
must, however, be granted voluntarily and must therefore not be compulsory

About public events may also without express consent
be reported in text and images if the focus is on the event
grund stands and individuals are not shown. Without consent
results may also be published. But reporting is allowed
only as long as there is an interest in the public, that is
for a very limited period of time. A permanent release without
Consent is therefore ruled out.
Clubs still have to make considerable adjustments. This
results, however, above all from the fact that many clubs before the entry into force of the
DS-GVO were far removed from the requirements of the previously applicable
Regulations from the BDSG a. F. to meet. From this resulted and results
a greater need for adjustment. However, this is not based on the
regulations of the DS-GVO, but in omissions of the past.
Clubs are still struggling to meet the requirements of data
to fulfill protection. An important reason for this is the partially missing
acceptance of these requirements. My callers often walk away
from that the requirements of the volunteers in the
associations are not fully achievable. However, these requirements are
like other laws - for example the road traffic regulations,
environmental protection and association law – by all members
to fulfill a community. As European law, they are also subject

on the checking and deletion periods in the area of credit bureaus.

The subject of a large number of incoming complaints is the deletion

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been in effect since May 25th, 2018
as a regulation under European law, application priority over national law

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection
47th activity report on data protection

Art. 88 GDPR contains an opening clause for data processing in
Employee context, due to which national legislators are more specific
regulations can be issued. The German legislator has of this
Right exercised and in § 26 BDSG the data processing for
Purposes of employment regulated, but without being specific
to address the issue of the publication of employee photos.

Legal bases for the processing of employee photos

§ 26 paragraph 1 BDSG
Personal data of employees may be used for the purposes of the employment relationship
be processed if this is necessary for the decision on the justification of a
employment relationship or after establishing the employment relationship for his
implementation or termination or to exercise or comply with any law
or a collective agreement, a company or service agreement (collective agreement)

only be processed if there are actual indications to be documented
justify suspicion that the person concerned committed a criminal offense in the employment relationship
has committed, the processing is necessary for detection and the protection-worthy
the employee's interest in the exclusion of processing does not prevail,
in particular the type and extent are not disproportionate to the occasion.

Section 26 (1) BDSG – Necessity
Section 26 (1) BDSG requires data processing to be carried out
of the employment relationship is "required". necessity means
that the legitimate interests of the employer worthy of protection
of data processing and the personal rights of the employee
are to be brought to a gentle balance that is as beneficial to both interests as possible
largely taken into account. A balancing of interests is therefore necessary
between the interests of the employee and those responsible
position in terms of a proportionality test.
Section 26 (1) sentence 1 BDSG then serves as the legal basis only for the
Considering that the visual presentation of the employee(s)
status of the employment contract, such as for a photo model.
Should, however, "normal" employees in the public presentation
of the company in the form of images or film sequences
this is not usually done to carry out the employment relationship
necessary, as it mainly serves advertising purposes.

§ 26 paragraph 2 BDSG - Consent

§ 26 paragraph 2 BDSG
Is the processing of personal data of employees based on
of consent, for the assessment of the voluntary nature of the consent, in particular
or the dependency of the employed person in the employment relationship
as well as the circumstances under which the consent was given.
In particular, voluntariness can exist if the employed person has a legal
cher or economic advantage is achieved or employer and employed person
pursue similar interests. The consent must be in writing, unless otherwise
another form is appropriate due to special circumstances. The employer has
employed person about the purpose of the data processing and about their right of withdrawal
according to Article 7 paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in text form.

According to Section 26 (2) BDSG, the lawfulness of the processing can be based on a
transparent and comprehensive consent of the employee
become. The provision regulates the conditions for consent in employment

According to this, the consent must be given before publication and informed,
This means that the individual uses must be specified precisely,

According to § 26 paragraph 2 sentence 3 BDSG, the consent basically requires the

to assess their decision.
Art. 7 Para. 3 DS-GVO should be emphasized, according to which those affected have an explicit
and a right of revocation at any time is granted, to which prior to delivery of the
consent must be indicated. As this may cause problems
it is recommended that the question of the obligation to delete be addressed at the time of issuance
to regulate the consent.
Submissions that are available to my authority have so far regularly concerned the
Facts that an employee from the company
has been eliminated, but her/his picture is still on the company's website
is published. If the publication is based on § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1
BDSG, the purpose falls when the employee leaves
for publication, with the result that Art. 17 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO
applies: "The personal data are necessary for the purposes for which they are
collected or processed in any other way is no longer necessary."
More problematic is the case when an employed person already has their
lawfully granted consent to the publication of their image
and the employer a possibly costly advertising campaign
must stop/delete.
According to the case law of the Federal
labor court (BAG judgment of 11.12.2014 - 8 AZR 1010/13) the KUG

Intensity of intervention in the personal rights of the (former) employee
tigten: The picture only had an illustrative character and hardly had anyone

the identity of the employee is emphasized by a text

there is in any case a legal right to erasure.
I am of the opinion that these ratings of the BAG also under the
Application of the DS-GVO and the new BDSG continue to apply, so that the
employed person must continue to justify the revocation of consent
and then the weighing of interests mentioned above would have to be carried out.
This legal opinion can be supported e.g. on the principles of
Good faith and duty of care under labor law.

direction of the documentation is also used or must be taken into account.
These tasks are listed below and briefly explained:
1.

With regard to the use of IT systems for processing personal

Building block: planning and specification
The aim of this module is to show which activities from operational

taken, in which he plans and explains what and how through an order
taker, e.g. B. also contract processors, is to be provided or in what way
data protection requirements for IT-supported processing
are to be implemented.
In addition to planning, the focus is on the specification of a processing
task. The reason for this is that a specification can be used in many ways in
of IT must be reused in order to have a functional IT and
to maintain high-quality processes in the long run, in the same way
meet data protection requirements. Like from IT development
known, regular comparisons at different levels are one
Processing activity between the target from the specification and the actual
required during operation.
In order to be able to carry out such target and actual comparisons, at least
necessary:
 – a description of the processing activity, as also specified in Art. 30

DS-GVO is required,

 – a documentation of the legal bases on which the execution

the processing activity takes place,

 – a documentation of the person responsible and the participants in one

organization or a company,
 – a specification of technical processes,
 – a specification of the specialist application with a description of typical applications

so that involved or potentially unauthorized third parties are identified

 – a description of functional and, given in an appropriate form
non-functional requirements and their interfaces, which are required in
way in connection with a risk assessment for rights
and freedoms of data subjects,

 – a provision and documentation to be taken or taken

technical and organizational measures and

 - A specification for the administration of technical systems and pro-
programs naming the administrators themselves, so that availability
security, confidentiality and integrity even under stress for the whole
operating life of the systems and programs are guaranteed.

Therefore, this building block is used for your own control in the organization or
in the company as well as the verifiability by the responsible data
protection supervisory authority. From an organizational control perspective, it stands

of information technology
 – the guarantee and verifiability of availability, confidentiality

and integrity as well

 – the requirement to implement that processing on the basis
of IT-supported processes must also be guaranteed under load.

Building block: logging
With logging, processing that has already been carried out, processing

is cross-processing and cross-system.
Depending on whether a processing and / or system-wide
logging is available, a distinction must be made between:
 – user activities in a specialist application,
 – system activities,
 – Administrative activities or also
 – Activities via interfaces.
Typical log data is determined by:
 - A time component or a time of a to be logged

event or the logged event during operation,

 - an indication of an entity - i. i.e. R. with reference to the IT used

MUST lists in Europe to carry out a
Data Protection Impact Assessment
With the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation, the
data protection supervisory authorities are obliged to compile a list in accordance with Art. 35 Para. 4
to publish. In this so-called MUST list are processing
to name processes for which the responsible data protection supervisory authority
considers a data protection impact assessment to be mandatory.

A data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out if
the execution of a processing of personal data potentially
there is a high risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
Already in the previous 46th activity report for the year 2017

application and outlook
With regard to the EU-wide coordination, it should be noted that a union
harmonization of national MUST lists for carrying out a DPIA
will take a while. In the meantime, five more submissions have been submitted

not by the expert group "Technical Subgroup" according to one
procedure, comparable to that of September 2018. Because even
here the focus has shifted to the fact that IT developments are a Europe-wide application
is to be allowed.
It seems to me that I am particularly interested in how the requirements are changing
in the MUST list for carrying out a DPIA in practice.
Further influences from legal practice will have to be taken into account,
especially against the background of inherent demands on the
technical implementation
 - in lists of processing activities in accordance with Art. 30 GDPR,
 – for the security of the processing according to Art. 32 DS-GVO or
 - when introducing certifications in accordance with Art. 42 and Art. 43 GDPR.

assuming that a completely new processing of personal data
is developed. It is based on a questionnaire based on the
text of the GDPR and is divided into four parts: (1) context,
(2) fundamental principles, (3) risks and (4) affirmation.
In the beginning, the context of the processing activity is to be described. In addition

Finally, the risk assessment for which a DPIA is to be carried out should

then the person responsible is obliged to notify the responsible data protection

The fourth step in conducting a DPIA is a so-called

result from different interpretations of what counts as a risk and what

Used by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
The software platform of the CNIL can be used in different ways
or also in the own network of an organization or a company
to get integrated. For the application in practice it will be decisive
how an organization or a company with regard to the IT equipment
are asked.
For the installation of the software platform of the CNIL in small and medium
ler companies a separation of the tool - at least through
Virtualization – recommended. The storage of the performed DPIAs
requires a special configuration, e.g. B. runs over a port 8080.

that they remain available in their own interest and treated confidentially

be how further development and maintenance of the software platform of the
CNIL, e.g. e.g. through security updates. Here will
also play into the extent to which compatibility is maintained, so that
already created DPIAs re-opened in the software platform and again
can be stored and thus the provision of adapted DPIAs
is made possible.

Art. 33 GDPR and the fine procedure
The feedback from companies shows that the federal legislature
with the regulation in § 43 Abs. 4 BDSG succeeded an unfortunate one
to create an appearance that leads to a false assumption among those affected.
The companies and individuals walk away as a result of the regulation
out that a violation or a data breach (data breach) that they have about the
"Art. 33er portal" to the supervisor, cannot be punished.

Determination of the obligation to report
When comparing both standards, some key differences become apparent
recognizable.
While according to § 42a BDSG a. F. an obligation to report only after a data breach
was triggered with certain types of data, the legislator waives
to such a restriction. These data also had to be sent to the "old"
Standard unlawfully transmitted or unlawfully made known to a third party

can. This could, for example, include the unintentional destruction of
important and difficult-to-recover personal data
be what according to the regulations of § 42a BDSG a. F., however, no message
would have triggered.
However, not every data breach automatically triggers the obligation to
message off. Both the legislator and the legislator have
included in the respective standards with regard to a risk assessment.
While according to § 42a BDSG a. F. the threat of serious impairment
impairment of the rights or legitimate interests of those affected
triggered the obligation to report, the legislator has significantly lowered the hurdle
puts. Now only then is there a report to the supervisory authority

Complaint by the person concerned can be checked by me.
In addition, the scope of the GDPR includes in contrast
on the previous legal situation according to § 42a BDSG a. F. both non-public and
also public authorities.
The requirements of Art. 33 DS-GVO are therefore clear from a
higher number of cases met, leading to a sharp increase in reporting
ments in my authority. That was the case throughout 2017
a total of 85 reports according to § 42a BDSG a. F., while for 2018
a total of 681 reports were recorded. These numbers settle
from 51 reports according to § 42a BDSG a. F. and 630 reports under Article 33
GDPR together. Considering only the period from 05/25/2018,
an annual number of cases of about 1,000 can be assumed, what
represents an increase of 1,176% compared to the previous year.

Legal consequences if there is a reporting obligation
If it has been determined that the requirements for reporting are met
are, the person responsible now has this to the supervisory authority

In the past activity reports it was repeatedly reported that
that there are currently no regulations in Hesse regarding the handling of patient
medical files after the planned or unplanned closure of a hospital
house exists. In the meantime, the Hessian Ministry for Social Affairs has told me
and integration (HSM) a draft of a corresponding regulation for
the Hessian Hospital Act (HKHG) to be amended.

background
In the past, both planned and unplanned closures
hospitals disclosed that dealing with the associated
gene patient files was not adequately regulated. In particular, it was over
In my view, it is important that both the secure storage of the files
is guaranteed in these cases, as well as that the former patients
still be able to view their patient file without any major loss of time
and a specific contact person has been named for this purpose.
With the new § 12 para. 5 HKHG, this should now be taken into account.

Section 12 (5) HKHG
The hospital operator is obliged when closing a hospital or
a hospital establishment to ensure that the medical records
the regulations on confidentiality and data protection are kept and only
are accessible to authorized persons.

it says:
“The proper backup and storage of patient records

production facilities of a hospital has been increasing in recent years

this topic is also discussed and there is a need for action when dealing with
Patient files from closed facilities, such as e.g. B. hospitals and
rehabilitation facilities identified. Also the Hessian data protection officer
recently confirmed this need for action in its 45th activity report.
The new regulation of § 12 Para. 5 HKHG takes up the need for action and
obliges the hospitals or their legal successors when they close

Legal Assessment
I have the following comments to the HSM on the draft
made:
In the 2017 discussions with the HSM it was discussed that the

Mandatory submission for data protection and freedom of information
be. Ultimately, the description is "at the closure of a hospital"
relatively vague, so a more precise definition should be given. From my
ner point of view, it is therefore necessary in advance, regardless of a
impending closure, a procedure on how to proceed in the event of a
closure (in the sense of technical and organizational measures).
Section 18 of the Berlin Hospital Act also stipulates timely information
obligation to inform the technical supervisor if the closure of a
hospital becomes foreseeable (especially in the case of an application for
opening of insolvency proceedings). In my opinion, this should also be included in the regulation
be taken over.
It would also be worth considering whether in the event of the insolvency of the hospital operator
even a catch-all solution cannot be created. Independent
an addition to this seems appropriate, as is provided for in Section 39 (6) of the State
kenhausgesetzes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LKHG M-V), since the

To what extent the information I provided was included in the draft
were made is not known to me.

Freedom of Information Act was explained in its main features.

2.1
scope of application
The fundamental right to access from public authorities
with regard to official information (§ 80 Para. 1 HDSIG) is
law made legal. As far as the law access to information
opened, the official information is then general
accessible sources within the meaning of Art. 5 Para. 1 S. 1 GG. fully

authorities, the state office for the protection of the constitution, the state antitrust authorities,
the Regulatory Chamber of Hesse, the Chambers of Industry and Commerce, the
Chambers of crafts and notaries, Section 81 (2) HDSIG.
In addition, according to Section 81 (1) HDSIG, there is a right to information
access to certain positions only if not - pointedly formulated -
lated – the main function of the body is affected. So the claim is there
only with regard to the general administrative area at the following positions:
 – Hessian state parliament
 – Hessian Court of Auditors
 – Hessian data protection officer
 - Dishes
 – Law enforcement and law enforcement agencies
 – Financial authorities
 – university hospitals
 – research institutions
 – Universities
 - Schools
 – Hessian Radio
 – Hessian state institute for private broadcasting and new media
The legislature has provided for a special regulation for the municipalities

Task: It is up to them to decide whether §§ 80 ff. HDSIG
to be expressly determined by the articles of incorporation.
However, the law does not only open up the right to access information
with regard to certain public authorities, but granted
the claim related to all public bodies in accordance with
substantive criteria, namely special public and private concerns.

2.2
Protection of special public and private interests
In favor of these concerns, the claim according to § 82 HDSIG exists entirely

according to which it must be checked in each case whether the disclosure of
information may have an adverse effect on:
a)

to another country

b) matters of external or public security,

Protection of fundamental rights of legal persons (Art. 19 Para. 3 GG) serves the
success of § 82 No. 4 HDSIG, according to which a right to information access
does not exist in the case of secrets belonging to the personal sphere of life
or trade and business secrets, provided the data subject
has not consented.

2.3
Data protection as a prerequisite for access to information
Data protection and access to information are not independent of each other
areas of law, but the access to information presupposes the observance of the
data protection ahead. As far as personal life is concerned,
the person concerned determines whether and to what extent a right to information

204

Access exists: Without the consent of the person whose rights are affected

As far as the personal area of life is not affected, it is

shifts in this case from the person concerned to the public

Section 83 HDSIG, which is to be followed by the public body, gives this
Regulation briefly and concisely:
“Information access to personal data is only if and to the extent
permitted, as their transmission to a non-public body is permitted."
Here, too, the HDSIG clearly shows that the decision of the
to regulate data protection and freedom of information in a law,
is concise in terms of the legal system, because data protection and access to information
are interlinked in the HDSIG on legal dogma:
The content of Section 83 HDSIG refers to Section 22 (2) No. 2 HDSIG and
forms together with this standard a joint provision. This requires
an assessment of the legitimate interests of the person requesting information and
the legitimate interests of the data subject. So for this review
the necessary information is available as far as possible, the application

those affected by his data must be given the opportunity to comment,
if there are indications that he has an interest worthy of protection
on the exclusion of access to information (§ 86 Sentence 1 HDSIG).

2.4
The decision on a request for information
Deadlines for the decision
The law determines the decision on an information request
deadlines. A decision must be made immediately, i.e. without culpable hesitation,
but at the latest within one month, at the latest in the case of third-party participation
within three months of receipt of a sufficiently specific

Scope and requirements of § 6b paragraph 1 BDSG
The following describes when this rule applies
and what requirements it places on a video surveillance system.

2.1.1
When is video surveillance available?
§ 6b paragraph 1 BDSG defines video surveillance as observation
“optical-electronic devices”. From this term are not only
commercially available video cameras, but any device that can be used for observing
attention suit, recorded. It is irrelevant whether they have a zoom function
or have a swivel device, whether the camera is mounted stably or
is freely movable. Also the use of webcams, game cameras, digital
Cameras or mobile phones with an integrated camera is fundamental
to be regarded as video surveillance (see also No. 3.1). Requirement is

sons must be recognizable on the recordings or other conclusions
on the identity of a person are possible.
The term video surveillance includes both video surveillance,
in which the images are transmitted live to a monitor, as well as
the video recording where the recordings are saved. One

2.1.2
What is a public space?
The application of § 6b BDSG presupposes that a publicly accessible
space is observed. These are areas within
or outside of buildings which, according to the recognizable will of the
authorized (e.g. the property owner) used by anyone or
may be entered. A public space is also present if for
access special general requirements, such as a certain
minimum age must be met, an entrance fee must be paid or

on Misleading and Comparative Advertising of 12/12/2006 defined as
"every expression in the exercise of a trade, trade, craft
or freelance with the aim of selling goods or providing services
of services, including immovable property, rights and
obligations to promote”.
The courts also lay down this far-reaching view of advertising
in their decisions and see e.g. B. thus also satisfaction

On the other hand, advertising or direct mail within the meaning of the GDPR, but

1.2
There are no detailed regulations on this in the GDPR
With the GDPR, all detailed regulations of the previous Federal
data protection law (BDSG) for the processing of personal data

In this respect, the weighing of interests results in, among other things, from recital 47 that the
reasonable expectations of the person concerned based on their relationship
the person responsible are to be taken into account. That's it too
to turn off the subjective expectations of the person concerned in individual cases.
In addition to these, however, one must also ask what objectively
can and may be. It is therefore also crucial whether the processing
personal data for direct marketing purposes in certain
areas of the social sphere is typically accepted or rejected.

The law does not require immediate or separate information.
However, the information must be provided within a reasonable period of time, in any case
at the time an advertisement is sent, but no later than within
one month after processing. Does the information take place in
connection with the first advertising mailing, both components (internal

Information on the portfolio (“old cases”)
Art. 13 and 14 DS-GVO produce the information requirements from the wording
seen initially on data collection after the GDPR came into effect
("Are personal data ... collected ...").
The Art. 29 group, however, with regard to recital 171 Sentence 2 (“Processing

implement the new information obligations in an appropriate manner or

3.4
"Prohibition of coupling", Art. 7 Para. 4 DS-GVO
The previously existing linking ban for advertising can be found
also in the GDPR again, but is no longer dependent on whether a
other access to equivalent contractual services is possible. At
the assessment of whether the consent was given voluntarily depends on the circumstance
to the greatest possible extent whether, among other things, the
performance of a contract, including the provision of a service,

4.1
Short Paper No. 12
Data protection officer at responsible persons and
processors
This short paper by the independent federal data protection authorities
and the countries (data protection conference - DSK) serves as a first orientation
especially for the non-public area, as in the opinion of the
DSK the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in practice
should be applied. This view is subject to a
future - possibly deviating - interpretation of the European
Data Protection Board.

The following explanations on the data protection officer (DSB) apply
for both controllers and processors.

Appointment of the DPO
An obligation to designate a DPO can result from both the GDPR and
also result from national law. A designation obligation can apply to
the person responsible, for the processor or for both,
depending on who through his activity himself the conditions for this
Duty accomplished. Anyone who previously had to order a DSB usually has to
continue to appoint a DPO.

Appointment of the DPO according to Art. 37 DS-GVO
According to Art. 37 Para. 1 lit. a to c DS-GVO, a DPO must be named in any case.
if one of the following conditions is met:
 – Authority or public body (with the exception of courts

act within the framework of their judicial activities)

 – Core activity with extensive or systematic monitoring of

persons

 – Core activity with extensive processing of particularly sensitive data

(Article 9, 10 GDPR)

"Core activity" is the main activity of a company, which is inseparable from it
characterizes, and not the processing of personal data as a secondary activity
(Recital 97 of the GDPR). The core activities then also include all of them

267


47th activity report on data protection

Operations that are an integral part of the main activity of the person responsible
represent. This does not include those that support the core business
activities such as B. the processing of employee data of their own
Employees.
For the definition of the term "extensive" can be taken from recital 91 of the DS-
GMO the following factors are used:
 – Amount of personal data processed (volume)
 – Processing at regional, national or supranational level (geo-

graphic aspect)

 – Number of persons affected (absolute number or as a percentage of the

relevant reference value)

 – Duration of processing (time aspect)
If several factors are high, this can mean “extensive” monitoring
ment or processing.
If patient or client data is processed by a
an individual doctor, other healthcare professional or
Lawyer, it is regularly not a case of the designation
obligatory extensive data processing (see recital 91). Under
Taking into account the circumstances of the individual case and the concrete elements
an extensive processing within the meaning of ErwGr. 91 – for example
in the case of a number of those affected that is significantly greater than the group of those affected
an average, by Rec. 91 sentence 4 privileged individual doctor
goes beyond - there may be extensive processing, so that
a DPO is to be named. Notwithstanding, the naming is general
recommended to comply with data protection regulations
to facilitate and thus, if necessary, regulatory measures
to avoid.
The regulation of Art. 37 Para. 4 S. 1 DS-GVO provides that DSBe also
can be named on a voluntary basis. If there is no obligation to
designation of a DPO is available, a voluntary designation of a DPO
be recommended.

Appointment of the DPO to other responsible persons and
Contract processors according to § 38 BDSG-new
The EU Member States have the option of making the designation mandatory
of a DPO in their national implementing laws to other bodies
stretch (Art. 37 Para. 4 S. 1 DS-GVO). The federal legislature has this
Regulatory leeway used to specify the duty to designate operational

To adjust DSB to the "status quo" existing in Germany (cf. § 4f
BDSG-old and § 38 BDSG-new).
Accordingly, the designation of a DPO is also required in the following cases:
 - usually at least ten people are constantly with the
automated processing of personal data employed or
 - processing is carried out that is subject to a data protection

assessment according to Art. 35 DS-GVO or

 – personal data is processed commercially for the purpose of
Transmission, anonymized transmission or for purposes of
market or opinion research processed;

then must be independent of the number of people engaged in processing
Persons are named a DPO.

Common DPO
A group of companies may appoint a joint DPO (cf.
Art. 37 Para. 2 GDPR). The prerequisite for this is that the data protection officer of each
Branch can be easily reached from. This is also the case
recognized that under German law there is an obligation to appoint a DPO

Authorities or public bodies have the option of

to appoint a common data protection officer based on their size (Article 37 (3) GDPR).
The reference to organizational structure and size also means that the

Internal and external DPO
The DPO can be an employee of the company or the authority (in-
internal DPO) or his tasks based on a service contract
(external data protection officer, Art. 37 Para. 6 DS-GVO).

form of naming
Since the GDPR only speaks of naming the DPO, a
Written form - in contrast to § 4f Abs. 1 S. 1 BDSG-old - no longer required
wrote. For reasons of proof with regard to the obligation to provide evidence according to
Art. 24 Para. 1 DS-GVO and Art. 5 Para. 2 DS-GVO and for legal certainty
however, it is advisable to appoint a DPO in an appropriate form
to document. The already before the validity of the DS-GVO and the BDSG-new
against this background, the signed order documents continue to apply. The
Certificate and any additional agreements and tasks contained therein
Assignments should be checked for compatibility with the new regulations
of the GDPR can be checked and adjusted if necessary.

Position of the DPO and obligations of the person responsible or the
processor
The person responsible or the processor must be free from instructions
of the DPO in the fulfillment of his tasks. The DSB may because
not be dismissed or disadvantaged in fulfilling his duties.
The special protection against dismissal and dismissal for DSB according to § 4f
Paragraph 3 sentences 4 to 6 of the old BDSG has been retained in the new BDSG (Section 6 Paragraph 4
i. V. m. § 38 paragraph 2 BDSG-new). The DSB reports directly to the highest
Management level (Article 38 (3) sentence 3 GDPR).
According to Art. 38 DS-GVO, it must be ensured that the data protection officer
is involved in all data protection issues in an appropriate and timely manner. The
DSB must be assisted in fulfilling his duties by giving him

 – access to personal data and processing operations

as well as

The DPO is in the fulfillment of his duties to maintain confidentiality
or bound to confidentiality. The BDSG-new additionally regulates for DSB
the obligation to maintain secrecy about the identity of the data subject,
who consults the DPO and the circumstances from which conclusions can be drawn
allow the person concerned. In addition, § 6 para. 6 i. V. m.
§ 38 para. 2 BDSG-new the obligation to maintain secrecy and

The person responsible can transfer further tasks to the DPO,
whereby he must ensure that no conflicts of interest arise. This

management are perceived or the fields of activity

Tasks of the DSB
According to Art. 39 GDPR, the DPO has the following tasks:
 – Informing and advising the person responsible and the employees,
carry out the processing with regard to their data protection obligations
(lit. a)

 – Monitoring compliance with data protection regulations and the
tegies of the person responsible for the protection of personal data

Processor concept
According to Art. 4 No. 8 DS-GVO, the processor is a body that processes personal
related data processed on behalf of the person responsible. The term
of the person responsible and subsequently the relevant distinction
between controller and processor is not in the DS-GVO
completely congruent with the wording of the BDSG-old. Responsible
is, according to Art. 4 No. 7 DS-GVO, the body that alone or together with
others about the means and purposes of processing personal data
data decides. This is where the decision comes in
the processing purposes, while the decision on the technical
organizational issues of processing also on the processor
can be delegated (cf. already WP 169 of the Article 29 group,
p. 17 f.). This working document does refer to the legal situation

the GDPR will place more responsibility on processors in the future and

bound by instructions. He therefore does not carry out the processing for the client
as third i. s.d. Art. 4 No. 10 GDPR through. Rather, it is between
the controller issuing the order and its processor

therefore generally attributed to the person responsible.

Short Paper No. 14
Employee data protection
This short paper by the independent federal data protection authorities
and the countries (data protection conference - DSK) serves as a first orientation
especially for the non-public area, as in the opinion of the
DSK the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in practice
should be applied. This view is subject to a
future – possibly different – interpretation of the European
Data Protection Board.

Old law = new law?
In § 32 Federal Data Protection Act-old was the employee data protection
specially regulated. There was no comprehensive employee data protection law
however. The GDPR also does not contain any concrete, area-specific
fishing regulations. Rather, the focus is on employee data protection

must. A hitherto higher national level of data protection can therefore be
be maintained in this area. The German legislator has
this opening clause through the enactment of Section 26 of the new Federal Data Protection Act

In § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 and paragraph 4 BDSG-new is now expressly
regulated that the processing of employee data on the basis

III) To detect criminal offenses
Section 32, paragraph 1, sentence 2 of the old BDSG was adopted as Section 26, paragraph 1, sentence 2
BDSG-new. According to this, data for the detection of criminal offenses may be processed
if there are factual indications to be documented that
the person concerned has committed a criminal offense in the employment relationship.
The processing must be necessary for detection and the protection-worthy
ge interest of the employee in the exclusion of processing
must not predominate. In particular, the type and extent with regard to

Which regulations of the DS-GVO are for video surveillance

such processing the narrow exceptional circumstances of Art. 9 Para. 2
GDPR. Detailed information on this can be found in Short Paper No. 19 “Special

Which content-related requirements will arise in the future for a
video surveillance system?
The test to be carried out in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR follows in
Essentially the criteria already known from the BDSG:
 – Protection of legitimate interests
 – Necessity
 – balancing of interests
With regard to the factual element of "legitimate interest".
the previous casuistry can continue to be followed. New is from German
View, however, the consideration of the so-called "third party interest". As a "third party"

As part of the necessity test, it is still necessary to ask whether the
specific video surveillance is suitable for achieving the purpose and whether al-

Transparency requirements and information signage
In addition to the lawfulness of the processing, the GDPR requires Art. 5

data subject must be processed in a comprehensible manner.
With this regulation as well as the resulting from Art. 12 ff. DS-GVO
requirements, the transparency obligations have increased significantly. From the

increased demands on transparency and the design of the

concept of joint responsibility
Art. 26 of the GDPR regulates the “joint responsibility for processing
ly". This legal institution was already in the EC data protection directive
(RL 95/46/EG) but not detailed and played there
in Germany so far - if at all - only an extremely small role, since
it was not expressly mentioned in the old BDSG. Therefore, the express

practice in Germany have a significant impact.

A designation chosen by the participants themselves or any

Joint responsibility can also exist in such cases
in which the participants declare the relationship as order processing,
however, the purposes and means of processing also or even largely

Those responsible are also liable without an agreement under Art. 26

I. Rights and freedoms of natural persons under the GDPR

(disambiguation)

“Rights and freedoms of natural persons” is a key concept in the
GDPR. The aim of the GDPR is, according to Art. 1 Para. 2 GDPR, the fundamental rights
and to protect fundamental freedoms of natural persons. These determine
adhere to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the European Union
Union (Charter of Fundamental Rights - GrCh) and the European Human Rights
convention (ECHR). The concept of rights and freedoms of natural persons
also includes individual rights under ordinary law. He is within the
European legal context and not according to a purely national

299


47th activity report on data protection

increase The starting point for the interpretation of this term is the fundamental right
on protection of personal data according to Art. 8 GrCh, but it includes
in principle, all fundamental rights that are guaranteed by data protection law at least
be protected indirectly. The provisions in Art. 5 also serve to a particular extent
DS-GVO standardized principles for the processing of personal data
Data and the regulations on the rights of data subjects (Art. 12 et seq. GDPR)
this protection.
The rights and freedoms of natural persons are central to assessing
of a risk in accordance with the GDPR. Any processing of personal
data is at least an impairment of the fundamental right
the protection of personal data by a legal basis
must be justified (Art. 8 GrCh and Art. 6 GDPR).

II. Risk according to the GDPR (disambiguation)
The concept of risk is not explicitly defined in the GDPR. Out of
the recital 75 and 94 sentence 2 DS-GVO, the following definition can be derived
become:
A risk within the meaning of the GDPR is the possibility of
Occurrence of an event that itself causes damage (including
justified impairment of rights and freedoms of natural
persons) or to further damage to one or more
natural persons can lead.
It has two dimensions: first, the severity of the damage, and second
the probability that the event and the consequential damage will occur.

According to recital 75 are among the possible damages physical, material and
classify non-pecuniary damage. Unjustified impairments of

of Art. 5 DS-GVO are in themselves impairments of the basic
right to data protection and therefore already represent a damaging event.
They can also take additional risks, such as natural discrimination

materials

An example of this is an erroneous entry in a ban file
or misrepresentation of creditworthiness – a breach of
the principle of correctness in accordance with Article 5 (1) (d) of the GDPR
can also lead to financial consequential damage and damage to reputation.
Basically, damage can result from:
a. the planned processing itself,
b. responsible and
c. Externally caused deviations from the planned processing (e.g.

Third-party effects, natural disasters, hardware defects ...)

III. risk and legal consequences
The GDPR uses the distinctions "risk" and "high risk"
(e.g. recital 76). In addition, the wording “probably not to
a risk" (Art. 27 Para. 2 lit. a and Art. 33 Para. 1
GDPR). Since there cannot be completely risk-free processing,
the phrase "do not become a risk" is deprived of its meaning and purpose
starting out as leading “only to a small risk”. goal of
Risk assessment is therefore to classify the risks as “low
risk”, “risk” and “high risk”.
The risk with regard to legal consequences under the GDPR is relevant in particular
special at:
 – Responsibility of the controller (Art. 24 para. 1

GDPR)

 – Data protection through technology design (Article 25 (1) GDPR)
 – Security of processing (Article 32 GDPR)
 – Dealing with a personal data breach

(Art. 33, 34 GDPR)

 – Data protection impact assessment and prior consultation (Art. 35,

36 GDPR

IV. Risk Assessment
The phases described below are to be used for the risk assessment
run through:
1. Risk Identification
2. Estimation of the probability of occurrence and severity of possible

damage

301


47th activity report on data protection

3. Assignment to risk classifications
A risk assessment must be based on a concrete description of the
underlying facts for which the risk is to be assessed.

1. Risk Identification
To identify data protection risks, it is advisable to use the following
questions to go out:
a. What damage can be based on natural persons

of the data to be processed?

b. by what, i.e. H. What events can cause the damage?
c. What actions and circumstances can lead to this

events coming?

to a.) Damage to natural persons
According to the GDPR, damage can be physical, material or immaterial
be nature (recital 75, first sentence). The concept of damage is thus in a
to be understood in the broadest sense and not to damage that can be quantified in monetary terms
limited.
It must be considered the negative consequences of the planned processing itself
become. This includes restrictions on rights and freedoms,
for example, if affected persons for fear of disadvantages on the
refrain from exercising their rights (e.g. refraining from participating in a
demonstration due to extensive surveillance).
Also negative consequences of deviations from the planned processing
must be considered (e.g. data access by unauthorized persons
or bodies, unauthorized disclosure or association of data, accidental
Destruction of data, failure or limitations of those provided
processes, accidental or intentional unauthorized modification of
data, failure to fulfill a right to information). The deviations can
to an unlawful one or one that violates data protection principles
lead processing.
Every processing of personal data takes place at least one
Impairment of the fundamental right to protection of personal data
(cf. Art. 8 GrCh). In addition, other fundamental rights may be affected, such as
e.g. B. respect for family life in Art. 7 GrCh or the opinion and
Freedom of assembly in Art. 11 and 12 GrCh or the right to non-

302

materials

criminalization in Art. 21 GrCh. These impairments lead to damage
if they are not justified.
Ultimately, all conceivable negative consequences of data processing must be eliminated
for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, their economic,
financial and immaterial interests, their access to goods or
services, for their professional and social standing, for their
health condition and for any other legitimate interests
to be viewed as.
Examples of possible damage include:
 – Discrimination
 – Identity theft or fraud
 - financial loss
 – damage to reputation
 – economic or social disadvantages
 – Making it more difficult to exercise rights and preventing control

affected people

 – Exclusion or limitation of the exercise of rights and freedoms
 – Profiling or use by assessing personal aspects
 – bodily harm as a result of actions based on incorrect

liable or disclosed data

to b.) Events
For each potential damage already identified, the events
determined that could lead to its realization. These consist in the
Non-compliance with the data protection principles according to Art. 5 Para. 1 DS-GVO
as well as the non-granting of the rights of data subjects according to Art. 12 et seq. DS-GVO,
in particular:
 – unauthorized or unlawful processing
 – Processing contrary to good faith
 – processing that is not transparent for the data subject
 – unauthorized disclosure of and access to data
 – Accidental loss, destruction or corruption of data
 – Denial of data subject rights
 – Incompatible use of the data by the person responsible

purposes

 – Processing of unforeseen data

303


47th activity report on data protection

 – Processing of incorrect data
 – Processing beyond the storage period
In the case of damage resulting from the processing itself, this exists
event in this same processing.

to c.) Sources of risk
A relevant part of the sources of risk is the area of responsibility or
processors and the processing carried out by them according to plan
to assign. It is also necessary to consider the extent to which people in the
Area of the person responsible or any processor aware or
unintentionally exceed the scope provided for processing
could (e.g. a sales department that requires the earmarking of customer data
may change, for example to meet a sales target).
Another example is employees who willfully disobey instructions
on the handling of personal data violated or intentionally in
act without authorization in pursuit of their own interests.
There are also risks from unauthorized attackers such as cybercriminals
take into account. Sources of risk may also be government agencies that
gain unauthorized access. Finally, sources of risk
lie with communication partners with whom personal data
authorized to be exchanged, or with manufacturers and service providers who
Information technology, including the software used with it, which is used for
the processing of personal data or in their environment
will provide or wait.
Finally, technical malfunctions and external influences, e.g. B. through
force majeure, to be considered as sources of risk.

2. Estimation of the probability of occurrence and severity of possible

damage

For each possible damage, the probability of occurrence and
estimated severity. These can only be
to grasp cases mathematically.
Nevertheless, the GDPR requires the risk to be assessed on the basis of objective criteria
assess (recital 76). Especially in cases of immaterial damage, such as
e.g. B. damage to reputation, must also - on the basis of objective criteria -
be judged as to how serious the possible negative consequences for
the lifestyle of the persons concerned are to be classified.

304

materials

One way of measuring a risk is to use a scale
determination of the severity and probability of occurrence of a
possible damage on a scale - with, for example, four levels
gen – to represent.
Both for the differentiation of the probability of occurrence and for
possible damage could be used in each case the following gradations:
 – slightly
 – manageable
 – substantial
 - large
The assignment to the levels must be justified.

probability of occurrence
The probability of occurrence of a risk describes the probability
probability of a specific event (which itself may also be damage
can) occurs and with what further probability there is consequential damage
can come.
For example, is the damaging event an unwanted one?
disclosure of a person's sexual orientation, the likelihood
reliability of both this disclosure and the resulting from it
assess further damage.
The probabilities of the various paths leading to such a
Disclosure can add up here. In the example mentioned
include inadequate precautions of those responsible, more careless
Dealings of employees under their direct responsibility with the
information, technical malfunctions or spying by third parties
the paths to consider.

The severity of the potential damage
The severity of possible damage must be determined in each individual case in particular
taking into account the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing
be determined (recital 76). Significant factors are in particular:
 – Processing of specially protected data within the meaning of Art. 9 and 10
DS-GVO, in which the DS-GVO expressly requires increased protection
neediness provides;

305


47th activity report on data protection

 – Processing of data of groups of people worthy of protection (e.g. children,

employees);

 – Processing of non-modifiable and uniquely identifying data
such as B. clear personal identification numbers compared to pseudonymous
ated data;

 – Automated processing that involves a systematic and comprehensive
Assessment of personal aspects (e.g. profiling) include and on their
Basis then decisions with significant legal effects for
affected persons are met (cf. Art. 35 Para. 3 lit. a DS-GVO);
 - if the damage is not or hardly reversible or the affected person
has only few or limited possibilities, the processing itself
to check or to be checked by a court or to object to this processing
to withdraw, for example, because they have no knowledge of the processing;

 – if the processing enables systematic monitoring;
 – the number of data subjects, the number of data sets and
the number of features in a dataset; and the geographical one
Coverage achieved with the processed data.

3. Assignment to risk classifications
After the probability of occurrence and the severity of possible damage
were determined, these must correspond to the risk classifications "low risk",
"Risk" and "high risk" are assigned. Like this picture specifically
takes place is not described in more detail in the GDPR - it therefore exists
basically scope for different models.
The overall risk of processing is generally the highest risk
class of individual risks. Should many in this risk class
Individual risks may exist, but it may be necessary in individual cases
assume a higher risk class.

risk matrix
For the assessment of the risk of processing according to the probability of occurrence
probability and the severity of the possible damage can be the following
matrix are used:

306

materials

When estimating the risk using the matrix, cases may arise
in which the occurrence of the damage is relatively probable or the potential
cial damage would weigh particularly heavily and thus borderline areas
between risk areas may be affected. Here are in the fields
entered two colors in the matrix. This makes it clear that in these
borderline cases, a case-by-case analysis is necessary. In case of doubt, this can
come to the conclusion that, despite the result of the generic
assessment based on the matrix of individual cases appears to be so serious that
that there is still a high risk. Conversely, in individual cases
e.g. B. also a minor possible damage that is manageable
probability of occurrence represent a low risk.
With the procedure described up to this point, the

V. Risk Control
By way of the data protection impact assessment or – if likely
there is no high risk - in a simplified procedure, the next
th step to appropriately contain the risks
determine.
Basically, the risk of processing by means of remedial measures
to contain Often this will correspond with the prior art
technical and organizational measures (TOMs) can be achieved,
which are suitable to protect the rights and freedoms of the natural persons concerned
adequately ensure by reducing the probability of occurrence
and/or mitigate the severity of the potential damage. In addition
include measures to contain adverse events (e.g.
Attacks by cybercriminals) like classic security measures
from information security, but with a view to protecting the
are to be assessed by the persons concerned and not by the person responsible.

VI. residual risk
The risk remaining after these measures have been implemented is
referred to as risk. If this residual risk is classified as high, then there is
the obligation for prior consultation in accordance with Art. 36 GDPR.
The person responsible must check carefully (and according to Art. 5 Para. 2 DS-GVO
documented as proof of compliance with the requirements of the GDPR
have), whether he has all possible according to the principle of proportionality
taken measures to mitigate the risk before commencing
processing begins.
After the remedial measures have been implemented, they must be tested for effectiveness
tested and continuously monitored. Possibly shows
when implementing the measures that there are other risks that
are also to be treated.

Conclusion
The objective determination and assessment of the risk of processing
personal data in the above Sense is required to determine how
the rights and freedoms of natural persons are effectively protected.

Short Paper No. 19
Informing and obliging employees to comply
the data protection requirements according to the data protection
basic regulation
This short paper by the independent federal data protection authorities
and the countries (data protection conference - DSK) serves as a first orientation
especially for the non-public area, as in the opinion of the
DSK the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in practice
should be applied. This view is subject to a
future – possibly different – interpretation of the European
Data Protection Board.

What does the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulate?
According to Article 29 GDPR, employees of a person responsible (a
company, a club, an association, a self-employed person, a
authority and so on) or a processor's personal data
Data exclusively on the instructions of the person responsible or
arbeiters process, unless a statutory provision dictates one

the persons authorized to process the personal data
have committed to confidentiality (insofar as they do not
are subject to statutory confidentiality obligations; The latter applies, for example
for private medical, tax consultant or legal clearing houses).
Even if, according to the wording of the GDPR, only the employees of one
are to be "obligated" by the processor, the content of this "obligatory
de information” (hereinafter: obligation) also those responsible
and their employees. How responsible this legal obligation
implement (and, if necessary, prove to the supervisory authority), is not
bindingly regulated. It is recommended that this be in the form of a written or
to implement an electronic declaration of commitment. A pattern for one
such obligation can be found in the Annex.

309


47th activity report on data protection

What should be committed?
The obligation of employees to maintain data secrecy
and to comply with data protection requirements is an important one
part of the measures required for a responsible
cher (see Article 5 paragraph 2 and Article 24 paragraph 1 GDPR) or a
Processor (see Article 28 Paragraph 3 Clause 2 Letter b GDPR)
ensure and prove compliance with the principles of the GDPR
may (“accountability”). These principles of the GDPR, laid down in
Article 5 paragraph 1 DS-GVO essentially includes the following obligations:
Personal data must
a) in a lawful and fair manner and in a way that is fair to the data subject
be processed in a comprehensible manner ("lawfulness, processing
good faith, transparency”);

b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and
may not be used in a manner incompatible with these purposes
be further processed ("earmarking");

c) adequate and relevant to the purpose and to what is necessary for the purposes of

Processing be limited to what is necessary ("data minimization");

d) accurate and, where necessary, up to date; it
all reasonable measures must be taken to ensure that personal
data that are inaccurate in relation to the purposes of their processing,
promptly deleted or corrected ("accuracy");

e) stored in a form that allows the identification of those concerned
persons only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which they
work is required (“Storage Limitation”);

f) processed in a manner that provides adequate security
of personal data, including protection against
unauthorized or unlawful processing and against unintentional
loss, accidental destruction or accidental damage
through appropriate technical and organizational measures ("Integrity
and confidentiality").

The core element of the measure is that the employees on compliance
be bound by operational instructions. The shape of the respective
sung is of secondary importance. In addition to individual instructions
of superiors, in particular company agreements and general
service instructions. In addition, process descriptions (e.g
from quality management), schedules and documentation
(e.g. register of processing activities) and manuals

Who needs to be committed?
The group of persons to be obliged (the DS-GVO speaks in this respect
of “subject natural persons”) is due to the importance of these
regulation to be interpreted broadly. In particular, in addition to the regular
core of workers also trainees, interns, legal trainees, temporary workers
and involve volunteers.
So much for the secrecy of employees in the public sector
is expressly regulated by law or collective bargaining agreement, such a
obligation does not occur.

When does the commitment have to be made?
The commitment must be made upon commencement of the activity. she should
should therefore be made on the first working day if possible (at the latest).

How must an obligation be made?
Responsible for the obligation is the company management, the owner of a
company or one of its representatives. Even if, as stated above,
the GDPR does not prescribe a specific form of obligation, it should
a special form can be used for reasons of proof, whereby the
Commitment may be in writing or in an electronic format.
The obligation also includes instruction about the resulting
duties. The employees are - if possible based on typical cases -
to inform you about what you can do in terms of data protection with your

other non-disclosure agreements can also be combined,
for example on trade, telecommunications or tax secrecy. Out of
Reasons for proof within the framework of the accountability according to the DS-GVO
it is important to adequately document the commitment.

Is the one-off data protection obligation enough?
For the ongoing sensitization of employees to questions of data protection
it is advisable to do this at regular time intervals as part of training courses
or in written notices, for example in the company newspaper
to remind employees that they have been committed and which ones

5. Resolution of the 36th Conference of

Freedom of Information Officer in Germany
from 16.10.2018

5.1
Social participation needs consistent publication of
administrative regulations!
An open and transparent administrative culture is a prerequisite for
for citizens and the state to meet on an equal footing.
The conference of freedom of information officers in Germany demands
the social service providers, administrative regulations independent of the application,
to publish in a timely and user-friendly manner, insofar as they do not do so
are already required by law.1
Social participation of all people in our society follows from the im
principle of the welfare state enshrined in the Basic Law. expression of this principle
a social security system based on social security benefits
Social codes guarantee a basic standard of social security
should. Only informed citizens can make the decisions that concern them
Understand benefits agency decisions, file claims
do, but also fulfill obligations.
All social service providers use administrative regulations to
a uniform processing and decision-making practice for your authority
ensure. Administrative regulations are internal directives that regulate
how laws are to be interpreted and applied. Admittedly, administrative
regulations directly only the administration itself; those on their basis
However, the decisions made have an external effect. administrative regulations
are therefore to be announced so that "the person concerned (...) is aware of the content of the
rights and obligations established for him by them”2.
For example, the Federal Employment Agency and the
German pension insurance, which publish current instructions. Many
other social service providers, on the other hand, provide the information at best
out upon request.

1 Legal obligations currently exist in: Hamburg, Bremen, Rhineland-Palatinate,
Schleswig-Holstein (from January 1st, 2020).
