Video conferencing systems in schools





HBDI is adjusting the timeframe for schools to transition their video conferencing systems to match the delay in adopting the country's video conferencing system





09.07.2021








            The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HBDI) Professor Dr. Alexander Roßnagel was informed that the introduction of the state-wide video conferencing system for the schools in the state of Hesse (Landes-VKS) will probably be delayed. The delay is due to an application for review in the award procedure.

It was planned that the state-wide video conferencing system would be made available to the schools on August 1st, 2021. Due to the delay, this appointment cannot be kept. Professor Roßnagel says: “Schools and students should not suffer from the delay in introducing the state video conferencing system. On the other hand, it is important to me to create a data protection-compliant state in this area. The ongoing restrictions on the fundamental rights of those affected must be kept as low as possible.”
The HBDI is now reacting to the changed circumstances. He will not take any action against schools that cannot switch to a data protection-compliant video conferencing system because the state VKS is not yet available. As soon as the schools can use the state VKS, the HBDI expects that the schools will switch to the state VKS quickly.
