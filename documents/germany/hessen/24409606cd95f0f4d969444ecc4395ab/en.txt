1. For data protection in Hesse, there were no difficult
significant violations - in contrast to the development in
Germany or in the world. In Hesse, data protection has been largely
accepted and not fundamentally questioned. Nevertheless, in many
Areas that meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GMO) still not sufficiently implemented, lead to complaints,
require the intervention of the data protection supervisory authority and orders
and enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis. The digitization of many
Tasks and activities cause additional
che obligations, entails additional requirements and requires
additional attention (Part I No. 1).

2. For the further development of data protection in Hesse win the
Europeanization with decisions of the European Court of Justice
(ECJ) and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) (Part I
No. 1 and 5) as well as the juridification of data protection law with a
Significant increase in fines (from 2 in 2020 to 29
in 2021) and involving the courts (Part I, Items 1 and 6)
increasingly important. This requires more influence
European developments through committed participation in work
circles of the EDPB and the expansion of the legal department to deal with the
additional process procedures.

3. The diverse data protection issues in the implementation of the corona protection
measures in many everyday areas of life led to
data protection complaints, inquiries and advice from
Those affected and those responsible for data processing (Part I No. 1
and 2). Additional measures were also required to
management decisions made at the beginning of the pandemic
with the new challenges that are understandable in the situation im
Result but were in breach of data protection, to correct gradually
(Part I Nos. 1 and 4.2).

4. A key focus of oversight activity continued to be the

This is the first activity report for which I am responsible and at the same time the
50th of the Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
The first activity report (state parliament printed matter 7/1495) dates from 29.
March 1972. With him, the first data protection officer in Hesse described,
Willi Birkelbach, the first steps of data protection supervision in the new
scope of data protection. The duties of the data protection officer
were without any precedent at the time because the Hessian Data Protection Act
(HDSG) of October 7, 1970 was the world's first data protection law.
In this respect, there was also no model for such a report. It was
the world's first privacy report.
The report describes a "forward into new territory" of data protection (p. 10f.).
The law only applied to machine data processing in the public sector

to recognize the horizon (p. 33f.). The data protection officer was appointed according to § 7
Para. 1 HDSG elected by the state parliament at the suggestion of the state government and
was free from instructions according to § 8 HDSG. Him stood to fulfill his

On the other hand, Birkelbach closes his report with a look into the future

1. New tasks and general conditions
New tasks and framework conditions
This activity report describes and analyzes data protection
in Hesse in year 4 since the date of application of the basic data protection
regulation on May 25, 2018. Many uncertainties that the new, very
has brought abstract legal frameworks for the practice of data protection,
are overcome. Some issues have now been resolved, others are
still under discussion. In some areas of action arise
first routines. The Europeanization of data protection is progressing
and is increasingly changing the tasks and options for action

Jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice
Accordingly, the importance of the European Court of Justice increases and
jurisprudence for the further development of data protection law. He has
some important decisions on data protection and interpretation
of the General Data Protection Regulation and existing
disputes resolved. But every decision focuses on its development
the subject of divorce and yet always contains things that point beyond it
Remarks. As a result, the decisions leave many new questions
which is being disputed and the legal uncertainty for those responsible and
effect supervisory authorities. An example is the “Facebook Fan Page Judgment”
of June 5, 2018 (C-210/16), in which the court found that the
Operators of a "fan page" and Facebook share responsibility for
have the processing of the data of persons who visit the "Fanpage".
Since this judgment, every IT cooperation between two bodies has been asked
whether they share joint responsibility for data processing.
A clear demarcation to separate responsibility, accepted by all
or for order processing has not yet been found. This question has
the Hessian data protection supervisory authority in many individual cases. A
Another example is the "Schrems II judgment" of July 16, 2020 (C-311/18). It

Providers from the USA can be implemented (see item 3). This question
affected many efforts to implement the judgment in Hesse such as

Judgment on the Hessian Petitions Committee of July 9, 2020 (C-272/19). In
the court found that the petitions committee in the Hessian
sian state parliament is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation. It has
but very narrowly limited to the classification of the Petitions Committee and

such as the question of whether the state parliaments in Germany

European cooperation
The framework conditions for the Hessian data protection supervision
increasingly also determined by the European data protection infrastructure,
of which she is a part. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has
meanwhile caught on and many issues in cross-border
Individual questions decided as well as many helpful clarifications in the form of
Recommendations, guidelines and opinions given.
Alongside the European Court of Justice, the committee is the instance that
Union-wide determines how the abstract provisions of the General Data Protection
ordinance are to be understood in practice. Anyone who wants to influence
how data protection will be understood and practiced in the future in the Union,
must be actively involved in the work of the EDPB and its working groups
(see item 5).
In order to ensure uniform implementation of data protection in the Union
len, the General Data Protection Regulation sees a narrow cross-border
cooperation between the supervisory authorities in the Member States. Touches a

Member States come from different data protection traditions and
have developed different understandings of data protection supervision.
Therefore, the supervisory authorities very often have to

and the cumbersome procedures of collaboration. Overall, the

in these collaborative processes it is decided who influences

intensive participation is necessary (see item 5). However, it is often frustrating
reluctant to watch helplessly as the data protection requirements,
agreed upon by all Union supervisors, for the worldwide

Juridification of the supervisory activity
The General Data Protection Regulation has new legal options for

The number of complaints, which has been increasing since 2018, leads to

people who have lodged a complaint and an increase
of complaints against the supervisory authority. These in turn increase the
workload and jeopardize the regulator's reputation as a fiduciary

Through the juridification of the supervisory activity, the jurisprudence of
increasing importance for data protection at national courts.
However, there are no courts or chambers specializing in data protection
or senates. On the contrary, the individual arbitral tribunals usually decide too seldom
about data protection issues than that they are always included in the special systematics and

technical, economic and political developments can be observed,
which are increasingly endangering the personal rights of the persons concerned.
For Hesse, on the other hand, it should be noted that data protection in the reporting period
accepted and not fundamentally questioned.
Nevertheless, in many areas the requirements of the General Data Protection
regulation is still not sufficiently implemented, leading to complaints,
require the intervention of the data protection supervisory authority as well as orders and
enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis. The digitization of many tasks
and activities creates additional obligations for those responsible

Large companies and administrations can cope with this to some extent.
This can be small and medium-sized businesses or communities but easily

for which supervisory notices were required but also welcomed.
In the school sector, the supervisory authority accompanied the developments of the

Data protection requirements for contact tracing
Already in the course of the previous reporting period (see 49.
ity report, Section 11.6) was the corona-related contact recording
focus of my work. The data protection issues in the reporting period
to work on was particularly difficult because the regulations for contact
tracking were repeatedly adapted to the pandemic.
For this reason, too, I received various inquiries and complaints
on the subject of contact tracing.

I. Frequent change of legal bases
The regulations on contact data collection were throughout the year
subject to frequent changes, which often only apply for a short period of time. The

according to § 4 CoSchuV. § 4 CoSchuV itself referred again
to the federal regulation of § 28a para. 4 IfSG (Federal Law Gazette I p. 370) and supplemented
these by a few stipulations.
From June 25, 2021, the CoSchuV initially obliged various companies
operators and event organizers for the
clock data acquisition:
 – Trade fairs and cultural events (theatre, opera, cinema and concerts)

according to § 16 CoSchuV,

 - Fitness studios and similar facilities according to § 18 paragraph 2 CoSchuV,
Casinos, amusement arcades and similar establishments according to Section 18 (4).

deleted from August 19, 2021 (CoSchuV, GVBl. p. 386) (see Section 2.5).
Since then, the rights of those affected have been part of the contact data collection
applicable without restriction.
Since September 16, 2021 (CoSchuV, GVBl. p. 571) were large parts
of the formerly obligated parties are excluded from contact data collection
(especially restaurants, hairdressers, fitness studios and cultural institutions).
However, dance halls, discotheques, clubs and

similar facilities according to § 26 CoSchuV. According to § 27 paragraph 2 CoSchuV
the local competent authorities were also given the power to

also a contact data collection for other facilities (restaurants,

The CoSchuV was re-enacted on November 25, 2021 (GVBl. p. 742). The
Regulations on the collection of contact data were only editorial
Changes, but the content remained unchanged.
On December 16, 2021, Section 4 CoSchuV was supplemented by sentence 2.
Thereafter, contact data collection was not required if the person

Regulation during the reporting period and related
Due to legal uncertainty, this requirement was not consistently complied with (see
Section 2.3).
The contact details were surname, first name, address and telephone number

is legally standardized, such "consent" could not be obtained. also is
the production of copies of identity cards or negative evidence

inadmissible. These contain significantly more personal data (in the case of
Negative evidence also health data within the meaning of Art. 9 DS-GVO)
than may be levied by law (see Section 2.3). The contact details were
according to § 4 S. 1 No. 1 CoSchuV to be given completely and truthfully.

Obviously false information (pseudonyms, "funny names") did not meet
the requirements of the CoSchuV.
In the reporting period, it happened again and again that contact details for other
whose purposes have been used (e.g. advertising or other
communication with the recorded). Since the contact details according to § 28a para. 4

Violations of contact tracing rules
Some concrete examples from the practice of the reporting year show the
data protection problems of contact tracing that have arisen. Me
received many complaints that the publicly available interpretation of the
leading contact lists as content. In addition, the improper
Custody and inadmissibly long storage of the contact data was reprimanded.
In these cases, I have taken measures to protect the data protection

Another focus of my supervisory work was leadership

these data collections were not available. The day-care centers are for such queries
not responsible. However, you can contact the parents by means of information letters
or talking about their legal obligations after entry

Due to an input, I became aware of a form that some
Kitas should use to query information from "travel returnees".
The provider of these day-care centers provided them with a form before the 2021 summer holidays
lar to query numerous personal data of parents and children

Publication of vaccination data on social networks
There is a risk that those responsible will violate the provisions of the
violate data protection law if they are related to the Corona

publish on social networks.

During the reporting period, I received a complaint concerning a
contribution (so-called post) in a regional chat group. had in the post
the management of a company announces that all employees

must be vaccinated against Covid-19. The management named though
none of the employees by name. Because of the regional connection
but without much effort it is possible to draw conclusions about the identity of the

I took the complaint as an opportunity to contact the person responsible
to listen to the process. He took this as an opportunity to write the corresponding post
to delete. To process the vaccination status of the employees concerned
he stated that a time off work for the Covid-19 vaccination
had been granted, so that the employees through the exercise
the time off work would have voluntarily disclosed the vaccination status. The
Employees were informed about the intended mail and
had given their consent to this orally.
With regard to the case described, it must be taken into account that two
data processing operations are to be distinguished from one another: On the one hand
the question of the legality of the collection of vaccination data arises
the employer (querying the vaccination status), on the other hand is the disclosure

Digital sovereignty and successful digitization projects
Digital sovereignty means that those responsible have the option
comply with their data protection obligations. It is therefore an
necessary prerequisite for digitization that conforms to data protection law.
Ensuring digital sovereignty and taking it into account at an early stage
of data protection thus form common essential success factors
for successful digitization projects.

It came about at the beginning of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
a special exceptional situation. This led and continues to lead
profound changes in daily life and has an impact on
different areas of life. For a variety of challenges
solutions had to be found, implemented and made available at short notice.
In the context of IT solutions, the focus during implementation was therefore in
many cases, initially on speed and the provision of indispensable
clear basic functionalities. Other aspects were these goals
subordinate and often deferred. This was especially true for
the data protection.
Overall, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a sustained digital
growth that continued in the reporting period. Also
for the coming reporting period I expect a progressive increase

in connection with the implementation of the Online Access Act (OZG).
This commits the federal, state and local authorities to the end
of the year 2022 a large number of their administrative services online

initially continue to be used by schools in the pedagogical area,
until an audit of the data protection compliance of Microsoft 365 by the
Conference of independent data protection officers has brought clarity.
In this context, however, I have also made it clear that on the part of the HKM

to use other VKS.
I have also pointed out the current legal situation again. This will

Court of Justice (ECJ). According to this judgment, the transmission of
personal data of European citizens in states,
that do not guarantee the data protection standard of the DS-GVO, without additional
Protective measures are prohibited (see Section 3.1 for details). With the use of the
Landes-VKS would Hessian schools (subject to my examination) the

Of course, I was also aware that it was due to
school-specific processes in the individual schools in the state
different timings of the migration could occur. For this reason
I was willing to share the resulting delays, so far
it is recognizable that the schools are moving towards a data protection compliant
hit VKS. However, I walked away at the time
from that schools by the end of the first half of the school year at the latest
completed the conversion in 2021/22.
At the beginning of July 2021, I was informed that the introduction
of the state-wide VKS for the schools of the state of Hesse
will obviously be further delayed. The delay is due to a
application for examination in the award procedure. Due to the delay, the
originally announced date for the introduction of the state VKS.
Due to the fact that the state VKS will not be in place by August 1, 2021

It is important to me to maintain a data protection law-compliant state in this
area and the ongoing restriction of fundamental rights

but that a changeover by the schools to the state VKS quickly
will take place. Again, I will describe the circumstances in each school

Grant state VKS by the HKM.
On December 27, 2021, the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court determined that
that the award procedure was defective. The HKM must therefore again
carry out an award procedure. A state VKS is therefore probably only
expected at the beginning of the 2022/2023 school year. This changes mine
However, there is nothing fundamental about giving the schools the time

to change compliant VKS.

II. Challenges for universities
The universities of the state of Hesse were also involved in mid-March 2020
confronted with the conditions of the corona pandemic and the lives of the
Students and teachers have changed significantly. Instead of in a full
len lecture hall together with fellow students at the courses
to take part had to use other routes due to the contact restrictions
be found to provide the required scholarly communication
to perform. As with the schools, it made sense to use VKS,
to bring the courses to the student apartments.
Here, too, data protection was taken into account when selecting the systems used
often not placed in the foreground, but on established ones on the market

promised.
On the part of the then HBDI, in spring 2020, the Hessian
tian universities clarified that the opportunities available to the schools at
the selection of a VKS were granted, also for the university sector
are valid. This meant that in the interests of flexible combating
Corona pandemic also in this area temporarily the use of
VKS on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Subparagraph 1 lit. d and e GDPR largely

In the months that followed, my predecessor and I went to college

A VKS designed for use at schools and colleges across the country

cial conditions that work in such institutions entails.
When using a VKS, different categories of personal

But also such data that the provider of the VKS for other reasons

remains to be seen. With the tasks from Art. 57 DS-GVO and Art. 58 Para. 3
lit. b DS-GVO there are good reasons for a different result than the OVG
to come to the Federal Network Agency in summary proceedings.
But it is certainly important that every decision about a report
a fine is to be made on a case-by-case basis. It's about to
take into account that the press release has a pillory effect
significantly negative consequences in terms of "name and shame"
can be solved. On the other hand, the public also has a
interest in the information. This raises the question of whether and how and
to what extent to draw attention to an imposed fine
is. My authority decides on this on a case-by-case basis.
The fact that some regulators publish fines
and others not, many a press release the name of
company reveals, while others do not, results in a colorful landscape
of publications. It becomes even more colorful that some fines
is not announced at all. This different press work plays for
the quality of the case collections for the fine procedure plays a key role.

improper use of data from the so-called "corona lists" in

is only the case if it involves a crime focus

the video surveillance is here in particular, the crime by a

It is also important to ensure that the necessary video surveillance
private zones can be masked out so that, for example
wise living spaces, interiors of shops, but also outdoor areas
of restaurants and cafes as far as they are for more than a short stay
are not intended to be captured by video surveillance. For this is
to design the video surveillance in such a way that the affected areas
are not first recorded by the cameras.
Incidentally, the requirements for recordings at meetings
specifically regulated and restricted in the Assembly Act (VersammlG).
(§§ 12a, 19a Assembly Act). Insofar as the video surveillance

The signage of the video-monitored areas is to be carried out in such a way that
that they are sufficiently recognizable and perceptible for the persons concerned
is acceptable. Therefore, the information signs should be attached in such a way that
it is clearly visible which area the video surveillance covers and who
who are responsible and how they can be contacted.
Further instructions and information will be on the signs

Finally, the storage duration of the video recordings must be proportionate

Queries in the driving aptitude register in the pursuit of
traffic violations
During the reporting period, my authority received several complaints to
early data queries in the driving aptitude register as part of the processing
of traffic violations. Here could in cooperation with the
Kassel Regional Council, Central Fines Office, a fundamental one
Change in the process can be achieved.

The Federal Motor Transport Authority operates on the basis of the Road Traffic Act
(§ 28 StVG) the driving aptitude register (FAER). Querying data from
the FAER are for the competent prosecuting authorities under the
Processing of traffic offenses regularly required to
for the punishment of violations to determine whether by the data subject
criminal offenses or administrative offenses are repeatedly committed which
related to road traffic. Regarding the question of
legally permissible time of a query in the FAER as part of the
Processing of traffic offenses by the government
sidium Kassel, Central Fines Office (ZBS), went in the reporting period
several complaints.
In the FAER, information about road users who are on the road
traffic have become conspicuous, stored, insofar as the offense committed
action rated with points according to the driving aptitude rating system
is. Specifically, the complainants submitted that
Inquiries by the ZBS to the FAER were made at a time when
when there was no underlying requirement. Because the information
from the FAER only for the individual sanction in the corresponding
Traffic offense procedures are required is a requirement
for the relevant data collection in the opinion of my authority
given if the procedure after the assessment of the present
information against a specific vehicle driver.
The original procedure already saw a FAER query at the KBA
at a time when, after a summary examination of the expert
consider the hearing of the person concerned and the owner information has been provided
was triggered. At this point, however, the addressee of the accusation
have not yet had an opportunity to comment on this and, if necessary
to appoint another person as the responsible driver or
to state other reasons that further prosecution of the traffic
inhibit an administrative offense or the prosecuting authority within the framework of
application of the principle of opportunity refrain from further prosecution

trigger, which is not (yet) required at this time and therefore considered
were not permissible under data protection law.
After my authority discussed this problem with the ZBS,
a change in the relevant specialist procedure has now been triggered. Provided
after owner information and summary examination, a hearing as those affected
or affected person, no FAER query is initially carried out.
Such a query is now only after a period of time that the
seven-day feedback period with regard to the hearing of those affected

Current developments in public administration

With three clicks to apply for a driver's license
– Challenges of data protection law
administrative modernization
Faster, more efficient, more user-friendly and also cheaper?
The provision of services by the administration to citizens
and business aims through the use of e-government procedures
be modernized. A diverse and complex undertaking, such as
the attached diagram explains it very well. Also with a view
data protection law raises many tricky questions. The following
The article gives an overview of the developments in 2021 from data protection
legal perspective.

Final sprint for the implementation of the OZG
This is an essential component of the implementation of a modern administration
Law passed in 2017 to improve online access to
administrative services (Online Access Act – OZG). The law obliges
Federal, state and local governments, their administrative services by the end of 2022
- for example the application for a driver's license - via administration
also offer digital portals. Digitization is affected by this
of 575 administrative services.
In order to realize this mammoth project in the planned period,
etc. developed the so-called "One for All" (OfA) principle. The EfA principle
is the idea of an efficient and cost-saving administrative digitization
talization. If, for example, the state of Hesse submits the application for granting
of a driver's license digitized as an administrative service, the authorities should
other federal states join the solution and they too
to be able to use.
As far as the provision of portal solutions or the implementation
digital administrative services using the OFA principle,
there are several difficult ones from a data protection point of view
legal issues, e.g. e.g.:
 – Which responsibilities within the meaning of the GDPR (responsibility,
Joint responsibility, order processing) arise between

91

50th activity report on data protection

between the different parties involved in the digitization process
actors – e.g. B. the entity developing the system (Country A), which
driving unit (IT service provider) and the subsequent user unit (country
B, federal government, municipality)?

 – How can the legal consequences linked to this be efficiently implemented
become? Is it necessary to create new legal bases or
are contracts to be concluded?

 – Must for the processing of personal data in the OZG context
new legal bases are created or are they already sufficient
existing legal basis?

 – If legislative action is necessary, who must

take action, the federal government or the states?

 – What technical and organizational requirements are there for a
administration portal and to provide a digitized administration service?
For these and other topics it applies - despite the extremely tight implementation
period of time - compliant with data protection law and manageable in practice
to develop solutions.
My authority is in regular and close contact with them
the data protection officers of the federal and state governments, the OZG coordinator
nators of the state of Hesse, project managers for digitization
individual administrative services, the central Hessian service providers for
Information and communication technology and the federal IT cooperation.

Kick-off for register modernization
In order to enable the use of digital administrative services for citizens and
organizations to further improve, the many public
register can be adjusted. In April 2021, the law on
Introduction of an identification number in public administration and
to change other laws (Register Modernization Act – RegMoG)
announced. The newly created regulations are intended to
uninformed administrative services are supported. The implementation follows
the idea of the once-only principle: citizens and
Organizations should only provide the necessary information once
administration to submit. With the consent of the users
and users should have the data reused and shared with other authorities
can be exchanged easily and safely.
A necessary prerequisite for this is the clear identification of persons
sonen and cross-register identification management. With it

assigned and the quality of the data can be improved as well
the renewed provision of already existing data is no longer necessary
according to the RegMoG, the tax ID should be used as a cross-register
identifier are used. In the case of an application for grant
a driver's license, the tax ID could be used for inquiries about driving
registration register or the central driver's license register.
The topic is not only national, but also European
Dimension. Selected administrative procedures are to be carried out online across borders
can be processed progressively and completely without media discontinuity
(Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of October 2, 2018 on the establishment of a uniform digital
gangstors to information, procedures, assistance and problem solving services
and to amend Regulation (EU) No. 1024/2012 – SDG-VO).
From a data protection perspective, the use of a registered
cross-identification feature, there is a risk that personal
gene data on a large scale easily linked and into a comprehensive
personality profile can be completed. The conference of
data protection officer of the federal and state governments already has this in their
Resolution of August 26, 2020 "Register modernization constitutional
Implement compliantly!” (https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.
de/resolutions.html). The risk potential is illustrated
if you consider the dimensions of register modernization
leads: 51 registers are identified by the tax ID
linked together.
So desirable and important a faster, more effective and modern
Administration is too - the task of the data protection authorities is to ensure that
to wear that despite all the euphoria and eagerness to innovate, the right to
informational self-determination does not get out of sight. Necessary
this requires transparent procedures, compliance with high data
protection standards and a technically safe design.

Live streaming of meetings and publication of minutes
on the Internet – Participation in local politics in times of Corona
Pandemic
Participation in local political decision-making processes – for example through
keeping track of municipal council meetings or access to
Minutes of meetings – is in compliance with data protection principles
possible despite restrictions due to the pandemic.

Against the background of the corona pandemic, I received more

Political decision-making and opinion-forming processes are justified here
on informational self-determination of those affected by the publication
towards people and must be balanced in an interest-based manner
to be brought. In the following I would therefore like to go into more detail on the legal
possibilities and the data protection aspects.

I. Publication of video and audio recordings of meetings of

municipal council online

For Hessian municipalities, Section 52 (3) of the Hessian Municipal
deordnung (HGO) a legal regulation for the production of image and
Sound recordings in public meetings.

§ 52 HGO
(1) The municipal council passes its resolutions in public meetings. She can for
individual matters exclude the public. Requests for exclusion
public are reasoned, discussed and decided in non-public meetings;
the decision can be made in open court if no special one
Justification or advice is required. The chairman, in agreement with
involve the mayor in the meetings that are not open to the public.
(2) Resolutions that have been passed in non-public meetings should, insofar as
this is likely to be announced after the public has been restored.
(3) The main articles of association can stipulate that film and sound recordings
media for the purpose of publication are permissible.

The regulation lays down the decision-making authority over the publication
of film and sound recordings of public meetings in the hands of the community

50th activity report on data protection

de-representation, which can determine in the main statute that in public
Sessions film and sound recordings by the media with the aim of
publication are permitted. This also includes the possibility
corresponding recordings on the municipal website
publish.
Insofar as the main statute contains a corresponding regulation, however
additional data protection considerations are required. So should speakers
speakers can request that their speech be recorded
or the recording is not published (right to object).
Also, before each session, a reference to the production of images and
Sound recordings are made (see also the short paper no. 10 of the DSK
on information requirements for third-party and direct collection, available at https://
datenschutz.hessen.de/infothek/kurzpapiere-der-dsk).
The city of Frankfurt am Main has in § 11 of the main statute and § 48 para. 2
the rules of procedure of the city council, for example
made the following regulation:

§ 11 Main Statute of the City of Frankfurt am Main
The public meetings of the City Council can be viewed online

§ 48 paragraph 3 Rules of Procedure of the City Council
The head of the city council arranges for a simultaneous
Audio transmission of speeches on the Internet. The sound transmission is from the city
to be announced by the head of the city council at the beginning of the meeting.
Speakers who object to audio transmission have this
to notify the head of the city council. In this case
will speeches of or of the opponent, which are based on prior written
Request to speak based, not transferred.

In contrast to elected representatives, employees and meeting attendees must
not accept that they are part of picture and
sound recordings are. Here the settings are to be selected in such a way that recording
Individually identifiable persons are avoided as far as possible. Otherwise
usually the consent of the person concerned must be obtained. In

prevented and thus guaranteed by those responsible.
A transparent declaration of consent should take this into account and
as concrete as possible, in an understandable and easily accessible form in one
be formulated in clear and simple language. In addition, the characteristic
sufficient account is taken of the voluntary nature of the declaration of consent
(see also brief paper no. 20 of the DSK on consent
according to the GDPR, available at https://datenschutz.hessen.de/infothek/
brief-papers-of-dsk).

II. Publication of Minutes of Meetings
In addition to virtual participation in public meetings, the
Online provision of meeting minutes against the background
of the pandemic-related contact restrictions is becoming increasingly greater
Role. A regulation on minutes can be found in § 61 HGO:

§ 61 HGO
(1) About the essential content of the negotiations of the municipal council is one
to prepare transcript. The minutes must show who is present at the meeting
was present, which items were negotiated, which resolutions were passed and which ones
elections have been held. The voting and election results must be recorded.
Any member of the municipal council can demand that their vote be taken in the
transcript is recorded.
(2) The minutes are to be signed by the chairman and the secretary.
Municipal representatives or municipal employees can be secretaries – and that too
those who do not reside in the municipality - or are elected citizens.
(3) A copy of the minutes must be included within a period of time to be specified in the rules of procedure
period of time to all community representatives in writing or electronically. Over
The municipal council decides on objections to the minutes.

Addressees of the minutes are the community board and the community
deprecation. In this way, the committees are to be given information and control
be made possible. In principle, the general public has no claim
to look at the transcripts. However, there is nothing to prevent that
Minutes relating to the public part of a meeting,
also be made available to other people.
When publishing, however, care should be taken to ensure that the
contain such personal or personally identifiable data.

Improvements through the amendment of the Hessian school law
The 12th amendment to the Hessian School Act (HSchG) is intended to
achieve improvements in data protection law. So become schools for the
digital data processing no consent of the students
and teachers need more. A new legal regulation (§ 83a
Para. 1 No. 2 HSchG) should enable the schools to
to determine their digitization processes. become at the same time
schools, however, are also required to protect privacy and security
to ensure data processing. However, it is expected to
last until autumn 2022 before the law is passed after a wide range of consultations
can be dismissed.

The legal basis for school data processing before the
amendment
So far, schools that use a digital tool in the pedagogical
wanted to use the area of their activity, the consent of the persons concerned
serve as there is no legal requirement for this type of data processing
basis there.
School data processing is based on the legal basis of the
Article 6 paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 lit. a and e GDPR and the currently valid § 83
Para. 1 HSchG.

Article 6 paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 lit. a and e GDPR
The processing is only lawful if at least one of the following conditions
conditions are met:
a) the data subject has given their consent to the processing of data concerning them

e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public domain

was transferred.

Parents and teachers process, insofar as this is for lawful fulfillment
of the school's educational mission and for one associated with it

The need to obtain the consent of those affected applies in particular
special for pictures and videos of students who are in the
school context. The legal basis for this is Art. 6
Paragraph 1 subparagraph 1 lit. a GDPR.
Digital data processing has also been subject to the reservation of the
consent of those concerned. However, the state data processing
education (school = state) are fundamentally based on legal regulations
and the legal institution of consent only in exceptional cases
(e.g. for taking pictures).

Recital 43 GDPR
In order to ensure that the consent has been given voluntarily, it should, in special cases,

exists, especially if the person responsible is an authority,
and therefore unlikely given all the circumstances in the particular case
is that the consent was given voluntarily do not provide a valid legal basis.

EG 43 considers the voluntary nature of consent to be an actual one
or presumed subordination of parents or students
and students to school and school administration, so that an unequivocal
Consent based on a free decision of the persons concerned
is in question.

Periodically I have repeated in the past

§ 83a HSchG
(1) The processing of personal data in the context of the task
of schools according to § 83 paragraph 1 is permitted, also in the context of digital applications

and made available to schools for use, or

2. the school independently as part of its assignment of digital applications

(2) The schools can use central state-owned electronic school administration procedures
to be provided. The use of individual procedures can be declared mandatory.
(3) Further details are regulated by statutory order.

However, the schools also have a special obligation to

additional resources will be able to lift. That's why they have to
Ministry, the state education authorities and the teachers' academy and
the media centers have sufficient resources to support the

The possibility of providing the schools with state-specific electronic procedures (§ 83a
Para. 2 HSchG) and their use in individual cases
making it mandatory is to be welcomed in principle. These procedures
of the HKM and others must be checked for data protection compliance
have been.
If this is ensured, it seems more than logical to carry it through
establish mandatory use in schools. The teachers and

Insofar as the school portal Hessen (SPH) will also be subject to this provision in the future
or the planned nationwide and unified video conferencing system
should, this is also an added value in terms of data protection law, insofar as their data

rical framework conditions are created in order to meet the demands of the
Comparability of the test circumstances and controls as well as the protection of
To do justice to the fundamental rights of the students concerned.

Legal basis
The Hessian state government has amended the Hessian Higher Education Act
lled. In this context, in the new Section 23, a legal
Regulation created for the possibility of remote electronic examinations as well
to be able to carry out independently of the current pandemic. With this
The legislature has succeeded in creating “a permanent, viable legal basis
for electronic remote examinations".
According to § 23 Para. 6 HHG, the regulations in § 23 Para. 1 to 5 HHG
not by an ordinance, but by the statutes of the universities
be specified, in which they provide details in particular
 - for the design of the electronic remote examination,
 – for the processing of personal data as well
 – to deal with technical faults and attempts at deception
rules.
The universities are not in their statutes on these three facts
limited. Rather, § 23 HHG provides in its regulations that the
Universities in their statutes self-contained systematic complete
can make regulations on questions relating to electronic remote examinations.

Content regulations
Remote electronic exams can make things easier for everyone involved
bring. But you have to strike a difficult balance between the
equality of those to be examined and the protection of their personal rights and
comply with their informational self-determination.

102

schools, colleges

In order to achieve this, the regulatory concept of § 23 HHG provides that
Electronic remote examinations only "in addition to the corresponding presence examinations
be offered” (§ 23 Para. 1 Sentence 2 HHG). Electronic
Distance exams are always an additional offer, which is also rejected
can be.
In order to be able to decide which form of examination you should choose
the students “are given the opportunity to relate to the exam situation
on the technology, the equipment and the spatial environment in advance
to test the exam" (§ 23 Para. 1 Clause 2 HHG).
Participation in an electronic remote examination should therefore always be
based on the principle of voluntariness. Based on the expression of
§ 23 HHG provides for a two-stage procedure for voluntary use:
 – Participation is usually voluntary
Expression that those to be examined are taking part, although at the same time
an on-site examination is offered, which they could have chosen
(§ 23 Para. 5 HHG).

 – Do you want to take part in an electronic remote examination with automated recording
participate, this may only take place if they are expressly included in this
have consented in writing.

The data processing in electronic remote examinations is therefore fundamentally
additionally on a legal permit. This sets the condition for a
voluntary participation through an alternative offer. The more intense
Intervention in fundamental rights on the basis of permission for automated evaluation
tion is provided by comprehensive information and an express written agreement
Consent of the participating students is taken into account.
The problem addressed by recital 43 sentence 1 GDPR,
that consent cannot provide a valid legal basis if "it
the person responsible is an authority and it is therefore in
Given all the circumstances in the particular case, it is unlikely that
the consent was given voluntarily”, does not exist here.
On the one hand, data processing is based on remote electronic examinations
and the supervision provided for in principle is not based on consent,
but a legal basis, which, however, the voluntariness of
Participation ensured by a simultaneous alternative offer.
On the other hand, this alternative offer applies to an automated evaluation
tion, which is made dependent on express written consent
becomes. For this consent therefore exists despite the imbalance of power
between the university and the person to be examined “taking into account all the circumstances

When conducting the electronic remote examinations, the basic

adapt the monitoring measures to the respective examination modalities

In the case of open-book works in which the use of

Therefore, depending on the examination material, it is necessary to change the examination modalities
to adapt to the respective context of the test, which is a differentiated

The principle of proportionality also applies to the differentiated

Data protection made easy
Pupils often perceive data protection as an obstacle
taken. The diverse legal regulations are not very appealing
prepared, not only for young people. It is important to me that young people
already create simple mechanisms at school or during training
and to convey legal regulations in dealing with data protection.
Own design options and responsible handling
your own data and the data of others are a good prerequisite
for a responsible handling of the diverse digital
Tools available to children and young people.

In the context of increasing digitization, media such as video clips motivate
young people to get involved in data protection issues. The

However, the most recent case law of the Federal Court of Justice of June 15, 2021 (VI

way, the Higher Regional Court Munich I in its judgment of April 6, 2019 (3 O

by the responsible German Gymnastics Federation (DTB) through an external one
Law firm revised. In this context, the
young people were interviewed and assured of confidentiality. A more than
100-page final report was created and handed over to the DTB
ben. As a result, the trainer's lawyer demanded the handing over of the
Report and referred to Art. 15 DS-GVO. The DTB transmitted
then the report, but blacked out the passages, the conclusions
on the identity of the young people interviewed. Against this
the lawyer lodged a complaint with me.
First of all, I was able to establish that the DTB was willing to respond to the request for information
to comply with in principle. The redactions that have taken place appear
logically, it is about the statements of the young gymnasts
Behavior of the trainer towards them and others. An anonymization
of the information, i.e. the removal of the names of the gymnasts, could not
take effect, since many of the facts and situations described by them
could be traced individually and thus personally.
On data protection when processing personal data
Unfortunately, the GDPR does not contain any general regulations for children. Only for
data processing in connection with an offer of services
of the information society towards children contains Art. 8 DS-GVO
regulations. In ErwG 38 of the DS-GVO, however, the special protective

Schools in Hesse using the portal. This appears against the background
that many students in 2020 and 2021 for a long time
had to be schooled at home and that the SPH the schools from
State of Hesse is made available free of charge, more than understandable.
It is therefore all the more important that the SPH complies with data protection law
complies with regulations.

This resulted in a number of consultation appointments between the HKM and myself. This

served to expand the existing data protection documentation

to work out.

A look into the future

which raises important privacy issues in every aspect. To this too

in the near future it will be possible to give a final evaluation of the portal.

Advice to the Hessian state parliament

10th consultation of the Hessian state parliament
Advice to the Hessian state parliament
An important task of the data protection supervisory authority is
Article 57(1)(c) GDPR, "in accordance with the law of the Member State
the national parliament … on legislative and administrative measures
to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to
(to) advise the processing”. There were three consultations during the reporting period
of the Hessian state parliament of particular importance: for the validity of the
DS-GVO for data processing in the state parliament (section 10.1), to a new one
Petition Act for the State Parliament (Section 10.2) and for the revision of the data
data protection regulations of the state parliament (section 10.3).

10.1
Does the GDPR apply to the Hessian state parliament?
The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data
in the Hessian state parliament only for the administrative area. To this counts
also the administrative processing of petitions, but not the processing
processing of a petition by a member of the Landtag as rapporteur
and also not the consultation in the Petitions Committee and the final one
Decision on the petition by the Landtag plenum. No validity
has the DS-GVO for the legislative and parliamentary activities of the
Parliament, the parliamentary groups and the members of parliament.

Since the GDPR came into force, it has been disputed whether it also includes processing
personal data collected in the parliaments of the Member States.
The ECJ (C-272/19) ruled on July 9, 2020 that
the Petitions Committee of the Hessian State Parliament (HLT) of the DS-GVO
lies and regards him as responsible according to Art. 4 No. 7 DS-GVO. With
However, in this judgment he has not decided the crucial question of whether this
also applies to the parliamentary activities of the Landtag. To this question
the President of the Hessian State Parliament asked me for a legal opinion
(see also Roßnagel/Rost, Is the General Data Protection Regulation also in the
Landtag applicable? Democratic sovereignty and Union data protection,
NVwZ 2021, 1641).

I. Scope of application of the GDPR
Crucial to the question of whether the scope of the GDPR
parliamentary activity of the state parliaments, through which the state parliament members

117

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
50th activity report on data protection

primarily pursue, record or exclude political and legislative objectives,
is the provision of Article 2 (1) and (2) (a) GDPR.

Art. 2 GDPR
(1) This Ordinance applies to the fully or partially automated processing of personal
of personal data as well as for the non-automated processing of personal data
Data stored or intended to be stored in a file system.
(2) This regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data
a)
in the context of an activity that does not fall within the scope of Union law,
(...)

Art. 2 para. 1 determines the material scope of application of the GDPR very much
far. Insofar as the HLT processes personal data, this also applies
them this fact. According to Art. 2 Para. 2 lit. a DS-GVO, the regulation
However, the statement “does not apply to the processing of personal data
Data … in the context of an activity not within the scope
of Union law falls".
On the question of whether data processing within the framework of parliamentary-legislative
active activity of a democratically elected representative body in Germany
within the scope of Union law and thus also of the GDPR
falls, there was no case law until the judgment of the ECJ. In the literature
the answer was controversial.

II. Decision of the ECJ of July 9, 2020
On a request for a preliminary ruling from the VG Wiesbaden under Art. 267
Para. 1 TFEU, the ECJ ruled in its judgment (C-272/19) of July 9, 2020
stated “that the Petitions Committee … to the extent that this Committee
alone or jointly with others about the purposes and means of processing
tion decides, as 'responsible' within the meaning (of Art. 4 Para. 7 DSGVO)
is to be classified, so that the made by such a committee
Processing of personal data within the scope of this
Ordinance … falls”.
In its reasoning, the ECJ focuses strongly on the activities of the petitioner
committee and does not make any fundamental statements on the parliamentary
cal activity of the LDS. He instructs the Petitions Committee in relation to
HLT a "special role". From the point of view of the ECJ, it is a body that only
"contributes indirectly to parliamentary activity" and its activities
are "political and administrative in nature". For him he takes no original
parliamentary task true, but is an "administrative control body",

Advice to the Hessian state parliament

which is more like a Board of Appeal or an Ombudsperson. A
Precedent for the applicability of the GDPR for general parliamentary
The verdict therefore does not result directly from the technical tasks of the HLT.

III. Exception of Art. 2 lit. a GDPR
The question of the scope of the GDPR is therefore direct
Art. 2 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR to answer. After that, it is crucial whether the
parliamentary activities of the LDS and the political-legislative activities
Members of Parliament fall within the scope of Union law.
Since the treaties of the European Union only certain sovereign rights of
transferred from the Member States to the Union is the scope
of Union law to be positively determined in each case. According to the principle of
limited individual authorization according to Art. 5 para. 2 TEU, the Union
act only within the limits of the competences that the member
States her in the contracts for the realization of the laid down therein
transferred goals. According to this, the "scope of application of the
onsrechts" with the areas for which the Union has legislative powers
zen have been granted. This is for the area of
parliamentary-legislative activities of the member states is not the case.
But even if it were argued that the "scope of the
Union law” is to be understood more broadly than the area for which legislative
competences of the Union, this area of application could only
be understood in such a way that it includes all matters regulated by Union law
includes, for which the Member States to observe Union law requirements
have. This is to be assumed if the Member State in the respective
sphere of activity of Union law or has to be carried out
enforcement or implementation of Union law, the exercise or actual
the realization of the fundamental freedoms of Union citizens must be observed.
The scope of application of Union law would then be opened up if the
field of activity is the subject of a secondary law regulation. For
the parliamentary activities of the LDS there are no specific union
legal requirements. The fundamental freedoms also cover this limited
field of activity not.
In addition, Union law protects the national sovereignty of the member
States has to consider. The legal
obligation of the Union, the respective national identity of each Member State
to be respected in their basic political and constitutional
structures including regional and local self-government
expression comes. These basic political and constitutional
gene structures and the areas of activity in which these are reflected

119

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
50th activity report on data protection

come, determine the national identity, which is an "ultimate limit for
action by the Union'. In Germany, after the
jurisprudence of the Federal Constitutional Court, the concept of constitutional structure
tures in Art. 4 Para. 2 Sentence 1 TEU with the constitutional identity, which over
Art. 23 para. 1 sentence 3 i. V. m. Art. 79 Abs. 3 GG is defined. The identity
of the Federal Republic of Germany, the BVerfG determines above all in its
Lisbon decision of June 30, 2009 (BVerfGE 123, 267). to the union
legally inviolable constitutional identity belong to the “political
Decisions that have a special impact on cultural, historical and
linguistic pre-understandings are dependent, which are partisan and political

unfold" (para. 247). Union law must therefore regulate the functioning of the
political-parliamentary democracy in Hesse according to Art. 4 Para. 2 Sentence 1
EUV as part of national identity, in its fundamental political
and constitutional structures.
The parliamentary areas of activity of the HLT are thus outside
the regulatory competence of Union law and its application and
thus also outside the scope of the GDPR.
On the one hand, this applies to the activities of the representative body and its tasks
as legislator. Data processing within the framework of the legislative
procedural in the narrower sense are only determined by national data protection
regulations allowed and regulated. This also includes the
operation-regulating activity of the Presidium and the Council of Elders of the HLT
and the committee secretariats. On the other hand, Union law

also the parliamentary-political decision-making of the LDS and the following
related activities of the members of parliament and the parliamentary groups in the

union law. These parliamentary-political decision-making processes
also include the development of one's own political positions and initiatives
and concepts, cooperation with other parliaments, contacts

the public relations of the LDS, the parliamentary groups and the MPs. Not
Fourthly, the political control of the government falls under the GDPR

exercises temporary committees of inquiry. These enable in particular

and to evaluate and to present political alternatives. Finally falls
the approval of the state budget does not fall within the scope of the

protection according to Art. 8 GRCh does not mean that for him too
the GDPR is applicable. Because the GDPR is just one of many
legal specifications of the protection of fundamental rights, which are mutually
compete, so that the fundamental rights are not directly binding on the
applicability of the GDPR can be concluded. Rather concrete
the LDS establishes this bond itself within the framework of its parliamentary autonomy,
by taking a position that corresponds to his constitutional status
data protection regulations (see Section 10.3).

IV. Application of the GDPR to the administrative area
The special importance of the LDS for the political-democratic process
and for the formation of the identity of the State of Hesse, however, only applies to theirs
political-legislative-parliamentary field of activity. It does not apply to
its administrative functions. As an organization with personal, material
and financial resources is the LDS managing authority. Therefore will
his administrative activity is covered by the scope of the GDPR.
Accordingly, § 30 HDSIG (about the opening clause of the

In its coalition agreement, the new federal government intends to

Use of digital tools for employee monitoring
In the year under review, I received complaints in which employees stated
ben, through software applications on their business devices from their
being monitored by employers. Such applications are usually
not permitted under data protection law.

At least since the beginning of the corona pandemic, working in the "home

to reduce their contacts and avoid infections. For employer
Women and employers can ask themselves whether their employees
carry out assigned tasks in the home office or the working hours
also use for private matters.
Against this background, there is a growing market for digital
monitoring of employees e.g. B. means of software applications for this
purposes to be installed on service computers. To improve performance and behavior
to enable employees to be checked, use such applications
a range of possible data that can be generated during the normal use of
IT devices are created. Starting with information that is easy to collect
– such as when an employee logged in on a device or
the screen saver was activated due to inactivity – the
number of keystrokes, the duration of those in focus,
applications used, the websites accessed in the web browser
to be recorded regular screenshots. On mobile devices
such as smartphones can also use GPS positions
and transaction data are processed.
When using Software-as-a-Service offers (SaaS), the
determined data is often transferred directly to the IT systems of the providers,
aggregated and evaluated there. Employers will then often

allows. In cases where employees also use their private devices
use for official tasks, or if private use
of e-mail and other Internet services using company devices
is approved, it is also not unlikely that the private
Communication and activity of employees is recorded and evaluated.
Against the background of the technical possibilities and the legitimate
Interests of employers, taking into account the personal rights of the

The question therefore arises to what extent the monitoring of the work performance of

According to this, the processing of personal data in the employee

working hours of eight hours per day stipulated in § 3 ArbZG.
An application that enables time tracking in the home office
and beyond that no personal data of the employees
processed, is therefore to be regarded as permissible under data protection law.
The legal situation is to be assessed differently if software goes further
operates data processing operations. Some products that come as software for
work time recording are advertised, determine the number of keyboard
punches or take screenshots of the screen on a regular basis. This is
generally inadmissible under data protection law, since such data processing
processing operations constitute a significant encroachment on the rights of employees
to informational self-determination, which is
purpose cannot be justified (BAG, judgment of 07/27/2017,
2 AZR 681/16, paragraph 21 ff).
As far as monitoring measures to uncover in the employment
criminal offenses committed in relation to the employment relationship, the strict preconditions
§ 26 Section 1 Clause 2 BDSG must be observed.

Employee data protection

§ 26 paragraph 1 sentence 2 BDSG
2Personal data from employees may only be used to uncover criminal offences

justify the suspicion that the person concerned committed a criminal offense in the employment relationship
has committed, the processing is necessary and the interest in need of protection of the or
of the employee does not outweigh the exclusion of processing, in particular Art
and extent are not disproportionate to the occasion.

The monitoring of employees must then be used to detect
offenses are required. It applies that no so-called investigation
"into the blue" may take place, but already actual clues
for committing a criminal offense in the employment relationship.
These must be documented. In addition, data processing must also
actually be necessary for the detection of the offense and it is one
carry out a balancing of interests.
Under no circumstances is it permissible under data protection law to
general suspicion and to monitor preventively from the outset.
Exactly such a suspicion-independent and complete data processing
however, depending on the configuration, this is done using the most commonly available software
Employee monitoring, so that their use also according to § 26 paragraph 1 sentence
2 BDSG should only be permissible in rare cases. The mere suspicion that
Employees in the home office take care of private matters, legitimized
not their complete monitoring. Even if cases of labor
time fraud is to be assumed, the use of the described digital
Monitoring instruments are not always the mildest means,
to substantiate the suspicion of the crime.
Do employers use employee monitoring products that protect privacy

Imposition of measures according to Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO can be expected.
Depending on the severity of the violation, a warning, an instruction that

In addition, in such cases, the initiation of a fine procedure

impermissible surveillance measures are ruled out from the outset.
Finally, it should be noted that works councils during the introduction

GPS tracking in employment
Employers are increasingly using GPS to track company vehicles
and thus also used by employees. Where are the data protection
legal limits of such surveillance? How can a localization of
employees are made data protection compliant by means of GPS tracking? It
may be permissible under data protection law, insofar as the interests of the employer
bers and the personal rights of employees in an appropriate manner
compensated and it is limited to what is necessary.

During the reporting period, I received several inquiries and complaints
dealing with the lawfulness of the processing of personal data
deal with GPS tracking.

and is used for precise navigation or location determination. In here
context considered, a GPS transmitter is attached to vehicles
brought and serves to determine their exact location.
At the beginning of the year, a complaint was filed against an international
submitted to the transport company. The complainant reported
that GPS trackers were installed in the vehicles used there.
The reason given to the employees was that
the installation of the GPS tracker of the anti-theft device, the increase in efficiency,
the improvement of the service, the control of unauthorized private use

serve. According to the complainant, the GPS data of the
Vehicles saved for six months.
As a result of my hearing on the categories of personal data
ten, the purposes and legal bases of the data processing procedure
the situation was as follows:
The company processed the following data: Name of vehicle user
Zers, the current location of the vehicle, the current speed
of the vehicle and the current Can-Bus data (i.e. ignition, mileage
counter, fuel consumption, fill level, engine revolutions).
For the purposes of processing, the transport company
led that the GPS tracking:
 – Fast troubleshooting and increased efficiency in the routing

planning,

 – ensuring compliance with tax regulations,
 – driver safety (accident/breakdown assistance),
 – the safety of the vehicles (anti-theft protection),
 - the increase in efficiency in vehicle procurement (quality/wear

of vehicles) and

 - Ensuring compliance with labor law requirements (abuse

the fuel card)

serve.
The responsible party set the legal basis for the processing

called. The storage period for the collected GPS data was set at six
months specified. In addition, the responsible company announced that
that the private use of company vehicles is prohibited.
My legal assessment found the following:
During the test procedure it became apparent that the use of the GPS tracker
in the described form violates the provisions of the GDPR

In detail, for the stated purposes of data processing by means

The processing of personal data is generally permitted if
if you are on one of the points in Article 6 Paragraph 1 Subsection 1 lit. a to f DS-GVO
Permission facts can be supported. Because of the opening clause
of Art. 88 DS-GVO is data processing in the employment relationship
to be measured against § 26 BDSG (its conformity with Union law is currently being
reviewed by the ECJ in a preliminary ruling procedure).
With regard to GPS tracking and the associated storage
of the personal data of the drivers come as a possible legal
Basics in particular Article 6 Paragraph 1 Subparagraph 1 lit. b GDPR, specified
by § 26 paragraph 1 sentence 1 BDSG (“Execution of the employment

Both regulations require that data processing be carried out in order to achieve

and is therefore inadmissible.

Compliance with tax regulations
According to general life experience, official vehicles are also used
are available for private purposes are actually used privately.
This is supported by the evidence of the first appearance (BFH, judgment of 4 December
2012 – VIII R 42/09). A private usage share for a company car
is not recognized by the financial administration if the person responsible
proves that the car is not used privately. As proof
contractually fixed usage bans apply. Also introducing one
GPS tracking tools can be an effective means of providing evidence
to tax authorities. Since the private use of company

GPS tracking to ensure compliance with tax regulations
should have been necessary. The person in charge couldn't either
explain that there is a corresponding requirement on the part of the tax authorities
would have given to the company. For data protection reasons

However, the users cannot or do not want to log in before each visit

the latter entails considerable risks for the personal rights of the users, since

Since 2009 there have been European legal requirements for the setting of

Federal Participation Act: Working aid “Data protection in the

After a project "Data protection in carrier-transmitted

In autumn 2019, after the successful completion of a (first)
project, the creation of a work aid on the subject of “data protection

The group of actors involved was also asked about their perspective
to be able to involve, in addition to representatives from
the practical provision of rehabilitation services. This included
e.g. B. the areas of service providers or associations of people
disabilities.
At a total of nine events organized by the BAR in Frankfurt am Main
deokonferenz dates in the period from December 2019 to July 2021 was announced in
all-day working sessions the project topic by the participants
and participants elaborated. There were also numerous bi- or
multilateral specialist exchanges, topic processing or coordination
between different project participants. As in the previous project
the discussions between the representatives of the various
Institutions always considerate with regard to the respective concerns and were
constructively and pragmatically oriented. That's how it was for everyone to work together
participants, both professionally and interpersonally, once again pleasant and fruitful.
In the last meeting of the project group in summer 2021, the working
help "Data protection in rehabilitation" were passed unanimously.
From my perspective, the jointly developed result can be good
let see:
 - On more than 60 pages, the topic is presented in all its facets (not
most recently also from the perspective of data protection),
presented and explained in terms of content and classified legally.

 - Then in illustrative representations on more than 20 pages
ten examples of permissible data collection and transfers in the
rehabilitation listed.

 – Finally, the work aid contains numerous sample forms that

were integrated into more than ten pages.

In total, this resulted in a work aid with over 100 pages.
In autumn 2021, the BAR initially published it in its final status

In 2019, I received several complaints about video surveillance

from each other by two private individuals as well as a civil rights group.

In detail, the shopping arcade consisted of ten shops,
three restaurants and a theater. The basement offered

disputed cameras existed - taking into account all the circumstances

During an on-site inspection, it was also found that
no private areas (such as apartments or balconies) from the surveillance

independent of credit institutes. In these services
these are payment initiation services and account information services.
A payment initiation service can be commissioned by a payer to

The topic "Scope of the right to information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO" in
connection with account terminations or refusals of contractual

The subject of these complaints is often that a bank

The bank then often appeals, at least rightly so under civil law
to the provisions of the terms and conditions, the contractual relationship without specifying
reasons to terminate.
In terms of data protection law, the scope is important when evaluating such matters

however, does not change the scope of the obligation to provide information under Art. 15 GDPR.
However, the right to information is fundamental to the
responsible to claim. The mere request for termination,

If, however, as part of the specification of the request for information

this is usually through the bank to the person concerned, provided

thus brought to the attention of the person concerned. Reasons for a unilateral
Termination by the bank is often the lack of profitability of the
business relationship or a sustained disruption of the relationship of trust
between bank and customer.
However, there are in connection with the fulfillment of the right to information
also case constellations in which the reason for termination, even if this

is stored, not be part of the information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO
may. This is the case, for example, when there are legal regulations
are, which prohibit the responsible persons certain information to the
to be communicated to those affected.
A norm that often comes into play in this case constellation is found
in Section 47 of the Money Laundering Act (GWG), the so-called "tipping-off ban".

§ 47 GWG
(1) An obligated party may the contractual partner, the customer of the transaction and
not inform other third parties of
1. an intended or submitted report pursuant to Section 43 (1),
2. an investigation that is initiated on the basis of a report pursuant to Section 43 (1)

has been directed, and

3. a request for information pursuant to Section 30 (3) sentence 1.

The "tipping-off ban" prohibits an obligated party under Section 2 GWG, among other things, from
the contractual partner (here the terminated, former customer) about it
to inform that according to § 43 Abs. 1 GWG a report about a
Facts to the Central Office for Financial Transaction Investigations (FIU)
has taken place. Such reports are usually
“Suspicious Money Laundering Reports”.
If, by stating the reason for termination, the person concerned
fenen would be disclosed that such a report by the bank to the
FIU has been deposed, the provisions of Section 47 GWG apply accordingly
to note. According to § 47 GWG i. V. m. Art. 23 (1) lit. e GDPR and § 29

data subject and the rights and freedoms of others, including in the
areas of social security, public health and humanitarian aid.
2These limitations should be consistent with the Charter and with the European Convention on
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The legislature has therefore made use of the opening clause and
in § 29 para. 1 sentence 2 BDSG a corresponding restrictive regulation
regarding the right to information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO.

§ 29 BDSG
(1) 2The data subject's right to information pursuant to Article 15 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 does not exist insofar as the information would disclose information that is
of a legal provision or its essence, in particular because of the overriding

The obligation to provide information according to Art. 15 DS-GVO does not exist,
if the information in question is based on a legal regulation
must be kept secret. Consequently, they find the right to information
restrictive regulations of § 47 GWG i. In conjunction with Art. 23 (1) lit. e GDPR
GVO and § 29 para. 1 sentence 2 BDSG apply to the reason for termination,
provided that the Bank hereby submits a suspicious activity report
the FIU would be revealed.
In such cases, the bank is consequently obliged to provide the information
appropriately restricted, even if the suspected money laundering
display represents the reason for termination and this in the systems of
Bank is stored personally. The information is then nevertheless as
to be considered in full, even if the reason for termination is not stated
becomes. Exists in addition to the issued suspected money laundering report, however
there is another reason for termination, this must be included in the information.

On August 6, 2021, I became aware that as part of the

The following criteria were used for the risk assessment in the present case
really important:

that he must notify the data subjects. Basically
this notification must be made without undue delay, i. H. without culpable hesitation

The course of the attack followed the well-known procedure for ransomware
attacks. Via an initial access (probably via phishing or a
other form of social engineering) to an IT system of the victim
the attackers found their way out laterally in the IT infrastructure of the person responsible
and tried, among other things, to change their access rights to other IT systems
and expand services. Employees of the person responsible provided the
unusual behavior in the IT infrastructure during the course of the attack
and reported this to the IT department. This reacted immediately and could

command in the reporting year. Overall, the number of cases is stabilizing in
my authority six years after entry into force and four years after
the entry into force of the GDPR at a very high level. while doing so
observed that in many areas the quality of the complaints
and the need for advice has changed. While at the beginning questions
according to the more formal requirements of the GDPR
(e.g. after the obligation to appoint a data protection officer, to
information and access rights of the person concerned), many questions
with which I had to deal in the reporting year, more in depth and
raise fundamental questions.

Promoting the use of the CWA for cluster detection could help

for example, regularly use offers for new customers. consumers,
who regularly select the most cost-effective offer on the market for you and
want to switch providers to do this, could
be excluded from attractively priced offers.
However, every citizen has the right to competition
between the energy suppliers and look for cheap ones on the market

no legitimate interest i. s.d. Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
It was precisely the aim of the legislature, by liberalizing the
effective and undistorted competition in the energy market
to enable the supply of electricity and gas. The attempt to
knew and to identify consumers who are willing to change and, if necessary,
to exclude them from certain offers would run counter to this objective.
Even if the interests of companies are considered legitimate
would prevail in such cases, the interests worthy of protection
and fundamental rights of customers. Contractual consumers may
rightly expect that none go beyond the purpose of the contract
Your data will be processed, which may limit your options, freely

The storage and transmission of positive data by an energy
sorgerpool would contribute significantly to transparent consumers and
would be illegal under Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 Letter f) GDPR.

Positive data is information that does not have a negative payment history
ments or other behavior that is not in accordance with the contract,
but, for example, the information about the fact that a contract

This data is regularly inadmissible in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Subparagraph 1 Letter f GDPR.
The processing of this data by the credit agency is also inadmissible.

Employers may enter the date "vaccination status" of their

not process it - not even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

251

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
50th activity report on data protection

The legal basis for the processing of the date "vaccination status"
of employees § 26 paragraph 3 sentence 1 of the Federal Data Protection Act
(BDSG) not applicable.
The date "vaccination status" is a health date
Article 4 Number 15 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation

quarantine available. The requirement for a claim is, among other things, whether
there was a chance of vaccination.

 – Employers are allowed to check the vaccination status of employees
also process, insofar as this is due to legal ordinances on pandemic

The processing of the date "vaccination status" of employees on the basis
Location of consent is only possible if the consent is voluntary
and has thus been granted with legal effect, § 26 paragraph 3 sentence 2 and paragraph
2 BDSG. Due to the between employers and

there are regular doubts about the voluntary nature and thus legal validity
the consent of employees.

supervisory authorities, but law enforcement authorities, other authorities or
Chambers responsible for certain professional groups.
Nevertheless, data protection authorities have, when assessing the

This fourth activity report on freedom of information describes

not to impair public bodies, there is access to information
only on files from completed proceedings. Access to information is
excluded from public bodies, insofar as he is responsible for the fulfillment of the task
of these positions would hinder. This regulatory concept was founded by
Legislators as follows:

"Administrative action should be more open and transparent in the future

Hesse therefore does not yet have freedom of information. Accordingly, the

Freedom of information statute within the meaning of the HDSIG only related to their
self-government area, this is not illegal, but it harmonises
not with the overall concept of the Hessian freedom of information law.

1. The Freedom of Information Complaint
A lawyer (complainant) applied in a road traffic
opportunity (speed violation of his client) to me and complained that
that he has access to documents on test measurements (radar systems) in
the city of Kassel had not been granted. The Hessian Ministry of the Interior
I am involved in this context and have a right to access information
rejected. The petitioner therefore asked me to address the issue of access to information
claim to review in the matter.

2. “Unconditional” Access to Information
The Hessian Ministry of the Interior and Sport (HMdIS) had in one
Letter to the complainant his denial of the information
The right to freedom is justified, among other things, with the following statement:

"The transparency of the fine procedure and the legal protection of your client
were consequently included in the documents for the test measurements by the refusal
gen not injured. Against this background, we have already stated that
also an inspection of the documents of the
Test measurements according to §§ 80 ff. Hessian data protection and information
Freedom Act (HDSIG) resigns.”

This explanation was reason for me to add a supplementary position to the HMdIS
to ask for a letter from me. Because the quoted passage suggests that
A claim to freedom of information is only given if the applicant
could claim to be charged in the specific matter, for example
due to a lack of "transparency of the fine procedure".
But that is exactly not the case: In this respect, freedom of information is "of
unconditional", yes, that is almost what makes her special compared to others
Information claims (e.g. Art. 15 DS-GVO or § 29 HVwVfG), i.e
its essence, so to speak.

269

4. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

Requests for access to information may only be denied if the
Freedom of information regulations justify this (§ 80 HDSIG).

§ 80 HDSIG
(1) In accordance with Part Four (= freedom of information), everyone has vis-à-vis public
Claim access to official information (access to information) …
(2) Insofar as special legal provisions regulate the provision of information, they go to the
provisions of Part Four.

Against this background, I asked the Ministry to explain why
exactly §§ 80 ff. HDSIG the information request in the matter
heit and informed the complainant about this
state of affairs.
The complainant then informed me that the city of Kassel, and
supported by the Ministry of the Interior, opposite him with a view to the information
information freedom right rejected the information access with the reason
have, the freedom of information statute of the city of Kassel only affects the
self-government area, but not the area of delegated
administrative tasks that are at stake here.
Then I got the freedom of information statute from the city of Kassel
can be submitted that explicitly allow access to information only for self-
administrative area, the city's own sphere of activity (§ 2 HGO).

3. Municipal statute reservation in the Hessian

Freedom of Information Right

Legal basis for information access statutes in municipal
The area is Section 81 Paragraph No. 7 HDSIG.

Partly expressly determined by the articles of association.

This provision establishes the validity of the Hessian freedom of information law
in the municipal sector, i.e. subject to the statutes.

270

Access to information and municipal statute reservation

In the legislative process there was no doubt that the statutory reservation
relates both to access to information in local self-government
area as well as to the tasks assigned to the municipalities by the state
refers (cf. § 4 HGO: instruction tasks, order matters).
It was also not considered that a municipality would respond to the "idea"
could come, the access to information with regard to the task type
split. To consider such a split to be unlawful would be the informa-
of course not beneficial, because then the municipality could
also equally opt to access information (in turn) entirely
to fail: So partial access is better than none at all.
Nevertheless, the situation in Kassel for the Hessian freedom of information
quite bizarre: the state legislature has passed through for the state area
Standardization of §§ 80 ff. HDSIG on freedom of information known. kassel
is now denying access to information on the country's legal status
related instruction tasks and order matters in the sense
of § 4 HGO by explicitly stating access to information in its statutes
just for self-government (one's own sphere of activity
within the meaning of § 2 HGO).
All in all, the legal situation in Kassel is relatively positive, because
the other larger cities in Hesse do not have any at all
enact information access statutes and thereby prevent information
access claims complete. And from the counties have so far
also only Marburg-Biedenkopf, Groß-Gerau, Darmstadt-Dieburg and the
Main-Taunus-Kreis opted for a freedom of information statute, that is
just four out of 21 districts in Hesse.
The complainant I have concluded the process via the above
the factual and legal situation described.

Disclosure of applicant data

Disclosure of applicant data
If an applicant from the body requested for information
the transfer of your data to third parties is prohibited, this is from the office
observe. However, this can mean that in this case no information
can be given in the matter.

1. The occasion
A citizen complained to me that he was at a university
so far unsuccessfully with the information access to contractual agreements
had desired at an institute. I then asked the university to
Information access application in accordance with the Hessian information
right to freedom (§§ 80 ff. HDSIG). Against this background
the university decided not only to accept the information access request
content, but together with the personal details of the applicant to the institute
to be announced for his opinion. This happened though in which
Request expressly the transfer of personal data to third parties
had been prohibited.
The university was of the opinion that it was authorized to do this, so that the institute
comprehensive for his position on the information access request
is informed.

2. Legal Assessment
This disclosure of the applicant's personal details by the university
to an institute was unlawful. A legal basis for such
Data transmission against the will of the applicant, i.e. evidently without
his consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 Subpara. 1 lit. a DS-GVO), is in such a
Constellation in accordance with the data protection and freedom of information
not available on the right (with regard to Art. 6 Para. 1 Subpara. 1 lit. e, Para. 2 and
3 GDPR, §§ 22, 83 HDSIG).
Even from the special procedural regulation in the case of involvement of third parties, § 86
HDSIG, can the agency responsible for information be authorized to
not derive the applicant's personal details against his will,
but the body responsible for information must give the third party only the opportunity
give an opinion on the request for access to information.

issue of information. That can then have the legal consequence, for example
if a trade secret of the third party is concerned, that no information
is given, § 82 No. 4 HDSIG.
I have informed the applicant and the university about this legal situation
done. I also asked the university to contact the institute
arrange for the applicant's transmitted data to be deleted,
what happened then.

In the present case, the institute had no objections to the
Provision of information and the university then offered the applicant the
documents for inspection.

who he himself had unsuccessfully requested information to
release this information to me, and then I should
then transmit the information to him.

 (No) Binding Order

2. Legal Assessment
2.1
The Hessian freedom of information law (§§ 80 ff. = fourth part of the HDSIG)
regulates in § 89 HDSIG the legal status of the Hessian Freedom of Information
Commissioner (Freedom of Information Authority). This norm gives after her
Paragraph 1 of every person who violates their right to information

§ 89 HDSIG
(1) Anyone who sees his rights violated according to the fourth part can do so without prejudice

Call the Hessian freedom of information officer.

In the event of such a freedom of information complaint, it will be
Checked by the Hessian Freedom of Information Authority. Is the complaint
justified, the freedom of information authority can the information obligation
Body (i.e. the body that has the requested information, § 85
Para. 1 sentence 1 HDSIG) request that the violation of the Hessian information

p. 3 HDSIG).

275

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information
4. Activity Report on Freedom of Information

§ 89 HDSIG
(3) (...) If the Hessian Freedom of Information Officer establishes violations of the
provisions of the fourth part, he or she can rectify them within a reasonable period of time
demand. The competent supervisory authority must be informed of this.

However, such a request is not a (legally binding) decision
the Hessian Freedom of Information Authority towards the information
obligatory body, but (only) a legal appeal. The form of action
Administrative act within the meaning of the Hessian administrative procedure law (§ 35
HVwVfG), i.e. a binding order to act, is the
Hessian freedom of information authority towards public authorities
not available.
In this respect, there is a significant difference to data protection law.
The Hessian data protection officer is responsible in this area of law, namely
lich quite authorized to issue administrative acts to public authorities
enacted (cf. Art. 58 Para. 2 DS-GVO), but only under certain conditions
Conditions (cf. § 14 Para. 1 Clause 2 HDSIG). In freedom of information law
on the other hand, a "prompt" as already mentioned is (only) an appeal
to the body responsible for information. An additional emphasis is created
by informing the supervisory authority of the person obliged to provide information
body (Section 89 (3) sentence 4 HDSIG).
In this respect, the complainant's request that the Hessian information
information freedom authority may "oblige" the information-obligated body
to provide the requested information is not met
become.

2.2 No provision of information on the part of the Hessian

Freedom of Information Authority in favor of the complainant

However, there is one more provision, the meaning of which depends on the
Hessian freedom of information authority towards the complainant
rer with a view to his concerns, with her help to the coveted documents
was to be clarified. After all, the Hessian information
freedom of information of the freedom of information authority the right, with regard to
object of the complaint to the information-obligated office
and to inspect the relevant files and files
(Section 89 (3) sentence 2 no. 1 HDSIG).

(No) information gathering for the applicant

§ 89 HDSIG
(3) (...) The Hessian Freedom of Information Officer is particularly involved

grant and provide access to relevant files and files (...).

However, the Hessian Freedom of Information Authority allows this regulation
not to itself the information requested by the complainant
procure them in order to subsequently make them available to the complainant
to provide.
Because that would result in the legislative decision that the
Freedom of information authority towards the information-obligated body
can only appeal, counteract.
Such a procedure would namely constitute an inadmissible "enforcement"
on the part of the Freedom of Information Authority by way of one of the information
"Substitute performance" not entitled to by the health authority at the expense of the
means subject to obligation. However, such an approach is the

Is open data coming to Hesse?
During the reporting period, I received a request from the Hessian state parliament to
a draft law by the FDP parliamentary group to open access to so-called
to comment on open data.
In principle, I support access to open data in the sense of the greatest
possible transparency of the public sector. The current developments
in the European Union show that increasing access to data
public authorities is desirable and the EU has a legal framework
men for uncomplicated access to data from public authorities and the
establishment of "data rooms" wants to establish.

1. Benefits of providing and using open data
When providing open data is in contrast to the previous
Legal situation, according to which an application for access to official information
information must be submitted, no application is necessary. The official
Information is already held and accessible ex officio
made. This increases the welcome transparency of the public sector.

Public bodies collect a large amount of data. The provision
of these enormous data pools beyond the borders of the respective authority
has great economic importance. So promises the use of
Open data added value for large parts of the economy - right now
also for small and medium-sized companies (open data strategy
of the Federal Government, 2021, p. 10). In the following I will therefore present the current
applicable legal situation in the EU, in the Federal Republic of Germany and in
Hessen, the open data strategy of the EU and the federal government as well as
Outline the data governance law to show how in the future
use of open data could be designed.

2. Term "Open Data" and goal of providing open data
The term "open data" and the purpose of providing open data
are in Recital (EG) 16 of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European
European Parliament and Council of 20 June 2019 on Open Data and
the re-use of public sector information (Open
Data Directive) (Official Gazette 172 of June 26, 2019, p. 56).

no re-identification of data subjects can take place based on additional knowledge.

3. Legal basis at EU and federal level
Recital 16 of the Open Data Directive already shows
that the provision of Open Data by public bodies within
half of the EU is a declared goal. There are also legal regulations at the federal level
Basics for the provision of open data. For the first time were through
the so-called Open Data Act (Federal Law Gazette I, 2206) with the on July 13, 2018 in
Section 12a of the E-Government Act (EGovG) that has come into force
indirect federal administration obliged to provide open data.
With the so-called second Open Data Act of July 16, 2021 (Federal Law Gazette I, 2941)
this obligation was basically applied to all authorities of the indirect federal
administration expanded. This regulates the implementation of the Open Data Directive
Data Usage Act (DNG) of July 16, 2021 (BGBl. I p. 2941, 2942, 4114)
finally details on the provision and further use of open
Data. The federal government has developed an open data strategy that
the implementation of the legal basis specified.

280

Is open data coming to Hesse?

4. Legal situation in Hesse
The legal obligation of public bodies to provide Open
Data goes one step further than the ones currently in force in Hesse
Freedom of Information Rules. The principle of freedom of information
says that public bodies request access to official information
have to grant. In Hesse, this is regulated in the fourth part of the HDSIG.
So far there is no obligation to provide Open in Hesse
Data, even if the DNG relies on the provision of Open Data by the
countries (Open Data Strategy of the Federal Government, 2021, p. 16).

5. EU Open Data Directive
The member states are bound by the Open Data Directive
to ensure that public data is further processed by public authorities
can be used, both non-commercial and
for commercial purposes. Expanded access to data should always be
be free of charge, with exceptions according to Art. 6 Para. 2 of the Directive, e.g. B. for
Libraries and museums are possible. Exceptions to the Obligation
for the provision of open data are regulated in Art. 1 Para. 2 of the Directive
and concern e.g. B. Documents that are trade secrets or confidential
contain information, or those for reasons of protection of
national security are not publicly available.
Chapter V of the Open Data Directive has special regulations for thematic

6. The federal government's open data strategy
The federal government's open data strategy lists three fields of action,
in order to be able to use open data more efficiently and meaningfully in the future (open
Data Strategy of the Federal Government, 2021, p. 19 ff.):
 – Improvement of data provision as well as efficient and sustainable

sustainable design of the data infrastructure;

 – Increasing an innovative, public welfare-oriented and responsible

efficient use of data;

 – Increasing data competence and establishing a new culture in the

7. Outlook: The data governance law of the EU
Since the regulations in force to date on access to open data
Further use of data that affects the rights of third parties,
not permitted, the EU Commission has planned an advance to also
allow further use of such data. With the suggestion of
25 November 2020 for a regulation of the European Parliament
and the Council on European Data Governance (Data Governance
Law; hereinafter DGG) (COM(2020) 767 final) prepared the European
Commission proposes a European data space, the basis for a
future data economy should be. After opinion of Parliament
and the Council's common position, the Council and Parliament agreed
ment on November 20, 2021 in the trilogue on a common version of the

282

Is open data coming to Hesse?

Regulation (Council Document 14606/21) pending by Council and Parliament
must be formally decided.
On the one hand, the regulation serves to avoid distortions of competition
in the internal market by the public sector with regard to value-added services,
which is developed based on public sector data and
are offered (non-discrimination, prohibition of exclusivity
agreement). On the other hand, the directive harmonises the conditions of the

on the previous regulations on the provision of open data

future data room, the fundamental rights of data subjects are protected
the should. To this end, EU law should be effective in the European data space
enforced and the protection of personal data unrestricted
be respected (Roßnagel, protection of fundamental rights in the data economy, ZRP
2021, 173 (174)).
The DGG is the first attempt to normative data usage and data protection
to reconcile. This is mainly due to the fact that the DS-GVO
also in the field of data management retains its full validity and through that
DGG supplemented only selectively with regard to three types of responsible persons
will: public bodies, data intermediaries and data altruistic organizations.
With regard to data protection, it makes sense to distinguish between personal
and to differentiate between non-personal data (Roßnagel, ZRP 2021,
173 (175f.)). For the protection of personal data are specific

The proposal goes even further than the regulations outlined above

"More transparency in the protection of the Constitution - trust and

The federal and state authorities for the protection of the constitution have the task of

information gathering measures taken in their duties
are mostly subject to secrecy. But this does not mean that
their entire activity must inevitably be opaque.
Transparency obligations, such as the obligation to create constitutional protection
directed, are found not only in the constitutional protection laws of the federal government
and the federal states (cf. § 16 BVerfSchG). In principle, the press has
a right to information under press law, unless the operational
business of the authorities is affected. So are e.g. B. Topics and participants
of background talks, even against the will of the authorities,

If the authorities according to press or environmental information law
must provide information, unless their secret activity is affected,
it is not clear why they respond to corresponding general questions
according to the freedom of information right to remain silent.
More transparency strengthens trust in the authorities for the protection of the constitution
and increases their legitimacy.

to regulate the flow of information from government agencies to citizens
and citizens in Germany. Modern transparency laws provide the

available.
The Conference of Freedom of Information Officers in Germany (IFK)
therefore calls on the legislature to
of to modernize in the next legislative period and the IT
federal freedom law to a modern transparency law
develop a transparency register. In particular, the IFK demands:

A Further development of the Freedom of Information Act in a

Transparency Act with a Transparency Register

 – The Federal Freedom of Information Act (IFG) must become a real one
Transparency Act with a legally regulated transparency register
to be further developed.

 – In the Federal Transparency Act, the IFG and the Um-

 – As in several countries, the transparency register should be a catalogue

other appropriate information should be explicitly allowed.
 – About the information published in the Transparency Register,

 – A provision should be included in the law according to which internal

tion exists.

B Area Exceptions and Reasons for Exclusion
 – The reasons for exclusion of the IFG require a fundamental revision
because some grounds for exclusion are superfluous or overlap
the. They should be reduced and harmonized.

 – A general weighing up of interests between information and secrecy
interest (so-called public interest test) should be used as an additional corrective
be introduced.

 – The area exception for the protection of the constitution goes too far and should

no longer be included in a new transparency law.

C Regulations to promote freedom of information
 – The requirements for freedom of information are i. S.v. "Free information

and include organizational processes.

The advantages of such an order are obvious:
 – Freedom of information officers can public bodies in similar
support in a way and promote freedom of information, as stipulated in the
area of data protection has long been envisaged.

 – Freedom of information officers can assist their public bodies
be when these questions on the interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act
have, for example, when it comes to justification and scope
raised information access claims. This is guaranteed at the same time
the uniform application of the law within the public body.

 - You can also ensure that an access to information

and not just qualified as a "simple request", but on time

 – It would also be expedient for them to process the corresponding
coordinate applications. The information freedom officers can

"Ratify Tromsø Convention and uniform minimum standard
create access to information throughout Germany!”
from 03 November 2021
The Conference of Information Officers (IFK) calls for the new federal
government to approve the Tromsø Convention in the new legislative period
sign and begin the ratification process.
On 1 December 2020, the Council of Europe Convention No. 205 on the
Access to Official Documents (Tromsø Convention) of 18 June 2009
entered into force without German participation.
The Convention is an international treaty that

of information access requests. The convention thus applies
as the world's first international agreement that provides a general right

human rights are invoked.
The Federal Republic of Germany has to sign and ratify
of the contract so far waived. The last federal government argued
that with the Federal Freedom of Information Act (IFG) such a
Minimum standard for all of Germany already created and the goal of
convention has been reached. Ratification is therefore not necessary.
This view is incorrect, because the IFG only applies to the federal government, not
however for the countries. Not all countries have a freedom of information law
