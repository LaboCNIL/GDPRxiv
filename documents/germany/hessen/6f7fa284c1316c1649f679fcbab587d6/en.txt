Press release on the standard data protection model





09/10/2018





Prof. Dr. Ronellenfitsch:
"Users can work with the first building blocks!"
The standard data protection model (SDM) provides a method with which those responsible and supervisory authorities can assess whether personal data is processed in accordance with data protection regulations during development, data protection advice and the examination of data processing. The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments (DSK) recommended using this model for testing. The first building blocks are now available.

Chapter 7 of the manual on the methodology of the standard data protection model refers to a catalog of technical and organizational reference measures. In April 2018, the DSK decided that the catalog, which is divided into individual modules, should first be published successively by individual supervisory authorities and released for testing by users.
For this purpose, a sub-working group "SDM modules" was set up, in which the following data protection authorities are involved: The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the Saxon Data Protection Commissioner, the Independent State Center for Data Protection Schleswig-Holstein and the Commissioner for data protection of the Evangelical Church in Germany.
This working group has so far developed and now published the following seven building blocks:
• Privacy Management
• Planning / specification
• Documentation
• Logging
• Separation
• Extinguish
• Storage
The texts can be found at:

The authors of the sub-working group expressly point out that these building blocks have not yet been agreed in the conference of independent federal and state data protection supervisory authorities. They recommend users to inform the data protection supervisory authorities involved in the development of the modules of their experiences in testing the modules and thus to contribute to the further development of methods and measures.
The SDM methodology manual (V1.1, trial version) can be obtained from:
