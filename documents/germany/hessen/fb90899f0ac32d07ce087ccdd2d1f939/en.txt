HBDI accompanies the TeleCOVID Hessen project through various stages of development





08/12/2021








            The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HBDI) was active in an advisory capacity in the TeleCOVID Hessen project from the start and continuously worked towards compliance with data protection regulations. This ensured that the rights of the affected patients were protected with this innovative telemedicine solution.

The TeleCOVID Hessen App was developed by Awesome Technologies Innovationslabor GmbH in cooperation with the Kassel Clinic and the Frankfurt am Main University Clinic. The Hessian Ministry for Integration and Social Affairs (HMSI) supports the TeleCOVID Hessen project on an organizational and financial level[1].
Hospitals with a smaller intensive care capacity can use the TeleCOVID Hessen app to obtain a second opinion from an intensive care doctor from larger hospitals for COVID treatment. The hospitals can network via video telephony and transmit findings and treatment data in encrypted form. In this way, important information can be exchanged before the patient is transferred to another hospital.
The use of the app can simplify and technically improve the current exchange of information between the intensive care units via telephone, fax and e-mail.[2] Around 80 hospitals in Hesse are already connected and can use the app
The parties involved worked together constructively in regular talks with the HBDI. The HBDI's advice and comments were implemented and the hospitals involved were included in this discussion. By involving the HBDI at an early stage, numerous concepts and documents could be coordinated in advance.
Here it has again been shown that by including the HBDI before the start of the project, the right course can be set in good time and project-delaying improvements to ensure data protection compliance are not required.
