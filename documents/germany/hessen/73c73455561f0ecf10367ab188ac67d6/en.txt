On possible databases of credit agencies on energy supply contracts





09/23/2020








            The activities of credit bureaus are generally based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Whether individual databases or information are permissible is decided on the basis of a weighing of the legitimate interests of credit agencies and their contractual partners on the one hand and the legitimate interests of the persons concerned on the other.

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HBDI) clarifies the public discussion about possible databases that could be kept by credit agencies for energy supply contracts:
The activities of credit bureaus are generally based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Whether individual databases or information are permissible is decided on the basis of a weighing of the legitimate interests of credit agencies and their contractual partners on the one hand and the legitimate interests of the persons concerned on the other.
Whether the processing, such as the storage of corresponding data, and the provision of information about switching customers of energy suppliers is permissible has not yet been finally coordinated and decided by the supervisory authorities of the federal states and the federal government. This was not yet necessary due to the lack of productive databases operated by credit agencies. However, such a vote will take place at the next meeting of the responsible body of the data protection conference in early November in order to prepare a decision of the data protection conference.
