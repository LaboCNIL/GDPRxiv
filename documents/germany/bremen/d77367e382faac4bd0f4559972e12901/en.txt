According to its own statements, the Apple Group has been using a fleet of vehicles marked with "Apple Maps" in Bremen since June 15, 2020 until September 10, 2020. In addition to other data, these also capture camera images of the crazy environment. We do not yet know when the vehicles will be on the road in Bremen and Bremerhaven. According to Apple, the purpose of the recordings is to improve "Apple Maps". It is unclear whether the images produced could also be used in the future for a publication in the so-called "Look Around Feature".
The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has published further information on this topic on its website:

If you have further questions about the Apple project or related complaints, you are welcome to contact us or the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (contact options can be found on the website provided).
