PRESS RELEASE

Bremen/Bremerhaven,
February 9, 2021

  
No private vaccination data processing without law
 

It was reported in the press that a Bremen online ticket company had already

has created the conditions for making it possible for concert organizers to

Proof of vaccination as a prerequisite for admission to events. The State

commissioned for data protection and freedom of information, the company concerned has pointed out

s that such processing of vaccination data can be used as a "ticket" for events at private

economic purposes would only be possible with express legal permission and that it

a corresponding law does not currently exist.

The Bremen State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Dr. imke summer,

on this: "Vaccination data are specially protected as health data and may only be used in special

exceptional cases are processed by private individuals. It is a mistake to believe that the freedom of contract

heit is one of the exceptions. Also a legally effective consent of the vaccinated

cannot exist because they comply with the standards of the European General Data Protection Regulation

would not be considered voluntary. If only those are allowed to attend an event who

uploading a scan of their vaccination card is a violation of the ban on coupling. the

Processing of vaccination data by private bodies could at best be permitted in a law
that meets the high requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation."
