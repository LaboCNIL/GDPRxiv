right use of Microsoft Office 365 is possible.

The decision of the data protection conference was made with a narrow majority of 9 votes

erns, Hesse and Saarland the assessment of the working group administration from 15 July
2020 as a relevant working basis, but not yet considered ready for a decision. That

The five data protection supervisory authorities welcome all the more that the data protection conference

to start talks with the manufacturer.
