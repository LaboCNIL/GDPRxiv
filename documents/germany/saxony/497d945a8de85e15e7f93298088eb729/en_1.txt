foreword

Dear readers,

maybe you feel the same way: there are years that guess
quickly forgotten. Others literally burn themselves
into memory. The year 2020 is probably the most order
from us to the category "unforgettable". I conclude that
me in particular with regard to data protection.

2020 - that was the year in which analog life ended
was slowed down and the digital rapidly picked up speed.
In line with this, a large number of questions about data
protect me. Suddenly video conferences, streaming platforms and online
shopping. Home office and home schooling found their way into everyday life; Corona warning apps
should stop the pandemic.

In the middle of the year, a court decision caused uncertainty among those responsible.
Because on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice had the Privacy Shield Agreement between
Agreements between the EU and the USA were declared invalid ("Schrems II"). Consequently, it is US company
men no longer possible on the previous basis personal data of EU citizens
to process. This decision forces a variety of economic, political and
social actors to act. Companies in particular are likely to face the impending fine
have in mind when setting up their processes when processing personal data
do not adapt to case law. In this respect, too, the European data
General Protection Regulation (GDPR) their effect.

The conference of independent data protection authorities had to deal with the judgment just as quickly
the supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments. The data protection conference
(DSK), which I chaired in 2020, dealt intensively with the consequences of “Schrems
II”, for example with the transmission of Windows 10 telemetry data to Microsoft or
the legally compliant use of Office 365. Furthermore, the task force “Schrems
II" set up. It deals with the consequences of the judgment and serves the supervisory authorities
to vote on how to proceed.

In addition to questions about data protection-compliant digitization and the fight against pandemics,
In 2020 I had many more concerns. The need for advice in Saxony continued
high. Data protection affects more or less almost all areas of life. And so un-
no matter how different the individual practical cases may be, one aspect persists
famous common thread: the right to informational self-determination. It is an electronic
essential characteristic of our free democratic basic order and therefore
inalienable. The GDPR also follows this guiding principle, the structure of which is based on the
Article 59 activity report to be prepared annually.

foreword

Finally, I would like to thank the members of the Saxon state parliament and
would like to thank all partners who, not only in the reporting period, thanked for data protection and the
equipment have made my authority strong. I especially thank my co-workers
and employees. You've done a great job over the past year. I think so
not only to the Corona-related challenges, but also to coping with the
many requests for advice, the DSK chair, the preparation for the European data
protection day and much more.

You can find out details about all these events, dear readers, on the following
ing pages. With this in mind, I wish you lots of new insights!

Her

Basis for a uniform data protection law in the European Union. Consequently
At the beginning of 2020 we conducted a survey on the status of the implementation of the GDPR at selected
th municipalities. We wanted to find out to what extent the municipalities
already implemented in Saxony and the respective data processing processes
the regulations of the GDPR have been adjusted. A similar survey was already carried out in
their states. Thus we were able to respond to the questionnaire of the state representatives for the
Set up data protection Lower Saxony for our query.

In order to achieve a survey result that is as meaningful as possible, in addition to all
free cities and districts, various municipalities of different sizes for the
question randomly selected by us. The questionnaire with a total of four topics
plexen was sent to 118 places. We received feedback from 61 positions
in 2020 a. Few of the bodies responded within the six deadline set
weeks. With the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, however, we were unable to accept any further inboxes

Specialist offices received from authorities.

Ultimately, all ten districts, the three urban districts (Dres-
den, Leipzig, Chemnitz) and another 48 cities and municipalities. Many thanks to all
who took part in the survey!

The 39 questions included topics from the GDPR on data protection organization, such as the
Appointment of an official data protection officer (Art. 37) and questions about the directory
of processing activities (Article 30). There were also questions about the specific data protection
compliant processing, for example on the basis of consent (Art. 7), for
contract processing (Art. 28 and 29), for data protection impact assessment (Art. 35 and 36) as well as
on the information obligations (Articles 12, 13 and 14) and requests for information from a data subject
person (Article 15). Finally, on the subject of reporting data breaches (Article 33)

Summary of the main results

The GDPR came into force in 2016 and has been in force since May 25, 2018 in all
Member States of the European Union directly. The evaluation showed that unfortunately
only 23 percent of the municipalities contacted by the end of 2017 with the
settlement work had begun and, as a result, the two-year transitional period up to
effective date of the GDPR. The majority (77 percent) of the
Written municipalities did not start implementation until 2018 or - even later - only
started in 2019. As a result, half of the municipalities surveyed were planning to implement the GDPR
necessary adjustments to legal provisions, forms, contracts and so on
to be completed by the end of 2020. Another twelve municipalities (about 20 percent) will

During the reporting period, I was also faced with questions about the form of effective consent after the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Saxon Data Protection Implementation Act does not contain any further provisions
Consent. According to the Saxon legislator, the regulations of the
GDPR are sufficient. As in the 18th activity report (04/2015 to 03/2017) under 1.6, page 26 ff.
already shown, the GDPR only allows national and state legislatures to
Reich-specific specifications and supplements regarding the consent.

Section 11 of the Saxon Data Protection Implementation Act regulates the processing of employee
data from public Saxon authorities. A consent regulation as in the previous
Script of § 37 of the Saxon Data Protection Act does not contain § 11. Nevertheless it should
not lead to misunderstandings. Consent in the employment relationship is also

the consent in the employment relationship, also because of the in the service and employment
relatively even data processing tends to remain the exception. The voluntariness
must also be guaranteed despite the dependency relationship.

In contrast, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) in Section 26 (2) sentences 1 and 2
set rules for voluntariness. About the provisions of the GDPR on consent
Based on § 26 paragraph 2 sentence 3 BDSG the written form or electronic form

Consultation on government legislative projects

In the reporting period, I was assisted in various legislative projects
tend to be involved. These were, for example, statements on the Saxon
E-Government Law Implementation Ordinance, on the Saxon School Law and the
Saxon Corona Protection Ordinances and the Saxon Implementation Act on the
State Treaty on Gambling. I also took a stand with the other members of the data
protection conference with regard to federal legislation, for example in the evaluation of the federal
data protection law or the draft of the register modernization law.

Art. 36 Para. 4 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates that state legal
legislative bodies, both in formal legislation and in regulations that
concerning personal data processing, the supervisory authority has to be consulted
ben. It applies – of course – also to the level of the national states.

Act on the 23rd Broadcasting Amendment State Treaty

The Saxon Committee for Science, University, Media, Culture and Tourism
In spring 2020, the state parliament passed the state government’s draft law into law
on the 23rd Amendment to the Interstate Treaty on Broadcasting (Printed Paper 7/679). I
took this as an opportunity to inform the committee of my position on data protection
to share. The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and
Länder (DSK) already discussed the planned changes to the circular in spring 2019

Irrespective of this, on June 6, 2019, the heads of government of the federal states approved the draft of the
23rd Amendment to the Interstate Treaty on Broadcasting adopted. The Saxon State Parliament was

The present draft itself was unchanged with regard to the comparison of reporting data. He was

The regulations do not sufficiently take into account the standards of the GDPR.
Due to the priority of application of European regulations, national data

of the new regulation there are considerable concerns in this regard with regard to the
Principles of data minimization and necessity.

The provision for the waiver provided on the basis of the statements made by the data protection conference
on the comparison of reporting data is also problematic. The law leaves specifications for

"Self-initiated" public relations work by authorities

Occasionally I receive complaints from people who refer to police publications

of crimes. So last year I received a petition from a doctor whose practice
had become the target of a burglary. Published in the media information that has been issued
on the website of the responsible police department, was from a burglary in a doctor's office
on the specifically named street. The report also contained information on the amount of

So it would hardly be necessary and proportionate to respond to a request from a single press

In any case, the requirement for the provision of information is at least one request

Of the opinion that § 4 SächsPresseG is not a suitable legal basis for "self-initiated"

Data processing principles, definitions

2.1.1

Company doctor as his own responsibility within the meaning of
Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR

I occasionally had to deal with the question of whether company doctors were
responsible within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation. internal operating
I am convinced that doctors are functional positions within the responsible body
to watch. However, they belong to the person responsible and are not responsible for their own
chen. This also applies if the company doctors act as persons subject to professional secrecy. Although subject
You are subject to a special obligation of confidentiality, which means that you are within the data
processing body act informationally isolated and they are also subject within
no obligation to issue instructions regarding their area of activity, which is subject to secrecy,
yet they remain part of the entity. Affected rights, such as not uncommon
occurring information, are independent from internal company doctors without violating
to fulfill confidentiality obligations. However, the person responsible has the technical and organizational
to create technical possibilities and prerequisites for procedural implementation (cf.
also activity report 2019, 9.3, page 165 ff. and activity report 2017/2018, 2.11.1, page
103 f.).

The activities of external company doctors should be viewed differently. These are about
own responsible persons who process data on behalf of the personnel administration
tend to be active, but they themselves are aware of the purpose and means of processing the personal
gene data.

2.1.2

Data protection officer as the person responsible

In the last reporting period, I was confronted with a complaint in which affected persons
contacted me because they wanted information from an external data protection officer
coveted. The persons concerned had previously contacted the person responsible, who
actual data processing office, with a request for information, whereupon
the external data protection officer had become involved.

My authority treats the internal data protection officer as one of the responsible
to be assigned to officials, even if they act independently – Art. 38 para. 3
Sentence 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - and a person subject to professional secrecy
is provided (cf. 3.1.2 at the end and the wording of Art. 38 Para. 5 GDPR, cf. also
Activity Report 2019, 9.3, page 165 ff. and Activity Report 2017/2018, 2.11.1, page 103 f.).

Chapter 2 Principles of data processing

It is to be judged differently in the case of a commercially active – external – data protection
commissioned. This operates the personal data processing processes and
determines the purpose and means of processing.

The contents of the processed data are also not incorporated. That means the data processing

DSGVO towards external data protection officers. Request for information to inter-

2.1.5 Redacted copies of ID cards according to the Money Laundering Act -

data minimization

According to Sections 8, 10, 12 of the Money Laundering Act (GwG), those responsible under money laundering law must
check the identity of the beneficial owner of a transaction (to be initiated) and
document this. In principle, a copy of the identity document presented is to be
negligent, since a corresponding legal obligation is obeyed (cf. Art. 6 para. 1 letter
c GDPR).

Chapter 2 Principles of data processing

The underlying anti-money laundering registration of those responsible and transactions
is regularly expanded, so that smaller entrepreneurs such as brokers and
Goods traders are affected. From the multiplication of affected transactions and
corresponding systems for data processing is followed by a considerable increase in data
intellectual property risks. This means that there are no longer just a few, central and extensive

In all cases in which responsible persons based in the Free State of Saxony make copies

supervised persons responsible make copies, I can only do this within the scope of my
performance mandate on my legal opinion and, if applicable, the legal clarification

In order to counteract the inconsistency of legal interpretation and those responsible such as
affected persons to make their own decision within the scope of their responsibility or
to enable wise rights, the main arguments are presented below:

For the completeness of the copy to be made and thus the exclusion of blackening

concrete content-related reason for this view, despite detailed discussions, is neither pre-
worn can still be seen. However, according to this view, the earlier qualification of the
copy to be made in the law to implement the Fourth Money Laundering Directive, to
management of the EU money transfer regulation and the reorganization of the central office for financial
transaction investigations as “complete” would at least have been superfluous.

It is true that from the legislative materials of the Act on the Implementation of the Amending Directive
line to the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive is not immediately apparent for what reasons
legislator has removed the qualification “complete” from the provision of Section 8 (2) GwG.
However, there are no indications of a legislative error: The 2020 in § 8
Para. 2 GWG carried out the change rather bears the express specifications of the implemented
the Fifth Money Laundering Directive bill (Directive (EU) 2018/843 of the European
Parliament and Council of May 30, 2018 amending Directive (EU) 2015/849 on
Preventing the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorism
mus funding and amending Directives 2009/138/EC and 2013/36/EU). Art. 1 No.
25 explicitly emphasizes the limitation of the copy to what is necessary. After that is "a copy
of the documents and information received that are required for the fulfillment of the due diligence
are required for customers in accordance with Chapter II".

There is also no reason why the data protection principle of the data mini-
5 Para. 1 Letter c GDPR could be inapplicable here. Already the club
availability of the earlier version of Section 8 (2) GwG (2017: "complete copies of this documentation

considered a direct result of the constitutional right to informational
Self-determination (see BVerfG, judgment of December 15, 1983 - 1 BvR 209/83).

The corresponding justification in the legislative process of the GWG 2017 is at best
misleading and can hardly justify the "completeness" of copies introduced in 2017.

Such as the storage of body heights (stored in ID documents), eye color

GWG 2017 thus stipulates, with Section 8 GWG 2017 essentially the Fourth Money Laundering Directive
implement, the law blatantly violated their express requirements and higher
senior right. The Fifth Money Laundering Directive implemented with the GWG 2020
further reinforces the importance of the principle of proportionality under data protection law
(cf. recital 5, page 2) and data protection in general (cf. recital 21,
38, 51). In this respect, it seems extremely obvious that the German legislature with the new
version of Section 8 Para. 2 GwG union, constitutional and data protection-compliant
wanted to ask.

In my opinion, it follows fundamentally from the right to informational self-
Provision and the corresponding Union and human rights requirements that the
Collection and processing of data not required for the purpose of the law to
has to stay. This probably applies regardless of the fact that the Fourth and Fifth Money Laundering Directive
should be able to grant sufficient concrete individual rights in this respect, and thus the data mini-
nification is also mandatory due to a guideline-compliant interpretation of the Money Laundering Act
appears.

A binding clarification of this question by the courts seems desirable and

Management of visitor lists at Saxon courts

In the spring of 2020, I received a series of inquiries about keeping visitor lists
contained in Saxon courts. In an effort to narrow it down
of the infection process in the emerging pandemic, the courts laid

to enable contact tracing that may be necessary. Uniform specifications are

A legal basis for collecting the contact details of visitors to the courts was found
neither in the Infection Protection Act (IfSG) nor in the then valid Saxon Corona

On the occasion of the coronavirus pandemic, exit restrictions were imposed in Saxony for the first time
imposed (first lockdown). This resulted in drastic restrictions on fundamental rights and
the extensive shutdown of public life, in particular the closure of
barber shops and restaurants.

On March 31, 2020
Then the first Saxon Corona Protection Ordinance came into force

2.2.5 Disclosure of personal data respectively
Health data from the health authorities to the police

In connection with the coronavirus pandemic, I received various inquiries,
under which conditions a transmission of personal data is permissible. In
some cases it was about passing on the data of those who tested positive from the health
officials to the police.

A collection of health data by the police enforcement service or by
the rescue control center at the responsible health authorities and the transmission of the necessary

permissible if there are indications of a specific danger.

I justify this as follows:

According to § 7 paragraph 1 sentence 3 law on the public health service in the Free State of Saxony
(SächsGDG) in connection with § 6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 SächsGDG comes a transmission from
Health data by the health authorities of the districts and district-free cities to

Police enforcement service is permissible in this respect. The prerequisite is the existence of a (specific)

transmission of data to avert danger.

However, the SächsGDG does not provide a legal basis for a precautionary (preventive), ad hoc
independent transmission of sensitive health data to the rescue control center or
wise to refer to the law enforcement service. The same applies to the regulations
of the Infection Protection Act (IfSG). The transmission of sensitive health data is in

If necessary, an inquiry can be made in individual cases with the health

Certificates of exemption from the obligation to wear a

I received numerous inquiries from parents, some of whom even received

it was demanded that these must contain a justification, on the other hand they wanted that
In any case, keep a copy of the certificates in the school.

No version of the Saxon Corona Protection Ordinance contained requirements for the
Content of a medical certificate. Accordingly, the Saxon State Ministry for
Social and societal cohesion (SMS) from the beginning on the Internet: "Zur
The presentation of a medical certificate is sufficient for credibility. A separate justification
the doctor is not necessary.”

Irrespective of this, the Saxon State Medical Association, which pursuant to Section 37 (1) of the Saxon
sische Heilberufekammergesetz is subject to the supervision of the SMS, in a press release
from November 9, 2020 …

"currently summarized the content requirements for an effective medical certificate. Around
for example, an appropriate decision on exemption from the so-called mask requirement
for medical reasons, the medical certificate must meet a certain minimum
requirements (Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia, decision of 24 September

The SMS probably took this as an opportunity in the justification for the Saxon version
Corona Protection Ordinance of December 11, 2020 (completely correct)
ren:

 "[...] also clarifies that to prove the exemption from the obligation to wear the

especially since these people are not medically trained personnel.”

I am not aware that the SMS in this case relies on its supervisory rights over the
made use of the Saxon State Medical Association. The press release was over
of the reporting period can still be accessed without comment on slaek.de.

With regard to the admissibility of a copy of the certificate, the Saxon Corona Protection
Ordinance of September 29, 2020 in § 2 para. 7 the following wording: "For credibility
To request an exemption from the obligation according to sentence 1, it is sufficient to present a severely handicapped
tenancy card or medical certificate.”

This did not seem to be understandable enough for a number of headmasters. So I turned to
the Saxon State Ministry for Culture (SMK) with the request to take action.

In the meantime, the version of the Saxon Corona Protection Ordinance of 21.
October 2020 even clearer: "To substantiate an exemption from the obligation according to sentence
1, granting access to a severely handicapped ID card or a
medical certificate."

The SMK then also announced in a letter from the headmaster on October 30, 2020:

"The copying of certificates, with which schoolchildren from wearing a mouth
No nose covering is permitted. Likewise, it is not permissible to use these certificates
to put in the student file. The Saxon data protection officer pointed this out.
However, it should be noted for the respective student
that a corresponding certificate has been submitted."

The SMS finally took a complete U-turn with the version of the Saxon Corona
Protection Ordinance of November 27, 2020. There it was now regulated in § 3 para. 3:
“Schools and child day care facilities are authorized to use the medical certificate
which an exemption from the obligation according to paragraph 1 is made credible, in an analogous or
digital copy or, with the consent of the presenter, the original."

In my opinion, this was still permissible under data protection law, since
has been regulated that the copy or the certificate is to be secured against unauthorized access and after
Delete or destroy it immediately at the end of the period for which the certificate is valid

What was not regulated, however, was the relationship between the still existing general

create. The justification of the version of the Saxon Corona Protection Ordinance of
December 11, 2020 will lead to this (albeit with the wording of the
now § 3 paragraph 4) from: "It is now also made clear that the school or
childcare facility may make a copy of the certificate; the submitter has
to allow and tolerate this.”

2.2.7 Health Certificates for School Attendance

In the spring of 2020, numerous parents contacted me. It was about fulfilling the
long health confirmations. These had to be shown daily and belonged to the public

whether the fireplace inspection was carried out in person.

The district office, which I asked for an opinion, first informed me that the
powerful district chimney sweep himself demanded in a letter: "If not for me

Irrespective of this, the questionnaires in question were sent out in

to offer support. The voluntary fire brigade, clubs and groups are also trying
to attract new members.

For this purpose, the mayor turned to the municipal administration, which issued a corresponding

Collection of health data from employees in the
coronavirus pandemic

In the spring of last year I received a complaint about the collection of health
security data of employees of an authority as well as with these employees in a house

The employees of the authority were asked by e-mail to have a deadline for health
data relating to chronic pre-existing conditions from themselves and also from relatives
who live with them in the same household to indicate that they are at risk of

It is true that the right to inspect files and the right to information under data protection law
fundamentally convey two juxtaposed claims. On the one hand, they
different purposes and, on the other hand, relate to different objects. This
fundamental juxtaposition can be repealed, however, if the legislature with
the regulations on the right to inspect files, the right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR
wanted to restrict. However, such a restriction would have to meet the requirements of Art.

In several cases, those affected turned to me, to whom the responsible credit institution
with reference to contractual or statutory fee provisions only for a fee

According to Art. 15 Para. 3 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the data subject has the right
to obtain a copy of the data stored and processed by a person responsible

103

The right to a free data copy exists independently of contractual or statutory
Regulations that set a fee for certain documents or copies. That's how it is
This right also applies, for example, if there are contractual fees for account statements or copies thereof
are agreed. This also applies, for example, to the patient's right to a copy

grievance process does not correspond to the internal instructions according to which customers who

the SächsDSUG was to be applied.

The SächsDSG valid at the time of the crime was usually the milder law.

Even if, according to the above-mentioned decision of the OLG Bamberg in the area of hazard

statements that for the admissibility of a data retrieval the existence of a
initial suspicion is required, “therefore one that goes beyond mere assumptions

has been committed and the suspect is considered to be the perpetrator or accessory to that crime

6.4.2 Administrative offense proceedings in the non-public area

In the reporting period, I had to register 80 new administrative offense reports. The
number was essentially at the level of the previous year. More than a quarter
of the reports (25) referred to – by the police within the usual framework

I find that the person concerned had not only used the video recordings to

The person concerned had the dashcam permanently in use, later in his opinion

reported to the police for alleged traffic violations by third parties. With the perma-

6.4.3 Who owns the procedural files in fine proceedings?

If the public prosecutor's office discontinues preliminary investigations into a criminal offence,
but this because of the possible realization of an administrative offense
give myself away, I can observe very different procedures. Usually
I will be sent the relevant files with acknowledgment of receipt without further comments
hand over. But there are also public prosecutors who give me the files to prosecute
handed over an administrative offense under their own responsibility, but at the same time also a return
after the end of the procedure or a transfer to other bodies from their consent
make dependent.

I have a hunch that such claims are merely from the unverified application
result from text modules. In fact, procedural rule goes with a toll
according to § 43 law on administrative offenses (OWiG) to the administrative authority, so here
to me, about. With the submission by the public prosecutor's office, the administrative authority follows
§ 35 Para. 1 OWiG responsible for the procedure without it being the initiation of a fine
procedural need. The decision on how to proceed, in particular the
taking further investigative measures, the termination of proceedings or the conclusion by means of
of a fine, then lies solely with the administrative authority. The administration
authority is only bound by the decision of the public prosecutor's office as to whether an act is a criminal
deed is prosecuted or not (§ 44 OWiG).

This means that the procedural files after the conclusion of the administrative offense
rens remain with the administrative authority in accordance with the applicable retention periods and
subsequently destroyed by them; a return to the public prosecutor's office

It is different only in the case of an objection against the issued by the administrative authority

she has to transfer the fine files via the public prosecutor's office to the responsible district court

the tasks of the prosecuting authority are then transferred (again) to the public prosecutor's office
(Section 69 (4) OWiG). If the objection is not subsequently withdrawn,

Use of "Corona visitor lists" for

The reporting period was dominated by the pandemic and the measures to prevent it

being able to do so was seen in the obligation of certain companies and institutions to make lists

special authorization basis in the new Police Enforcement Service Act was planned -
starting with the year 2020 - over a period of two years, the organizational units
(including the facilities for training and further education as well as the patrol

According to § 57 Para. 6 SächsPVDG, the use of bodycams is special in a suitable way
to make recognizable. Therefore, the body cams are only open and in connection with the
speaking neon yellow sign "Video Audio". The beginning of the recording
is generally communicated to the data subject. The bodycams are configured in such a way that
recordings are externally recognizable. The police officers are required to
to limit the recording of uninvolved third parties to an unavoidable minimum.

court reduced to 900,000 euros. The court held that the benchmark was based on the turnover of the con-
Zerns-based assessment for no admissible criterion (see para. 91 et seq. of the decision).

The fine originally imposed was based on a violation of Article 32
Paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Accordingly, the technical

The starting point for the identified data protection violation was that the company's call center

am therefore only under § 630 g of the German Civil Code (BGB) under assumption of costs,
which the plaintiff just did not agree to.

The district court ruled as follows:

Regarding the storage period of account statements in

In its decision of May 14, 2020, Az.: B 14 AS
7/19, on the question of collecting and storing bank statements in social service files
decided. Specifically, the plaintiff was concerned with the deletion of his account statements on the basis

The main reasons for the decision are as follows:

1. A Benefits Authority has the authority to process a Benefits Application
Check the applicant's account movements and request account statements for this.
The required legal basis
for this data collection results from
Section 35, paragraph 2, first book of the Social Code (SGB I) in conjunction with Section 67 a, paragraph 1 sentence

2. When submitting bank statements, the admissibility of partial redacting

The court had already ruled on this in its judgment of September 19, 2008, Az.: B 14 AS 45/07 R,
pointed out. For special types of personal data, it must be checked separately whether
the knowledge of which is required to fulfill the task of the collecting body. § 67 paragraph 12
SGB X lists information about racial and
ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs,
union membership, health or sex life. However, it must be ensured
ensure that the amounts transferred remain identifiable. It is therefore protected
only the secrecy of the intended use or the recipient of the transfer
instructions, not their amount.
