The EU Commission facilitates data transfers from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom.



On 28 June 2021, the European Commission adopted the adequacy decisions for transfers of personal data to the UK under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, PDF file on ec.europa.eu) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED, PDF file on ec. europa.eu), accepted.
With the recognition of the appropriate level of data protection, data transfers from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom, within the scope of the decisions, do not require any special approval. Independent of this, it is necessary to check whether the general data protection requirements for data transmission are met.
