The Saxon data protection officer points out that labeling doorbell strips with the name of a tenant is not inadmissible under the General Data Protection Regulation.
According to the Saxon data protection officer, it is justifiable to put names on doorbells

to the consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter a DS-GVO,
to the (rental) contract in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter b DS-GVO or
on legitimate interests of the landlord according to Art. 6 Para. 1 Letter f DS-GVO
- to support in individual cases,
- at least as far as the landlord or property manager determines the attachment of the signs.

In the overall assessment, it must be taken into account that service providers, delivery services, rescue services, etc. will regularly be dependent on the name inscriptions, so that the signage in business transactions will regularly be in the interests of landlords, property managers and tenants. Mailboxes have signs with names anyway. For the most part, no additional data is disseminated if name designations remain on doorbell signs.
Insofar as landlords and property management companies accommodate individual affected persons who claim that their personal rights have been violated by doorbells, the Saxon data protection officer raises no objections to this.
Insofar as the tenants or occupants undertake and are responsible for the content of the labeling themselves, the question does not arise at all.
