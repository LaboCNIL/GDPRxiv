»Communication via social networks also works in a data protection-friendly manner and without the big tech companies. The short message service Mastodon is a good example of this. It is decentralized, free of advertising and does not require user monitoring. Mastodon also offers advantages for companies and public administration. Because unlike the large commercial providers, Mastodon can be operated in compliance with data protection.
                  For me, the platform is therefore an important part of up-to-date and citizen-oriented communication. With my authority, I provide information at Mastodon on current topics relating to data protection and freedom of information," says Dr. Juliane Hundert and adds: »I would be happy if other public authorities from Saxony could be found on Mastodon in the near future.«
