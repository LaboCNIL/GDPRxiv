In accordance with the Coronavirus Protective Mask Ordinance, persons entitled to claim receive reduced or free FFP2 masks from pharmacies.



Those affected contacted the office of the Saxon data protection officer and complained about the production of copies of ID cards. The Saxon Data Protection Officer therefore points out that personal data may only be processed to the extent necessary. Since January 7, 2021, protective masks have been handed out to persons entitled to claim who have reached the age of 60, or who have an illness specified in Section 1 Paragraph 1 Number 2 of the Coronavirus Protective Mask Ordinance (ProtectionmV) or a condition listed in Section 1 Paragraph 1 Number 2 SchutzmV named risk factor is present, against corresponding certificates of eligibility. In the case of entitled persons who receive basic security (unemployment benefit II), masks are handed over upon presentation of the information disc of the health insurance company according to ยง 3 paragraph 5 sentence 2 SchutzmV and the identity card or another photo ID. The pharmacies keep the information letter and stamp it with the pharmacy stamp and the signature of the person issuing it.
Any further processing of personal data of the persons concerned is not covered by Article 9 Paragraph 2 Letter i) GDPR and also constitutes a fine. The production of photocopies or the scanning of ID cards in connection with the mask issue are therefore not permitted. It is also impermissible to make the supply of protective masks dependent on a customer card from the pharmacy or to process personal data in other ways that are not specifically required in the context of supplying masks and billing.
