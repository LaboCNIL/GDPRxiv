Around 494,500 schoolchildren in Saxony start a new school year on September 6th. Also present: around 39,900 first graders.



Their everyday life is now changing and this is associated with numerous questions that parents are now asking: How can my child use a tablet without their data falling into the wrong hands? Can the school make a copy of a mask exemption certificate? Can proof of vaccination, for example measles vaccination, be requested from my child? What should be considered when filming and photographing school events? School representatives, on the other hand, are often unsure when it comes to using online learning platforms and video conferencing systems in compliance with data protection regulations.
You can find answers to these questions and further information in the new section on data protection at school.
