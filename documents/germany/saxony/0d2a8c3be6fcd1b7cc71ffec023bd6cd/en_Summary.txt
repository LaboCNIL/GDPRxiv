The federal and state statistical offices are again conducting a population, building and housing census (census) this year. The reference date is May 15, 2022 (census reference date).



The State Statistical Office is the authority responsible for this in Saxony. When requesting data, it makes use of its powers, which are granted to it in particular by the law on the implementation of the census in 2022 (Census Law 2022 - ZensG 2022). This legal basis implements the requirements that the Federal Constitutional Court has set for such surveys:
In its judgment on the census law of December 15, 1983, the Federal Constitutional Court determined that the right to informational self-determination can be restricted in the overriding public interest. However, these restrictions require a constitutional legal basis that must correspond to the constitutional requirement of legal clarity. The legislature must observe the principle of proportionality and take organizational and procedural precautions to counteract the risk of a violation of personal rights.
to the census law
There is then an obligation to provide information for the surveys. The Census Act specifically stipulates who is obliged to provide information. Sections 27 et seq. of the ZensG also contain detailed regulations on data protection and data processing.
