100 days after the Saxon Transparency Act came into force, citizens in many places are making use of their right to access information.



The Saxon Data Protection and Transparency Officer Dr. Juliane Hundred:
Â»Many authorities in the Free State of Saxony have already received requests for access to information. I am pleased that the citizens are pursuing their interest in official information and are thus exercising their right to participate in a democratic society. However, I also note that the flood of applications, which some critics feared in advance, did not materialize. Since the beginning of the year, my authority has itself been the addressee of eleven requests for information. The number of complaints that I have received as transparency officer has also fallen short of expectations. In the first quarter of this year, only twelve complaints were received by my agency. Apparently, the applications are processed punctually and thoroughly by the transparency-obligated bodies. I am positively surprised by the Saxony State Directorate, which already publishes such information on its website in a 'transparency portal' that it has provided information about."
