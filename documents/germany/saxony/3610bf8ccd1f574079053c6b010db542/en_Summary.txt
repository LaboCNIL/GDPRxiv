After three terms of office, Andreas Schurig will end on December 31, 2021 as Saxon data protection officer. Since 2004, he and his staff have worked on tens of thousands of cases. Some received nationwide attention, for example the so-called "Saxon swamp" investigations in 2006/2007 or the Dresden "Handygate" in 2011. In addition to these incidents, there were many other events and consultations that did not find their way into the media. Andreas Schurig sums it up: "I am proud of what we have done and achieved in the 18 years of my tenure. One of the biggest challenges was certainly the conversion to the European General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect in May 2018. More than a thousand requests for advice were received came to me; from citizens, companies, associations and from the administration. In addition, there were a number of new tasks and obligations as a now independent supervisory authority. This realignment was a tour de force for everyone involved, which we mastered together."
