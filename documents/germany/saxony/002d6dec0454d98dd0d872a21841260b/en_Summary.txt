Data protection conference meets for the 100th time
The conference of the independent data protection authorities of the federal and state governments (DSK) will meet on November 25th and 26th, 2020 in a video conference for the 100th meeting since its inception. The Saxon Data Protection Officer Andreas Schurig will chair the meeting. Topics of the anniversary event will include: the inventory data disclosure procedure for security authorities and intelligence services, the proposed abolition of secure end-to-end encryption in telecommunications, the still pending implementation of the ePrivacy Directive and the processing of personal data in the fight against pandemics.

Schurig: "In the 42 years of its existence, the DSK has repeatedly dealt with controversial topics, from the 1983 census to handling the personal data of people who tested positive for corona during the current pandemic. It forms a significant counterweight to the ministerial conferences at the federal level. We have always been guided by the interest of the persons concerned in being spared state or private interference with their fundamental freedoms and rights, or, if this was unavoidable, that such interference is at least proportionate.‚Äù
