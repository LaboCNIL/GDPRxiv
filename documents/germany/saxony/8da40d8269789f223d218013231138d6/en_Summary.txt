With the implementation decision of June 4, 2021, the EU Commission issued new standard contractual clauses.



They are intended to enable the legally compliant transfer of personal data to third countries. The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments, like the European Data Protection Board (EDSA), points out that even when using the new EU standard contractual clauses, an examination of the legal situation in the third country and additional supplementary measures are required. Details can be found in this press release from the data protection conference.
