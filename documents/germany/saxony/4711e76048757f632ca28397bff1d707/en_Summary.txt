On Friday, March 5, 2021, the Federal Council will vote on the introduction of the Register Modernization Act. It envisages that the tax ID will now become a general identification number in public administration.
The Saxon Data Protection Officer Andreas Schurig explains: “By creating a uniform and cross-administrative personal identifier, there is a risk that extensive personality profiles will be created – a big step towards transparent citizens. In addition, Saxony has historical reasons for rejecting such a personal identifier. A comprehensive personal code was introduced in the GDR at the beginning of the 1970s, which was used to control the population. I therefore appeal to the Saxon state government not to approve the draft law in the Bundesrat.”
