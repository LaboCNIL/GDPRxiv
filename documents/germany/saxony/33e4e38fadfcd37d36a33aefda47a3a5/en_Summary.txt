On January 1, 2023, the Saxon Transparency Act will come into force. This means that citizens in Saxony also have the right to access information.



From now on, they can request the release of certain information from bodies subject to transparency obligations. This includes, for example, expert opinions, studies, reports or notifications. A transparency platform must also be set up by the end of 2026, via which the public administration can make existing information available online.
