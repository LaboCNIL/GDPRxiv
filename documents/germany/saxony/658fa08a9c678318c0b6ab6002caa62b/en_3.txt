The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and

Pandemic and the associated basic

legal interventions to the basic requirement of the rule of law to continue these interventions

to be critically assessed and evaluated on an ongoing basis. The DSK asks in the course of such

to be checked thoroughly and promptly for correctness.

The DSK recommends that the federal states use the CWA as a supplementary option.

must be taken into account in their concepts for combating the pandemic.

Since the update to version 2.0, the CWA has had a corresponding radio

come together to register. Even if here - unlike other

ren apps â€“ no personal data collected and later sent to a health

office can be transmitted, the pseudonymised cluster detection of the

CWA make a significant contribution to breaking chains of infection.

Through the direct networking of CWA users, people who

were exposed to the potential risk of infection, immediately and therefore faster than

CWA with more than 27 million downloads, there is a high probability that

Promoting the use of the CWA for cluster detection could result in
