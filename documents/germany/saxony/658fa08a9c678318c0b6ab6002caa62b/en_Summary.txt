The 101st conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments (DSK) met on April 28th and 29th, 2021.



A key topic: Digital contact tracking systems, for example for the event industry or gastronomy. For this purpose, the DSK has published an orientation guide on the use of digital services for contact tracing. The data protection requirements are described in the document, which is aimed at developers and those responsible.
Since the majority of the federal states have now decided to enter into contractual agreements with the provider of the "Luca" service, the DSK has also dealt with this system again. The results are published in a statement to Luca.
In view of the recent functional expansion of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA), the DSK emphasizes the data-saving possibilities of cluster detection and contact notification associated with the use of the CWA in the resolution on using the Corona-Warn-App 2.0. The data protection conference appeals to the countries to include the CWA in their concepts for fighting the pandemic and to promote their use.
Against the background of the increasing use of messenger services in the health sector, the DSK also passed the statement on technical data protection requirements for messenger services in the hospital sector. In addition, the DSK published requirements for data protection certification programs.
