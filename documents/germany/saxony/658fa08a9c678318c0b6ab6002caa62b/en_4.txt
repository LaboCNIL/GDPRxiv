Technical data protection requirements for messenger services

 

in the hospital sector

 

Messenger services have paralleled the proliferation of smartphones in recent years

gained central importance for the exchange of messages over the years, other

Communication services such as e-mail or SMS are often replaced and count in everyday private life

the most popular forms of communication.

Reasons for this are in addition to the usability at any time via smartphone and the

ease of use of the range of functions, which allows, in addition to text messages

also exchange pictures, videos or voice messages, voice and video calls

to be carried out and optionally with individual participants or

to communicate in the group. In addition, it is often a matter of free

usable offers.

Due to the widespread and established use in the private sector,

these messenger services are also increasingly used in the health sector,

often associated with the use of a private end device1,2,3.

The professional or commercial use of messenger services is subject to legal

chen data protection requirements, which common messenger services have not yet or

correspond only to a limited extent. In particular, the widely used service WhatsApp leads

in a business use to a number of problems4, the use in

largely exclude the hospital. The same applies to others in the private sector

frequently used services.

With a view to the sensitivity of the data concerned in the health sector and the

special protection that this according to Art. 9 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

enjoy, are therefore important when selecting suitable messenger services for the transmission

of patient data in the hospital area by the responsible

relevant data protection requirements to be taken into account. The pro-

at the same time serve as orientation for the use of messenger services

in the established area.

The use of messenger services in the hospital sector can be

various scenarios (e.g. internal hospital use, consultation, communication

with emergency services, communicating with medical practices, communicating with others

service providers, communication with patients). Depending on the scenario

rio can result in different requirements. The following

Requirements require the use of business end devices and do not include

the use of private devices by employees. The scope of the

level.

 

I. Messenger Application

(e.g. information on data protection, data protection declaration) for the at any time

access to be deposited.

2. The application must have the ability, use and access
to the data processed via it to its own prior authentication

(e.g. PIN, fingerprint). This can be based on the operating system radio

functions, but must opt out of the protection for unlocking the mobile

device (see item III. 1).

3. The application must be able to display contact data from communi-
nication participants in their own, from the general

key) to import. A communication via the messenger application

may only be used on the basis of reliable identification and authentication

tion of the communication partners may be possible.

5. If electronic signatures or other electronic certificates are used,
there must be a certificate management. In particular, it must be ensured

that electronic keys or certificates clearly belong to a legal entity

son (here: the hospital) or assigned to a natural person and regularly

moderately checked for validity. Compromised keys or certificates

kate must be able to be disabled. It is irrelevant whether the

used Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) operated by the person responsible or by

is made available to a third party.

(e.g. certification according to Art. 42 DS-GVO, certification according to European

Privacy Seal, BSI basic protection certification or similar). on the part of

hospital, the messenger application should also be based on the test catalogue

13. The application should have (semi) automatic update procedures7.

 

II. Communication

1. The confidentiality and integrity of the medical
chinic communication must take into account the state of the art

via end-to-end encryption between individuals or groups

of communication participants or the respective

services are guaranteed (Art. 32 Para. 1 lit. a DS-GVO).

2. As far as the integrity of the data communicated via the messenger service for
subsequent measures is important, should there be the possibility

Technology to be proven (Art. 32 Para. 1 DS-GVO). Furthermore, to guarantee

tion of the integrity of the information when used for subsequent actions

is important, care is taken to ensure that all data communicated

arrive at the recipient. If a message is

tens of a messenger distributed over several messages (e.g. because the messenger

only allows a certain number of characters or file size per message).

Mechanisms must be integrated that inform the recipient

whether the message sent has arrived in full or whether individual messages

correcting parts are missing. This can e.g. B. by automatically adding a se-

number (โpart x of yโ) so that the recipient

catchers can see whether all the messages have reached him or her.

3. Connection data for the communication conducted via the messenger service
(e.g. communication participants, time, device and

location data) may only be processed for as long and to the extent necessary for

carry out the transmission of the communication or to maintain it

or restoring the security of electronic communications networks and

services or to detect technical defects and errors in the transmission

of the hospital are used. A use for other purposes by the

Manufacturer of the solution or the platform operator (e.g. advertising purposes) is inadmissible

casual.

4. The use of open communication protocols8 (e.g.
XMPP9, Matrix10) to communicate with other messenger

enable services.

 

III. Endpoint security

1. The end devices used must have effective access protection
(e.g. PIN/passphrase, biometric solutions). The internal memory of the devices

must be protected by encryption so that decryption

any necessary adaptation to the respective device type immediately

take.

3. The end devices must have a Mobile Device Management (MDM) service
or an equally effective measure (configuration specifications/profiles, installation

allow in case of loss, but with a permanent localization of the owner

can be ruled out.

 

IV. Platform/Operation

1. Insofar as the messenger service used is a
publicly available telecommunications service i. s.d. ยง 3 No. 17a Telekom

Communications Act (TKG), this must comply with the applicable specifications

of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Telecommunications Act

, including in particular Section 6 and Part 7 TKG. With regard to compliance

to choose from. The conclusion of a contract in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 DS-GVO

(see below) is not necessary in this case.

2. It must be ensured that only authorized users participate in a message
exchange can participate. This applies to the communication of a fixed

laid, closed user group (e.g. hospital), as well as for the

Communication with other participants of the messenger


 

service. This requires a suitable registration process or

Speaking authorization/authentication mechanisms, such as through a

centrally administered identity management system.

3. For the processing activities associated with the use of the messenger service
activities, the need for a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

according to Art. 35 DS-GVO. In particular, if these processing

activities are extensive, a DPIA must be carried out (Art. 35 Para. 3 lit. b DS-

GMO). Do several hospitals have similar processing activities by

4. The hospital must regularly check the messenger solution
assessment, assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the protection of processing

technical and organizational measures taken

(Art. 24 para. 1 sentence 2, 32 para. 1 lit. d GDPR).

5. The messenger solution should operate both as a service of a service
ters/processors as well as in the technical infrastructure of the health

allow on-premises.

6. Insofar as contract processors are used to operate the process
it must be ensured that these comply with the regulations of the data protection

Basic Regulation and the requirements of Art. 9 Para. 3 DS-GVO

i. V. m. ยง 203 Abs. 3 StGB as well as other possibly relevant regulations (e.g. crane

house laws). For this purpose, service providers in Germany, the EU

according to Art. 42 DS-GVO, certification according to European Privacy Seal, BSI basic protection

certification).

8. For the data stored by the service provider as part of the messenger solution
Regular erasure of data must be ensured (cf. Item I.8). personal

Contract processors (insofar as they comply with the requirements of the basic data protection

regulation - in particular Art. 9 Para. 3 and 28 DS-GVO -, the federal or state


 

data protection regulations and, if necessary, taking into account specific national

legal, in particular regional hospital regulations

were processed). The temporary storage on the end devices should

therefore kept as short as possible according to the principle of necessity and in

short cyclic intervals from the end device to the intended server systems

be relocated. This also applies to any container solution in the mobile

messenger app.

9. As soon as they are available, security-related updates of the app in particular are

to be released internally and carried out on all devices used.
