This year, Safer Internet Day takes place on February 9th. The day of action is an EU initiative that focuses on the topic of online security. The international motto is "Together for a better internet".
On the occasion of Safer Internet Day, the Saxon Data Protection Officer Andreas Schurig explained: “For most people in Europe, the use of apps and online services is a natural part of their lives. A number of these applications collect and process a large amount of personal data without the users always being aware of the extent. Fortunately, there are also transparent and data-saving solutions for many areas. We should give preference to such data protection-friendly applications and thus exercise our fundamental right to informational self-determination.”
