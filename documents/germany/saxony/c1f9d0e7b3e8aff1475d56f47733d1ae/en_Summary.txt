The conference of the independent federal and state data protection supervisory authorities (DSK) has published FAQs on the use of Facebook fan pages.



Responsible persons who operate a page on this platform will find answers to frequently asked data protection questions in the document. The data protection conference also points out that the legal aspects also apply to other social networks and platforms. In contrast to the Facebook fan pages, a judicial clarification is still pending.
