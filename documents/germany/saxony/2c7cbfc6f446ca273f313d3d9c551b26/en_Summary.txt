The data protection supervisory authorities of several German states have examined the websites of media companies with regard to the use of cookies and the integration of third-party services. A total of 49 websites in 11 countries were tested on the basis of a joint test catalogue. The focus was on user tracking for advertising purposes.
The Saxon Data Protection Officer Andreas Schurig explains: “Many people use the websites of Saxon media companies every day. Cookie banners and the integration of third-party providers sometimes cause uncertainty. I keep getting complaints about this. My supervisory authority therefore examined five high-reach online presences of Saxon media providers with regard to data protection. The procedures and the exchange with those responsible have not yet been completed. At this point in time, however, it can already be stated that there is still room for improvement on the tested websites in terms of the design of consent solutions, data transmission and the transparency of the offers for users.”
