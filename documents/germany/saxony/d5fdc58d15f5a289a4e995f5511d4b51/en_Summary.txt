According to § 3 paragraph 3 of the Saxon Corona Protection Ordinance (SächsCoronaSchVO) of August 24, 2021, authorities and courts are obliged to record the contact of visitors.



This contact recording is independent of incidence.
On the other hand, contact recording in connection with postal voting is not permitted - can be found in the FAQ of the Saxon State Ministry for Social Affairs and Social Cohesion. It says:
“No contact is recorded in authorities and rooms that are used for casting votes, for counting votes or for other voting activities necessary in connection with the conduct of the election to the German Bundestag and that are publicly accessible. There is no obligation to present proof of vaccination, convalescence or test. This also applies to applying for postal voting or handing over the documents for postal voting.
