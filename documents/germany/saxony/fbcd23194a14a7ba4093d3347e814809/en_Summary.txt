Traffic accident research at the TU Dresden GmbH (VUFO) uses video observation in a current research project.



From October 22 to 29, 2021, the driving behavior of e-scooters will be examined at various locations in Dresden. The Saxon Data Protection Officer advised the scientists during the planning phase and had no fundamental objections to the project. This does not affect the obligation of those responsible to ensure data protection-compliant implementation.
