The state parliament passed the Saxon Transparency Act today. From January 1, 2023, citizens have a right of access to information from the Saxon authorities. In that case, bodies subject to transparency obligations must provide the required information upon request. This includes, for example, expert opinions, studies, reports or notifications. In addition, public administration will in future be obliged to proactively provide information. These publications should be made on the so-called transparency platform by the end of 2026 at the latest.
Compliance with the Transparency Act is monitored by the Saxon data protection officer. It performs its duties with complete independence, is not subject to instructions and is only subject to the law.
dr Juliane Hundert: "The Transparency Act is an important step towards strengthening civil rights and our democracy. Access to government information is a prerequisite for active participation in our democratic society. This is what I will do as the transparency officer. In the future, citizens can contact me if they see their right to transparency violated. I am also available to advise parliament, government and administration.‚Äù
