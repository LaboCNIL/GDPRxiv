The "3G" regulation is often applied to events during the Corona period.



This means that every participant must provide information as to whether he or she has been vaccinated, recovered or tested. In this context, the Saxon data protection officer recently received the question: Do parents also have to provide this information if they want to take part in a parents' evening?
The Saxon State Ministry of Culture - responsible resort for the school and daycare corona regulation (SchulKitaCoVO) of August 24, 2021 - has announced that there is no test-dependent access ban for parents' evenings according to § 3 paragraph 1 sentence 1 SchulKitaCoVO. Reason: The class parents' meeting falls under the term "parent participation" in § 3 Para. 1 Sentence 5 SchulKitaCoVO. Section 3, paragraph 1, sentence 5 of the SchulKitaCoVO exempts committees for “parent participation” from the ban on entry in accordance with sentence 1. A negative proof is not required.
