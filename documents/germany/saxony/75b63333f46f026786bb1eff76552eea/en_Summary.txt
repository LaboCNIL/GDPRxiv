The residents' registration offices are obliged to provide the data of adult citizens to the contribution service of ARD, ZDF and Deutschlandradio every four years for comparison.



As part of the comparison, it should be clarified for which apartments no license fee has been paid so far. For this purpose, information on name, address, doctoral degree, marital status and date of birth as well as the date of moving into the apartment is sent to the contribution service.

                  The comparison of registration data has its legal basis in Section 11 (5) of the Interstate Broadcasting Agreement. The comparison does not require the consent of the citizens concerned, nor is there a right to object to the data being passed on by the residents' registration offices.
                  If an adult cannot be assigned an apartment that has already been registered with the contribution service, the contribution service will contact them by letter. The first letters are expected to be sent by the contribution service from January 10, 2023.

                  The Saxon data protection officer is not responsible for the data protection control of the ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio contribution service. The data protection supervision of the processing of personal contribution data in the contribution service of ARD, ZDF and Deutschlandradio is in principle the responsibility of the responsible broadcasting data protection officer of the broadcaster concerned.

                  You can find the contact details of all broadcasting data protection officers on the data protection conference website. For the Free State of Saxony, the broadcasting data protection officer of the MDR is the responsible supervisory authority for data protection supervision of the ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Contribution Service.
