My office has recently received an increasing number of inquiries and complaints from tradespeople and companies about a "data protection information center" allegedly based in Oranienburg, Brandenburg. This is not an authority, but a profit-oriented body that apparently sends unsolicited advertising to traders by fax.
Last but not least, the corresponding fax letter conveys an official impression and the impression that there is an obligation to report back to or register with the "Data Protection Information Center"/"DAZ" in order to obtain legal information, since it does not immediately reveal the intention to make a profit The request with a short deadline to fill out a form in the appendix, on the other hand, is aimed at the careless conclusion of a contract by the recipients who have been informed in this way for a subscription to a “basic data protection service package” for an annual fee of EUR 498 plus VAT. It is not advisable for companies and tradespeople to respond to unsolicited advertising or comparable offers by signing and entering into a contract.

Offered help, texts and forms for the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation can be found free of charge on the websites of the data protection supervisory authorities, including on the website of the Saxon data protection officer, https://www.saechsdsb.de/anleitung. This official information as well as that from business, professional associations and chambers should be sufficient to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. In addition, Saxon traders and companies are free to contact the Saxon data protection officer if they have any further questions.
