The provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation come into effect today. The General Data Protection Regulation creates a uniform legal framework for data protection in the European Union.
At the same time, supplementary national regulations will apply from May 25th. The Saxon authorities are subject to the Saxon Data Protection Implementation Act. The revised Federal Data Protection Act applies to non-public bodies in Saxony.
Andreas Schurig on the new features: “In recent weeks, a great deal of information has been published on the General Data Protection Regulation. Unfortunately, some of the reporting has also caused misinformation and uncertainty, especially among smaller companies. I get countless inquiries. My authority recognizes the responsibility for advising those affected and the small and medium-sized Saxon companies. I would like my office to be able to act not only as a supervisory authority, but also as a service provider. However, this will only succeed if the budget legislator and the state government also provide my department with the personnel and material resources required for the implementation of EU law.”
Further information on the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation can be found on the website of the Saxon data protection officer
