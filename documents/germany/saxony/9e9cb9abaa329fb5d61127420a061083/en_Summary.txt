On May 15th, the 2022 census will start in Saxony, a large census of the population, buildings and dwellings. The Saxon Data Protection Officer Dr. Juliane Hundred:
“In its groundbreaking census judgment from 1983, the Federal Constitutional Court laid down the fundamental right to informational self-determination. The judges have thus set clear limits for the state in population surveys. Among other things, he must create a legal basis and take organizational and procedural precautions to ensure that the data collected does not fall into the wrong hands. In practice, this means, for example, that individual statistical information from a person interviewed must be kept strictly confidential. They may not be issued to administrative authorities or private individuals. During the 2022 census, I will conduct random checks with my authority to determine whether the data protection regulations are being complied with. After all, citizens have a right to the state always processing their data in accordance with the law.”
