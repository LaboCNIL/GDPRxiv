From April 19, 2023, the Saxon data protection and transparency officer (SDTB) will use new email addresses. The change affects the domain part: »@slt.sachsen.de« becomes »@sdtb.sachsen.de«.



Important: Do you have previous SDTB e-mail addresses, e.g. B. stored on the PC or on the smartphone, you should carry out an update. Even if you have given SDTB's general e-mail address in a data protection declaration, for example, a change is required (new: post@sdtb.sachsen.de).
                  E-mails to the previous addresses will only be automatically forwarded to the new mailboxes at SDTB until the end of June 2023.
