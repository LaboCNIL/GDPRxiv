the Conference of Independent Data Protection Authorities

DSK publishes new guidelines for providers of telemedia

The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and

LÃ¤nder (DSK) today has a new version of the orientation guide for providers

published by telemedia. The paper offers operators of websites and apps

or smart home applications specific assistance in the implementation of

new regulations of the Telecommunications Telemedia Data Protection Act

(TTDSG). In addition, the orientation guide gives affected citizens a better

res picture of the legal framework.

With the publication of the revised orientation guide, the

supervisory authorities to the changed legal situation. This has been in place since December 1, 2021

Privacy policy implemented in national law.

The TTDSG was formulated and demands close to the wording of the European specifications

corresponding user request can be determined and then implemented.

When examining whether, in exceptional cases, consent is not required, it should be noted that

that the conditions differ significantly from the criterion of legitimate interest

in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Until November 30th

2021, the legitimate interest was determined by the supervisory authorities under close

stipulations as a possible legal basis. A previous interest

consideration according to the GDPR does not automatically meet the narrow requirements

of the TTDSG. To implement the new legal situation, it is therefore, for example

not sufficient if only the names of the legal bases in a

privacy policy to be exchanged.

Further processing of the personal data collected in this way continues to apply

provisions of the GDPR. There are also some hints on this in the new Ori-

planning aid.

Operators of websites, apps and other telemedia should use

precise design of the technologies and their need for revision

undergo. Time, type and duration of storage as well as the downstream data

data processing must comply with the requirements of the TTDSG or the DS-GVO

chen. The present guide is intended to provide assistance in this regard.

The document largely replaces the previous version from 2019 and

was published on the DSK homepage. It is planned, soon also one

to provide the English version of the orientation guide.

Furthermore, a public consultation process for the new version of the
