What does the new Saxon Transparency Act bring to the citizens? This is what Dr. Juliane Hundert on November 17th. from 7 p.m. at an event organized by the State Center for Civic Education.



The Saxon Transparency Act will come into force on January 1, 2023. This gives citizens a legal right to the disclosure of information to bodies in the Free State of Saxony that are subject to transparency obligations. The law is an important step towards strengthening civil rights and democracy. Only when government action is transparent is it comprehensible and controllable. Compliance with the Transparency Act is checked by the Saxon data protection officer.
At an online event organized by the Saxon State Center for Civic Education citizens can find out, among other things, how they can make use of their right to access information, where the limits of the Transparency Act lie in Saxony and what other options there are for influencing municipal decisions beyond the Transparency Act gives.
The following are available as interlocutors:

dr Juliane Hundert, Saxon data protection officer and from 2023 also transparency officer
Hannah Vos, fully qualified lawyer working at the portal for freedom of information fragdenstaat.de
Ulrich Hörning, Administrative Mayor of the City of Leipzig

The event will take place online on November 17, 2022 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. via the Big Blue Button and can be reached via the following link:
