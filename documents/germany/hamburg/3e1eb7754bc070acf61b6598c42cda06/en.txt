The data protection supervisory authorities of Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania have jointly applied for project funds from the EU program “Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values” (CERV) in a nationwide campaign that is unique. The aim of the EU program is to make data protection tangible and understandable for parents. Various topics of data protection and media education are to be made easily accessible with events and online events. In addition, parents receive comprehensive information about their rights and obligations in the digital space. The project is aimed at all families, so attention is paid to multilingualism and low-barrier access.
"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has given us the task of sensitizing citizens to the handling of their data and creating special offers for children and young people," explains Heinz Müller, State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LfDI M-V). .
It is the first time that data protection authorities are conducting such a comprehensive awareness campaign for parents in Germany. "Together we want to set long-term impulses for the media and data protection competence development of the citizens in our federal states. Due to increasing digitization, knowing what happens to my data is more important than ever," concludes Thomas Fuchs, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
