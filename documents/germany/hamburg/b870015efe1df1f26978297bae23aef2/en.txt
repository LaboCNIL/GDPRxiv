Data retrieval via police computer - supervisory authority checks

According to media reports, personal data was queried via police computers in Hesse, Hamburg and Berlin without any official reason for doing so. In this context, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information is investigating a report that information about a journalist was requested from a Hamburg police database. These queries are related to a threatening letter addressed to them, which was signed “NSU 2.0”.
The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information is in contact with the Hamburg Police, which he has asked to comment. In the meantime, an incident previously determined by the police has also been handed over for data protection assessment.
Johannes Caspar, Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information: “The incidents are extremely worrying and are taken very seriously by the data protection authorities. Police powers of data processing must not be abused. This is already the case if personal data is used for personal purposes in an official capacity. If this is also done to intimidate people, this is in no way acceptable under the rule of law. Those affected by this need our strongest protection of their rights and freedoms. In this respect, transparent and unreserved clarification by the responsible authorities is required. I am assuming that we will receive prompt feedback from the Hamburg police on this matter.”
