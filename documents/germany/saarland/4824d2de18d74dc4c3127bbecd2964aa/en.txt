Saarland faces major challenges in the coming years. Among other things, the social, economic, cultural and institutional changes associated with increasing digitization have a significant impact on economic and social life in Saarland. Data protection plays a key role here, because an indispensable prerequisite for the acceptance of digital transformation is user confidence in the corresponding procedures and processes. This trust must first be gained and then sustainably strengthened through pronounced data protection, data-saving system design, user education and effective IT security measures. It is not the reduction of the level of data protection or even the lowering of data protection requirements through legislative measures that can therefore be used as factors for successful digitization, but rather the early, permanent and consistent consideration of data protection issues by those responsible. Data protection is therefore not an obstacle, but a key success factor for digitization in Saarland. With this in mind, the following points are intended to show suggestions for legislative and administrative action by the new state parliament and the new state government. Saarbrucken, April 2022
