 press release
 
 
On April 14, 2021, the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Monika Grethel, presented the President of the State Parliament, Stephan Toscani, and the Prime Minister, Tobias Hans, with the 7th activity report for the area of freedom of information for the reporting period 2019/2020 and the 29th activity report for the area of data protection for the year 2020. At today's press conference, the two activity reports were presented to the public. The biennial activity report for the area of freedom of information was published separately from the annual report for the area of data protection for the first time. This is also intended to take account of the importance of freedom of information, which is reflected in an increasing number of requests for advice from bodies with a duty to provide information and in complaints from citizens who feel that their right to access information has been violated (Chapter 2). In 2019, the area of activity of freedom of information was primarily shaped by the 37th conference of freedom of information officers, which took place in Saarbr√ºcken under the Saarland presidency. The resolution passed by the conference on the introduction of a mandatory lobby register (Chapter 6) is now opposed to a law introducing a lobby register at the German Bundestag 2). In addition to the obligation to trace contacts, the pandemic-related expansion of home office and the switch to distance learning brought with it considerable challenges and numerous implementation questions (Chapters 2.1. to 2.5.). Beyond the topic of the pandemic, the legislative process for the new regulation of police data processing was accompanied and the criticism of data protection law was taken into account in central points (Chapter 3.5.). Repeated cases of unprovoked and illegal processing of creditworthiness data led to the initiation of fine proceedings in the reporting period (Chapter 3.17). The fact that the desire to siphon off discounts offered to new customers was intended to get electricity and gas customers willing to switch to an entry as a so-called bonus hopper in a specially created industry pool of credit bureaus was met with criticism under data protection law (Chapter 3.16). which can be accessed at: https://www.datenschutz.saarland.dePressekontaktTelephone 0681 94781-24 Fax 0681 94781-29 Email medien@datenschutz.saarland.de
