101st Data Protection Conference - Data protection when using digital services for contact tracing .A central topic of the conference was the use of digital contact tracing systems. Insofar as the federal states oblige catering establishments, cultural institutions and other bodies to process contact and presence data of visitors, customers and guests by ordinance, a large number of providers now offer digital services for contact tracing. Therefore, the DSK has the data protection requirements for such systems and their operation in the "DSK orientation guide for developers and those responsible for the use of digital services for contact tracing on the occasion of event, facility, restaurant and business visits to prevent the spread of Covid-19‚Äù. The DSK emphasizes that in the interaction between the service provider, the body responsible for collecting contact data and the health authority, the spheres of responsibility under data protection law must be clearly defined and the personal data processed in this way must be strictly earmarked. The service provider must also counteract the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons resulting from the scope and sensitivity of the data processed in the context of contact tracing with adequate data security measures. Since the majority of federal states have now decided to enter into contractual agreements with the provider of the "Luca" service, the DSK dealt with this system again in addition to the first preliminary assessment of March 26, 2021. In her statement, she points out that, despite the fundamentally viable conception of the Luca system, further technical protective measures to prevent risks resulting from improper use are to be regarded as necessary. The conference also emphasizes that there should be no obligation to use digital contact tracing systems. In view of the recent functional expansion of the Corona-Warn-App (CWA), the DSK in the resolution "Use chances of the Corona-Warn-App 2.0" raises the with the Use of the CWA associated data-sparing possibilities of cluster detection and contact notification and appeals to the federal states to include the CWA in their concepts for combating pandemics and to promote their use. Against the background of the increasing use of messenger services in the health sector, the statement "Technical Data protection requirements for messenger services in the hospital sector"** passed. With regard to the sensitivity of the data affected in the health sector and their special need for protection, the statement presents the data protection requirements for those responsible when selecting suitable messenger services for the exchange of patient-related information. In addition, the DSK has the joint document "Requirements for data protection certification programs"* passed, which is intended to serve as the basis for uniform application by the data protection supervisory authorities within the framework of the evaluation and examination of corresponding certification programs @datenschutz.saarland.de *) Publication after editorial revision.
