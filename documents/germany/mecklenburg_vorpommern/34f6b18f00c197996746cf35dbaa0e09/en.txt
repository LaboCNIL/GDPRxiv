The state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, Heinz Müller, gave the green light to the planned corona tests in old people's and nursing homes today. “We are in a very special situation at the moment. Health, especially for the most vulnerable members of our society, is hugely important, as is the professionals who have been committed to and caring for these people for weeks. At the same time, personal rights and data protection must not be completely ignored,” said Müller. "For this reason, we immediately and intensively supported the project in order to get it off the ground as quickly as possible," Müller continues. "We can now approve the start of the test series because it is ensured that the tests are voluntary and, above all, that the data protection rights of the nursing staff and residents are protected. Important liability issues have also been clarified, which is of particular benefit to care facilities. However, I am already announcing that we will also look at the concrete implementation of our specifications in practice," concludes Müller. The Ministry of Health in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has concluded an implementation contract with CENTOGENE AG in Rostock. In the project, around 25,000 older people and people in need of care in the care facilities as well as around 15,000 employees are examined.
