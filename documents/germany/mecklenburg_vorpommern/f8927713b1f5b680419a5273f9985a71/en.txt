In the dispute over video surveillance at Schwerin's Marienplatz, the police have now given in and procured new technology. "The police have made it plausible that the recordings are now being encrypted when they are transmitted by radio," says Heinz Müller, state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information. "I therefore assume that my core requirement has been met." He therefore declared his urgent application to the Schwerin administrative court to be settled yesterday.
During a break in the snow, two employees of the state commissioner climbed onto the roofs of the Marienplatz gallery and a high-rise building on the Großer Dreesch and had the police show them the antenna systems. They also inspected the associated IT in the Schwerin police center. "Even if the very last proof has not yet been provided: My employees have the impression that an appropriate level of security for personal data is now guaranteed," said a satisfied Heinz Müller.
Although the state commissioner had banned video surveillance on Marienplatz without additional security measures, it continued unchanged. The only option left to him was to go to court. "This procedure has made it more than clear," says Heinz Müller, "that the state commissioner in the public and non-public area should have the opportunity to enforce his orders, which are binding under European law."
