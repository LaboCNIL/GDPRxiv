"Secret voyeur videos violate the most personal sphere of life and are punishable by law," says Heinz Müller, State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. “The mini cameras apparently used at the 'Monis Rache' festival come in all sorts of versions. They can be hidden in a smoke detector, a pen or even a charger. Recordings from such cameras can basically affect any of us.” Müller warns: “Even if they are available on the free market, mini cameras cannot be operated in compliance with data protection regulations”.
According to media reports, at the "Monis Rache" festival in Tutow (West Pomerania-Greifswald), a man hid cameras in the toilets and filmed the users. After research by the ARD magazine "Strg_F", he later cut the recordings and distributed them on porn platforms. He is said to have earned almost 8,000 euros with this.
After the publication of the report, the Anklam Police Inspectorate officially filed a complaint against an unknown person. The Criminal Police Inspectorate there has now started investigations into suspected commission of criminal offenses pursuant to Sections 184 and 201a of the Criminal Code and Section 23 of the Art Copyright Act. The police are asking people who were at the festival in 2018, who used dixi toilets and could therefore have been affected by this act, to report the incident. That could also happen online at www.polizei.mvnet.de.
The country's top data protection officer takes the matter very seriously. His authority will take all possible measures within its area of responsibility. Initially, however, the procedure lies with the competent public prosecutor's office.
