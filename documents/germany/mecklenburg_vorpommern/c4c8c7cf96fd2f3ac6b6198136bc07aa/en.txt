According to the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the information portal 'Neutrale Schule' of the AfD state association massively interferes with the right to data protection of the teachers concerned. Heinz Müller: “The AfD collects information on the political opinions of teachers in this country without any legal basis. We are therefore considering a ban on the portal.”
Müller's authority has received several complaints against the portal. The political opinions processed there, not only of the teachers but also of the children, are to be classified as particularly sensitive data. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), increased legality requirements apply to the processing of such data. An initial review by the authority revealed that the portal does not meet these requirements.
“From the point of view of my authority, various questions arise. We have therefore asked the AfD to comment at short notice today," says Müller. As the person responsible, the AfD state association must be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. "We will," says Müller, "have the relevant documents presented to us." In addition to a ban on the portal, the imposition of a fine could also be considered. Müller: "The fine framework of the DS-GVO is now well known."
