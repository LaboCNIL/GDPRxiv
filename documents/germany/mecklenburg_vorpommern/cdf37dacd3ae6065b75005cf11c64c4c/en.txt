The portal of the AfD state association "Neutral School" remains offline. Even at the second attempt, the AfD state association cannot overturn the ban on the portal by the state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
Opinions critical of the AfD in the school environment should be reported via the portal. The state data protection officer banned the “neutral school” reporting portal last fall. The AfD state association, on the other hand, took urgent action with the aim of being able to continue operating the portal. The administrative court in Schwerin had already rejected the urgent application. The Higher Administrative Court of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania finally confirmed the decision last week.
Authority head Heinz Müller is happy about the decisions of the two courts: “School is a place for political and democratic education. This includes standing up for the Basic Law and the human dignity guaranteed therein. It must not be that someone feels restricted in their right to speak by such a portal and renounces freedom of expression. It is the task of data protection to safeguard these fundamental rights.”
With the decision of the Higher Administrative Court, a quick restart of the portal is off the table. Heinz Müller is optimistic that the legality of the prohibition order will be finally determined in the main proceedings that are still open.
