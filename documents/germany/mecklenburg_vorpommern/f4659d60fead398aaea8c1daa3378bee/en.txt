The independent federal and state data protection authorities welcome the judgment of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of June 5, 2018, which confirms their longstanding legal opinion.
The judgment of the ECJ on the joint responsibility of Facebook and the operators of a fan page has direct effects on the site operators. These can no longer refer solely to Facebook's responsibility under data protection law, but are jointly responsible for compliance with data protection for the users of their fan page.
