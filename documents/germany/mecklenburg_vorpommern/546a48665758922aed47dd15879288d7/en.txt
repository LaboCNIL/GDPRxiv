The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LfDI MV) has received several complaints about dubious advertising campaigns from a "data protection information center" (DAZ) in the past few days. In its cover letter, the "DAZ" tries to persuade entrepreneurs to purchase their "basic data protection service package" for EUR 498 per year plus sales tax. For this purpose, the "DAZ" refers to the increased verification and documentation requirements for entrepreneurs under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The LfDI MV points out that entrepreneurs as those responsible must prove that they comply with the provisions of the DS-GVO. A contract with the "DAZ" is not required for this. The forms advertised there, for example for the creation of the processing directory, can be downloaded free of charge from www.datenschutz-mv.de. Authorities head Heinz MÃ¼ller: "To me, the 'DAZ' advertising campaign smells like an attempt at fraud. If you have any questions about the GDPR, please just contact us."
