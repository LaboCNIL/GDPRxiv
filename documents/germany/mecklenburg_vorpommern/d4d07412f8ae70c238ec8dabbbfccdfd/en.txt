Karlsruhe tilts SOG M-V
In a press release dated February 1, 2023, the Federal Constitutional Court informed about its decision in Decision 1 BvR 1345/21 that several provisions of the Mecklenburg-Western Pomeranian Police and Ordinance Act (SOG M-V) on police investigative measures are incompatible with the Basic Law. This applies in particular to the regulations on residential and telecommunications surveillance and online searches.
Several citizens had complained about these regulations.
The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania had already commented critically on the SOG M-V during the legislative process. "We are offering to support the state government in the now urgently needed change in the regulations and hope that our advice will now be taken into account after the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court," explains Rolf Hellwig, Deputy State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
