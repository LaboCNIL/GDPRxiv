"We can finally start a new training weekend again," said Christian Thönelt, Managing Director of the State Youth Council M-V and project partner of Medienscouts MV. Due to the corona pandemic, the media scouts MV training had to be paused in the meantime.
The 16th training course of the Medienscouts MV took place from June 18th to 20th, 2021 in the Bischof-Theissing-Haus in Teterow. The young people traveled from all over Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania – e.g. from Schwerin, Bad Doberan, Pasewalk and Mirow.
