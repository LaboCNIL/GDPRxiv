With the aim of updating and re-recording street views and building fronts, Apple vehicles will be driving through Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania again until the end of June. The cars are equipped with several sensors and cameras. The same applies to Google's map service, which runs through Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania until September.
“The street views can be very helpful for orientation in an unfamiliar city. In addition, the companies promise that people and license plates will automatically be made unrecognizable. But the view of the front gardens remains,” says Heinz Müller, State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LfDI M-V). "In this context, I would like to point out the existing possibilities of objection. So if you don't want your own house facade, the front yard or cars parked in front of you to be visible to everyone worldwide, you should actively use your right to object," Heinz Müller continues.
Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data subjects are entitled to information about the type and purpose of the camera recordings and can object to the processing of their personal data. This applies regardless of whether the images are already being used for the look-around/street view feature or whether new images are being taken. An objection is possible at any time.
"To support interested citizens, we are providing a form and necessary links on our website," concludes Heinz Müller.
