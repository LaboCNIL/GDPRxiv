You think this is too boring? Absolutely no way!
An active and self-determined handling of media and data contributes to the formation of democracy and equal opportunities. You think that sounds good? You didn't even know that Landesdatenschutz M-V also deals with media education and media competence?
Then it's about time! At the start of the new FSJ year on September 1, 2019, we are looking for a young person who would like to support the training area of the data protection officer M-V. This includes tasks such as working on the youth project Medienscouts MV and media education in schools in our state, whereby we want to teach children and young people how to use digital technology, apps and applications consciously.
Would you like to be even closer to politics? No problem! You will be able to visit committees on the subject of media/education and will receive your own state parliament ID card, which you can also use to travel independently. However, maintaining the Medienscouts MV homepage and normal administrative tasks are also part of your daily routine. You can get involved everywhere and try out your own ideas!
If you are interested or have any questions, simply send us an email to: antje.kaiser@datenschutz-mv.de
All application forms are available at www.datenschutz-mv.de
Information on remuneration, insurance and all other general conditions as well as the application process for the FSJ Politics/Democracy can be found at: www.ijgd.de
