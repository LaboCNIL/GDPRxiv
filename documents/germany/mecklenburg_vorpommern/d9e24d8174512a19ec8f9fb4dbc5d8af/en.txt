The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information today imposed a ban on video surveillance at Schwerin's Marienplatz in accordance with Article 58 Paragraph 2 Letter f of the European General Data Protection Regulation. The recordings of the eight cameras are transmitted unencrypted by radio to the Schwerin police center. "Adequate security of the data of the citizens is not guaranteed," says Heinz Müller.
"In doing so, the police are not only violating the applicable data protection law, but are also disregarding their own data protection and security requirements that are binding for the state administration," says Müller. "And the police know that, too. In her data protection impact assessment for video surveillance at Marienplatz, she declares data encryption to be a necessary security measure. However, the order I received today to continue video surveillance shows that encryption is not taking place.”
As head of the competent supervisory authority, Müller could not accept this violation of the law. “My job is to monitor and enforce the application of data protection law. And I take this task very seriously.”
