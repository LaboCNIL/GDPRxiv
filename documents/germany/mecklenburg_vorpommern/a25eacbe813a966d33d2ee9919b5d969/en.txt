The data protection conference goes online with its own website. Current resolutions, guidelines and short papers from the data protection conference can be accessed on the central information platform. Here you will also find links to the supervisory authorities and the data protection laws of the federal and state governments. In addition, an RSS feed for subscribing to new content is integrated.
With the application of the General Data Protection Regulation, its interpretation by the data protection supervisory authorities also becomes more important. With its own website, the data protection conference optimizes its range of information.
The homepage can be reached at https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/.
