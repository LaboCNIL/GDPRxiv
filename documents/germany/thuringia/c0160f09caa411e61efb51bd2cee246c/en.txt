© local_doctor

Erfurt, September 24th, 2020: Collecting data to create personality profiles, e.g. B.

when shopping or ordering online, in social networks, in personal blogs or

of contact, health, movement or geodata has been since our last

event in 2017 more and more advanced - customers are insurers,

Employers, unknown third parties with different objectives.

We have reached profiling 2.0! Often it happens without our knowledge.

How does it work? What can you do with it? How do they do it?

 

Where is it in use? For what purposes?

What potential for abuse is behind it?

Do we need AI?

Let us again this time with prominent guests, such as Prof. Dr.

Harald Lesch are looking for the answers to our above questions.

The patron of the event is the President of the Landtag, Ms. Birgit Keller.

Cordial invitation!

 

When: October 5, 2020, 10 a.m. - 4 p.m
