In addition, 115 new fine proceedings were opened in the 2021 reporting year.

A total of 72 fines were issued, more than 70 percent

more than the year before. The total amount of fines imposed is

61,325 euros. That is over 3.5 times more than in 2020. Read the article on this

Number 1.11. In total there were 283 reports of breaches of protection

personal data according to Art. 33 DS-GVO. This is an increase

compared to the previous year by almost 40 percent. For more details on this,

referred to article number 1.2 of the data protection report.

 

You will find a selection of particularly conspicuous cases from the public sector

among other things under index points 2.7: A hunter blows the halali too loudly:

Due to the complaint of a person concerned, the Thuringian State Commissioner for

data protection and freedom of information (TLfDI) in the reporting period

aware that the lower hunting authority of a district within the framework of the

legally required verification of a hunting license

had requested investigation files from the public prosecutor's office. reason for the request

were entries of the hunting license holder in the federal central register. It was for that

after the data protection assessment of the facts by the TLfDI not

required, the complete notification of the pension administration together with the

(specially protected) personal data (name of the complainant,

Enumeration of organic diseases and mental illness) des

complainant to the medical officer. Or the report 2.11: Ein

indomitable village - also falls under the ThürDSG. Because the TLfDI is for them

Municipality is the competent data protection supervisory authority. Then he pulled

Curious?

 

 
In addition:

The Free State of Thuringia has entered into force in 2020 with its Thuringian

Transparency Act (ThürTG) get an extended right to freedom of information

and this should therefore be more progressive than other freedom of information laws.

However, the name and "age" of a law alone are not enough to

Top of the table in Transparency Ranking 2021. Although that was

ThürTG particularly positive in the criteria of information obligations, application and

Freedom of Information Officer assessed. The ThürTG, on the other hand, can be expanded

the proactive publication obligations or the transparency register, which e.g. B. not

required for municipalities. Read about this under 1.2.

Another focus in the reporting period on the ThürTG was the work on the

Implementation of the cost law according to § 15 ThürTG. § 15 paragraph 2 ThürTG authorized

the responsible Thuringian Ministry of the Interior and Municipal Affairs in agreement

with the ministry responsible for finance, the administrative cost facts, the

Fee rates and the amount of expenses for the Thuringian Transparency Act

determine. Even in the second current year after the ThürTG came into force, there was still

no such regulation exists. Rather, this did not occur until September 20th

effective in 2022.

We wish you useful insights into the work of the authority of the

 

TLfDI and many further insights .
