foreword

The year 2020 was primarily characterized by the corona pandemic and its
Effects on social life, on education, training and work.
Our everyday life was sometimes completely turned upside down: the work was suddenly
Sometimes no longer possible or often only “remotely” – i.e. from a distance – possible.
The schools are closed, the day care centers are in emergency operation, most authorities and
other public facilities open at times. Shops – with
with a few exceptions –, restaurants and cultural sites: Closed. And everything
ahead: The sensitive restriction of social contacts. The lockdown triggered a
a real push towards digitization and also put data protection on top of it
tough test. Video conferencing, homeschooling and digital con-
clock tracking became a matter of course almost overnight.
However, the use of data
protection-compliant services and software.

In the first phase, this may seem unexpected and immediate.
it must have been understandable to the social and economic
to sustain life to some extent. The use does not comply with data protection
ter and thus legally inadmissible services must not become permanent.
Digitization, which is often hasty during the pandemic, opens up at the same time
also the chance to become aware of the problems and dangers involved
in order to take remedial action once the most critical phase of the pandemic has been overcome
and intensively on the data protection-compliant design of data processing
to work. Right now we should keep reminding ourselves that
data protection does not serve to prevent digitization, but to

The Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information took part
on the development of a catalog of requirements for mobile applications

To combat the corona pandemic, a number of technical solutions
proposed. These should serve to provide information about the dissemination
of the pandemic, identify people who have been in contact with the sick

A central strategy in limiting the spread of the corona virus
is to find infected people based on their personal contacts and
to prevent the infection from being passed on. It stands to reason that the capabilities of

The first approach was to use data about the location of the devices that

Contact. Of course it would be possible to use a large database
This data includes the whereabouts of a large proportion of the population

this could be done efficiently. And indeed was in some East Asian

From a civic perspective, that's not a good idea. Whoever the data
collects, receives an extremely deep insight into the lives of the people

This results in an immense power over those affected with a huge
potential for abuse. In addition, with this method, the location information
are often not precise enough to really create an epidemiologically relevant

Thankfully, it quickly became apparent that alternative approaches were available that
avoid problems. Smartphones not only receive data, they send it
also. And not just via mobile communications or Wi-Fi, but also with radio

supported by the number of smartphones is called Bluetooth. It serves e.g. B. to

The smartphone therefore regularly retrieves the published pseudonyms and
compares them with the pseudonyms registered with them. If there is a hit,
the respective contact person is warned. Also an estimate for the

However, this often contradicts data protection law. But also with the
offered by European providers, we had to find some extensive shortcomings.
In a constructive exchange with a large number of providers, we were able to
achieve improvements on both a legal and technical level.

41

In principle, those responsible can set up video conferences in two ways-
place:

Firstly, they can operate the necessary information technology themselves –
either by providing the service in-house or by
drove in an external data center. The necessary software is available on the market
and can be adapted by those responsible to their needs.
It should be pointed out that data protection is possible through technology design
is. But only large institutions can afford the necessary expertise
ready.

The second variant consists in hiring a service provider who
does all the work. He inevitably comes up with a variety of personal
related data in touch: data on the conduct of the conference and
the participants, audio and video recordings of the conference itself, possibly
happily also text messages between the parties involved and documents that

coming persons themselves.

Therefore, those responsible must ensure that the data is lawful

common constitutional concerns. In this way, a comparison

significantly reduce the informational self-determination of citizens

The police initially stated that the information in the PKS 2017 was based on the technical information

suspicious to the population group of Sinti and Roma basically takes place

14.1 Developments in the Sanctioning Body

In the third year of the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

regulations. In addition, only very few cases refer to the old one
legal position.

This year we fixed 47 fines totaling EUR 77,250.00

In addition, 38 penalty payment notices were issued.

POLIKS is one of the most important electronic work tools for the police and

The database includes data on suspects, criminals, victims

Unfortunately, some police officers and police officers repeatedly

In one case, a policewoman used POLIKS to find the new girlfriend's ex-girlfriends

In another case, a police officer had the data of all neighbors
queried in their own multi-family house in order to

The Service Center for European Affairs examines all draft decisions on cases
where the BlnBDI has reported as the supervisory authority concerned. The KO-
Operational procedures of the DS-GVO provide that the supervisory authorities concerned
can object to draft resolutions if they
disagree with them. The BlnBDI has already been involved in several cases
made use of this option and raised objections to resolutions
charges filed by other regulators. As a result of such an objection
the lead authority must review the draft decision, e.g. with regard to
an incorrect interpretation of the facts, a lack of action according to the
determination of a data protection violation or an incorrect procedural
che adjustment of the procedure.

than in previous data protection law. This applies in particular to the

Great Britain withdrew at the end of the transition phase on December 31, 2020

processing of complaints in cooperation between the European
Supervisory authorities (cooperation procedures).

18 Duty to inform

data breaches
18.1 Overview and Individual Cases
 
After the sharp increase in data breach reports in 2019
The number of reports in the reporting period remained 1,017 cases at 925 cases359
on a high level.

Two things can be derived from this: on the one hand, the increasing awareness
of those responsible with regard to the lawful handling of data
on the other hand also the fact that altogether too many data breaches
occur, whereby a high number of unreported cases can be assumed.

This time the numerous reports of data breaches in the medical
zinic area. Here it was z. e.g. incorrect sending of diagnostic reports
ments, laboratory findings or X-rays by medical staff, for example because
an incorrect fax number was used. Since health data is about
data that is particularly worthy of protection,360 those responsible usually have it
already informed us in the notification361 that the affected persons
informed about the incident and independently of any legal obligation362
Measures have been taken to avoid such mistakes in the future. To
These measures included B. the introduction of the four-eyes principle
shipping process.

We received a large part of the reports from a nationally active medical
financial billing service. This was mainly about the unauthorized knowledge

However, data breaches were not the fault of the billing service. Much-
more the error lay with the respective service providers who entered the address

could not reach the right addressees from the outset.

The correct handling of such a case of postal undeliverability
would, however, have to be returned to the sending medical service
have to lead. Instead, the invoices were sent by the delivering company
give it to the wrong recipients or put it in their mailbox
thrown. They then have the billing service via the incorrect delivery
informed, often after checking the content of the letter for their own concern
and thus has taken note of sensitive data of the person being treated-
ten. The billing service, for its part, reported the incidents to us and
informed immediately that he himself had informed the persons concerned in each case
or will inform you as soon as he has the correct addresses. This He-
approach is exemplary, because a possible and possibly lengthy dispute
about whether the service provider and/or the delivery company
bears the legal responsibility for the data breach and accordingly
must inform those affected by the breakdown of this, in favor of a

Banks have also increasingly reported data breaches to us for which they are responsible

documents or the unauthorized disclosure of bank account information such as B.

individual banking institutes whether this poses a high risk for those affected
with the result that the bank compellingly informs those affected about the incident
had to notify,364 soon disbanded: in almost all reported
ten cases, the banks have opted for maximum transparency and the
respective data subjects informed about the data breach as a precautionary measure. Also this is
commendable from our point of view.

Overall, those responsible dealt with data breaches appropriately. Where
People work, mistakes happen. For us it is important that and how a missing
ler is "captured" in particular from those affected. This includes
on the one hand, the admission of the person responsible that a
data breach has occurred, and secondly, taking measures to
to avoid such mistakes in the future.

No. 9 speaks of “business confidential information”, which is not further defined;
the protection of trade secrets regulated elsewhere in the draft law
