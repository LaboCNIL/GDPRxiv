Doorbells are not a privacy issue

 

After a Viennese property management announced, bell signs with the names of almost one

removing a quarter of a million tenants is also causing a great deal of excitement in Germany. It

there is a rumor going around that all doorbells in Germany have to be

Basic Ordinance (DS-GVO) to be dismantled and the housing industry have to

Failure to comply may result in the imposition of large fines.

 

We can reassure you: the installation of doorbell signs with names is fundamental

permissible and does not affect any data protection regulations. The GDPR is on

Handling of personal data only applicable if this data is automated

or processed in file systems. Conventional ones meet these requirements

Doorbells don't.

 

As a rule, the residents of a house want their name on

Doorbell for friends, relatives, postal workers, craft businesses, emergency services and

other visitors can be reached. Only on special request

individual residents should not have their names on the doorbell

appear. One should think in particular of stalking victims or prominent persons.

 

Maja Smoltczyk:

"It is annoying that due to incorrect interpretations of the GDPR and thereby

caused fears of the imposition of high fines, the new regulations in

discredited, even though these serve to protect the citizens.”
