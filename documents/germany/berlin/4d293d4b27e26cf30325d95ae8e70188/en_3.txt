Years ago elected Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. I
I'm really looking forward to the new task and I'm grateful to be able to walk this path with high-quality
fied experts at my side. Your tireless and
Committed commitment to data protection and freedom of information forms the basic
situation for this annual report.

We are still waiting for a modern transparency law to be passed
for Berlin. Does the administration proactively provide the information that
are the basis for administrative action and political decisions, enable
it facilitates the timely discussion and comprehensibility of the decisions
gen. Ultimately, the administration itself also benefits from the publication by
Information required by other authorities via a transparency portal on the
receive short official channels. Such a portal requires that administrative information
are available electronically and without media discontinuity from digitized processes
can be provided. Against this background, it is also important that

who is responsible for what. Because people's trust is crucial
for the acceptance of the procedure.

initiate proceedings.

Our job is to protect fundamental rights and to inform people about it.
to benefit from digitization and the use of technology without relying on self-
mood, anonymity, free access to information and opinion-forming, as well as other
time unobserved freedom of development. For the growing up
Generations and thus for the education and school sector, this is of particular importance
Significance: We must enable children and young people to take advantage of this freedom
to obtain in the future. At the same time, they should use digital learning aids and

seniors and also aims to improve the solidarity community

elected at district level. Almost 70,000 seniors experienced this year
in the districts of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Pankow and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf
a surprise: at the beginning of January you received mail from the district of Reinickendorf,
with which they were invited to the local election of the district senior citizens' representation.
Many of those affected could not understand the reasons for this

letter of invitation, even though they lived in a completely different district.

In the course of pursuing the complaints submitted to us, we were able to resolve the case

data protection officer imposed. The company had a privacy
commissioner appointed to independently control decisions that
he himself had met in another capacity. The fine is not yet

Such a conflict of interest existed in the case of a data protection officer of a subsidiary
parent company of an e-commerce group. The person was also business
manager of two service companies, which on behalf of the company

which he himself managed as managing director. There was thus an interest
conflict and consequently a violation of the GDPR.

As a supervisory authority, we therefore initially issued a warning in 2021
against the company. After a re-examination earlier this year,
because the violation persisted despite the warning, we imposed the fine.
When calculating the fine, we took into account the three-digit million turnover
of the e-commerce group in the previous financial year and the role of
Data protection officer as a contact for a large number of employees
and customers. The intentional renaming of the

to replace the Transparency Act.255

This year it was now clear that the corresponding statement in the red-green

was disclosed. The police justified this by saying that by disclosing

document is now more than 16 years old. In this respect, we doubt that the

police fitness

We received a complaint from a citizen of disclosure to the police
Administrative regulation PDV 300 required. This regulates u. the health
 Aptitude test for police service. The police refused to disclose
and justified this with the fact that this could have a negative impact on the
concerns of public safety are to be taken care of.

The police explained that with knowledge of the regulation and existing illnesses
health symptoms could be tried, the symptoms during an examination
to disguise accordingly to contrary to the necessary requirement in the
to enter the police service and to be able to exercise it. In addition, they counted
Documents to protect the official decision-making process according to § 10 Para. 4
IFG: "By publishing them, the internal and inter-authority
process may be affected."

The refusal of access to information cannot be based on Section 10 (4) IFG
become: Because after that is only the discussion, deliberation and consideration, consequently
the actual process of deliberation, protected. On the other hand, the administrative
provision as the basis for forming a decision is not part of the scope of protection of Section 10
Para. 4 IFG. Section 11 IFG was also applied incorrectly. Because there were contrary to that

are to be considered against disclosure are not sufficient: are required
according to the wording of the law, rather "serious" disadvantages for the well-being of the
federal or state. These were definitely not recognizable.

In this case, too, the police did not deal with our arguments-
set and the objection of the citizen against their decision with still

the meaningfulness of our legally standardized advisory authority,283 if our
