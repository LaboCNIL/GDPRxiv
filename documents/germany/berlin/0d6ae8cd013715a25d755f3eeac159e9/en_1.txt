Data protection officer: Google Analytics and similar services only with consent
usable
 
Website operators require the consent of the visitors to their website
Websites, if third-party services are to be integrated into them, where the provider
personal data obtained in this way for its own purposes. This also includes
the product Google Analytics, as the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and
Freedom of information, Maja Smoltczyk, emphasizes.
 
As early as spring, the data protection supervisory authorities published the “Guide for
Providers of telemedia”1 published and worked out in detail under which
conditions tracking of website visitors is permitted.
Nevertheless, the Berlin data protection officer continues to receive a large number of complaints
about websites that disregard the guidance.
 
Analysis tools that pass on data about usage behavior to third parties may then
at least in cases in which these third parties also use the data for their own purposes
use only with consent. The same applies if the behavior of
Website visitors are tracked and recorded in detail
can, for example, when keystrokes, mouse or swipe movements are recorded. as
On the other hand, it can be considered permissible if a website operator
carries out reach detection and counts the number of visitors per
Page that collects devices and language settings, even if a processor does so
done. However, a processor may not use the data for its own purposes
use, as the provider of Google Analytics now reserves the right to do.
 
Maja Smoltczyk:
"When integrating Google Analytics, many website operators refer to old,
long outdated and withdrawn due to ongoing product changes
Publications such as the information for Berlin website operators, the Google Analytics
deploy. The Google Analytics product has been further developed in recent years
that it no longer represents order processing in its current form. Rather concedes
the provider agrees to the right to own the data of the website visitors
purposes to use. The integration of Google Analytics therefore requires a
Consent that meets the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation. Most
of the so-called cookie banners that we see in practice meet the legal requirements
requirements not.

Website operators in Berlin should immediately check their website for third-party content and tracking
check mechanisms. Anyone who uses functions that require consent must
either obtain consent or remove the feature. Consent is only then
effective if the user of the specific data processing is clear and
informed agrees. A so-called cookie banner, which assumes that pure
Continued surfing on the website or similar should mean consent
insufficient. The same applies to pre-checked boxes for declarations of consent. This
Evaluation of the General Data Protection Regulation is clear, and the European Court of Justice
expressly confirmed it in its judgment of October 1, 20192.”
 
What constitutes effective consent is set out in Article 4(11) of the Data Protection
Basic Regulation (GDPR) defined. After that, a "'consent' of the data subject
each voluntarily for the specific case, in an informed manner and unequivocally
given declaration of intent in the form of a declaration or another clear one
affirmative action by which the person concerned indicates that they are with the
processing of the personal data concerning you". To
Recital 32 GDPR are silence, already ticked boxes or
Inactivity on the part of the data subject should therefore not be regarded as consent.
 
Maja Smoltczyk:
“We already have numerous complaints and tips about the impermissible integration
of third-party content. We are examining these and have already had many cases against companies
initiated. This number will increase significantly in the future. website operators
and operators who inadmissibly integrate third-party content not only have to
data protection regulations, but should also take into account that the
DSGVO threatens high fines for such violations.”
