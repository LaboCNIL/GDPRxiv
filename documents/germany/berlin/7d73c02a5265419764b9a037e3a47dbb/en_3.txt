c) Recommendations of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)

on additional protective measures for data exports

As reported last year,12 the EDPB has drawn up recommendations on how

coordinated in detail with the new standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission13
are now available in the final version 2.0.14

The final version essentially only contains clarifications. the one for the public
Consultation provided version 1.0. In particular, the EDPB – in accordance
with the case law of the ECJ – the so-called risk-based approach15 for data exports
again expressly rejected.

Version 2.0 of the recommendations also deals with the case that the legal situation in
third country is unclear.16 In this case, after proper examination, the
Situation revealed that no additional protective measures are required.

assessment to provide further protective measures and not to accept excessive risks,
but to refrain from data processing.

The condition for this is that the data exporter: in a detailed report

also the regulations for order processing and are mandatory in this respect if a

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates that bodies that

The task of a correctional facility is, for example, to enable the prisoners in the future
to lead a life without crime in a socially responsible manner and the general public
to protect against further crimes.116 The enforcement of youth detention should in turn

that he has to answer for the wrongs he has committed.117 The social services

In the event of a positive test result, schools process health
personal data of the students concerned. This sensitive data is subject to a

legal basis exists. Such is contained in the Schools Act (SchulG). It allows
the schools the processing of health data if this is necessary for

The creation of a Berlin transparency law that lives up to its name,

Also because of massive structural deficits in

 meant an increase of 132 percent. A negative image in editing – also:

Here, as in other mediation cases in which we - despite numerous reminders -
ments – no answer was obtained that was satisfactory for the applicants
have, due to a lack of authority to issue orders or sanctions, we were able to the petitioners
unfortunately give no other recommendation than to enforce their decision
to raise a so-called action for failure to act at the administrative court in Berlin.283

To avoid this unsatisfactory situation, we will advocate that
our authority will in future be given the legal authority to remove statutory
to order violations and to be able to demand disclosure of the information.
This increase in competence would underline the importance of transparency of knowledge and
Additionally strengthen the actions of public authorities and our authority if necessary
give more assertiveness.

Incidentally, our authority, which is responsible for freedom of information, is also rightly subject to it
occurs, the IFG. We received 55 applications for file information or file inspection (possibly
by sending copies), an increase of 72% vs. 32 applications in advance
year. The subjects of the application concerned figures on sanctions, reports of data
breakdowns, data protection complaints, test procedures and fine notices.

Access to official information will continue to be granted 22 years after the entry into force of the
IFG in the administrations often only insufficiently implemented. That has to be done urgently
change - and the realization of this should also and especially at management level
to grow.

The Senate Chancellery then informed him as follows: "Since the request is a long one

E-mail addresses are not sufficient. Without the postal address his application would not

We have pointed out to the Senate Chancellery that the petitioner will

a simple email reply will suffice. Other personal data such as
Postal addresses are not required for this short message. Therefore had to first

checked, but nevertheless submitted to the petitioner (insofar as contradictory) as a cost estimate

Fee proposed.284

In addition, we informed the Senate Chancellery that we shared their opinion

postal address that can be delivered must be provided. We also have before
reason that Berlin chaired the conference in question and it consequently

are, but checked for data285 to be protected under the IFG and possibly accordingly
need to be blacked out. The disclosure of the information remaining after

the video conferencing tool Webex as an eLearning tool for teaching in the virtual world
classroom can no longer be used. The Senate administration then informed him

of § 10 para. 4 IFG has not been applied correctly, because the statements in the decision
exhausted themselves in the reproduction of the legal text. Instead, this was the
permanent administrative court rulings on this provision to be taken into account
. This only protects the actual decision-making process, i.e. the
Discussion, deliberation and consideration, and therefore the actual process of the

decision, the application was otherwise rejected, but meanwhile at least
at least with a comprehensible reason.

Such an incorrect application of the IFG, as in the present case
has taken place must not happen again 22 years after the entry into force.

A petitioner submitted three applications to the BVG, with which he received information on the following
the (abbreviated here) questions:

1.

 Application: BVG advertising costs from 2018, 2019 and 2020 and
Expected costs for BVG advertising in 2021

 Application: BVG advertising concept(s) in 2018, 2019 and 2020

3.

 Application: guidelines/specifications/instructions according to which it is checked whether sub-
accept/private individuals/authorities advertising on/in means of transport and on/in
Can/may switch/commission BVG bus stops.

All applications contained the applicant's express request to the BVG that
inform him in advance about the expected administrative expenses and the expected
costs for the file inspection or file information. This request was
not complied with: The BVG provided the requested information and used it
a fee of EUR 10.00 each. The request for payment
abinformation had classified them as an inadmissible condition; because procrastinating
Conditional applications are according to the case law of the Federal Administrative Court
(BVerwG) inadmissible.297 The petitioner therefore turned to us for help.

Although the IFG does not provide for an obligation to inform an applicant about the probable
to be informed of the costs. Nevertheless, an overriding of this express request
of an applicant as unlawful conduct. Because with that
the BVG violated § 242 BGB (performance in good faith), which is
public law applies accordingly. After that, the debtor is obliged to make the payment

The fact that the applications in the present cases are inadmissibly "restricted
dingt” had been made, was an incorrect interpretation of the clear requests
at the expense of the petitioner. The case law cited could also support the view of the BVG

not support, because it was about the return declared under one condition (!)
of a (follow-up) asylum application that was ineffective. The case constellation of the decision of
BVerwG would at best have been comparable with the present constellation
sen if the petitioner declares the withdrawal of the IFG application under the condition
would have a fee imposed on him. But that was not the case: He has
submitted a clear IFG application and clearly separated from this the request for cost
ten advance information expressed.

Since the BVG stuck to its view, we had to inform the petitioner that he
the disputed issue can only be clarified in court.

We re-evaluate failure to comply with an applicant's request
 Advance cost information as breach of trust. The fixing of a (even if only small)

Scriptures have not yet been issued.

We have pointed out in the past that this lack of control
also causes problems in practice. This includes that affected citizens initiate
atives such as the “Neutral School” project initiated by the AfD parliamentary group at the time
confronted with the possibility of control. But this year, too, there were difficulties
ten. This time, an affected person contacted us with the information that
that the plenary and committee service of the Chamber of Deputies in a committee
session to which she was invited to listen, uses a video conferencing system,
that cannot be used legally. Unfortunately, on this point, we found the
no hearing. Because the House of Representatives responded to our cover letter
in particular our limited authority to control.

Even if one considers the use of such a system in the specific
constellation actually excluded from the scope of the BlnDSG
would like to see why the House of Representatives, when using video
conference systems claimed a special role. Rather, it should
set a good example when processing personal data
and thus actively contribute to the protection of fundamental rights.

Since sensitive data is also processed in the business area of the House of Representatives
should be quickly ensured a data protection level corresponding to the DS-GVO
be asked. The House of Representatives as a legislative body has no
undoubtedly a role model. It will be up to the newly elected Parliament to

a "data protection contract" was concluded, into which the knowledge gained was incorporated.

The workshop met with great interest. By the end of the year we will have four Berliners
districts held a total of eight full-day workshops (five hours each) and
achieved with over 160 students. The increasing need for training and accompanying

19.4 Cooperation with the Chamber of Deputies

from Berlin

The committee for communication technology and data protection (KtDat) came in this
Year together eight times and dealt with many topics from the
digitization and data protection. The BlnBDI attended all meetings
taken and comprehensively advised the committee together with their experts.
The digitization of schools,319 electronic contact tracing to pan-
demiekampf320 and the BVG321 mobility apps were some of the special
important items on the committee's agenda. A key issue was also
the data protection-compliant use of digital teaching and learning materials in schools.322 We
in this context we have emphatically advocated that the school
law (SchulG) is modernized with regard to data protection. The mission has
worth it. The reformed SchulG now contains regulations on data protection that are based on
explicit recommendations of our authorities and is therefore one of the modern
ten school laws in Germany.323 The planned new Berlin transparency
gesetz (BlnTranspG)324 was repeatedly put on the KtDat agenda.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies did not succeed in getting it by the end of the 18th legislative
tur period to say goodbye. On the one hand, this is unfortunate, on the other hand, this
circumstance for the newly composed House of Representatives at the same time the chance
to eliminate the serious shortcomings in the most recently submitted draft law and
actually approved a modern transparency law in Berlin during this legislative period
create.

We addressed the public with a total of fourteen press releases.
We have i.a. on the data protection deficits in digital teaching in the
State of Berlin and the disclosure of sensitive data in con-
trolls on buses and trains for beneficiaries of the “berlinpass” criticized. Besides that
we informed the public about new test procedures in the field of international data
transfers of companies and the use of tracking techniques and third party services
towards websites. At the end of her term of office, Maja Smoltczyk, as part of a
seminung, took stock of their more than five years of activity as BlnBDI.

In addition, the management of the authorities and subject specialists answered in dozens
interviews and background discussions, a wide range of questions from A to processing
up to Z like certification. In a joint opinion, Prof. Dr.

comprehensive relaunch of the intranet.

In the coming year, the position in the public relations department, which has been vacant since spring
occupied so that we can then work on new event
formats, print publications and, last but not least, the implementation of our digital
communication strategy can work. This includes i.a. the revision of our
our website and the expansion of our digital information offering.

The central concern is the exchange with politics and the media and in particular with
Citizens to continue to strengthen and so the general awareness of the
to promote data protection and media literacy. Therefore we will
work with civil society actors, scientific institutions, schools
and expand educational institutions. The involvement of multipliers,
new digital event formats and media as well as the introduction of various
Training courses will have a significant impact on our work in the coming year.

In the fourth year of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is evident that
probably the number of entries as well as the reported data breaches on one
maintain a consistently high level. This is especially true when compared to the number of
Cases before the GDPR came into effect. Compared to the previous year, there is an increase
the formal complaints and consultations of those affected as well as those reported
record data breaches.

The presentation of the following chapter is based on the uniform statistical
tic criteria set by the Conference of Independent Data Protection Authorities
of the federal and state governments (DSK). In addition, we come
reporting obligations from the GDPR and the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG)
