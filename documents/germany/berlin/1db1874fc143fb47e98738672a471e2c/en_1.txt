Annual Report 2018

 
 
On the occasion of the publication of its 2018 annual report, the Berlin Commissioner for
Data protection and freedom of information, Maja Smoltczyk,
 
on Thursday March 28, 2019
at 11 o'clock
in the press room of the Berlin House of Representatives (room 190)
 
to a press conference.
 
In the annual report 2018 are the most exciting and important developments in data protection
summarized from the past year:
 
 

 How has the number of complaints changed since the GDPR came into effect

developed?
 

 What does the GDPR mean on specific legal issues: Is advertising without consent

still allowed? Are restaurants allowed to film their guests? And must
Photographers fear fines if they go about their work?

 

 What happened to the pilot project at the Südkreuz train station, in which "intelligent"

video technology was tested?
 

 Should I manage my patient data in an app-based health record?

 

 Were political parties allowed to use Deutsche Post data for their election campaigns?

 

 Are personal data safe in the Berlin police databases

raised up? And why are they stored there at all?
 
 

The Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information is looking forward to
Press conference to report on these and other topics and give you a speech afterwards
and to answer.
