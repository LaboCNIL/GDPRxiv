Drawing lessons from the Corona crisis: Berlin needs digital independence

The Corona crisis has made it clear that, above all, in the public sector

advanced by modern means of communication.
 
The precautionary measures to contain the corona pandemic have in almost all
areas of daily life to restrictions and changes to usual processes
guided. For large parts of the population, this also included extensive work and
Learning from home. This was and is also true for public institutions in the fulfillment

Where the urgency of the measures to be taken currently prevent the protection of
personal data could not be considered to the necessary extent, must therefore

The current situation should also be seen as an opportunity given working methods
to redesign the experience gained during the Corona crisis from scratch
and to use the possibilities of digital technology in a data protection-compliant manner right from the start.
Berlin is on the way to becoming the e-government capital. Which also includes
also the design of the technology required for modern administration

desirable that corresponding services themselves with the help of the respective IT service provider
of the country are operated. Video conferencing services e.g. B. could from the outset
be made privacy compliant so that they are available when needed and immediately
can be used without having to make legal compromises.
