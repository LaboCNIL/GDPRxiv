Introduction Introduction

On May 25, 2018, the motto was "And action, please!".
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
became effective. And despite all prophecies of doom
in a previously quite overheated
public debate that fueled fears
and scandalized alleged pitfalls,
it runs surprisingly smoothly. Of course there are teething problems and
Security in and with the new EU-wide binding data protection law. This
but can in the case of the complete creation of a new legal area on a European
level - and that's what it's all about - still without case law and
practical knowledge shouldn't be any different. Now after almost a
year has passed, everything already appears clearly in a different light.

Despite all the prophecies, the GDPR has learned to walk. This shows
above all due to the enormously high number of complaints that has persisted to this day,
the volume of requests for advice and the number of
ten data breaches.1 Although we were prepared for a considerable amount of extra work,
However, our expectations became clear, especially in the first few weeks after the
entry into force of the GDPR, significantly exceeded. To come in on the tide-
to cope with the calls at least somewhat, we initially set up one
DS-GVO telephone hotline for those seeking advice, through which the most pressing questions
could be answered immediately. And to this day, the

employees stand the test. There is no relief in sight.

It is unmistakable that the new set of rules places greater emphasis on data protection

dismissed by modern development.

Algorithms are increasingly deciding which messages to send
reads which partner you meet or even which partners

of the members of the Conference of Freedom of Information Officers in Germany
country at the suggestion of the freedom of information officers of Berlin, Bremen and
Schleswig-Holstein has formulated requirements in a position paper for
public authorities even more consistently than before to a transparent and
responsible use of algorithms and artificial intelligence

Digitization is taking democracy and the rule of law to an extreme

than ever, given the high pressure to adapt in our rapidly accelerating

we developed a wide variety of educational materials for elementary school children and parents

is to be understood in exactly the same way. It was not approved by the European institutions

1.1 Handling Cross-Border Cases

Authority fundamentally changed. This applies in particular to the processing of

What is new is that we not only receive complaints against Berlin companies and

In principle, you can contact any data protection supervisory authority throughout Europe.

All incoming complaints – but also all cases that we have ex officio
take up - are therefore first checked by us to see whether they are a so-called border
concerning data processing3. This may be the case when the
or the person responsible is established in more than one EU Member State
and the processing takes place in several of these branches. Even if
the person responsible has only one branch in the EU, one

may have. It is therefore sufficient if, for example, the service of a German

If there are indications of cross-border data processing,
all necessary information about the case will be stored in an electronic

The certificate shows

service (object of certification) was certified,

• where you can read about the properties of the object of certification

must ensure at least

• in which framework the certificate is valid,
• when it was issued and for how long it is valid as well
• who carried out the certification.

The certificate shows the compatibility of the object of certification with the
requirements of the GDPR. Certifiable according to the current legal
lage40 are products, processes and services in which personal
gene data are processed.

1.4.2 Procedure of the accreditation process

In the process of accreditation of certification bodies, the
supervisory authorities and the German Accreditation Body (DAkkS) work closely together.41
The DAkkS controls the entire accreditation process and accepts the applications
against, takes over the formal examination steps. The supervisory authorities examine
and approve the certification criteria, check not only the practical
particular the independence of the applicant and her
expertise and decide together with the DAkkS whether accreditation
is granted or not. After a positive decision, they issue the application
issuers have the authority to act as a certification body.

In detail, the accreditation process is as follows:

4.

6.

The actual accreditation procedure is preceded by a program
switches. The program examination deals with the certification criteria
teries (what should the company to be certified after presenting the certification
certification body do?) and the planned procedure of the certification body (how
does the certification body want to determine whether the criteria are met?).

41 art. 43 GDPR, § 39 BDSG

31

The criteria and the accompanying processes together form the certification
gram, hence the name of this phase.

The German supervisory authorities are working on creating the requirements
and procedures for evaluating certification criteria and programs
also close together. This is intended to make it possible to compare accreditation
genes of the individual supervisory authorities can be achieved. Furthermore, a system

This also ensures test transparency.

If a European data protection seal is sought, there is also one

scrap required.42

The actual accreditation process begins with the submission of the accreditation
application to the DAkkS. When reviewing the application, this binds the
competent supervisory authority as authorizing authority in the accreditation
procedure.

The assessment follows the document check. In the course of the appraisal
The responsible supervisory authority checks together with the DAkkS

activity of the certification body through its accompaniment during the auditing of a

If deviations are found in the troll assessment, this can lead to a restriction,
suspension or cancellation of accreditation. This can also
affect certificates that have already been issued.

1.4.3 Observation of the certification and further

development of requirements

The certifications issued by the supervisory authorities are also regular
to be checked.43 The accredited certification bodies inform the
competent supervisory authority for the issuance, extension or revocation
requested certifications.44 Are the requirements for certification
not or no longer fulfilled, the competent supervisory authority can issue the certification
instruct the certification body not to grant or revoke a certification.45

Accreditations are also regularly carried out as part of intermediate examinations
checked. This includes document level and on-site checks.

This means that the supervisory authorities will be permanently involved in the processes of accreditation
dating and certification involved. The requirements for criteria and pro-
programs must be regularly adapted to future developments.
The data protection supervisory authorities have set up a working group for this
who participates in the continuous development of the accreditation process in

With the entry into force of the GDPR, the previous detailed regulations on
Advertising is omitted.49 The GDPR does not contain any special system for the
permissiveness of advertising, therefore, in principle, the general
applicable provisions for the processing of personal data.
It is still the case that advertising is only permitted if either a legal
Legal permission or consent of the person being advertised is available.

The processing of personal data by advertisers can be lawful

or required by third parties and provided that does not affect the interests or fundamental rights

always to ask what is being advertised objectively more reasonable
can or may wisely expect. It is therefore crucial whether the processing
personal data for certain areas of the social sphere typically
wisely accepted or rejected and whether it is reasonable, disadvantages
accept for the right to self-determination.

The advertisers must be able to prove that they have carried out this balancing of interests
actually carried out and that the result is in their favour.
Furthermore, they have to face the interests that are included in the consideration

1.6 The new Berlin Data Protection Act –

Hopefully not the latest

With the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018
the reform process of European data protection law was by no means over
de. Rather, this resulted in an enormous need for adjustment by the federal and
State law, which has not yet been fully completed to this day
is.66 The Berlin data protection law is significantly influenced by the Berlin Data
Protection Act (BlnDSG), which was passed on May 31, 2018 by the Berlin
house of orders was decided. It regulates the conditions under which
the public authorities of the State of Berlin generally process personal data
allowed to process.

In addition to adapting the general Berlin data protection law to the DS-
GVO also became the EU data protection directive for police and police forces with this law
Legal authorities, the so-called JI Directive EU 2016/680, into national law.
This also means that the processing of personal data by the police
and judicial authorities newly regulated. As before, however, the BlnDSG will also
further through various area-specific regulations in various
al laws added.67

Our authority was intensively involved in the legislative process. We have
submitted several written statements and informed us several times in the relevant
speaking committee meetings as well as in the plenary session.

Unfortunately, the result is that the Berlin Data Protection Act affects some
Places the rights of citizens guaranteed in the GDPR curtailed.68 In the
However, strengthening the rights of those affected is a central concern of the
European data protection reform. Affected rights put people in
the position to exercise data protection in a self-determined manner. Based on information
and information, they should be transparent themselves about the personal
worked data can produce. This is a prerequisite for reporting
Cancellations and deletions enforce the accuracy of the stored data
to be able to It is all the more regrettable that the Berlin legislature in this
area has made restrictions that are no longer required by the GDPR
are covered: For example, according to this, rights to information are not only restricted
if the provision of information leads to the prosecution of criminal offenses or the security
security of the country would be endangered, as stipulated by the European regulations.69
Rather, the refusal to provide information should also apply in the case of comparatively insignificant
be permissible in the fine procedures, such as stopping in a no-parking zone.70

In addition, certain decisions about a refusal to provide information
not even passed by the independent data protection supervisory authority
are testable. According to the new Berlin law, this is always the case if
individual members of the Senate refuse to provide information on the grounds that
there is a potential threat to the federal or state governments.71 An over-
verification of the validity of this reasoning is according to the new legal
The Berlin regulation is just as impossible as checking legality
the specific data processing by the data subjects themselves or on their behalf
tend by our authority.

Other powers of the data protection supervisory authority were also granted by the Berliner

Chapter 1 Main points 1 .6 The new Berlin Data Protection Act – hopefully not the latest version

specifically denied the power enshrined in the GDPR to impose fines against
to impose on authorities and other public bodies.72

In the area of the JI Directive, the Berlin legislature has gone even further
and, contrary to the wording of the guideline of our authority,
granted a right of objection.73 If the addressee of a
not comply with the requirement, there is therefore only the possibility of
to appeal to the relevant parliamentary committee, which in turn also
has no legally binding remedy powers. The recording on
the agenda does not have to be short-term, so that a
breach of data protection may persist for a long time without concrete
to be able to intervene. The possibility of bringing about a judicial clarification,
also does not exist. This regulation contradicts the specifications of the JI guidelines
never, which presupposes that the supervisory authority must be able to
to issue legally binding instructions.74 As examples of such effective
Authorizations are given as examples, e.g. B. the power to data processors
instruct processing operations to comply with data protection laws
bring, and the power to impose a temporary or permanent restriction
to impose the processing, including a ban. Contrary to the festival
of the JI Directive,75 according to which the supervisory authority shall apply the
regulations issued under this Directive and their implementing regulations
should monitor and enforce, our authority does not have the
necessary powers to carry out this task effectively.

It remains to be hoped that the BlnDSG will
evaluated in the points we criticized gave way
sert.

When adapting the BlnDSG to the DS-GVO and the JI directive, it has
the legislature missed a courageous signal in the direction of the protection of fundamental rights
to put. The rights of data subjects contained in the GDPR have been
restricts. The powers of the authority responsible for safeguarding these rights
fen is circumcised.

In June 201876, the European Court of Justice ruled that fan page
operators on Facebook together with Facebook for the
processing of personal data of visitors to the fan
page are responsible. The decision is based on the before May 25th
2018 Privacy Policy applicable. But the considerations can be summarized in the
GDPR time transferred since the definition of joint controllers themselves
has not changed. In contrast to the old legal situation, the GDPR provides for the
joint controllers, however, additional requirements in Art. 26 DS-
GMO before. According to this, they are obliged to set out transparently in an agreement
increase who fulfills which obligations under the GDPR. Over and beyond
the agreement must reflect the respective actual functions and relationships

The ECJ confirmed this interpretation in a further decision from the
last year. Shortly after the fan page decision, the court ruled85 that

answer sufficient that the religious community the proclamation activity
organizes, coordinates and encourages members to do so.86

is not far. In a current procedure, the ECJ has to deal with the question of

the European legal regulations have to be adapted. The GDPR contains more than
70 so-called opening clauses for the national legislature, which will continue to exist
allow the processing of personal data in special regulations
to regulate or maintain. For the adjustment of the data protection law
The leading Senate Department for the Interior and Sport has the main administration
called upon to comply with the specialist laws in their area of responsibility
review to see changes in an article law adapting the data protection
right to be included in the GDPR. We were involved in this process
in close contact with some specialist administrations and advised them intensively.

With the Senate Department for Europe and Culture, we were already able to at the end of 2017
the need for change, etc. with regard to the archive law of the state of Berlin
such as the Cultural Data Processing Act, which then send this to the
administration has passed on. We also have the Senate Chancellery regarding

advise order.

We have the Senate Department for Health, Care and Equal Opportunities
special to adapt the Health Services Act, the state health
house law, the Chamber of Health Professions Act and the State Equal Opportunities
legal advice.

For the field of public health services have been missing for many years
the necessary regulations for the processing of personal data, in particular
particularly sensitive health data. Despite intensive exchange with the
permanent authorities on the question of the enactment of a corresponding ordinance

law, the opportunity was taken to fill the previously missing processing

therefore unfortunately only the school law and the health professions chamber law amended
came into force and thus – to a large extent91 in line with the provisions of European law
been adjusted. The parliamentary law stands for all other specialist laws

youth welfare

Since May 25, 2018, youth welfare offices and numerous private
independent organizations of child and youth welfare organized under VAT law
to apply the provisions of the GDPR. In practice there is a high information

We have received numerous requests for participation in information events
reached. We were not able to handle all requests for lectures due to our
meet limited capacities. We focused on that, if possible
to reach many multipliers. With the social pedagogue
Technical Training Institute Berlin-Brandenburg (SFBB), which is responsible for further training
of the pedagogical specialists in the child and youth welfare of both federal states
who is responsible, we have a specialist event on the GDPR in June 2018
carried out in which more than 100 educational professionals took part.145
The aim was to give the participants an initial overview of the effects
of the new European data protection law on the practice of children and
to give assistance and the relationship to the regulations of the social data protection
to light on the right. Due to the high response to the event,
there will be an in-depth specialist conference in spring 2019, in which we will be active again
involved.

In child and youth welfare, even after the GDPR has come into effect
− as before − the area-specific provisions of the social code books146
 apply. While the federal legislature the regulations of the SGB I and

As early as January 2017, the EU Commission submitted a proposal for a

and finally to say goodbye. To date, however, no agreement has been reached in the Council

has not progressed.

In the European Council, the text of the draft regulation in the competent

shows,230 there is still a need for discussion on the legal
requirements for the processing of electronic communications data, for protection

should lead protective supervision. Apparently, a number of Member States are of the opinion
that the regulations must be more closely aligned with the GDPR,

to allow data. This is questionable, as the EU Commission's proposal for
ePrivacy Regulation was designed to use the GDPR for certain data processing
work in the field of electronic communication to supplement, to
and to create specific and prioritized special regulations. This pre-
having is the opposite, if now unspecific permission facts
as well as possibilities for extensive purpose-changing data processing
will create.

In addition, the member states argue about the regulations for the use of
online services and the question of whether the providers of these services
should have the ability to visit their advertising-financed websites for the benefit
to subject users to the condition that they use web tracking

The delays in the Council mean that entry into the trilogue negotiations

also for the companies and organizations for which the hanging

Contrary to what is intended by the EU Commission, the ePrivacy Regulation is
not finished in time.232 This means that the previous data protection
line for electronic communications,233 which are required by the ePrivacy Regulation
should be put into effect first. In relation to the GDPR, therefore
Regulations that the previously applicable data protection directive for electronic com-

to which the person responsible is subject.251

However, the GDPR has indirectly influenced freedom of information in Berlin.
So far, the tasks and powers of the Berlin Commissioner for Information
freedom of information in the IFG by referring to the regulations in the "old" BlnDSG nor-
mated. Since these regulations no longer exist, the reference now goes to
Empty. We have therefore approached the leading Senate Department for
Interior and Sport put forward the required amendment to the IFG and with one
specific proposal suggested that the applicable regulations from the "al-
ten" BlnDSG directly into the IFG. These include in particular
more the right to complain252 and the obligation to support public
places.253

The severing of the powers of the Freedom of Information Commissioners
the BlnDSG is not only for reasons of practicability, but also because
appropriate to the independent importance of freedom of information. For this
also says that the freedom of information officers - unlike the data
protection officers – primarily as arbitration boards and in an advisory capacity
persons submitting the application and the bodies responsible for providing information,
so that the new tasks and powers as data protection officer according to the
DS-GVO not easily transferred to the freedom of information officer
can become.

It remains to be hoped that the corresponding change in the IFG will, if not at short notice,
tig, but then at the latest within the framework of a transparency law
becomes. Because according to the coalition agreement, the IFG should move in the direction of transparency
set to be further developed; a draft - according to the planning of the Senate
Department for Home Affairs and Sport – should be in the House of Representatives in the course of 2019
be introduced. For this purpose and to exchange previous experiences with

In both cases, requests for information were permitted under the IFG.

however, only to the extent that they perform administrative tasks.255 That was undisputed here
the case. However, the opinion was that an IFG application could not be sent by email

expressly standardizes the possibility of submitting an application not only verbally or
in writing, but also electronically.256 On the other hand, the petitioner had the
Statement that the costs may be charged in advance as an inadmissible advance payment
missunderstood. Because this request from AG Wedding was only made just in case
that the petitioner does not have a postal address for the delivery of the fee

The cases were nevertheless an occasion for us to refer to the case law of the Oberver-
verwaltungsgericht Berlin-Brandenburg for advance payment of a fee for the
access to information.257 The OVG had made it clear that in
range of access to information, an official act subject to a fee is only sufficient
depending on the prior payment of the administration fee
may be done. The prerequisite is that there are indications of this
are that without the advance payment, the interests of the budget would be jeopardized. Such
Indications would not already exist if the administrative burden for the

14.1 Developments

The first experiences after the GDPR came into effect on May 25, 2018
confirm that this date is indeed a turning point for data protection
overall and for the supervisory activities of the Berlin commissioners
for data protection and freedom of information (BlnBDI) is to be considered in particular.

The public debate about the new set of rules has both citizens and
Citizens as well as authorities, companies and other institutions for the
Sensitized to the topic of data protection. The handling of personal data
has since become more conscious in many parts of society. The data
processing data subjects are increasingly demanding their data protection rights
the responsible authorities are increasingly realizing that
data protection when introducing new processes or products
must be taken into account from the outset in order to avoid a later technical,
to avoid additional financial and bureaucratic work.

Of course, this development has a significant impact on supervisory
official practice. Due to the immensely increased number of submissions, complaints
and requests for advice that have been sent to the
BlnBDI are addressed, the workload in the entire authority is not
more to deal with. It is far from possible to deal with all inquiries properly
are answered, required tests are hardly feasible.

The situation is particularly problematic when it comes to processing citizen petitions
ben. The number of complaints has increased compared to 2017
nearly quadrupled. Simply because of the large number of (new) incoming complaints
their timely processing is fundamentally at risk. This is critical insofar as
than the clarification, examination and evaluation of complaints
rarely leads to further regulatory action. A timely processing
processing of these processes is therefore important for the supervisory activities of the Bln-
BDI of central and overriding importance.

163

The increase in complaints is mainly due to the fact that
the area of responsibility of the BlnBDI has expanded considerably. Was the
previously only heard for the processing of complaints against Berlin authorities
and companies responsible, the DS-GVO with the so-called market location principle has the
extended to all (national and European) bodies that
offer goods and services to the citizens of Liner or
keep watching. The introduction of the one-stop-shop principle261 requires that
In the case of all incoming complaints, it must first be checked whether a cross-border
continuous reference exists. If this is the case, the BlnBDI, as the lead
authority to inform all supervisory authorities in the EU about the complaint and
to involve all supervisory authorities concerned in the process. Go to one
of the other European supervisory authorities a complaint with cross-border
progressive reference and are thereby the rights of Berlin citizens
and citizens affected, the BlnBDI acts as part of the (European) test procedure
"affected authority".

This leads to complicated, labor-intensive and time-consuming coordination
procedures with the other supervisory authorities, which are also in English
and must be managed under strict deadlines. In order to
to be able to cope, the service center for European affairs was created
fen. Cross-border issues are coordinated via the
electronic internal information system (IMI). The number of
tenuous cases exceeded all expectations. Since the effective date of
In 2018, around 500 cases were entered into IMI under the GDPR. All cases
were checked in the Service Center for European Affairs for a possible

so that the authorities deal with the content of the respective facts

According to the DS-GVO, responsible bodies can use their products and services (free

Appendix It seems important to me at this point to point out once again that
the General Data Protection Regulation was a necessary step to civil rights
in a time of advancing global digitization.

The current technical developments are nothing less than a
change for our society. Digitization has now found its way into almost
maintained all areas of life. Some of it has the potential to transform our lives
facilitate and improve. At the same time, however, these developments
also dangers for our free, democratic society.

The quasi-monopoly positions of large data companies mean that this is not the case

mostly completely non-transparent, although they have a significant impact on the

The General Data Protection Regulation is an important first step towards

People benefit from the advantages of digitization and they do it carefree
can enjoy, we must counteract undesirable developments. This is for
one the task of the supervisory authorities, which urgently need better
equipment in order to be able to fulfill these tasks. On the other hand
but also politicians more than ever in demand, courageous answers to the big questions
found in our time; there is a considerable need for regulation.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would therefore like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome you
You appeal to your opportunities as elected parliamentarians
mentarians and to work to ensure that necessary regulatory
steps are taken.

The fact that today a Federal Council initiative to combat identity
crime is on the agenda is a good step in that direction.

Appendix But there are many more points where something needs to be done. That's the way it is
urgently required that the European e-privacy regulation finally be
who will also protect people on digital messenger services
should expand. Changes in competition law need to be discussed
and the taxation of digital companies. And urgently need solutions
can be found for the transparency of algorithms. – By the way, this is not
only an issue of data protection, but also of freedom of information. Only in-
informed citizens can make sovereign decisions. And
sufficient information is also a basic requirement for that
such a fundamentally important trust that citizens have in the state.

In an increasingly complex digitized world, in a time of
uncertainty also ensure that alternatives to the offers

that creates independence and that creates freedom for the development of the
local economy.

We should all see data protection and freedom of information as an opportunity
to bring our democratic and liberal values safely into the future

work actively and constructively on new solutions!

Thanks very much!
