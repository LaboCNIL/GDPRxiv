The Ministry of Justice and for Europe and Consumer Protection and the Brandenburg State Commissioner for Data Protection and the Right to Access Files would like to use the Safer Internet Day as an opportunity to come together as actors on the subject of "On the Internet? With security!" to inform. The campaign is also supported by the consumer advice center in Brandenburg.

Background: The Safer Internet Day 2019 is an annual global day of action for more safety on the Internet, initiated by the European Union. This year it is taking place under the motto "Safer Internet Day 2019 - Together for a better internet". Here, different actors are committed to online security and a better Internet for children and young people. Globally, this day is coordinated by the European Insafe network as part of the European Commission's CEF Telecom programme. In Germany, klicksafe.de coordinates the day of action and encourages people to get involved with their own actions.
