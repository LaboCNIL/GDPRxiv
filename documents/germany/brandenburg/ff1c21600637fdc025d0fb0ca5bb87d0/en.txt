Practical information on the right to inspect files in Brandenburg
- Published on 01/11/2023 - press release 01/2023




The state commissioner published its extensively revised and updated application instructions for the File Inspection and Information Access Act today. The implementation of its regulations in everyday practice still raises difficulties. Sometimes there are complicated legal issues to be decided in connection with the area of application, with personal data or trade and business secrets, with the secrecy of advice or with processing deadlines and costs.
The brochure is intended to make it easier for public bodies to handle the File Inspection and Information Access Act and to help applicants to assess the chances of success of their information requests. All information is based on experience that we have gained in specific cases since the law came into force in 1998. The brochure is available on our website; we will also send them to you free of charge as a printed brochure. Dagmar Hartge:

My recommendations for the implementation of the file inspection and information access law clearly show that this requires a fundamental amendment. The aim should be to create a modern transparency law. A reduction and simplification of the numerous exceptions is also required.

Anyone who has questions about the fundamental right to access information or believes that the inspection of files was processed by a public body in an inadmissible manner can contact the state commissioner at any time.
