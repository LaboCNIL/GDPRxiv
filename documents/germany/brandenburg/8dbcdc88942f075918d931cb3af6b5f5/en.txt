- Published on April 13, 2023 - press release 03/2023




The state commissioner for data protection and the right to inspect files, Dagmar Hartge,
Monday 17 April 2023
presented its current activity report on data protection for 2022 at a press conference.
First, Ms. Hartge hands over the report to the President of the Brandenburg State Parliament, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Liedtke. At 10:45 a.m. there will be the opportunity to take pictures in the lobby of the Brandenburg state parliament. The subsequent press conference will take place at 11:00 a.m. in room E.060.
The report presents the most important topics that our authority has dealt with in the past year in the field of data protection. The focus is on the state government's Facebook fan pages, cookies and tracking on the Internet and the use of the Microsoft 365 online service. Once again, we had to deal with various cases of video surveillance. Hacker attacks, fishing controls using private smartphones, a hospital's online baby gallery and the publication of data from members of a fishing club are also discussed. The activity report also contains an article on random checks of car dealerships and the support of police projects. Ms. Hartge will also provide information about the sanctions and fines imposed by her authority in 2022. She is then available to answer any questions.
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend.
