Digital contact tracing: put an end to paperwork in accordance with data protection regulations!





The Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Integration and Consumer Protection recently announced that Brandenburg is also signing a contract with other states to use the Luca app. By the end of April, all rural districts and urban districts could use this culture4life GmbH application for digital contact tracing. Until now, customers, guests or event participants had to write down their contact details on slips of paper by hand. The use of digital instruments represents a significant improvement: Customers only have to briefly show a code on their smartphone, companies save themselves having to keep the time-consuming contact records and the health authorities are relieved by the fast transmission in cases of infection. Dagmar Hartge:
Applications for digital contact tracing can significantly support the containment of the corona pandemic. From the point of view of data protection, their use is to be welcomed in principle, for example, a timely deletion can be guaranteed in an uncomplicated manner. However, this presupposes that both the operators of the systems themselves, the health administrations and the companies and facilities in which the contacts are recorded meet the data protection requirements.
The conference of independent federal and state data protection authorities summarized these requirements in a statement. In particular, it recommends that the data collected be stored as decentrally as possible and that it is encrypted and managed securely. She also considers it necessary to prove and document compliance with the central security measures. The conference calls on the company to make appropriate adjustments to the Luca app. The paper is available on our website. In view of the dynamic development, this is initially only a snapshot.
The responsible Berlin data protection supervisory authority is currently in talks with the operator of the Luca app to ensure that the application is designed in accordance with data protection regulations. However, the use of the app on site also requires a clear distribution of data protection responsibility between the numerous agencies involved and proof of the security of the process. Therefore, the state representative asked the Brandenburg Ministry of Health for more information on its plans; because the following also applies to digital contact tracing: Success in fighting the pandemic and trust in the observance of data protection rights go hand in hand.
The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments is currently developing a comprehensive guide for providers of contact tracing apps.
