Invitation to the press conference on May 23, 2022 - Presentation of the activity report for inspection of files 2020/2021





The state commissioner for data protection and the right to inspect files, Dagmar Hartge,
Monday, May 23, 2022
present its current activity report for inspection of files for the years 2020/2021.
First, Ms. Hartge hands over the report to the President of the Brandenburg State Parliament, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Liedtke. There is an opportunity to take pictures at 9:45 a.m. in the lobby of the Brandenburg state parliament.
The subsequent press conference will take place at 10:00 a.m. in the Brandenburg state parliament (room E.060, with live stream).
In the report, which covers two calendar years, the focus is on the complaints – i.e. cases in which the state commissioner has identified legal violations that the respective authorities have not remedied in the course of the complaints procedure. We also list a whole range of other examples in the report in which authorities wrongly granted incomplete or denied access to information. During the press conference, Ms. Hartge will present a selection from them. Specifically, it will be about a dispute about the blacking out of meeting minutes of a public municipal council, about the donation practice of a savings bank and about an unsuccessful answer to questions about a construction project. Two other cases will show the need for transparency in connection with measures to contain the corona pandemic. Afterwards, Ms. Hartge will be happy to answer any questions.
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend. It is recommended to wear an FFP2 mask in the state parliament building.
