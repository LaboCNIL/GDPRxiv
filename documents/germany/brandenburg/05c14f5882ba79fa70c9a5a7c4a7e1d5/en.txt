Invitation to the press conference on April 9, 2019 - presentation of the activity report on data protection 2018





The state commissioner for data protection and the right to inspect files, Dagmar Hartge,
Tuesday, April 9, 2019 at 9:30 a.m
in the Brandenburg state parliament
press conference room (room E.060 a/b),
Alter Markt 1, 14467 Potsdam
presents its current activity report on data protection for 2018.
At the beginning of the press conference, Ms. Hartge hands over the activity report to the President of the State Parliament, Ms. Britta Stark. She then goes into the main topics of her activity report.
For us, the past year was dominated by the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation – probably the most important focus of the report. The associated changes for companies, administrations, associations and last but not least for the authority of the state representatives themselves took up a large part of our work.
In addition, Ms. Hartge will discuss questions about the admissibility of Facebook fan pages and the use of WhatsApp for business purposes. She also explains her position on the amendment of the Brandenburg Police Act and presents interesting cases in which the data protection supervisory authority had to take measures to ensure data protection last year. Afterwards, Ms. Hartge will be happy to answer any questions.
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend.
