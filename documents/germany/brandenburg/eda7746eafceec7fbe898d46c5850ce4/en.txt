Invitation to the press conference on May 9, 2022 - presentation of the activity report on data protection 2021





The state commissioner for data protection and the right to inspect files, Dagmar Hartge,
Monday, May 9, 2022
presented its current activity report on data protection for 2021 at a press conference.
First, Ms. Hartge hands over the report to the President of the Brandenburg State Parliament, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Liedtke. At 11:15 a.m. there will be the opportunity to take pictures in the lobby of the Brandenburg state parliament.
The subsequent press conference will take place at 11:30 a.m. in the Brandenburg state parliament (room E.060, with live stream).
The report presents the main issues that our authority has dealt with in the past year in the field of data protection. The focus is on information technology aspects of data protection. The example of the implementation of the online access law shows the challenges for a data protection-compliant offer of digital administrative services. We also kept busy with the SORMAS software intended to support the health authorities and the Luca system used for contact tracing. First results of an examination of advertising tracking on websites are presented as well as some examples from the numerous reports of data protection violations. Finally, Ms. Hartge will provide information on the sanctions and fines imposed by her authority in 2021. She is then available to answer any questions.
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend. It is recommended to wear an FFP2 mask in the state parliament building.
