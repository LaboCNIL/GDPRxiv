Press Invitation: Freedom of Information and Journalism – an Effective Research Tool?





On October 28, 2019, the State Commissioner for the Right to Access Files will host the International Symposium
"Freedom of information and journalism - an effective research tool?"
It takes place between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. in the BlauArt Conference Center, Werderscher Damm 8, 14471 Potsdam.
Media representatives are cordially invited to report and participate. The attached program can also be found on our website.
In addition to the right to information under press law, journalists are increasingly using the freedom of information laws – especially for long-term, investigative projects. In an international comparison, however, this happens in very different ways. On which factors does the success of journalistic research based on freedom of information law depend?
During the international symposium, experts from the European Union, Ireland, North Macedonia, Hungary, Austria and Germany offer insights into their experiences. In addition to the classic freedom of information based on applications, open data and data journalism will also be a topic. The symposium will be held in German and English with simultaneous translation.
The state representative, Dagmar Hartge, will be available for talks with media representatives during the conference.
We look forward to your participation and ask that you register for organizational reasons.
