Delete Corona contact records now at the latest!





In the past two years, numerous facilities and businesses have had to collect the names and contact details of their guests, customers or visitors. If one of these people was infected with the corona virus, the data had to be passed on to the health authorities so that they could trace the contacts of those affected and thus limit the spread of the corona virus. This affected, for example, restaurants, leisure and sports facilities, events or churches and religious communities.
Since the state government’s second SARS-CoV-2 containment ordinance was amended on February 8, 2022, the obligation to collect contact data has largely ceased to exist. Dagmar Hartge:
I would like to take the end of the contact data collection as an opportunity to point out that the contact records must be destroyed or deleted after a four-week retention period in accordance with data protection regulations. This regulation is not new. After March 8, 2022 at the latest, however, no personal data may be available at all - with a few exceptions. Restaurants, cafes and leisure facilities are urged to act now.
Only in hospitals, in prevention and rehabilitation facilities and in nursing homes is the obligation to collect contact data. The four-week period continues to apply here, i. H. the data must be destroyed or deleted four weeks after they have been collected. The deadline applies to each individual data record.
Disposal is data protection compliant if the contact records are completely and irrevocably destroyed or deleted. A suitable shredder should be used for data collected in paper form. A single tear is not enough. Data that was collected in electronic form must be deleted in such a way that it cannot be restored, unless the respective system already provides for automatic deletion after four weeks.
