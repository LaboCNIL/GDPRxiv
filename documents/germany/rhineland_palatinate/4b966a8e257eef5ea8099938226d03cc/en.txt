Light on data protection 2022Every year, very special rituals ring in the Christmas season. For many, this includes opening a door in the advent calendar every day. From December 1, 2022, the virtual advent calendar of the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information Rhineland-Palatinate (LfDI) will once again throw 24 Christmas highlights on data protection, freedom of information and the work of the LfDI digital door hides a Christmas data protection or transparency theme. Whether video surveillance at Christmas markets, gaming apps for children, baking recipes for websites, freedom of information for Santa Claus or much more, there should be at least one interesting topic for everyone. The contributions are also presented in a variety of forms, from Christmas poems to crossword puzzles, videos and podcast episodes to self-produced LfDI comics. The Advent calendar of the LfDI not only makes children's eyes light up! Dieter Kugelman. “The advance of digitization did not stop during the pandemic, quite the opposite. In some areas, digitization has even been significantly accelerated. Just think of home office, home schooling and video conferencing. And even apart from Corona measures, more and more personal data is still being processed, from digital consumption to administrative systems. One of the tasks of my authority is to draw attention to these issues and to bring the legitimate concerns of data protection to the fore for our citizens. Our advent calendar is a tried-and-tested tool for this and, in our experience, also a popular one.”To the advent calendarThis press release as a PDF
