                            mattthewafflecat / pixabay.comIn connection with the general measures to combat the corona pandemic, the Rhineland-Palatinate State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI) has also taken precautions to restrict social contacts and reduce the risk of infection.
This can lead to restrictions in accessibility and delays in the processing of transactions in the LfDI authority. Citizens and those responsible can continue to contact the state representative via the online services on the LfDI website or by email to poststelle(at)datenschutz.rlp.de.
In view of the restrictions on public life and the impairment of processes in business and administration, the state commissioner will handle deadlines for those responsible appropriately, taking into account the circumstances, as part of his supervisory and control activities. This also applies to the imposition and assessment of any penalties or fines.
