                            geralt / pixabay.com The current incident, in which public figures were victims of the unauthorized publication of personal data, has once again highlighted the vulnerability in digital areas of life. Data is often transmitted and stored in a way that is sometimes difficult to control, which makes it difficult for those affected to keep track of and effectively control their data. In the present case, the type of data leads to the conclusion that these are at least partly electronic address books , social media accounts and cloud services to which unauthorized access was possible due to compromised access. Other information was available on the Internet and was gradually compiled. "The risk of being affected by such processes can be significantly reduced by conscious and careful use of digital services and a number of simple measures," says the state data protection officer and Freedom of Information, Prof. Dr. Dieter Kugelman. “Many problems can be avoided by selecting suitable providers and services, careful handling of passwords and careful use of social networks. We have therefore summarized the possibilities that users have to improve the security and confidentiality of their data easily and without great effort in a handout.”• Recommendations of the LfDI Rhineland-Palatinate for the use of online and social media Services• Self-Privacy on the Internet
