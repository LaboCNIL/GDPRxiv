                            LfDIAs in previous years, the speakers from the Rhineland-Palatinate data protection officer (LfDI) will explain the dangers of using the internet to schoolchildren on today's day of action.
Safer Internet Day was launched in 2004 on the initiative of the European Commission and brings together activities that promote more online safety for children and young people. In Germany, this day is coordinated by the EU initiative Klicksafe. Under the motto “Idols on the Net. Influencers & Opinion Power” this year focuses on the influence of influencers on opinion-forming.
The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Prof. Dr. Dieter Kugelmann, on this: “For the formation of political opinions, it is important to recognize the connections between manipulative data processing. At least since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it has become clear that data is not only used for targeted advertising; personal data is also used for the political manipulation of users via so-called influencers. Young voters in particular must be made familiar with these mechanisms.”
These and other topics are taught today by the LfDI workshop instructor, for example at the Max-von-Laue-Gymnasium in Koblenz in the 5th grade.
