                                Debate on vaccination card picks up speed - data protectionists call for federal lawIn Europe, the debate on the so-called "vaccination card" is picking up speed. It is being discussed, for example, whether and to what extent a visit to a restaurant or a concert can be made dependent on visitors being able to prove that they have had an anti-corona vaccination or have survived an infection. The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments ( Data protection conference) has now published a resolution on this. From the point of view of data protection officers, the federal government should present a temporary federal law related to the specific pandemic situation.
The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI) Rhineland-Palatinate, Professor Dieter Kugelmann, says: â€œWhether people have been vaccinated or whether they have already survived a Covid 19 infection is particularly sensitive information must be handled with care and it must be legally secured in which contexts the data may be disclosed, processed and stored. The greatest clarity is when a corresponding law is passed at federal level informed consent should be avoided."
The decision of the data protection conference (DSK) therefore states: "In order to avoid this and to achieve legal clarity, legal certainty and a uniform solution for data collection and processing in the private sector, the DSK believes that there is a need for a specific pandemic situation, temporary legal regulation. This must regulate clearly and transparently who, by whom and under what conditions may use vaccination data, test results, evidence of a survived infection and other health data in the private sector. The law must meet the strict requirements of Article 9 paragraph 2 DSGVO are sufficient. The DSK calls on the legislator to initiate a corresponding legislative procedure in the short term."Resolution of the conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments of March 29th, 2021
