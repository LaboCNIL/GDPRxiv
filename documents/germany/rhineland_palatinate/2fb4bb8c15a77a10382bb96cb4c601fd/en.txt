                                Press Release "Best of Freedom of Information" 2018More and more citizens are taking advantage of the opportunity to access information. This is also reflected in the number of requests for advice and complaints lodged with the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in Rhineland-Palatinate (LfDI): This rose again to a total of 180 in 2018 compared to 140 in 2017, with these numbers numerous telephone consultations have not yet been taken into account. Rhineland-Palatinate is thus at the top of the federal states when it comes to the work of the LfDI. In 2018, the LfDI increasingly made use of its supervisory powers in the area of freedom of information: In three cases, it threatened objections and in two cases it expressed objections. In no previous year had the LfDI made use of this "sharpest sword" of its freedom of information powers. The LfDI also carried out local determinations in the area of freedom of information for the first time: Due to the suspicion of violations of the state transparency law, two employees inspected numerous files in the offices of the Rhein-Lahn district and checked them for violations of the right to freedom of information LfDI can again report on many exciting and interesting cases this year: For example, on the first local finding in the area of freedom of information in Rhineland-Palatinate, an application for UFO action plans or an information request to the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
