                                Data protection conference publishes FAQs on Facebook fan pages At its meeting on June 22, 2022, the conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments (DSK) approved a list of frequently asked data protection questions and the associated answers (FAQ) on Facebook fan pages. The DSK answered among other things, why the operation of Facebook fan pages is problematic under data protection law and why those responsible cannot guarantee the data protection-compliant operation of a Facebook fan page in the current situation. In the FAQ, the DSK also points out that similar aspects also apply to other social networks and platforms. So far, however, there has only been relevant case law on Facebook fan pages. The DSK emphasizes that the supervisory authorities are not concerned with a general ban on Facebook fan pages, but with legally compliant operation. However, this cannot currently be guaranteed without changes in data processing by Facebook and its parent company Meta. The DSK has presented the legal problems involved in operating a Facebook fan page in detail in a short report. With its answers, the DSK is reacting to the great interest in information on legally compliant action when using social media offers. At the same time, supervised bodies should be informed quickly and comprehensibly about the common legal opinion of the data protection supervisory authorities.
