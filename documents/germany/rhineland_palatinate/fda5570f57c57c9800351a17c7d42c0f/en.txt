                                37th Conference of the Freedom of Information Officers in Germany (IFK) in Saarbrücken On June 12, 2019, the 37th Conference of the Freedom of Information Officers in Germany (IFK) met. The conference aims to promote the right of access to official information and to advocate for the further development of freedom of information. At the 37th conference, the IFK dealt, among other things, with the challenges of digital change for administration. Against this background, she recommended that the public authorities of the federal and state governments incorporate the requirements for freedom of information into the design of their IT systems and organizational processes right from the start: "Freedom of information by design". The legislators are called upon to create the legal basis and to make the necessary resources available. In addition, the conference calls for transparency in the context of political decision-making processes. In order to achieve this goal, the IFK calls on the federal and state legislators to adopt a legal framework for the introduction of a mandatory lobby register. Dieter Kugelmann states: “The digital change opens up new possibilities for the administration, but also poses great challenges. Against this background, I welcome the fact that our position paper "Freedom of Information by Design" shows framework conditions and describes measures with the aim of achieving transparency in public administration even in the digital age."
