                            Landtag RLPThe Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate has elected Professor Dieter Kugelmann as state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information for a further eight years with a large majority. Since October 1, 2015, the legal scholar has headed the highest data protection authority in Rhineland-Palatinate, which also ensures free access to official information and environmental information Rhineland-Palatinate Parliament for the trust they have placed in me. I will continue to try to live up to this trust by striving to implement constructive data protection in dialogue. Increasing digitization, digital networking in business, administration and society, as well as the new challenges associated with the use of artificial intelligence and digital services and markets in cross-border data traffic, mean that more and more personal data is being processed be processed with greater intensity by administration and business. As great as the benefits of these new digital opportunities may be, it is also important to protect the freedoms of the individual and to monitor compliance with data protection by public and non-public bodies. Because only those who can decide for themselves which data about them will be disclosed can effectively exercise their rights in a democracy. In the coming years, the striving for digital sovereignty for the Rhineland-Palatinate administration and thus for a certain autonomy in the fulfillment of public tasks will be at the center of my interest. It is also part of the essence of our democracy to make state decisions and their basis transparent and to grant citizens access to official information. To effectively protect the basic right to informational self-determination and the right to freedom of information, I will continue to carry out these tasks together with my team in the future!"
