                                LfDI RLP During the event, the effects of a state information monopoly and how this is deliberately used to provide false information in conflicts/wars were examined in more detail. Against this background, it was also discussed how freedom of information can prevent targeted false information. Professor Dieter Kugelmann discussed the topics presented with participants from the fields of politics, science and journalism. The event was opened by a keynote speech by Dr. Elizaveta Gaufman (assistant professor of Russian discourse and politics at the University of Groningen). Miss Dr. Gaufman explained how information warfare works and explained how state disinformation works through the use of social media in the Ukraine war. This was followed by a discussion with Dr. Gaufman, the member of the Bundestag Tabea Rößner (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, chairwoman of the Committee for Digital Affairs), the journalist Christian Semm (ZDF correspondent from Russia) and Professor Kugelmann. The participants discussed, among other things, how disinformation works in the age of mass media and how this can be counteracted, among other things, by independent public reporting and media competence in the population. The event was moderated by Ralph Szepanski (moderator for ZDF). More information on freedom of information can be found in the "Freedom of Information" section.
