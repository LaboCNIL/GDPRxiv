Online workshop on access to environmental informationOn March 21, 2023, the LfDI held an online workshop on access to environmental information. During the workshop, an employee of the LfDI explained which special features have to be taken into account in the application process for environmental information and how their proactive publication is checked. In addition, he repeated the basics of information access under the State Transparency Act with the participants. Due to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information, different rules apply to freedom of information requests and proactive publication, depending on whether the information is official or environmental. Approximately 50 people took part in the workshop . Most of the participants work for public authorities in Rhineland-Palatinate and are therefore themselves confronted with incoming freedom of information requests and the obligation to proactively publish.Prof. Kugelmann emphasizes: â€œThe importance of access to environmental information is still underestimated. They are part of the State Transparency Act, but special regulations apply that may not always be noticed in day-to-day business. I therefore see it as my task to remind people of the relevant requirements and obligations. Because transparency can make a contribution to climate protection and sustainability
