                                Incorrect dispatch of patient-related documents is widespread nationwideAccording to a contribution published yesterday by the NDR, it was proven that the incorrect dispatch of patient data by healthcare facilities is widespread nationwide. The background is research by the NDR at the state data protection supervisory authorities in Germany. It was found that such abuses can be observed in all areas of healthcare, i.e. in hospitals as well as medical practices or billing offices. In view of the high need for protection of the erroneously sent data, this means a particularly serious encroachment on the fundamental right to informational self-determination for the affected patients.

In Rhineland-Palatinate, too, since the EU General Data Protection Regulation came into effect, healthcare facilities have frequently reported incorrect transmissions of patient-related documents to the state data protection officer. With the state-level initiative "Treated well with security", in which the LfDI, the Rhineland-Palatinate Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the State Medical Association and the State Psychotherapist Association are involved, the practice owners are to be supported in the implementation of the data protection requirements. The state representative, Prof. Dr. Kugelmann, comments today on the results of the NDR research: "The uncovered grievances are worrying from the patient's point of view. Even if individual incidents due to human error can unfortunately never be completely ruled out, the facilities involved in the treatment must make every effort to protect patient data effectively. If there is a lack of the necessary care and attention, I will take appropriate measures and will not shy away from imposing fines."
