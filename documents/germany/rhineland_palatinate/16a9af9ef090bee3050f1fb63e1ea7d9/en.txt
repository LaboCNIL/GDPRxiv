                                10 years of data protection student workshops - Kugelmann: Every child and young person should have a certain basic knowledge of data protection Exactly ten years ago, on September 22, 2010, the first data protection student workshop of the state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information ( LfDI) has been carried out. Since then, freelancers have informed schoolchildren in questions of digital self-data protection in 4,728 workshops. The aim of the project is to sensitize young people to safer handling of data on the Internet and to protect them from dangers. The state data protection officer, Professor Dieter Kugelmann, emphasizes: “The student workshops have become an integral part of media competence training in the state. Around 125,000 schoolchildren have now been reached. The 5000th workshop will take place next year. Teaching media skills has a long tradition in Rhineland-Palatinate. The workshops make an important contribution to teaching schoolchildren digital sovereignty and turning them into enlightened onliners. The more information is collected and stored, the more important it is to handle your own data responsibly. In the information age, every student should have some basic knowledge of data protection.”
In the first few years, around 300 workshops per year were requested and carried out, the number has now risen to over 500. In order to be able to carry out this number of events, the LfDI has specially trained a team of around 20 speakers. These receive pedagogical, legal and technical training in regular training courses.
The workshops can take place free of charge for the schools because they are largely funded by the Rhineland-Palatinate Ministry of Consumer Protection. The ministry is making around 100,000 euros available in 2020 and 2021 alone. The LfDI also contributes to financing the workshops with its own budget. Politicians took the opportunity to discuss internet use with the schoolchildren at special anniversary workshops: Prime Minister Malu Dreyer was a guest at a workshop in Trier in 2014 and exchanged ideas with a class about digital education.
The workshops were initially only offered in secondary schools, but were later expanded to include elementary schools. Workshops were also held in juvenile detention centers and family education institutions. Parents' evenings are now also being offered in day-care centers to raise awareness of data protection among parents of small children.
The student workshops deal with topics such as data protection as a civil right, business models of social networks, self-data protection, smartphones and apps as well as current data protection policy issues. In order to be able to convey this content in an age- and target-group-appropriate way, the LfDI employed pedagogical specialists and created a separate position for this purpose. All pedagogical concepts were published as free learning media (OER) and are therefore also available to teachers, for example for a substitute lesson. The central platform for knowledge transfer is the joint youth website of the federal and state data protection authorities and the canton of Zurich www.youngdata.de, which is hosted and edited by the LfDI.
While Rhineland-Palatinate was a pioneer with the idea of data protection workshops for schools in 2010, other states such as Saarland are now also offering workshops for the young target group. In terms of content, the topics are constantly adapted to new developments. For example, while only a few students had smartphones ten years ago, they have now become the main medium of communication and information. Accordingly, the workshops now deal a lot with mobile phone use and apps. The issue of "right to one's own picture" has become a much bigger problem in schools due to mobile phones, which is why the LfDI recently published an explanatory video and its own flyer.
In the last half of the school year, during the Corona pandemic, many workshops had to be postponed; some took place in smaller groups in parallel or one after the other. With the start of the new school year, the face-to-face workshops have started again. Schools can still apply for new workshops. For the future, the LfDI is working on a concept for "workshops in homeschooling" and corresponding online modules will be created.
