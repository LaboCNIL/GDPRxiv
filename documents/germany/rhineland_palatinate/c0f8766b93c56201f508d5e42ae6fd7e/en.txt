                                Information sheet and webinar on the application for access to information Although Rhineland-Palatinate has had legal regulations on freedom of information for ten years, the practical implementation by the administration and the processing of applications for access to information often lead to questions that need to be clarified. According to the findings of the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, requests for access to information are often not recognized as such and for this reason are not processed or decided in accordance with the legal requirements.
This problem arises in particular in those authorities where no or only a few requests for access to information have been made. Since these bodies understandably have not yet had any points of contact with the State Transparency Act, incoming requests for access to information are often not evaluated as such, but classified as "simple requests with no legal basis". This often means that the legal processing period has not been taken into account, that an answer is not given despite an existing legal obligation, or that an application is unlawfully rejected.
In order to counteract this problem, the state commissioner has started an information initiative and informed the Rhineland-Palatinate authorities with an information sheet and in a webinar on March 8, 2022 about applications to assert a right to information access according to ยง 2 para. 2 LTranspG and their proper processing.
