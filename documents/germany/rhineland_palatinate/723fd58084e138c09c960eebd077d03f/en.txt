The concept concerns the assessment of fines in proceedings against companies within the scope of the GDPR. In particular, it does not apply to fines against associations or natural persons outside their economic activity.
However, this does not mean that the LfDI will not impose fines on clubs and associations in the future. However, the assessment of the fine will not be based on the above concept, but generally on the specifications of Art. 83 DS-GVO.
