                                Which digital toy belongs under the Christmas tree? - New podcast by the state data protection officer and the consumer center A new podcast by the state data protection officer and the consumer center of Rhineland-Palatinate deals with digital toys such as tracking watches and camera drones. In the podcast episode, three experts give answers to questions such as: Which toys can you give small children? give with conscience? What thoughts should parents have in advance when they want to buy a smart toy or device? How do the manufacturers deal with data protection? The podcast is available here from today. It appears as part of the radio data transmission podcast series by the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI) RLP.
The experts Maximilian Heitkamper (Consumer Center Rhineland-Palatinate e.V.), Friedhelm Lorig and Philipp Richter (both LfDI) examine individual digital gifts and clearly show which settings can be made and what the problem is. Among other things, it is about tracking, GPS chips and film recordings. The experts also point out the tricks manufacturers use to tempt children and young people to use them on a daily basis and to make follow-up purchases. The tips and hints can possibly help to ensure that giving and receiving presents leads to bright eyes without any data breaches.
The LfDI has also set up a virtual advent calendar in which interested parties can open a door every day.
