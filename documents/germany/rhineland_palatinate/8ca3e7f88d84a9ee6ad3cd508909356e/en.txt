Supervision and clarification - action plan of the LfDI Rhineland-Palatinate for the year 2023The state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information Rhineland-Palatinate (LfDI) has drawn up an action plan for the year 2023. It focuses on the creation and maintenance of digital sovereignty with regard to technical developments, digitization processes and data flows. Overarching topics will be the creation and preservation of digital sovereignty and the associated handling of software applications by certain providers with a monopoly or oligopoly character. In addition, the LfDI plans to carry out more on-site inspections and investigations, e.g. in local governments that use EfA services (one for all) in accordance with the OZG. In addition, in the aftermath of the corona pandemic, it is advisable to use random samples to control the deletion of medical documents in particular, for example in schools or with employers, in the sense of "cleaning up" after the pandemic. "The action plan serves to ensure transparency of the activities of my authority to the outside world. However, it also serves to ensure one's own self-assurance as to which data protection issues are pressing, if not even burning, on which issues the LfDI wants to provide assistance to the persons concerned, but also to those responsible, and in which political processes the voice of data protection must be raised in order to ensure democratic processes to help shape it.” explains the state commissioner Prof. Dr. Dieter Kugelman. “My agency and I have a variety of tasks to fulfil. By setting priorities, the current challenges should be taken into account, as far as they are foreseeable. "The current action plan is available here. The activity reports of the LfDI are available here.
