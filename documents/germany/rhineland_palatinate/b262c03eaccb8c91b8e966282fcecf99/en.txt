                                Fine against the hospital due to data protection deficits in patient management©
                            DOC RABE Media (45551150) / fotolia.com The Rhineland-Palatinate State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI) has imposed a fine of 105,000 euros on a hospital in Rhineland-Palatinate. At the same time, the LfDI welcomes the hospital's robust efforts to promote further developments and improvements in data protection management in the long term.
The final fine is based on several violations of the General Data Protection Regulation in connection with a patient mix-up when the patient was admitted. This resulted in incorrect invoicing and revealed the hospital's structural, technical and organizational deficits in patient management. The state representative, Prof. Dr. Kugelmann emphasizes: “The primary goal of the remedial and sanctioning measures is to remedy existing deficits and improve data protection. Fines are one instrument among many. In addition to their sanctioning effect, they always contain a preventive element by making it clear that grievances are being consistently investigated. It is important to me that substantial progress is made in health data protection with a view to the particular sensitivity of data. I therefore hope that the fine will also be taken as a signal that the data protection supervisory authorities are showing particular vigilance when it comes to handling data in the healthcare sector.”
