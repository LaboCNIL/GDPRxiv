                                LfDI RLPThe State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (LfDI), Prof. Dr. Dieter Kugelmann today handed over the 29th activity report on data protection to the President of the Rhineland-Palatinate state parliament, Hendrik Hering. The report covers the activities of the LfDI in 2020. In a statistical section, the state representative shows the activities of the authority with a view to the facts and figures and then reports on the developments in the individual subject areas. The year 2020 was also for the Data protection and freedom of information shaped by the pandemic and its effects. From the point of view of data protection, the sudden increase in home office activities, the sudden need for distance learning in schools and universities on the basis of digital technology or, in general, the avalanche-like increase in video conferences have raised questions and problems that have previously been given less attention or ran under the radar. Therefore, the LfDI was in great demand and under pressure to develop constructive answers and resilient solutions to these questions and problems Prof. Kugelmann. When supporting social developments with new digital manifestations, we can build on this experience. I am confident that we will also be able to master the challenges that lie ahead.”To the activity reports
