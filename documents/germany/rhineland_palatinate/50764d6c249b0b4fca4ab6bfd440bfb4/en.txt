                                Photography and data protection: New publication by the LfDI on the right to one's own pictureThe state commissioner for data protection and freedom of information (LfDI) is receiving more and more requests for advice on the subject of right to one's own picture from very different areas. These show that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the subject of law in one's own image, although the requirements to be observed in practice have remained unchanged in many respects for a long time. In addition, some myths persist on this subject. The LfDI has now taken this as an opportunity to publish extensive assistance on its website. These explanations are intended to provide assistance for professional photographers, amateur photographers, companies, public authorities, clubs, schools and journalists in answering frequently asked questions about the creation and publication of photos must be observed and which framework conditions must be taken into account when taking photographs. In addition, there are special sections for public bodies, clubs, schools, day-care centers and employers. The texts are enriched with templates for the different questions.
