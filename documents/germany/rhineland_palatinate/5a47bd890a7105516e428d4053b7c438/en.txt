The country's transparency platform will be fully available from January 1, 2021.

The discussion event, which will be held via video conference on Monday, September 28, 2020 from 4 p.m., will focus on the following questions, among others: Does digital change create new opportunities to improve transparency and openness in administration? How can access to environmental information advance environmental protection? What challenges do public authorities face: Are changes to IT systems and new organizational processes necessary? What new opportunities are opening up with the further provision of information for the media?
