Data protection in times of crisis - handouts from the LfDI help with
contract processing within the EU and EEA

The DS-GVO brought for public institutions, companies, associations or
Municipalities faced some new challenges, which were also largely overcome.
In many places, the newly established administrative processes are now becoming data protection
put to the test by the exceptional situation caused by Corona. A lot of data-
data protection officers are again faced with questions about the legality of data protection
work - for example when it comes to orders for companies outside of Germany, per-
to process personal data.

This is where data protection officers depend on practical help - and that's exactly where it is
is our task as a supervisory authority.

In order to create uncomplicated legal certainty, the LfDI Baden-Württemberg
therefore a contract model for order processing within the European Union
(EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It's from now on
available in English and German. Further guidelines will be published in
to follow shortly.
