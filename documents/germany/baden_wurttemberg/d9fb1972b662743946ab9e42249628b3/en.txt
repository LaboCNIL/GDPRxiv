  More light! – Design shared responsibility in a meaningful way

 

 

The decisions made by the European Court of Justice over the last year

about joint responsibility were a loud bang, their reverberation

since has not faded away. The legal figure of “joint responsibility”

and the related question of how such a contractual agreement between

is actually to be designed by the responsible parties involved, has since solved the problem for many

responsible big question marks. The jointly responsible comes

a key task for the protection of data subjects: several people decide

jointly responsible for the purposes and means of data processing

jointly responsible and must agree among themselves who is inside

relation to which obligation from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

comes.

  

Model of such a contract developed by the official supervisory authority

So far, one has searched in vain for works, so that the design of such a contract

often robs the contractual partners of important time and human resources.

With the pattern published by the LfDI BW, the first light is now coming into the dark. Around

to make joint responsibility transparent and understandable

LfDI BW now a contract template for joint responsibility according to Article 26

GDPR available. This pattern was developed based on common

ments with a number of companies and public bodies. Also

At this point, LfDI would like to thank Dr. Stefan Brink for the good cooperation!
