From the end of May to the end of July 2020, the Baden-Württemberg State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information published a new weekly spotlight in the in-house spotlight series. In times when topics such as "social distancing" and "distance" are very important, the unusual format "data protection as a cultural task" should be present, if not in person, then at least in digital form. "And above all, we want to stay in contact with you!" That's how LfDI Dr. Stefan Brink together.
The data protection officer of the Canton of Zurich had a similar idea. dr Dominika Blonski has launched a video competition for this. She also asks which topics people are concerned with in Corona times, what worries them.
For this reason, the LfDI Baden-Württemberg is particularly pleased to be able to publish the winning entries from the competition for data protection officers in the canton of Zurich as part of cross-border cooperation between the supervisory authorities.
