The President of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), Thomas

Kranig, presented the last activity report on today's European Data Protection Day

during his tenure.

President Kranig personally presented the 75-page 9th activity report for the past year 2019

and pointed out in particular that the burden of the significant increase in citizen complaints

and reports of data protection violations by companies have again increased significantly. with that

Unfortunately, the processing time will inevitably be longer. He is leaving due to the recent increase in staff

but assumes that the situation will improve in the course of this year.

The main contents of the press event are reproduced in the following section:

1. Activity report only digital

As in the previous year, we decided not to publish the activity report as a book. The reactions

it was mostly positive recently. By publishing it as a digital document on the

had particular relevance.

2. Statistics: Complaints, consultations and reports of data breaches

2.1. Complaints and Control Suggestions

Looking back on 2019 we were of

the number of complaints and control requests

ments surprised: These are in the last

twelve months again increased enormously

gen. As stated in the last report,

we assume that in particular the

numerous events, press reports

and information materials have led to

ben that many citizens have become more aware

From the point of view of society, this development may therefore be rated positively, because it is noticeably increased

There is data protection awareness. For us as an authority, however, it became even more difficult because we

couldn't keep up with the processing of the numerous entries in the usual way and so we

had to involuntarily build up our "mountain of debt" or work backlog.

The processing time has also suffered as a result. In

many cases we have not been able to

defuhrer within the statutory period of

three months, information about the

status or outcome of the proceedings. In

Complainants therefore have individual cases

2.2. advisory

Compared to last year, the number of requests for advice has fallen sharply. In particular clubs,

small handicraft businesses and the like only asked for advice in relatively few cases. Our big

Information wave in 2018 in connection with an increased range of information on our home

page has probably led to the fact that those responsible in particular are sufficiently informed about how they deal with

to handle personal data.

Advice is still very important to us because we

can thus contribute to legal certainty

and also find out which questions

have responsibilities in practice. As a result

the burden of advice has changed for us but not how

you can assume it based on the numbers alone

could be reduced to about a third. Instead of-

sen is the complexity and difficulty of

Inquiries have now increased significantly.

 

2.3. Data Breach Reporting

As we recently forecast, the reports of data protection violations have again

rose. Even if many of the reports relate to the so-called incorrect dispatch (e.g. doctor sends doctor's letter to

wrong recipient), serious security incidents have occurred in other areas such as cybercrime or

Encryption trojan heaped. Here the effort involved in processing such incidents, in particular assumed

measuring, reacting and also advising so that further damage does not happen in the future is enormous for us.

Against the background of a national threat situation from cyberspace, which is also reflected in the reports

of data protection violations, the Bavarian state government has decided, as of January 1, 2020, to

"Cyber Defense Bavaria" to be launched. Included

Bavarian State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD).

3. Personnel development

In the reporting period, we have the budget legislator in the narrower sense, the Bavarian state parliament, in

No new jobs were received as part of the supplementary budget. But we have through the Bavarian State Ministry

nister of the interior, for integration and sport, in the course of a budget restructuring according to Art. 6 of the Bavarian

Budget Act in March 2019 received the commitment for budget funds, with which we have nine jobs in the 2nd

and 3rd qualification level not only for the year 2019, but permanently.

 

The personnel development in recent years is as follows:

 Until 31.12.2016: 16 posts

 Until 31.12.2017: 20 posts

 Until 31.12.2018: 24 posts

 Until December 31, 2019: 33 permanent positions (of which 31 are occupied)

4. fine proceedings

We still receive many cases involving the use of dash cams, video surveillance of public spaces

by private persons or publications of personal data on the Internet without the consent of those affected

– v. a. on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In total we have approx.

100 fine procedures completed, one of them with a fine notice according to the GDPR. Furthermore

some procedures are already at the hearing stage and will be in the foreseeable future

result in the issuance of a fine.

 

If the legal situation is not clear, we usually have clarification first in the supervisory procedure

brought about before a fine procedure was initiated. We do not want those responsible for the first time in

be able to take note of our legal opinion in a fine procedure. This should be done in advance either in

Have taken place within the framework of a consultation or a supervisory procedure. For this reason and because we still

had to handle a significant number of procedures under the old law, the fine procedures are only in

really got going in the last few months of 2019.

5. Relevant individual topics

In the activity report there are also individual cases from the most diverse areas of life with our decision

shown, such as B. Internet, tax advice, insurance industry, advertising, trade and services,

employment data protection, health and social affairs, clubs, associations, housing industry, video surveillance

etc.

6. Sense and purpose of the activity report

The supervisory authorities are obliged to prepare a report on their activities at specified intervals.

Our approach is to first bring transparency to our work through statistical processing.

Experience has shown that activity reports are mainly read by data protection officers who know about them

want to find out which legal opinion "their" supervisory authority represents on certain topics. We hope

but also that citizens who are not experts in data protection can do something with our activity report

can start. We have therefore endeavored to formulate the texts in such a way that they are generally understandable

are, but also as a guide for data protection experts by specifying the corresponding legal bases

to serve.
