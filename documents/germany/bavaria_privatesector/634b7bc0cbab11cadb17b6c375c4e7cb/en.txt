Bavarian Administrative Court decides:

BayLDA rightly prohibits the use of Facebook Custom Audience

 

As early as 2017, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision prohibited

(BayLDA) an online shop the use of "Facebook Custom Audience", a

Facebook marketing tool. The administrative court of Bayreuth confirmed that

opinion of the BayLDA and decided in an expedited procedure that the order was

is moderate. The Bavarian Administrative Court also came to the same conclusion:

The use of "Facebook Custom Audience" without the consent of the user

violates data protection law.

 
The “Facebook Custom Audience” process enables companies to target their customers who are also users of

Facebook are to have targeted advertising on the social network. To advertise on Facebook,

an online shop provides a list of its customers and prospects with name, place of residence, e-mail address and telephone

phone number. This customer list is then uploaded to Facebook in the online store's Facebook account.

Beforehand, the customer data is converted into fixed character strings (e.g.

Max Mustermann = dddfab9b5b8a360150547065daff114ff218b39c8b0986b761075977aeeca3c3).

Facebook then compares the customer list with all Facebook users and can thus determine which customer

of the online shop is also a member of Facebook. The online shop can then use one or more advertising

start pagne(n) on Facebook for its customers. He selects a specific target group that receives the advertising

should hold. The online shop can specify that, for example, women between 20 and 30 years of age who do a lot of sport

drive, have an average income, advertise on their Facebook account from the online

ne shop received.

 

The BayLDA issued an order against a Bavarian online shop and asked the company to

no longer use the marketing tool "Facebook Custom Audience via the customer list". Reason for that

was that the online shop did not obtain the user's consent. From the perspective of the BayLDA, however, this was necessary

lich, since customer data was transmitted directly to Facebook. The online shop sued against this order

before the administrative court of Bayreuth. The administrative court of Bayreuth shared the view of the BayLDA and

decided in summary proceedings that the order had been issued lawfully. opposed this decision

the online shop.

 

Finally, the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that the BayLDA's order was lawful

and explained, among other things, the following reasons:
