The President of the BayLDA Thomas Kranig decided that these funds should only be used for positions for

Processing and the switchboard are created. As gratifying as the response to our

exercises were (e.g. 220 applications for the position of telephone and reception) so difficult designed and designed

it is still possible to get approval from other positions for the selected applicants.

"I am very grateful to Minister of State Joachim Herrmann for this targeted support and I hope that

for the last applicants to whom we have given a confirmation of employment, the corresponding

Approvals will now be received by November 1, 2019 at the latest," says Thomas Kranig, President of the BayLDA.

 

As a first measure of this increase in personnel, the BayLDA will regain its availability by telephone

continue Instead of just mornings between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., the switchboard is to be open from now on

Monday to Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and on Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m

clock to be available.

 

To make it easier for citizens to get advice, the BayLDA recently expanded its online services to

to send a consultation request online and encrypted to the BayLDA. This online service

(www.lda.bayern.de/beratung) has proven to be very successful and the processing time has

shortens. This is due in particular to the fact that with online inquiries - as with complaints and data -

protection violations - existing internal digital administration processes can be used.

 

The General Data Protection Regulation obliges the BayLDA to respond to complaints within

three months about the outcome of the procedure or at least about the current state of affairs. if

If this does not happen, there is a risk of failure to act at the administrative court, which has already been done to a lesser extent

present.

 

In the months of April to July 2019, the BayLDA hired half of its eight lawyers from different

lost for the first time and therefore an additional challenge to overcome due to the resulting gap.

The filling of these positions has largely been completed. The incorporation of the total significant number

new employees will take some time. "But I'm going with it

from December 2019 at the latest, at least the processing of complaints will take place in a timely manner

that we are no longer threatened with complaints about failure to act and that we are again subject to larger-scale, unprovoked audits,

i.e. H. can carry out tests without there being a specific complaint," is the hopeful expectation

by Thomas Kranig.
