  Tuesday, June 16, 2020 2: Press releases Data protection-friendly basic concept of the Corona-Warn-App - voluntariness must not be undermined by improper use! Press release of the conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments The Corona warning app presented by the federal government on June 16, 2020 is a voluntary tool with decentralized storage on the respective smartphone for tracking possible infections. The data protection conference sees the data protection-friendly basic concept as the realization of the principle of data protection by design. However, she points out that the voluntary approach in particular must not be undermined by misuse: access to official institutions, workplaces, commercial stores, restaurants and accommodation facilities, sports facilities, etc. must not be made dependent on showing the app. This would be an inappropriate use that is already incompatible with the concept of voluntariness. Discrimination against people who do not use the app must be ruled out.
