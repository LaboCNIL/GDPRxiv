the conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments After the relaunch, the youth portal of the data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments www.youngdata.de has a completely new design. The website has been fundamentally revised and adapted to today's user behavior of young people. In particular, it has been optimized for quick mobile access via smartphone. "With youngdata.de, we want to give young people in particular, but also all other interested parties, the opportunity to find out about data protection issues," says Dr. H. c. Marit Hansen, State Commissioner for Data Protection in Schleswig-Holstein and this year's Chair of the Conference of Independent Federal and State Data Protection Authorities (DSK). In addition to classic topics such as security, tracking or rights to one's own image, this also includes information on trends in social networks, cyberbullying or hate speech. With regard to new developments such as artificial intelligence (AI) and tools such as ChatGPT, the youth portal conveys to schoolchildren what opportunities and risks are associated with them and what role their personal data plays in this. If you want to use the internet actively and creatively, you can find out a lot about the advantages and disadvantages of the services and applications here. Young people also have the opportunity to find out about data protection offers in their area on the website. Hansen adds: "With the youth portal, we want to ensure that young people can move about independently in our digitized society. That is why the offers and content on youngdata.de are constantly being further developed.” Contact:
