  Wednesday, July 3, 2019 2: Press releases Bringing data protection cases into training - case about video surveillance in the fitness studio in the MootCourt 2019 The Schleswig-Holstein Administrative Court supports the training of young law students with simulated court proceedings, so-called MootCourts. Interesting cases are singled out, which are dealt with by prospective lawyers. They represent the positions of the plaintiff and the defendant like lawyers before the administrative court. This year it's about a case from data protection practice: video surveillance in a fitness studio. Eight teams of law students at Kiel University have been working on the case since the beginning of the 2019 summer semester fitness studio was allowed to enact. After the written preliminary procedure, the negotiations in the preliminary round with four teams or the final negotiations with the best two teams follow. These negotiations are public and will take place next Friday, July 5, 2019, in the administrative court in Schleswig. The MootCourt is staffed by judges, a university professor for public law and a specialist lawyer for administrative law. A court decision will not be made in this simulated procedure, but all those involved have dealt with the facts in detail and will present the arguments for the legal assessment from different perspectives. Marit Hansen, State Commissioner for Data Protection Schleswig-Holstein, supports the fact that the MootCourt organizers have decided on a data protection case: "In the past, data protection law was often only marginally mentioned in legal training. The MootCourt 2019 now focuses on data protection and the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities in the event of video surveillance. Video surveillance is one of the long-running issues in all data protection agencies in Germany - so we are looking forward to the legal exchange of blows between the teams." Hansen is not familiar with comparable initiatives from other disciplines: "I would be happy if cases from the Data protection practice would be dealt with - as a normal part of training or in the form of competitions. We need bright minds with innovative ideas, especially when it comes to the fair design of new technologies and business models.” Spectators are welcome at the public MootCourt hearings.
