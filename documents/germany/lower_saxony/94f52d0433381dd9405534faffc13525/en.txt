Limitation of telephone times at the LfD Lower Saxony



The Lower Saxony State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) will reduce telephone hours and thus the telephone availability of employees from June 20, 2022.
The LfD sees itself forced to take this step in view of the continued high number of complaints from citizens and the incoming reports from authorities and companies on data protection violations. The LfD asks for your understanding for this measure.
In concrete terms, this means that the LfD Niedersachsen will be available by telephone at the following times from June 20th:







Monday and Wednesday:
09.00 a.m. – 12.00 p.m


Thursday:
2 p.m. – 4 p.m







This reduces the availability by telephone by two hours.
The number of the LfD Lower Saxony for inquiries from citizens remains unchanged. The supervisory authority can still be reached on 0511 120 - 4500.
