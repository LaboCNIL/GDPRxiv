Stop mass collection of contact data - make better use of the Corona-Warn-App
corona pandemic




At its first interim conference of the year, the conference of the independent federal and state data protection supervisory authorities (DSK) recommended moving away from the mass collection of contact data. Among other things, she spoke out in favor of including the Corona-Warn-App (CWA) in the state regulations as a data protection-friendly alternative to contact data collection. In Lower Saxony, this has been the case since the last change to the Corona Ordinance, which has been in force since January 15, 2022.

"It's good that Lower Saxony has already taken this first step," says Barbara Thiel, the state commissioner for data protection in Lower Saxony. "Now the state government should take the second step and stop the comprehensive contact data collection, which takes place in numerous companies and institutions."

Ulrich Kelber, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information and this year's Chairman of the DSK, said: "With the currently very high number of infections, the contact details are hardly ever used by the overburdened health authorities anyway. If the number of infections is low, on the other hand, the general recording of contact details is a disproportionate interference with the fundamental right of citizens to informational self-determination.‚Äù

The CWA quickly warns those affected about potential risky contacts and is particularly safe due to its decentralized structure. "I would therefore like the Lower Saxony state government to advertise the app and its possibilities even more intensively," says Barbara Thiel.
