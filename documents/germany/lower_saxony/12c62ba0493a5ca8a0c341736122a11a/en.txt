Key points for data protection-compliant online exams at universities in Lower Saxony
Legal certainty in digital exams



Due to the corona pandemic, numerous universities in Lower Saxony have carried out digital examinations. Since it can be assumed that this form of performance assessment will continue in the coming months or even permanently, the Lower Saxony State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) publishes key points for the data protection-compliant implementation of online examinations at universities.
"In the 2021 summer semester, we asked the universities which processes they use in order to be able to develop practical key points," says state data protection officer Barbara Thiel. "We are thus creating more legal certainty for the universities and at the same time protecting the privacy of the students."

Among other things, the key points deal with how universities can determine the identity of a student, to what extent cameras may be used to monitor the examination and which surveillance measures are generally not permitted.

The full key points are available here as a PDF download.
