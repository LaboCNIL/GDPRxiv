Delete Corona data now at the latest
Elimination of legal obligations





Many legal obligations related to the corona pandemic have ceased to exist in the past few weeks. This means that numerous data processing operations are no longer necessary. The State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) Lower Saxony, Barbara Thiel, is therefore asking companies and public bodies to check whether and which personal data they have collected and stored in connection with measures to combat the pandemic. If these measures and thus the purpose of data processing no longer apply, the data must be deleted urgently.

"All data processing - such as access control to the workplace with 3G control - was earmarked," says Barbara Thiel. â€œThe data processed in this context should have been deleted immediately when the legal obligations ended. Anyone who has not yet taken care of it should do so now at the latest in order not to create illegal data cemeteries. I reserve the right to carry out unannounced inspections in companies and other facilities this year."

Due to the special regulations in the health sector, certain data processing is still required there and is therefore legally compliant. This applies, for example, to the facility-related vaccination requirement in Section 20a of the Infection Protection Act (new). The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and state governments has published a current decision on this, in which it comments, among other things, on the data protection-compliant handling of vaccination certificates. The decision is available here as a PDF document.
