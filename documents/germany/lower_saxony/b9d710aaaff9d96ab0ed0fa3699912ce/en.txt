Thiel: Don't undermine data protection any further
Obligation to appoint data protection officers




The State Commissioner for Data Protection Lower Saxony (LfD), Barbara Thiel, criticizes the change in the law on the obligation to appoint data protection officers, which the German Bundestag passed last night. "I warn against undermining data protection through further legal amendments," said Thiel. “In Germany we have a very high level of data protection that we can be proud of and that must be maintained. The easing of the obligation to appoint data protection officers is not as far-reaching as had been feared in the meantime. But in the end, the companies and associations that you want to relieve with this measure are doing a disservice.”

Among other things, the passed law stipulates that companies and associations only have to appoint a data protection officer if 20 or more people regularly process personal data electronically. Previously, this threshold was ten people. "Even without the obligation to appoint a data protection officer, an organization must of course meet the requirements of the GDPR," says Thiel. “So the requirements are not getting any smaller. Without a data protection officer, however, there is no competent contact person on site who could help to avoid errors and violations from the outset.”
