Thiel criticizes the expansion of bodycams by the police
Camera use without legal basis



Lower Saxony's State Commissioner for Data Protection, Barbara Thiel, criticizes the Interior Ministry's plan to massively expand the use of bodycams by the police. The MI had announced this in the interior committee of the state parliament.
"It is very unfortunate that the body cameras are now being used illegally across the country," said Thiel. In February 2017, the data protection officer formally complained to the MI about the pilot test at the time because the cameras were being used without a legal basis. This also applies if only images without sound are recorded.
"I'm not fundamentally against the use of bodycams, but they must not be used in violation of the law. I therefore find it completely incomprehensible that this step is being taken before the new police law is passed," says Barbara Thiel. "For all its weaknesses, the draft law at least contains a legal basis for bodycams, which I expressly welcomed." However, from the point of view of the data protection officer, this would have to be supplemented, for example with regulations on independent evaluation and the maximum storage period of the material.
Barbara Thiel criticizes particularly sharply that the MI did not sufficiently involve the data protection authority in the evaluation of the pilot test. "Following my complaint, I was assured that further action would be coordinated with us in a suitable manner. That has not happened to this day.‚Äù
