LfD Lower Saxony publishes new guidelines on data protection for municipal representatives
Data protection in municipalities



At the beginning of the municipal election period on November 1st, the State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) Lower Saxony, Barbara Thiel, published a new handout for municipal MPs. In addition to the principles of data protection, it primarily explains specific questions from the day-to-day work of the elected representatives.
"Especially when you take on such an office for the first time, numerous questions and challenges arise," says Barbara Thiel. “One of these challenges is, on the one hand, to do justice to the information interests of citizens in committee work and, on the other hand, to comply with data protection regulations. The handout is intended to support municipal representatives in mastering this balancing act.”

The digital brochure answers, among other things, questions about how to deal with meeting minutes, the publication of information in the context of building management procedures or the possibility of retrieving data from the registration authority.
The live streaming of council meetings and the safe use of technical devices such as smartphones and tablets in committee work are also discussed.
