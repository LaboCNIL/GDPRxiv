DSK starts consultation process for updated guidance for providers of telemedia
Press release of the data protection conference



The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authority of the federal and state governments (DSK) today initiated the consultation process for its guidance for providers of telemedia. It was published in December 2021 after a complete revision due to the legal changes that came into force on December 1, 2021 with the Telecommunications Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG).

The orientation guide presents requirements for the operation of websites and apps. However, the scope of the currently applicable provisions for the protection of end devices, with which the TTDSG codifies the specifications of the ePrivacy Directive of the European Union, goes well beyond these case groups. The guidance should therefore also be used for other end devices that are connected to the Internet and for processes in which information is stored on or retrieved from devices, such as certain functions of networked vehicles, industrial devices or home and consumer electronics.

The consultation process gives representatives from politics, business, science, society and administration the opportunity to comment on the Telemedia 2021 orientation guide. The consultation process serves to review and, if necessary, to further develop the guidance, but does not affect its validity and application in data protection supervisory practice.

Statements can only be sent by email to the address LfD-Referat4@LfD.niedersachsen.de until March 15, 2022 (limitation period) with the subject "Consultation TTDSG". Further information on the procedure is provided on the website of the data protection conference (www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/konsultationverfahren.html).
