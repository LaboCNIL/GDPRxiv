Rental devices for teachers are an important step for data protection-compliant learning at a distance
digital education




The State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) Lower Saxony, Barbara Thiel, welcomes the fact that the Lower Saxony state government has approved the federal-state agreement "Loan devices for teachers". The agreement aims to enable schools to equip their teachers with mobile digital devices for lesson preparation and follow-up and for distance learning.

"This is a very important step away from the principle of 'bring your own device', which repeatedly causes problems in terms of data protection law," says Barbara Thiel. Only certain data of the students may be processed on private devices. In addition, with BYOD it must be ensured that the data is always hosted on the school's own servers or on servers provided by reliable service providers.

"For a long time we have been recommending the nationwide purchase of service devices for teachers in Lower Saxony, because this clearly separates private and work purposes," says the state data protection officer. "I hope that the funds will now be used quickly and that the teachers will be equipped with laptops and tablets in a timely manner."
