DSK publishes new version of the Telemedia Orientation Guide


At its 104th conference, the data protection conference decided on the amended version of the orientation guide (OH) for providers of telemedia 2021 version 1.1. This has now been published together with a comprehensive evaluation report.

When the Telecommunications Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG) came into force in December 2021, the DSK passed the OH Telemedien 2021. This deals in detail with the requirements of the new law and the General Data Protection Regulation when operating websites and gives website operators, providers of telemedia and Assistance to users and those applying the law for data protection-compliant operation of their websites. Technologies are regularly used on websites and apps - often by third-party service providers - which make it possible to process personal data of users for various purposes. A very practical example of such technologies are so-called cookies, which fall within the scope of the new ยง25 TTDSG.

Following the publication of the OH Telemedien 2021, the DSK initiated a public consultation process. After evaluating the comments received, corresponding adjustments and additions were made to the original version of the OH Telemedien 2021. In addition, OH Tele-medien 2019 was included in the current version 1.1. A detailed evaluation of the statements can be found in the evaluation report of the media working group "Consultation on guidance for providers of telemedia".
