State data protection officer praises the transparency of the Corona warning app and insists on it being voluntary



The State Commissioner for Data Protection (LfD) Lower Saxony, Barbara Thiel, considers data protection in the new Corona warning app of the federal government to be sufficiently taken into account. "This project is particularly characterized by a high degree of transparency," says Thiel. “The source code has been published and can therefore also be checked by independent experts. This is a smart measure to create trust in the application.” The LfD therefore agrees with the judgment of the Federal Data Protection Commissioner that there is no reason from a data protection point of view to refrain from installing the app.

Other positive aspects are the decentralized storage of the data and the voluntary nature of the app. "This voluntary approach must not be undermined under any circumstances," says Thiel. "People who don't want to or can't download the app must under no circumstances be discriminated against, for example by not being allowed to go to their workplace, restaurants or shops." is compatible.

“The app will work better the more people use it. This can only be achieved by creating trust and giving people the freedom to choose how they use it,” says Thiel. The app developers would have fulfilled these requirements. Now everyone involved would have to deal responsibly with the possibilities of application in order to make them an effective means of fighting the pandemic.
