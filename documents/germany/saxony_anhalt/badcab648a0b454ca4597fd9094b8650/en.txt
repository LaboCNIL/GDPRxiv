the Conference of Independent Data Protection Authorities

of the federal and state governments of January 27, 2022

 
 

 

 

DSK recommends using the CWA for contact tracing

The conference of the independent data protection supervisory authorities of the federal and

countries (DSK) has at their first interim conference a move away from the

mass collection of contact data recommended. The chairman said so

the DSK, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information

(BfDI) Professor Ulrich Kelber: “With the currently very high number of infections

hardly any contact details from the overburdened health authorities

used. If the number of infections is low, general contact data collection

on the other hand, a disproportionate encroachment on the fundamental right to information

self-determination of the citizens. The DSK therefore demands that instead

the comprehensive collection of contact data the possibilities of the corona warning

App (CWA) can be used better.”

The DSK is once again committed to ensuring that the state regulations

CWA is envisaged as a privacy-friendly alternative to contact capture.

The app quickly warns about possible risky contacts and thanks to the decentralized

Structure particularly safe. Therefore, state governments should support the CWA and its

Promote opportunities even more intensively and thus make them better known.

The DSK consists of the independent data protection authorities of the federal government and the

Countries. This year, the BfDI is chairing the conference. The DSK has them

Task to protect and to the fundamental right to informational self-determination

protect a uniform application of European and national

to achieve data protection law and work together for its further development

to enter
