The lawfulness of the treatment, with regard to the extraordinary update of pensions, will be based on article 71 of Law No. (see paragraph 1), which lists the Social Security and CGA pensions covered (see paragraph 3), with paragraph 4 establishing the interconnection of data between the CGA and the ISS, for the purposes of transmitting the relevant information, interconnection whose terms and conditions are regulated in the present protocol (under the terms of paragraph 5 of the same article).

However, logs must also record, specifically within the scope of this protocol, the information sent, allowing tracking of what was transmitted and when.
c) Rights of holders
The protocol does not provide for any clause listing the rights of the holders, nor is there any advantage in including such a standard, which would be limited to repeating legal norms.
It could be relevant, however, to regulate compliance with the obligation provided for in article 19 of the GDPR, which clearly applies in the context of this protocol in which personal data is transmitted, establishing an expedited means of communicating to the other controller (CGA or ISS), as recipient of the information, any request for rectification, erasure or limitation of treatment by the data subject.
d) Subcontractors

It is understood that this wording is too general and permissive, not complying with the legal requirements of subcontracting provided for in article 28, no.
2 and paragraph 4 of the GDPR, as the controller's option for what appears to be a general authorization for subsequent subcontracting does not preclude the processor's obligation to be able to carry out further subcontracting only if those processors provide 'sufficient guarantees implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures (...)'.
