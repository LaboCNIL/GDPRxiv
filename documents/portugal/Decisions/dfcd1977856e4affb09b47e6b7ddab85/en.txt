identification of candidates for positions in management and inspection bodies {see-
if n-' 5 of article 5.*) and the members of the administration and inspection bodies (n-* 2
of article 7.*). Likewise, no L of the former 33" is available, applicable to the parties

In light of the above grounds, the CNFD considers appropriate and necessary the
categories of data provided for in the annex to the Project, relative to the duration of the
