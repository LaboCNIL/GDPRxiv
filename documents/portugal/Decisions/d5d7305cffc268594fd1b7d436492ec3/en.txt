THE
OPINION/2021/151
i. Request
1. The Office of the Secretary of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers submitted to the National Data Protection Commission (hereinafter CNPD), for an opinion, the draft Decree-Law approving the regime for investment companies and transposing several directives relating to its operation - (Reg. DL 1240/XXII/2021).
2. The CNPD issues an opinion within the scope of its attributions and competences as an independent administrative authority with powers of authority to control the processing of personal data, conferred by subparagraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 57, in conjunction with subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 58, and with paragraph 4 of article 36, all of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of 27 April 2016 - General Regulation on Data Protection (hereinafter GDPR), in conjunction with the provisions of article 3, paragraph 2 of article 4, and paragraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 6, all of Law n° 58 /2019, of 8 August, which enforces the GDPR in the domestic legal order.
3. This decree-law transposes Directive (EU) 2019/2034, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 November 2019, on the prudential supervision of investment firms, approving the Regime for Investment Firms.
4. Pursuant to the preamble, 'the prudential framework of investment firms is separate from the prudential regime of credit institutions, except in situations provided for in Union law, which correspond to large investment firms or of a systemic nature'.
5. Among the main changes introduced, we highlight the elimination of the current autonomous typologies of investment companies and the consequent consecration of a single type. In this way, the regulatory requirements come to result from the scope of the authorization, which defines the investment services and activities that the investment firm may exercise, and not from the typology of the entity, as is currently the case.
6. Note that the registration of these entities becomes unofficial. Finally, it should be noted that the Investment Firms Regime concentrates the supervisory functions relating to these companies in the Securities Market Commission (hereinafter CMVM).

22. However, such elements are necessary as the CMVM assesses the competence and suitability of the members of the management and supervisory bodies of investment companies, having to take into account, under the terms of subparagraph b) of paragraph 5 of article 30 .°-D of the RGICSF «the accusation, indictment or conviction, in Portugal or abroad, for crimes against property, crimes of forgery and forgery, crimes against the execution of justice, crimes committed in the exercise of public functions, crimes tax, crimes especially related to the exercise of financial and insurance activities and the use of means of payment and even crimes provided for in the Commercial Companies Code».
23. Therefore, since paragraph 4 of article 67 of the Regime for Investment Companies, which is being analysed, assigns to the CMVM the competence to carry out an assessment of the suitability of the members of the management and supervisory bodies, as well as the suitability of holders of qualifying holdings3, with the processing of personal data related to criminal convictions and offences being at stake, its legal basis lies in paragraph 5 of article 111 of Law No. 83/2017, of 18 August, which provides adequate guarantees for the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in accordance with Article 10 of the GDPR.

Paragraph 3 of this item provides that the information covered by the duty of secrecy may be disclosed in a summarized or aggregated form, as long as the entities concerned are not identified, or with the express and prior authorization of the authority or institution or entity concerned that provided the information. It should be noted that, if this information contains personal data, its disclosure complies with the legal data protection regime, so it is recommended to reformulate this article in order to safeguard the personal data protection regime - since, for the mere authorization of the institution or entity concerned does not serve, prima facie, as a legal basis for the disclosure of personal data of third parties.
25. In turn, pursuant to article 131 of the Investment Firms Regime, the CMVM draws up the regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this regime, namely as regards the criteria used to assess the suitability of members of governing bodies and of qualifying holdings in investment firms and instructional elements to be submitted in the application.

26. Finally, under the terms of article 137, the CMVM may exchange information subject to a duty of secrecy with authorities of third countries if the authorities in question, in the CMVM's assessment, are subject to legal regimes of secrecy equivalent to those provided for in this regime. and in the Securities Code, if the transmission of personal data to these authorities and the respective processing is possible in accordance with national and European Union legislation on the protection of personal data, when the exchange of information contains such data; and if the information is necessary for the performance of resolution functions, by the authorities of the relevant third countries, considered equivalent to that provided for in the legislation on credit institutions, and may only be used for that purpose'. In turn, Article 138 provides for the conclusion of cooperation agreements with third countries for the exchange of information.
27. It should be noted that, in order for the transfers of personal data to a third country, provided for herein, to be in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, it is necessary that, whenever that third State has not been subject to an adequacy decision by the of the European Commission, under the terms of article 45 of the GDPR, adequate guarantees are presented, and on condition that the data subjects enjoy enforceable rights as well as effective corrective measures, under the terms imposed by article 46 of this Union diploma .
28. The European Data Protection Committee has already commented in Opinion 4/20194 on the Administrative Agreement for the transfer of personal data between the Financial Supervisory Authorities of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Financial Supervisory Authorities of countries third parties, concluded under Article 46(3)(b) of the GDPR.
29. Thus, the transfers referred to in Articles 137 and 138 of the Investment Firms Regime under analysis must take place under the conditions and with the entities provided for therein.
30. Furthermore, the draft Decree-Law does not raise reservations from the point of view of personal data protection.
