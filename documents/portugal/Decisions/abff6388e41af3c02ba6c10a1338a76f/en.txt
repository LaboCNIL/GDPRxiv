/ NATIONAL COMMISSION ON DATA PROTECTION
In accordance with point d) of paragraph 2 of article 27-D of the Highway Code, personal data from the car registration must be communicated, in order to carry out the respective attributions, to the entities responsible for supervising the Code. of the road. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 of article 27-E of the same diploma also allow these entities to be authorized to consult data transmission lines, provided that security guarantees are observed and subject to the signing of a protocol.
Thus, there is a legitimate basis for this processing of personal data, in terms of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR.
Paragraph 4 of article 27-H of the Motor Vehicle Registry requires that the entities competent to consult this registry keep an updated list of persons authorized to access the database. In this way, VITRUS is obliged to maintain this list, which must be updated in order to limit the possibility of undue access by users who no longer have the legitimacy to access.
Naturally, this obligation arises from the law, but it must also be included in this protocol, insofar as it will have a boosting effect on its compliance and will allow the IRN, at any time, to determine to the IGFEJ that the access credentials are deactivated.
The intervention of the IGFEJ in this protocol stems from the attribution provided for in subparagraph m) of paragraph 2 of article 3 of Decree-law no. 164/2012, of 31 July.
With regard to security measures, without prejudice to the need for permanent verification of their compliance, they appear to be appropriate.
II - Conclusion
The CNPD considers that VITRUS AMBIENTE, E.M., S.A. has legitimacy for access to the personal data of the car registration, within the limits and conditions recommended by this protocol, so it understands that there is no impediment to its execution.
Approved at the meeting of July 28, 2020
