consultation, which should be limited to what is strictly necessary, not using the information for other purposes; not to transmit the information to third parties; to take the necessary security measures to guarantee the integrity and proper functioning of the database. Any form of interconnection of personal data is also prohibited.
9. It is also foreseen, in the same clause, that, if the CMO uses the subcontractor to execute the protocol, it is bound, namely, to guarantee the security of the treatment, to ensure that the people involved assume a commitment to confidentiality and to give knowledge to the IRN of all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations under the GDPR, including facilitating and contributing to audits or inspections conducted by the IRN or by another auditor mandated by it.

11. Also under the terms of the protocol, the CMO undertakes to previously communicate to the IRN the identification of the users of access to the database, by indicating the name, category/function and NIF, with a view to attributing connection credentials to the system, and each user will receive, in a closed letter, a personal password, which will make him responsible for the use he makes of the service. OIGFEJ will assign an application user and respective password to the CMO to access the web services provided.
12. The protocol is concluded for a period of one (1) year, tacitly extendable for equal periods.
II. appreciation
13. Just as a preliminary note, alert to the fact that there is a gap at the end of the preamble of the draft protocol, referring to the Motor Vehicle Ownership Regime when it seems that it is intended to affirm Motor Property Registration.
14. As for the articles, the possibility for municipalities to access the car registration derives from the combined provisions of subparagraph d) of paragraph 1 and subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 of article 5 of Decree-Law no. 44/2005, of 27 February, last amended by Decree-Law No. 146/2014, of 9 October.
15. The Municipality of Ourém is, under the terms of Article 5(1)(d) and(3)(b) of Decree-Law No. 44/2005, of 23 February, the entity responsible for supervising compliance with vehicle parking and road traffic regulations, including the reporting of traffic accidents, in the territorial area of the Municipality of Ourém.
16. In accordance with subparagraph d) of paragraph 2 of article 27-E of the regime relating to the Car Registration, personal data from the car registration must be communicated, in order to carry out the respective attributions, to the

entities responsible for supervising the Highway Code. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 of article 27-E of the same diploma also allow these entities to be authorized to consult data transmission lines, provided that the security guarantees are observed and subject to the signing of a protocol. .
17. Thus, there is a legitimate basis for this processing of personal data, in terms of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR.
18. Paragraph 4 of article 27-H of the regime relating to the Motor Vehicle Registration requires that the entities competent to consult this registration maintain an updated list of persons authorized to access the database. In this way, CMO is obliged to maintain this list, which must be updated in order to limit the possibility of undue access by users who no longer have the legitimacy to access.
19. Naturally, this updating obligation stems from the law, but it must also be included in the present protocol, insofar as it will have a potential effect on its compliance and will allow the IRN, at any time, to determine to the IGFEJ that the credentials of access are disabled.
20. The IGFEJ's intervention in this protocol stems from the attribution provided for in subparagraph m) of paragraph 2 of article 3 of Decree-Law no. 164/2012, of 31 July.
21. With regard to security measures, without prejudice to the need for permanent verification of their compliance, they appear to be appropriate.
fl. Conclusion
22. The CNPD considers that there is legitimacy for the access by the Municipality of Ourém to the personal data of the car registration, within the limits and conditions recommended by the present protocol, so it understands that there is no impediment to its execution.
