Therefore, for audit and security purposes, ANSR, through SGMAI, undertakes to send to IGFEJ, in each transaction, the identification of the user who wants to access the information, the case number or the corresponding notice, in addition to of the other audit data, which are established by the IRN and the IGFEJ. Searches can only be done by vehicle registration. Records {!og$) of the accesses made are also kept, which are kept for a period of two years for audit purposes (cf. Clause 2.a).
Under the terms of Clause 3a of the protocol, the CMO must comply with the legal provisions contained in the RGPD and Law No. for other purposes; not to transmit the information to third parties; to take the necessary security measures to guarantee the integrity and proper functioning of the database. Any form of interconnection of personal data is also prohibited.

As the entity authorized to access the vehicle registration database, CMO is solely responsible for accessing the information and its subsequent use (cf. Clause 5.a). I
I - Appreciation
1. Under the terms of subparagraph d) of no. 2 of article no. 27-D of Decree-Law no. 54/75, personal data from the car registration may be communicated, in order to carry out the respective attributions, to the entities responsible for supervising compliance with the provisions of the Highway Code and complementary legislation.

2. Also in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 27-E of the same diploma, these entities may authorize consultation on the data transmission line, provided that security guarantees are observed and subject to the signing of a protocol. that defines the limits and conditions of access.
3. The possibility for the CMO to access the car registration derives from the combined provisions of article 5, no. 1, point d) with no. 3, point a) of Decree-Law no. of February.
4. To that extent, it is considered that there is a basis of legitimacy for this data processing, in the form of access, under article 6(e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of 27 April 2016 - General Regulation on Data Protection (GDPR).
5. Regarding the conditions of legitimacy for the realization of access through the SCoT and for the intervention of the ANSR, these are considered to be met, insofar as, as provided for in paragraph 1 of article 2 of Regulatory Decree no. 28/2012, of 12 March, the ANSR's mission is to "enforce the law of administrative offences". It is also responsible, under the terms of subparagraph e) of paragraph 2 of the aforementioned diploma, “to ensure the processing and management of records raised for violations of the Highway Code and complementary legislation”. To this end, it owns, coordinates, manages and finances the SCoT, in accordance with the provisions of Joint Order No. 19081/2008, of 17 July.
6. Also within the framework of the transfer of powers to local authorities, approved by Law no. 50/2018, of 16 August, Decree-Law no. powers for municipal bodies in the field of public parking, providing in its article 4, paragraph 1, subparagraph a) that the SCoT is used 'for the collection of administrative offences'.
7. Given that the IGFEJ only provides accreditation for a generic user (the ANSR) and not for individual users, who are managed directly by the ANSR, it is considered an adequate safeguard measure, by the IRN, to require that the identification of the user is provided, as well as the information regarding the case number or notice that triggers the search, as it allows him, on the one hand, to know the individual user for audit purposes and, on the other hand, to prevent the realization of of unjustified access, exercising better access control.

8. It should be noted that, under the terms of paragraph 4 of article 27-H of the decree-law that regulates the car registration, the entities that can consult the car registration, in this case the CMO, 'are obliged to maintain a Up-to-date use of persons authorized to access the databases». Although this is a legal obligation that derives expressly from the text of the law, the CNPD understands that its transposition into Clause 5.a of the protocol, in addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, may have an effect that enhances compliance.
9. In paragraph 3 of Clause 3a of the protocol, there seems to be a clear wording error in which, in the subject of the sentence, the CMO is replaced by «Law No. 58/2019», stating that the law is linked to ensuring compliance with the necessary technical and organizational measures. This provision must be amended accordingly.
10. As regards the security measures foreseen for the transmission of data, as well as the obligation provided for in paragraph 3 of Clause 5.a, they seem generally appropriate.
11. Regarding the participation of the IGFEJ as a party to this protocol, the CNPD considers this to be fully justified, given its attributions, provided for in article 3 of Decree-Law No. 164/2012, of 31 July. Likewise, the participation of SGMAI is based on the powers conferred on it by subparagraphs a) and djóo no. 9 of article 2 of Regulatory Decree no. given by Decree-Law No. 112/2014, of 11 July.
II - Conclusion
The CNPD considers that there is legitimacy for the access by the Municipality of Odemira to the
personal data from the car registration, within the limits and conditions recommended by the present
protocol, so it understands that there is no impediment to its conclusion.
