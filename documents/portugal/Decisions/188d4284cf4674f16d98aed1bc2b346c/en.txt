5. Under the terms of the preamble, after five years of application of Decree-Law No. 103/2015, of 15 June, which regulates these matters, it became necessary to adapt its annexes to technical and scientific progress, namely the obligation that any inclusion of new designations of the type in its Annex I must be done through a legislative amendment to the Decree-Law, of which it is an integral part.
6. Thus, given the need to add new types of non-harmonized fertilizing materials to Annex I of Decree-Law No. 103/2015, of 15 June, several changes are also introduced redefining the legal framework applicable to fertilizing materials .
