II. Analysis
6. Through Law No. 26/2021, of 17 May, the Government was authorized to establish the rules for implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, considering that this Proposal is within the limits defined by the law of legislative authorization, as to its object, meaning and extension.
7. With relevance to the protection of personal data, and following the administrative cooperation framework that already exists under Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 now repealed, the designation of the CNPD as one of the competent national authorities within the scope of of Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, by virtue of its legal powers to control compliance with the rules of national legislation that transposes Directive 2002/58/EC, on privacy in electronic communications, through Law No. 41/2004 , of 18 August, in its current wording.
8. The Proposal, in its article 13, grants the CNPD the powers provided for in paragraphs a), b) and d) to h) of paragraph 4 of article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, whose exercise complies with the provisions of article 10 of the aforementioned regulation.
9. Among these powers, “the power to seek or accept from the professional responsible for the offense covered by this regulation commitments in order to cease the infringement” (cf. point b) of paragraph 4 of article 9. ), and which is regulated in more detail in Article 20 of the Proposal. 'Professional' means, as defined in Article 3(11) of the Regulation, 'any natural or legal person, public or private, acting, including through another person acting in in its name or on its behalf, within the scope of its commercial, industrial, artisanal or professional activity'.
10. Pursuant to Article 20 of the Proposal, the competent national authority may propose or accept commitments from the trader aimed at the cessation of the infringement and, where applicable, the reparation of damages or other measures for the benefit of consumers. The commitments reached are written down by the national authority and a maximum period is set for their execution. The Proposal also provides for the possibility of publicizing commitments, orders issued under the Regulation and final decisions, including the identification of the offender.
11. In general, the Proposal is limited to defining what Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 is incumbent on the Member States to regulate, also taking into account a pre-defined list of consumer protection legislation that is subject to these cross-border cooperation mechanisms, so the CNPD has no comments to make on this matter.
