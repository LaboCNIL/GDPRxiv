The aforementioned precepts of article 4 of the Regulation refer to annexes (Annexes I and II), which list the information necessary for the decision to be taken and the issuance of the conformity approval document.
Likewise, article 9, concerning the prior communication of the operation of Simple Pressure Vessels, and article 11, concerning the approval of the installation of Pressure Equipment refer to two annexes (III and IV, respectively) where the information to be processed is listed.
Essentially, the annexes provide for the same type of personal data (i.e. information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, in accordance with the concept defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR): identification data and contact of the owner of the containers or equipment or the user thereof, when they are natural persons, duly specified.
In view of the purpose pursued with the collection and conservation of this information, the personal data listed in the aforementioned annexes appear to be adequate, necessary and not excessive, so the CNPD understands that the Regulation to be approved by this draft law respects the principles of protection of personal data, in particular that of data minimization (cf. points a) to c) of paragraph 1 of article 5 of the GDPR).
