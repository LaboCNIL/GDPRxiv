DATA DEPROTECTION
DELIBERATION No. 984/2018
I - The National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) prepared, on July 17, 2018, a draft resolution, in which the defendant was charged
combined provisions of Articles 5, paragraph 1 al. c) and article 5, no. 1 al. f) with article 83, no. 5, par. a), of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 679/2016, of April 27, hereinafter RGPD), punishable, each of them, with a fine of €0.00 to €20,000,000.00 or up to 4% of the annual turnover, whichever amount is higher, as well as the commission of a breach foreseen and punishable under the terms of the combined provisions of article 32, paragraph 1, subparagraphs b) and d) and article 83. , No. 4, al. a), of the GDPR, with a fine of €0.00 to €10,000,000.00 or up to 2% of annual turnover, whichever amount is higher.
Once the defendant was notified of the content of the said project and, pursuant to the provisions of article 50 of Decree-Law No. 433/82, of October 27, to present her defense, she came to claim (cfr. pages 38 to 82) , in short, that:
1. The CNPD cannot be considered as a national supervisory authority, under the terms of article 51, paragraph 1 of the RGPD, as it has not yet been formally indicated as such. Admitting otherwise would violate the principle of legality contained in Article 266 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (CRP);
2. The conducts foreseen in the RGPD as punishable with the fines of article 83 are not sufficiently densified, so that the intervention of the national legislator is indispensable for them to apply, under penalty of violation of the principle of typicality formulated in article 29 of the CRP;
3. Recognizes the existence of access profiles under the conditions reported in the draft deliberation of the CNPD;
4. Considers, however, that professionals with these access profiles (social action/service technicians, nutritionists, physiotherapists and psychologists) are subject to
the practice of two violations foreseen and punishable under the terms of the

adequate confidentiality obligations, namely deontological ones;
5. Such professionals have access to relevant and necessary information for the performance of their duties;
6. The systems used do not technically allow access stratification
to information with the ideal detail, something that he understands cannot be attributed to him since he uses systems standardized by third parties, without the possibility of intervention by and of mandatory use, given the determinations of the
guardianship entities;
7. It also argues that such a stratification of information will tend to be impossible, since, from the outset, it is not possible to determine which specific data may be relevant for the performance of those professionals' functions;
8. Informs, however, that the latest updates made available by the Shared Services of the Ministry of Health have resolved some of the issues raised by the CNPD, especially regarding the management of access credentials;
9. It also declares that it has already put into practice several of the recommendations contained in Deliberation No. 674/2018, of July 17, of the CNPD;
10. Regarding access to the PDS (Health Data Platform), he declares that "technically a button being available to access the PDS would not mean that the user could access it, since the PDS information system is an external system to the SClínico, therefore, it must validate itself if the user is a doctor or nurse”;
11. Rebuts the facts that in the deliberation project pointed to the lack of access logs to the SClinic system;
12. As for the accounts of active users associated with the "MEDICO" functional group, in a much higher number than the medical staff declared in the various reports and accounts, it admits the possibility that some of these accounts are no longer active, although it warns of the reality of contracting of doctors under the provision of services, which explains some of the disparity between the number of accounts and the number of professionals who effectively perform functions in the

13. Undertakes, still in relation to these inactive accounts, the correction of these situations, using internal technical verification processes;
14. Given the impossibility of modelling, altering or correcting the technical aspects of the systems used, he understands that he acted without fault, therefore, no illicit conduct is attributable to him.
He gathered eleven documents and four witnesses.
II - Assessment
1) Regarding the alleged existence of violation of the principle of legality due to the CNPD assuming a condition that, by law, will not (yet) belong to it, it will always be said that such an argument is unfounded. From the outset, and as explained in the draft decision, the CNPD is, for all intents and purposes, and as long as this is not changed, “the national authority whose attribution is to control and supervise compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions on the protection of of personal data, in strict respect for human rights and for the freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Constitution and in the law” (cf. article 22, no. 1 of Law no. 67/98, of 26 October, amended by Law No. 103/2015, of August 24, hereinafter LPDP).
2) Such a provision does not only contain a desire by the national legislator to assign any national matter linked to the protection of personal data to the CNPD, but rather the distinct intention of entrusting it with any matter of this nature that is not specifically prohibited by law. And we do not see how this could violate the principle of legality.
3) In addition, the RGPD contains several innovations tending to standardize the powers of the control authorities throughout the European Union (EU), precisely to allow the useful effect sought by the use of this legal instrument. This concerns, for example, the possibility of any of the control authorities in the EU being equipped with adequate powers of investigation and correction, thus ending the disparity that reigned until the 25th of May.

4) However, in Portugal, the CNPD has had this type of power for a long time, and the relevant GDPR is not new, except in terms of cooperation obligations with other EU supervisory authorities, without forgetting the paradigmatic transition from hetero-regulation (whose most visible face consisted of the prior assessment and authorization of personal data processing) to self-assessment, with those responsible for processing and subcontractors now being responsible for ensuring the legality of the processing of personal data that they carry out, without any any intermediation by the supervisory authorities.
5) In addition to all these arguments, there is another, of a purely formal nature, which is the institutional representation of Portugal that the CNPD already ensures in the EU. Indeed, the new European Data Protection Board, provided for in Section 3 of Chapter VII of the RGPD, must, under the terms of Article 68(3) of the Regulation, be “composed of the director of a supervisory authority of each Member State”. This new body of the European Union presupposes, then, that each country is represented by the director (or president) of each control authority of the various Member States, which, in the case of Portugal, resulted in the integration, as a full member, of the CNPD in CEPD, since the first meeting dated May 25, 2018.
6) As for the principle of typicality invoked by the defendant, it seems to us to be even less applicable. It will suffice, in order to rule it out, to recall, from the outset, the standardizing purpose of the regulation, particularly in terms of the application of fines, uncontroversially expressed in recital 150 of the RGPD “In order to reinforce and harmonize administrative sanctions for violations of this regulation, the authorities supervisory bodies should be empowered to impose fines. This regulation should define the violations and the amount
maximum and the criteria for setting the value of fines arising therefrom [underlined
Process No. 9932/2018 3

our], which shall be determined by the competent supervisory authority, in each individual case, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the specific situation, duly considering, in particular, the nature, gravity and duration of the breach and its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations set out in this Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement.”.
7) In addition to this reference, the Constitutional Court itself has repeatedly referred to the degree of concreteness required of norms that typify administrative offenses. Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque, in his “Commentary on the General Regime of Administrative Offenses”, in annotation 16 to article 2, illustrates this exemplarily when he refers that “the administrative offense based on the violation of general clauses (general duties of care and urbanity) and other specific obligations does not violate the principle of typicality (judgment of TC no. 338/2003, which focused on article 82, paragraph b), of Decree-law no. 422/89, of 2.12). The same can be concluded from the violation of the generic duty regarding the accounting organization (CA decision No. 455/2006, regarding article 14 of Law No. 56/98, and TC judgment No. 198/2010 , relating to Article 29 of Law No. 19/2003).”.
8) Regarding the facts, it is clarifying that the defendant confirms the existence of the access profiles as described in the draft decision. Indeed, the policy for assigning access credentials allowed at least 9 (nine) employees of the “TECHNICIAN/A” functional group to enjoy the access level reserved for the “MEDICO” functional group, which translates into the indiscriminate possibility of consulting of clinical files of all hospital users.
9) Regardless of recognizing the external standardization and availability of a determined set of types of profiles, it was the defendant who voluntarily and consciously determined that those professionals could, through profiles not suited to their functions and professional category, have indiscriminate access to the processes hospital-wide clinicians, rather than establishing

other procedures, perhaps more time consuming, but certainly less intrusive to the protection of personal data that any citizen deserves.
10) Without disregarding this critical judgment, one can understand the arguments related to the inability to determine, a priori, what information is relevant for each of the technicians with the aforementioned access profiles, a difficulty that is exacerbated by the architecture of the systems that do not allow the definition, step by step or casuistry of access to certain clinical information, a fact that, again, cannot be attributed to those who do not have the instruments to remedy or lessen the effects of such construction.
11) We even believe that this hypothesis removes the direct intent of the defendant's conduct, makes the necessary intent questionable, but does not preclude, in any way, the existence of eventual intent. So much so, that the defendant confesses to having always acted with knowledge of the existence of these shortcomings in the system, not refraining however from continuing to attribute undue access privileges to a group of professionals who should never be able to indiscriminately access clients' clinical files.
12) It is unsustainable to defend that any social worker can access the entirety of the client's clinical file in order to be able to carry out his or her function, and such a defense is even more unsustainable if access in these ways is allowed without a time limit.
13) Equally indefensible is the existence of access credentials that allow any doctor, of any specialty, at any time to access customer data from a given hospital centre. The principle of data minimization and the principle of “need to know” (or, in the Anglicism “need to know”), prohibit or intend to prohibit the collection, but also access and other processing of unnecessary information for the intended purpose.

14) For all these reasons, the CNPD cannot admit that the technical limitations mentioned can justify the unrestricted adoption of access validation procedures that practically make the essential core of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data irrelevant.
15) The defendant's allegation, which points to a much greater restrictiveness of the access profiles of non-medical professionals who have the profiles of the functional group "TECHNICIAN" and activity group "MEDICO" is manifestly reductive since, even if such restrictions exist, they were not enough to prevent the CNPD technicians from even seeing a test user created by the defendant's SSI (precisely from the functional group "TECHNICIAN" and activity group "MEDICO") that allowed them to "search for users registered in that hospital institution without restrictions and that he had access permission to all the elements that make up the clinical file of these users”, as stated in the report attached to the draft deliberation (cfr. page 6).
16) By knowingly allowing professionals from different categories to
access to unrestricted information about the clinical process of clients of a
defendant did not take the slightest care to ensure compliance with that principle, having, moreover, circumvented a limitation of the systems that had been adopted for reasons of security and privacy.
17) Added to this is that, according to her own defense, the defendant will never be careful to intercede with the SPMS in order to correct this aspect of the system which, as the recent update demonstrates, should and could be changed in advance.
18) As regards the possibility of accessing information that is not necessary or relevant permitted by these profiles, the inspection team verified and collected proof of access to the PDS from the user account of

test. In fact, as far as it was possible to verify in the context of inspection, the PDS platform does not validate the user's authentication, thus explaining that it was possible to access the PDS with a "TEST USER", which had not associated any mechanographic number or number order (from a doctor or nurse).
19) Contrary to the argument that it is up to hospital centers and
other health care institutions carry out the correct user validation and identification of the corresponding profile, not the PDS.
20) Regarding the maintenance of useless profiles concerning medical professionals
that no longer provide services to and that the latter did not take care to eliminate, the judgment
censorship remains unchanged.
21) Remember that, of the 18 (eighteen) user accounts that the CNPD verified were effectively deactivated, only one corresponded to a medical professional
22) Assuming that this conduct did not cause concrete damage to the protection of personal data of the clients of that hospital center, one cannot, however, ignore or disregard the breach of objective duties of those responsible for the treatment, especially when it is in question the potential access to special categories of data, a concept specified in Article 9(1) of the GDPR, such as health data.
23) It should be noted that the defendant did not deny the existence of such profiles, limiting herself to arguing that some (few or many) of them are due to the hiring, under a service provision regime, of doctors who are only performing functions temporarily no. The concrete and rigorous lack of knowledge of the universe of access accounts that should have been eliminated is a good demonstration of the lack of a reliable auditing system.

24) Equally objectionable is the procedure for creating accounts which, contrary to what has been alleged, is not even fully controlled by the administration of the
25) Indeed, evidence was collected in the context of an inspection that demonstrates that the process of creating accounts is not always governed by the procedure referred to by the defendant. Annex I (page 9) presents the transcription of e-mails exchanged between the Coordinator of the Physiotherapy Sector of
the Directorate of Clinical Pathology and the Information Systems Service (SSI), which expressly determine the request for the creation of user accounts, without any pronouncement on the part of the administration of the
26) Even if it is accepted that the defendant embarked on a path to correct this situation, the fact is that, at the time of the inspection, the creation of accounts did not minimally respect the principles of the RGPD.
27) Regarding the lack of access LOGS, it is confirmed that the computer technician exported the table «sys_log_acessos» with the name «log_acessos_assistant_social.XLS», which presents what appear to be input and output events of a system. It is presumed that they are associated with accesses to SClinico, although this information has not been confirmed.
28) From an auditability point of view, logging in and out of an application provides very limited information about its use. The CNPD recognizes, however, that the inclusion of a higher level of activity registration is dependent on changes in the application logic and that these changes will only be within the reach of the entity that develops the software - in this case the SPMS.

29) Compliance with the recommendations of the CNPD, included in Deliberation No. 674/2018, of July 17, is positively highlighted, which are precisely intended to correct elements considered critical or of substantive relevance.
30) It is recognized that there are updates to the systems provided by the SPMS that follow the correct course, even if potentially not complete, in accordance with the GDPR rules.
The witnesses presented were not heard since the factual matter was generally confirmed and, as for the disputed facts not revealed, they do not require further clarification or contradictory, which results in the eventual testimonies being irrelevant for the discovery of the material truth.

8. In the SONHO application, each user account has two attributes that allow hospital services to manage access profiles to the system: the functional group and the activity group, assigning codes to them; the functional group distinguishes the various functional areas that exist in a hospital environment (e.g., “ADMINISTRATIVE/A”, “TECHNICIAN/A”, “MEDICAL”, “INFORMATICS”, “ASSISTANT”), while the activity group allows distinguishing different areas within a functional group (e.g., in the functional group of “DOCTOR”, there are “SURGEON”, “ANANESTHESIST” and “DOCTOR”);
9. There is a functional group called “TECHNICIAN/A”, which includes different activities - “NUTRITIONIST”, “PHYSIOTHERAPIST”, “PSYCHOLOGIST” and “SOCIAL SERVICE” (cf. Annex I);
