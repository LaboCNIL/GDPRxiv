I. Report
1. The National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) prepared, on June 30, 2021, a draft deliberation, in which the defendant Municipality of Lisbon was charged with the practice, in material authorship, in the consummated form and with intent,
• one hundred and eleven offences, in an effective contest, p. and p. by Article 5(1)(a), Article 6, and Article 9(1), in conjunction with Article 83(5)(a), both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of 27 April 2016 (General Regulation on Data Protection - RGPD), sanctioned with a fine, up to a maximum amount of € 20,000,000.00 each;
• one hundred and eleven offences, in an effective contest, p. and p. by subparagraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 5, in conjunction with subparagraph a) of paragraph 5 of article 83, both of the RGPD, sanctioned with a fine, up to a maximum amount of € 20,000,000, 00 each;
• of an administrative offence, p. and p. by paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 13, in conjunction with paragraph b) of paragraph 5 of article 83, both of the RGPD, sanctioned with a fine, up to a maximum amount of € 20,000,000.00;
• of an administrative offence, p. and p. by subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 35 of the RGPD, in conjunction with paragraph a) of paragraph 4 of article 83, both of the RGPD, sanctioned with a fine, up to a maximum amount of € 10,000. 000.00; and
• of an administrative offence, p. and p. by subparagraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 5, in conjunction with subparagraph a) of paragraph 5 of article 83, both of the RGPD, sanctioned with a fine, up to a maximum amount of € 20,000,000, 00
2. Notified the defendant of the content of said project and, pursuant to the provisions of article 50 of Decree-Law No. 433/82, of October 27, in its current wording (General Regime for Administrative Offenses - RGCO), to present its defence, it came, through the Representative with a power of attorney attached to the process, to claim, in short:
The. The existence of a set of prior questions related to
i. the statute of limitations for the infringement by omission of the impact assessment on data protection;

ii. the omission of prior notice by the CNPD; and
iii. the nullity of the accusation for omission of the subjective elements of the type;
B. That the adoption of procedures relating to the management of notices of demonstrations was based on the tradition that already existed at the time of the competence attributed to Civil Governments;
ç. That the Municipality of Lisbon committed a relevant set of financial and human resources to meet the requirements of the GDPR and adapt internal practices to these requirements;
d. Which corrected the procedure when the complaint was made on March 18, 2021 by^^l
and. Disagree with the CNPD's assessment regarding the subjective element (intention);
f. That there is no sanctioning rule applicable to the defendant, since the application of the fines provided for in the RGPD only apply to the public sector in accordance with the intermediation of the national legislator, which must, under the terms of paragraph 7 of article 83, define the if and when. In the defense, the defendant argues for the lack of a sanctioning rule applicable to non-business entities in the public sector, as it is not expressly included in Law No. 5 of article 83 of the GDPR, which, in their opinion and except for the unequivocal intermediation of the national legislator, always point to the existence of business entities to which the limits relating to annual turnover apply;
g. That, if there is responsibility for the violations that, in part, he admits to have occurred, this was due, in the case of sending the notices to entities without legitimacy to have access to them, from a behavior only attributable to the employees who acted contrary to the Order of 13 April 2013, from the Mayor of Lisbon, which determined that the said notices should only be sent to the Ministry of Internal Administration (MAI) and the Public Security Police (PSP);
H. That the personal data contained in the notices should not, in some cases, be included in the special categories of data provided for in paragraph 1 of article 9, as they do not reveal any of the dimensions protected by that article, in addition to the fact that the

information on the support of the promoters to the causes and manifestations communicated by these notices was widely publicized on social networks, making it "treatable" in the light of the grounds provided for in subparagraph e) of paragraph 2 of the same article 9. In addition, the defendant believes that participation in demonstrations must be considered as a factor that strongly influences, if not obliterates, the reservation and protection that the personal data of the promoters, in theory and in different situations, would deserve;
As for the legality grounds, that the public interest was manifest and that Decree-Law No. 406/74, of August 29, cannot fail to be read in the light of the current reality, in which municipalities do not have the competence to to guarantee a good part of the requirements that the aforementioned diploma demands, namely with regard to the prerogatives of authority and management of the routes;
That the sharing of contact details with the MAI and the PSP is perfectly justified in line with the powers of that ministry and security force and,
That the sharing of personal information with the municipal services is based, on the one hand, on the fact that it is the same entity (in the case of the Municipal Police) and, on the other hand, on the need to coordinate the competent services for matters as different as urban cleaning or the provision of electricity to the demonstrations, with their promoters. And this should be done, taking into account the short period provided for by law (two working days), in the most direct way possible, that is, using the contacts of the promoters;
There was no intent or fault on the part of the Municipality, either because the undue treatment (remittance of notices to entities that were not foreseen in the order) occurred due to a "bureaucratic procedure" and originated in the undetected existence of unjustified information sharing at the time of the assessment of the Municipality's internal compliance with the requirements of the RGPD, promoted using internal staff and external assessment entities, whether due to the aforementioned disrespect for the orders or instructions issued by the Mayor's order;
If there is a subjective imputation, it will always have to be supported by a very tenuous degree of censorship and never by way of intent;

no. That, considering in the abstract the existence of all the infractions imputed to the defendant or only those that the defendant admits actually exist, the application of paragraph 3 of article 83 of the RGPD will always lead to the joint consideration of the infractions, tributary to the principle of absorption, therefore, only a single offense will be considered as all the offenses charged are considered to be closely connected.
3. The defendant did not deny, did not contradict, or even contradict any element of the draft deliberation regarding the charges of violation of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 13 and of the principle of conservation, provided for in subparagraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 5, all of the RGPD, except for the imputation of the same intentionally.
4. The defendant also requested the waiver of fines, pursuant to paragraph 3 of article 44 of Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August, which will be evaluated in Part B of this deliberation.
5. Gathered 28 (twenty-eight) documents and listed 8 (eight) witnesses.
PART A
II. appreciation
6. About the previous questions
The. Regarding the statute of limitations for the infringement by omission of the impact assessment on data protection.
i. The defendant maintains that such an obligation could only be considered enforceable when the GDPR came into application, on May 25, 2018;
ii. It should be noted that the defendant argues that, regarding a set of data processing that consisted of sending information about protesters to entities not provided for in the order of the Mayor of April 13, 2013, the personal data involved do not constitute categories data specials. This specific argument will be discussed below, in point 13. Even so, it will always be said that the consideration of the need to carry out an impact assessment on a specific treatment must have as one of its assumptions the possibility of it focusing on special categories of data, but this is not the only and decisive element that should dictate its realization.

iii. If we pay close attention to Article 35(1), we can infer from it that the need to carry out an impact assessment is not restricted to the presence and processing of special categories of data,
iv. and that whenever there is a susceptibility that it "implies a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons", then such an assessment must take place1,
v. being certain that "A «risk» is a scenario that describes an event and its consequences, estimated in terms of severity and probability. On the other hand, «risk management» can be defined as the coordinated activities that aim to direct and control an organization when it comes to risk."2
saw. The "reference to the «rights and freedoms» of data subjects mainly concerns data protection and privacy rights, but also involves other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of thought, freedom of movement, prohibition of discrimination, the right to liberty, conscience and religion."3
vii. And even when its performance is not mandatory,"..., the mere fact that the conditions leading to the obligation to carry out an IAPD have not been satisfied does not diminish the general obligation that controllers have to apply measures aimed at managing adequately assess the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. In practice, this means that controllers must continually assess the risks created by their processing activities in order to identify when a certain type of processing is "likely to a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.”4
viii. It should always be borne in mind that "In cases where it is not clear whether carrying out an IAPD is necessary, the Article 29 Working Party [and the European Data Protection Board, which succeeded it] recommends that, even so, an IAPD is carried out,
1 'There is only an obligation to carry out a DPIA when the processing is 'likely to involve a high risk for
the rights and freedoms of natural persons" (Article 35(1)).", in Guidelines on the Impact Assessment on Data Protection (DPIA) and which determine whether the processing is "likely to result in a high risk' for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, (p. 5), available at

as a DPIA is a useful tool to help controllers comply with data protection legislation.”5
ix. This means that the potential violation or jeopardizing the exercise of certain fundamental rights, such as freedom of assembly and demonstration, would in itself justify, with regard to the processing of data from promoters, the holding of an IAPD.
x. It should be noted that the Municipality did not have any authorization prior to 2018 and issued by the CNPD that could, as provided for in recital 171 of the RGPD and pursuant to paragraph 4 of article 60 of Law no. of August 8, remain in force and frame these treatments.
xi. Returning to the question of the statute of limitations raised by the defendant, it cannot be accepted that the breach of a duty imposed by the GDPR is postponed by the statute of limitations.
xii. Moreover, until Law no. remains possible (cf. Article 43).
xiii The fact that the IAPD is not carried out in any of the moments prior to sending the communication with the data of the promoters constitutes a clear evidence of the disrespect for this duty.
xiv. In fact, the awareness of the illegality of her actions and the actuality and pertinence of the adoption of different behavior by the defendant is evident from what she states in point 274 of the Defense, when she indicates the initiation of «procedures in order to precede the performance of an assessment impact on the processing of personal data in question and, as well, in order to proceed with the definition of retention periods for these treatments, thus allowing the erasure of personal data that are no longer necessary for the purpose of treatment'.
xv. It is not seen how to admit the lack of an assessment that the person responsible for the treatment recognizes remains fully necessary and enforceable.
B. About the omission of advance warning
5 Cf. Guidance cited (p.9)

i. The defendant defends that what is included in paragraph 3 of article 39 of Law no. of the conduct is not framed as intentional, constitutes a "procedural requirement".
ii. Regardless of the defendant's argument, with which one does not agree, the fact is that the CNPD imputed all the administrative misconduct as intentional, which it maintains, so it becomes out of time to discuss or rebut the assertions made.
iii. It should be noted, however, that the case mentioned in point 126 of the Defense, which runs under German jurisdiction, configures a situation totally different from the one dealt with here, which is not, even so, closed.
iv. In view of the foregoing, any assessment of the arguments put forward with regard to the 'non-application of national rules incompatible with EU law' and those relating to the 'filing for legal inadmissibility of the procedure', which focus on the admissibility of the aforementioned paragraph, is jeopardized. 3 of article 39.
ç. On the nullity by omission of subjective elements of the type
i. The defendant claims that the prosecution [rectius draft deliberation6] does not “specify and materialize the facts (allegedly) revealing, or at least indicative, of the subjective element of the types of offenses charged” (cf. point 191 of the Defense).
ii. Offering a list of jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Justice and the Constitutional Court which, according to the CNPD, only confirm the regularity of the draft deliberation.
iii. It should be noted that what should be made known to the accused, as the accused rightly notes in the cited jurisprudence, is the «sequential, narratively oriented and spatio-temporally circumstantial description of the essential elements for the singularization of the relevant administrative offences; and that this description must contemplate the characterization, objective and subjective, of the action or omission whose imputation is in question» (emphasis added).
6 As Augusto Silva Dias rightly notes, in administrative offences, prosecution is the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor's Office, in the judicial phase, if that phase is reached (cf. Law of Administrative Offenses, 2020, Almedina, §18 of part V).

iv. This is precisely what happened, the CNPD being careful to sequentially describe the facts and behaviors of the defendant that filled the types of administrative offenses for which he is accused, it being evident that the subjective element is fulfilled with the clear, unequivocal and repeated attribution of such behaviors to malicious title.
v. Furthermore, it is common ground that what must be expressly enshrined in the "accusation" are essential elements, repeatedly affirmed by the jurisprudence.
saw. "Therefore, "[in] a criminal offense/or misdemeanor, the accusation must necessarily include, due to its relevance to the possibility of imputing the crime to the agent, that the defendant acted freely (removal of the causes of exclusion of guilt - the defendant was able to determine his action), deliberately (volitional or emotional element of the intent - the agent what the criminal act was) and consciously (imputability - the defendant is imputable), knowing that his conduct was prohibited and punished by law (intellectual element of intent, translated into knowledge of the objective elements of the type)» (cf. the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Coimbra of 01.06.2011 in case 150/10.5T3OVR.C1, Maria Pilar Oliveira)."7
vii. Precisely what was inscribed in points 159 to 163 of the Draft Deliberation.
7. On the argument that the adoption of procedures relating to the management of notices of demonstrations was based on the tradition that already existed at the time of the competence attributed to Civil Governments
i. The defendant pauses in revisiting the procedures carried out by Civil Governments to justify maintaining a way of acting that does not comply with legal requirements.
ii. Based on the protocol established in 2012 by the then Mayor of Lisbon, it describes how warnings were sent (cf. point 213 of Defence) to the entities listed therein (Prime Minister's Office, Security Coordinating Office, Office of the Minister of Internal Administration, Office of the Deputy Minister and Parliamentary Affairs, Public Security Police, Territorial Coordination Unit and Lisbon Municipal Police).

iii. To which were added the Parliament, the Ministries, the Embassies and the municipal services that might be targeted (cf. point 214 of Defence).
iv. The defendant acknowledges that the protocol “did not define the level of information that should be transmitted to these entities” (cf. point 215 of the Defense).
v. Therefore, “the GAP officials limited themselves to sending a copy of the Notice received” (cf. point 217 of the Defence).
saw. According to the defendant, these procedures for sending notices under the terms mentioned above were used to "ensure communication between the competent authorities and the promoters of the demonstrations for the purpose of resolving issues related to public security or of a technical nature and that required immediate solution.” (cf. point 220 of the Defense).
vii. «Which (...) were not compatible (i) with a communication procedure that forced, for example, the PSP to contact the services of the Lisbon City Council so that they could contact the promoters of the demonstration and transmit to them the instructions received , and (ii) with the availability of the data of only one promoter for contact purposes...» (cf. point 221 of the Defense).
viii. The notices were also “sent to the services of the Lisbon City Council whose intervention was necessary following the holding of demonstrations” (cf. point 222 of the Defence).
ix. This whole description points to an evident disorganization of the services, or, as Opinion No. (defective corporate organization) or "autonomous fault for organizational deficit"'.
x. Defect that the Municipality itself assumed (without taking care to correct it properly), in the person of its President, when, on April 13, 2013, it decided to issue an order that amended the procedures provided for in the aforementioned protocol.

AVG/2021/300 5v Process
This order limited the sending to the Ministry of Internal Administration and to COMETLIS/PSP.
And that was communicated to the employees of the GAP (Office of Support to the Presidency).
Which, according to the defendant, ignored its content, maintaining the procedures instituted until then (cf. point 232 of the Defense) and contained in the aforementioned protocol.
Here, too, it seems evident that the defendant was satisfied with the mere issuance of the President's order, not carrying out, as was his obligation, an assessment, even if minimal, of its compliance.
It is strange that a change promoted due to doubts about the legal framework that governed the management of this information, was not accompanied by a dedicated and oriented attention to ensuring that this change was effectively complied with.
Situation that was in force until June 11, 2021, as the defendant tacitly admits, that is, after the complaints of the data subjects and the investigations carried out by the CNPD.
It should be noted that the GDPR entered into force on May 24, 2016, and its application was deferred to May 25, 2018 (see Article 99(2)).
It is the defendant himself who admits, again tacitly (or through negligence, which is irrelevant), that it was only on May 24, 2018, on the eve of the date on which the GDPR would come into force, that "a specific team to guarantee the implementation of the GDPR” (cf. point 241 of Defence).
From this it can be concluded that the Lisbon City Council, well aware that the GDPR was applicable to it from May 25, 2018, only started the process of evaluating the compliance of the processing of personal data with this regulation on the day before its application. and two years after its entry into force.
At no time does it claim, as it could not claim, not knowing either the moment when the GDPR came into force, or the moment when it came to apply.
Since it consciously complied with this manifest delay in the process of adapting to the requirements brought about by the RGPD, but which, by all indications, would extend to multiple domains subject to the discipline of personal data protection, as will be seen below.

xxii. Moreover, it was only on August 1, 2019 that the “Project Team's Action Plan for the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation” was approved (cf. point 256 of Defence).
xxiii. Even so, the treatment regarding the protest notices was not addressed, according to the defendant's version, “certainly due to an administrative error or lapse” (cf. point 257 of the Defence).
xxiv. In view of the succession of events, which begin with the lack of concern with verifying compliance with the 2013 order, which lasts until June 2021, they go through the late assessment of the compliance of internal procedures and personal data processing with the RGPD and end in the inability to diagnosis of the management of the notifications of the manifestations for the purposes of that same evaluation, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to ignore a consistency in the disregard for the rules of protection of personal data and a posture of laxity in the management of the matter related to the processing of data which can only result in the existence of conscious, repeated and voluntary conduct on the part of the Municipality and the President of the Municipal Council.
xxv. It is, in fact, very revealing of this attitude and conduct that the management of these notices and the information contained in them is under the responsibility of the Office of Support to the Presidency, which reported directly to the Mayor of Lisbon (regardless of the effective holder of that body). government over time).
xxvi. Even more revealing is the fact that there are referrals to a councilor (cf. point 46 of the Deliberation Project) and to more than one address related to advisors of the Mayor himself (which happened after May 26, 2020 ), suggesting a behavior commonly known and accepted by the organization.
xxvii. Without this having triggered the slightest critical reaction or correction of behavior on the part of those who had the competence and responsibility to demand it or, at least, provoke it.
xxviii. We return to the argument of the need to share information with the various interlocutors provided for both in the protocol and in the 2013 order, to point out some critical aspects.

xix. On the one hand, the defendant confuses the potential need to communicate the promoters' personal data with the communication of the mere existence of manifestations to an extensive set of entities,
xxx. the latter case being admitted, although without waiving that such communication does not, in itself and by virtue of the chosen addressees, aim at disproportionately limiting the right of assembly and demonstration.
xxxi On the other hand, it is based on an argument of convenience to legitimize processing of personal data not provided for by law.
xxxii. It is recalled that the notice referred to in Decree-Law no. 406/74, of 29 August, in paragraph 1 of article 2, expressly refers to the entities to be notified, today the Municipal Councils, in the past Civil Governments and Municipal Councils, when the demonstrations did not take place in the district capital.
xxxiii. In turn, paragraph 2 of that same article defined precisely what information should be made available by the promoters, namely "name, profession and address".
xxxiv It should be noted that the legislator understood, in 1974, when the means of communication were significantly smaller and with much more restricted access to the general population, to erect a system that was based on the communication of personal data that only luckily would allow communication in time. useful between City Councils and developers.
xxxv. Providing an admittedly short lead time between the time of manifestation and the time of reporting the warning.
xxxvi. If that was the case in 1974, there is no reason to allow that, in the present time, when the means of communication are instantaneous, extensive and almost omnipresent in the lives of citizens and with the CNPD even admitting that the personal data processed today have to be adapted to contemporaneity (collecting emails, telephone numbers and mobile phone numbers), the dissemination of such data by such a significant set of entities is authorized and clearly contrary to the law.
xxxvii. In 1974 there were already ministries, prime minister, services of the Municipal Councils, PSP and GNR and, however, none of these possible interlocutors was contemplated in the legal hypothesis.
xxxviii. The same needs for coordinating resources that are claimed today existed in 1974 and this was never seen as a sufficient argument to open up the sharing of contact between
AVG/2021/300 Case | 7
r
promoters to entities other than those provided for in Decree-Law No. 406/74 (which remains).
xxxix It does not seem likely that the profusion of potential contacts with the promoters in the space of two working days serves any practical purpose, since, in many cases, these are sporadic events, without any context of professionalization in their organization.
xl. In addition to the fact that, in the face of possible harassment from five, six or ten different entities, legitimately responsible for partial aspects related to the holding of the demonstration, contact with one, two or three people cannot be considered minimally useful or appropriate. promote.,
xli. In fact, allowing this multiplicity of contacts to take place could, at the limit, lead to the annulment of the right to assemble and demonstrate, such would be the feasibility requirements potentially pointed out by each of these entities to the promoters of the demonstrations.
xlii. Those who, certainly without the means and knowledge to respond in a qualified way to the various problems raised, could be led to give up or cancel the demonstrations for fear of individual responsibility.
xliii. Likewise, there is no justification for sending personal data to the Security Coordinating Office, or the Prime Minister, or the Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, the Assembly of the Republic or the Presidency of the Republic or even the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
xliv. In fact, when Decree-Law No. 406/74 was amended by Organic Law No. 1/2011, of 30 November, with the extinction of Civil Governments, the national legislator chose to concentrate the powers of reception and processing of communications relating to meetings, rallies, demonstrations and parades in the mayor of the territorially competent municipal council, when he could have considered transferring those powers to the MAI, as he did with regard to other powers of civil governors. The legislative option reveals the intention to prevent possible conditioning of the exercise of fundamental rights of assembly and demonstration resulting from knowledge of the identity of the promoters of the events by holders of political power or those who are directly and hierarchically dependent on them.

xlv. Furthermore, it is not possible to see what relevant public interest would be achieved with access to personal data that could not be carried out without such information or what powers would depend, in their exercise, on such access.
xlvi. Such sharing of personal information cannot but be qualified as indirectly violating the right to assembly and demonstration and directly violating the right to the protection of personal data, two fundamental rights that are constitutionally protected, xlvii. The obligation that seems to underlie the system created by the legislator is that an entity, the Municipality (rectius, an administrative body - the mayor of the territorially competent municipal council) will centralize the contacts that have to happen with the promoters.
xlviii. It will be up to the Mayor (or the body to which he delegates such competence) to promote these contacts and act as interlocutor, xlix. The argument of legal incompetence raised in the 2013 order by the Mayor of Lisbon was as valid at the time, as it is today, as it was in 1974, when, as is well known, the mayors, who were not district capitals, they already had this task; in other words, such an argument corresponds to an interpretation that contradicts the literal content of the norm and that has no support in the other interpretative elements, in particular, in the teleological element and in the historical element.
8. On the commitment of means to meet the requirements of the GDPR
i. The existence of this concern to provide the Municipality of Lisbon with the means and capabilities to assist in compliance with the GDPR, expressed in various initiatives of an organizational, procedural, financial and training nature, is positively highlighted.
ii. It should, however, be noted, as has already been done above, that the failure to take advantage of the two years of vacatio with which the European legislator intermediated the date of entry into force of the regulation and its date of application can only be evaluated negatively, as an additional factor revealing the high censorship of the defendant's conduct, especially with regard to the protection of personal data. 9

i. Correction initiatives initiated after the denunciation made by
ii. At this level, the emphasis is renewed on the assumption of the need to carry out an impact assessment on data protection regarding the treatment of notices of manifestations, as stated in point 274 of the Defense and which contradicts the allegation that the defendant makes in this regard. of the alleged statute of limitations for the breach of that same obligation.
iii. Even so, with regard to the management of the notices, the corrections were insufficient and doubts about the genuine desire to change the procedures in order to bring them into line with the law increase.
iv. Indeed, "limiting" the sending of notices with personal data from promoters to PSP and MAI does not meet the requirements expressed in the Decree-Law and suggests a militant will to violate the applicable legal provisions.
v. As mentioned above, sending this personal information is disproportionate, as the law does not provide for it and the supposed public interest that would be associated with it collides with a legal construction that clearly prefers to centralize the management of contacts with promoters in a single entity.
10. On the subjective elements pointed to the defendant's conduct (willful misconduct)
i. The defendant considers the imputation of the violations contained in the draft deliberation to be intolerable by way of intent.
ii. Pointing out as the only reason for "possible irregularities in the processing of personal data [...] exclusively the result of an error in the design and updating of the procedures intended to comply with the provisions of Decree-Law No. 406/74, of 29 of August» (cf. point 281 of the Defence).
iii. As Augusto Silva Dias states, «The proof of intent, like any subjective element, is made through inferences based on the factual circumstances of the specific case.»9 9

and
iv. «Evidence of intent always requires the reconstitution, based on the circumstances of the case, of the agent's knowledge of the elements of the type and the formal prohibition»10.
v. In the present case, what always transpired in the action of the Municipality of Lisbon was not the concern with compliance with the legislation for the protection of personal data, which it was aware of, as well expressed by its (albeit late) action of conforming the internal procedures with the GDPR, and, as well,
saw. Insufficient correction made in June 2021.
vii. What mattered to the defendant was to ensure that he was not held responsible as the addressee of the rules of Decree-Law No. 406/74, not refraining from endorsing personal data to third parties that he knew by himself could be received and kept.
viii. The order of April 13, 2013 is nothing more than the perfect implementation of this disclaimer that violates the legal precepts that confined the management of personal data to the Mayor.
ix. Order that is indifferent to the right to the protection of personal data, not even fighting for the explanation of the consequences, for the promoters, of the assumed procedures.
x. In addition to this indifference to the violation of the applicable rules, the fact that there is a permanent and objectionable behavior of non-verification of compliance with an order which, due to its nature, object and sensitivity, would require increased attention in its implementation, at least in the times subsequently closest to its publication.
xi. It cannot be accepted that the disrespect for the content of the order by the officials, it should be noted officials and not just an official, from the Office of Support to the Presidency of the Municipality of Lisbon, is a reasonable reason to exempt the defendant from those that are the your obligations.
xii. Since, as has been repeatedly emphasized, the order only limits, not eliminating, the patent violation of Decree-Law No. 406/74 and, reflexively, of the data protection legal regime then in force - Law No. 67/ 98, of October 26 - and, as of May 25, 2018, of the RGPD, with regard to the violation of the principle of lawfulness provided for in paragraph 1 of its article 5.

It should also be pointed out the contradiction of the defendant's defense who, despite understanding that he has no competence to act in the areas that the law itself reserves for him (of the management of manifestations and, by implication, of the notices to the same ones), determining, by order, the sending of notices to external entities, ends up defending the internal and practically indiscriminate sharing between its own services to ensure such competences that it rejected as its own.
The accused cannot still be unaware of the principle included in paragraph 2 of the same article 5, which enshrines a principle of responsibility, through which those responsible for the treatment - the quality that the accused assumes in the treatment of notices data - cannot be limited to the "passive" fulfillment of obligations to which they are bound in terms of protection of personal data, through, in particular, orders or instructions, and must assume an active posture of reiterated verification of this fulfillment within organizations (always that are legal persons).
However, such verification was never carried out, which led to the procedures being practically unchanged.
Furthermore, whenever deviations from the procedure were actually noticed, they were aimed at degrading the protection of the personal data of the persons concerned, through the sharing of their personal information with entities as different as the "Social Services of the Embassy of India" (cf. point 66 of the Deliberation Project) or, even, a private company, Restaurante Quero Lugar que não existe, Lda. (cf. point 113 of the Deliberation Project) Always without any additional, periodic and minimal verification.
Again, all this reality reveals an organizational culture, to say the least, very deficient.
It is undeniable that the defendant was aware of his legal obligations, whether arising from Decree-Law no. not contemplated in the law, with the sole aim of ensuring that they are not held accountable.
In an attitude clearly contrary or, at least, indifferent to the Law and its norms.

xxi. However, «the misdemeanor intent resides in the intellectual knowledge of the elements of the type and in the disrespect for the prohibitions or legal obligations protected by the administrative offences rules»11.
xxii. And there are no doubts about the knowledge of the elements of the type and the verification of the disrespect for the prohibitions or legal obligations on the part of the defendant.
xxiii. If the conditions for the imputation of the conduct with intent are complete, within the limit in the modality of eventual willful misconduct, the accused having foreseen the result as a possible consequence of his conduct and, nevertheless, carrying out such conduct, complying with the respective result.
11. On the absence of a sanctioning rule applicable to the accused
i. The defendant argues that there is no sanctioning rule, since, in short, the application of the fines provided for in the RGPD only apply to the public sector in accordance with the intermediation of the national legislator, which must, under the terms of paragraph 7 of article 83. ° of the GDPR, define the "if" and "to what extent" are those subject to fines.
ii. In defence, the defendant argues for the lack of a sanctioning rule applicable to non-business entities in the public sector, as it is not expressly included in Law No. 5 of article 83 of the RGPD which, in their opinion and except for the unequivocal intermediation of the national legislator, always point to the existence of business entities to which the limits referring to annual turnovers apply.
iii. This thesis cannot be accepted because it does not adhere to the reality of the facts and the applicable legal circumstances.
iv. Article 83(7) of the GDPR provides: 'Without prejudice to the supervisory authorities' powers of correction pursuant to Article 58(2), Member States may lay down rules which make it possible to determine whether and to what extent fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established on their territory.”
11 As explained by Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque, in note 4 to article 8 of the RGCO, in his work 'Commentário do Regime Geral das Contraordenações in the light of the European Convention on Human Rights”.

v. This is one of the precepts that authorize the intermediation of the Member States in the conformation of the regime registered in the RGPD, in the territory of their country.
saw. In the Portuguese case, the national legislator intended to express in paragraph 1 of article 44 of Law no. to public entities.
vii. In it we find the following formulation: «The fines provided for in the GDPR and in this law apply equally to public and private entities.».
viii. We consider the purpose and scope of the formulation to be crystal clear, and the will of the national legislator to subject public entities to the imposition of the fines provided for in the GDPR (as well as in national law) is obvious, in the same way that private entities are subject to them.
ix. Having thus answered the "if" with a resounding yes and the "to what extent", with the same intensity applicable to any other legal person.
x. We do not see how this precept can offer any interpretive difficulty.
xi. And even less is the framework to which public entities will have to be subjected when they do not take the form of companies is accepted as dubious.
xii. If the fines apply "equally to public and private entities", it becomes clear that, mutatis mutandis, if the public entity does not constitute itself as a company, the limits established in the GDPR (and in the law regarding the administrative offenses provided for therein) for all entities that are not companies or whose turnover expressed in the percentages of paragraph 4 and paragraph 5 of article 83 of the RGPD do not allow to exceed respectively 10 (ten) or the 20 (twenty) million euros.
xiii Here, there is no obstacle to legal predictability or legal certainty and certainty that could benefit the defendant and that should serve as a justification for not imposing fines within the framework provided for in the GDPR.
12. On the responsibility of the accused and his employees
i. Also here, the defendant understands, as already mentioned, that his responsibility is non-existent or, at least, negligent and that, if it exists, it is fully and solely endorsable to the employee(s) who failed to comply with the orders. of that dispatch.

ii. Basing this opinion on the fact that there was an order under the responsibility of the Mayor of Lisbon, the aforementioned order of April 2013, which clearly imposed the duty not to forward the notices to entities other than the MAI and the PSP (COMETLIS /PSP).
iii. It happens, on the one hand, and as already noted, that the order is manifestly insufficient, if not even silent on the destination of the personal data contained in the notices.
iv. While it is clear that they should be forwarded to those entities, in all other aspects of the processing (right to information, retention period, security conditions regarding the sending and retention of information) silence reigns.
v. On the other hand, and as has already been profusely demonstrated, the order limited itself to reducing the list of entities not authorized to receive the personal information of the promoters, not taking care, as was its duty, to eliminate these entities from the universe of recipients of the data. personal,
saw. And this obligation is as translucent today as it was in the light of Law No. 67/98, of October 26, amended by Law No. subsequently revoked by Law No. 58/2019, of August 8, which contained, for what is relevant here, the very same principles (with the exception of liability) - cf. Article 5(1) of this law and Article 5(1) of the GDPR.
vii. In addition to these elements, and as already underlined, the defendant never took care to verify, as was his legal obligation, whether this order (however insufficient) was being fulfilled,
viii. Omission that lasted, at least since 2013 and until June 2021, when an orientation from the Chief of Staff of the Mayor determined that personal data (in the notices) should not be shared with entities other than the MAI and the PSP (cf. pp. 435 of Annex I next to the file)
ix. Once again, the violation of the law was repeated in the consignment of recipients of personal data that are clearly not included in Decree-Law No. 406/74.
x. In addition to the clear demonstration of indifference to the legal obligation enshrined in that diploma, as well as to the obligations prescribed by the RGPD, this attitude reveals an obvious mistake on the part of those who manage the services.
AVG/2021/300 Case | 11
xi. 0 which is very revealing of the defendant's organizational culture and his organizational deficit, naturally only attributable to his own.
xii. Moreover, the attribution of responsibilities to the accused cannot fail to be affirmed.
xiii Whether (de jure constituto) by way of what the Superior Council of the Attorney General's Office defended in Opinion No. is found in a "structural defect of the business organization" (defective corporate organization) or "autonomous fault for organizational deficit", or by imputation to a natural person functionally linked to the legal person, but which does not need to be identified or individualized.»
xiv. This is, as Augusto Silva Dias argues, because we follow the argument that «that the model of direct and autonomous imputation is the most correct and should be adopted de jure constitundo»13.
xv. Since this criterion or model «points to autonomous grounds of responsibility of the legal person based on an illicit and fault proper to the organization, poured into the accomplishment of the fact, on which the social reprimand is based»14.
xvi. Refusing any of these positions, and interpreting paragraph 2 of article 7 of the RGCO in a restrictive way, we would be admitting and strengthening a space of unjustifiable and constitutionally dubious non-imputability, in terms of the principle of equality, in the confrontation between the responsibility of natural persons and legal persons.
xvii. In a relationship that, in accordance with the principle set out in paragraph 1 of article 7 of the RGCO, must be considered parified.
xviii It should be recalled, in conclusion, that the 2013 order was not complied with by an official, but by all elements of the Office of Support to the Presidency of the CML and that, even when a councilor had direct knowledge of the forwarding of one of these notices (cf. . point 46 of the Draft Deliberation), no corrective action was requested or even any doubts were raised regarding the ongoing procedures.

AVG/2021/300 11 v process
13. On the categorization of personal data under Article 9(1) of the GDPR
i. In this field, the defendant argues that the processed personal data cannot all be returned to the special categories of data, the processing of which is, as a rule, prohibited, under the terms of Article 9(1) of the GDPR.
ii. The defendant discusses the origins of the demonstrations and their objective, which, admittedly, aims to make public and notorious causes, protests, opinions or identities within society.
iii. However, the accused commits the "capital sin" of confusing the objective of the demonstrations with the objective of the demonstrations warnings.
iv. As for the first, it must be said that even the publicity of the motto that led to the demonstrations does not always aim at or oblige the publicity of the protesters.
v. The phenomenon of "anonymous" demonstrations15 is increasingly known, in which protesters try to remain incognito in order to avoid reprisals from the entities against whom they protest (generally the States).
saw. The growing range of means of identifying, recording and preserving personal information in public places (such as the profusion of video surveillance cameras with and without the possibility of running artificial intelligence programming that allows the rapid identification of protesters) should lead to an updated risk assessment. that these means represent for freedom of expression.
vii. On the other hand, the mere publicity of the person in the context of a given manifestation does not authorize any public or private entity, automatically and unconditionally, to collect, organize and store information about that publicity and person.
viii. The lawful ground provided for in Article 9(2)(e) is just that, a ground, not exempting from compliance with the other requirements in the GDPR to ensure that the processing complies with parameters as relevant as those of the loyalty,
15 In this regard, it is worth noting the example of the demonstrations that took place in Hong Kong, against the local government in protest against the democratic degradation of institutions and in which, for fear of reprisals, thousands of protesters wore masks to avoid being recognized, leading to the state legislation, as reported in the following news item: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49931598.
AVG/2021/300 Case [ 12
transparency and other principles with constitutional dignity that are equally summonable, such as proportionality.
ix. Therefore, it is not possible to absolutize a foundation as if it contained all the legal presuppositions of the processing of personal data.
x. Above all, as is well known, that paragraph 2 of article 9 of the GDPR serves as a catalog of grounds auxiliary to those provided for in article 6 of the same regulation, and it is with this article that we must begin the search for the lawfulness of any treatment .
xi. It is, for all these reasons, unacceptable, the conclusion that the defendant intends to draw that these data, being publicized, cannot fall under the protection of article 9.
xii. In what is an exercise of reprehensible one-dimensional characterization of personal data, when taken in the sense that, as it refers to a fundamental right with public resonance, it does not admit a scope of reservation or protection beyond that publicity.
xiii This "nonsense" that the defendant points out regarding the consideration of the protection of the data of the protesters in the scope of article 9, despite the content of these data having been freely publicized, reflects a misunderstanding of the different stages and different treatments that the personal data can suffer.
xiv. And, as already mentioned, if we all admit that, in the context of the demonstration, the protesters and the promoters, as a rule, unconditionally publicize their position,
xv. For this reason, we must not transform this exercise located and limited to a given situation and at a given moment into a catalog of people aligned with their ideas, orientations and religions, unconditionally maintained and managed by anyone.
xvi. Furthermore, the discussion and the problem should be centered on what really matters and that is the sudden transfer of personal data contained in notices of demonstrations to third parties and not provided for by law.
xvii. Instead of dwelling on a discussion, here spurious and inconsequential, about the more or less public character of these gatherings.
xviii Not least because there will not be many demonstrations in which the demonstrators, promoters or not, reveal their name, address and profession to all who may come into contact with them during the course of the same.

AVG/2021/300 12v Process

xix Another point that the defendant tries to raise is the fact that, in certain notices, the personal data presented refer to data subjects representing legal persons or public entities.
xx And, therefore, he argues that such data cannot be traced back to special categories of data, since those people will not be associated with those events.
xxi. Firstly, it must be reaffirmed that the sending of personal information (whose treatment is delimited by law) to entities not provided for in the law violates the principle of lawfulness, loyalty and transparency, regardless of the link that may be established between these people and the causes of the manifestations.
xxii. Then, the representation of legal persons does not automatically mean the disassociation of these persons from the causes and notices that are sent to the Municipality of Lisbon, and the situations in which this may eventually happen are rare.
xxiii. And what really matters, from the moment these notices are sent, is whether or not these people are listed as prosecutors.
xxiv. If so, as is the case, it is not seen how they can be dissociated from the demonstrations (and ideas, positions and protests) promoted.
xxv. However, the defendant is right in two cases,
xxvi. In point 521 of the Defense, refers to the notice regarding the event "Cultural Manifestation - Colombina Clandestina", which does not, effectively, have connotations with any of the types of personal data provided for in paragraph 1 of article 9 of the RGPD .
xxvii. Also in point 528 there is a notice referring to a concentration "to honor Mário Nunes, a Portuguese volunteer who fought the Islamic State in Syria".
xxviii. In the latter case, it is more debatable whether or not we can qualify the promoters as being linked to manifestations of a political, philosophical or religious nature, even though a direct link can be promoted between the homage to the man and the homage to the cause for which he fought and died. .
xix. Without prejudice to this interpretative path and because nothing is said in the notice that makes this direct link, it is accepted that there are also no special categories of personal data processed here, so these two cases will be considered as non-special personal data processing operations. .
AVG/2021/300 Case | 13
14. On the joint consideration of the conducts
i. The defendant understands that the 225 administrative offenses are closely connected, which prevents the application of the effective competition institute,
ii. before demanding recourse to the provisions of Article 83(3) of the GDPR,
iii. which presupposes an absorption system whereby “the joint punishment of all offenses is carried out only within the limits of the legal framework provided for the most serious offence” (cf. point 672 of the Defence).
iv. Although some of the arguments explained in the defense may be borne out, such as the interconnection between the 225 administrative offenses at issue here, one does not agree with the assertion that Article 83(3) constitutes an absorption system.
v. Regardless of the arguments for or against this perspective, the first binding decision issued by the European Data Protection Board under Article 65 of the GDPR16 cannot be ignored.
saw. The CNPD, in order to guarantee the objectives of coherent application of the RGPD in the various Member States, must follow the binding interpretation established there concerning, among other matters, the aforementioned paragraph 3 of article 83 of the RGPD.
vii. Therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that, in the event of application of Article 83(3), that is, when 'the controller or processor infringes, intentionally or through negligence, in the context of the same processing operations or of linked transactions, various provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount specified for the most serious breach.
viii. Take into account each of the violations that have been proven, and they must contribute to the determination of the final total value of the single fine to be applied to the agent, without such single fine being able to exceed the maximum amount abstractly considered of the frame that corresponds to the most serious violation of all those considered.
ix. This means, in the present case, in which we have 225 administrative offenses in total, but in which they are divided into 224 administrative offenses to which the maximum limit provided for in no.

15. Regarding the other arguments of the defense, it is understood that they have already been answered in the subsequent points, not requiring additional assessments.

III. With the elements contained in the case file, of interest for the decision, we consider the following facts to have been proven
i. Collection of personal data from promoters
17. The Municipality of Lisbon collects information on individuals who subscribe to notices for the holding of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades in public places or open to the public, whether they are promoters of such events or representatives of promoting associations.
18. This information corresponds, at least, to the name.

iii. Personal data registration
132. The Municipality of Lisbon records all notices, as well as communications made after they have been processed, in the GESCOR document management system.
133. From those documents and the registration in GESCOR, the Municipality creates an Excel file with the following information about each manifestation; registration number in GESCOR,

National Data Protection Commission
identification of the promoter or his representative, who sent the notice, date, time, place and subject of the demonstration (cf. pages 118 to 430 of Annex I of the Report).
iv. Preservation of personal data
134. From January 2012 until at least June 22, 2021, the Municipality of Lisbon keeps the list of events subject to notice in the aforementioned Excel file (see pages 118 to 429 of Annex I of the Report).
135. It also keeps in the GESCOR document management system, the documents mentioned in point 26 of the Draft Deliberation, at least from June 2018 until at least June 22, 2021 (cf. Annexes II to V of the Report).
v. Information provided to promoters on the processing of their data
136. The only information that is transmitted to promoters, regarding operations on the data they hold, is contained in the standardized response acknowledging receipt of the protest notice (cf. Annex I of the protocol referred to in point 18 of the Draft Deliberation ) and reads as follows: «Following the same, and in view of the combined provisions of paragraph 1 of article 2 of Decree-law n.2 406/74, of 29 August, in the wording of the Organic Law 1/2011, of 30 November, with paragraph 2 of article 3 of the same diploma, we inform you that it is the responsibility of the Lisbon City Council to forward the demonstration communications to the Office of His Excellency the Minister of Internal Administration and to Mr. Lisbon Metropolitan Commander of the Public Security Police, for the purposes legally provided for in Decree-Law No. 406/74, of 29 August».
137. No other specific information is available on the Lisbon Municipality's website regarding the treatment of information relating to the promoters of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades.
saw. Impact Assessment on Data Protection
138. The processing of personal data under analysis, because it treats special categories of data on a large scale, enjoys a reinforced regime of protection in the RGPD that is based not only on the strictest conditions for its treatment but also on the obligation to

AVG/2021/300 30v Process
carrying out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) in accordance with Article 35(3)(b) of the GDPR.
139. The Municipality of Lisbon, despite having carried out AIPD for processing by the Department of Support to the Municipal Organs and Services (to which the GAP belongs), did not include in this evaluation the processing of personal data carried out in the scope of notices of meetings, rallies , demonstrations and parades (cf. pages 65 to 110 and 116 of Annex I of the Report).
vii. subjective element
140. Consequently, the Municipality of Lisbon carried out a series of operations on information concerning natural persons, in the exercise of a specific public activity, which necessarily results in an impact on their privacy and freedom and was obliged to know the legal framework in that could in fact carry out this set of operations and conform the procedures and actions in the light of the rules and principles of the RGPD.
141. The Municipality of Lisbon acted freely, deliberately and consciously, in sending the one hundred and eleven electronic communications, with information on individuals who subscribed to the notices of meetings, rallies, demonstrations and parades, to the services of the Municipality of Lisbon, who did not need to know that personal information for the preparation and execution of public tasks, knowing that their conduct was prohibited and sanctioned by law.
142. The Municipality of Lisbon acted freely, deliberately and consciously, when sending the one hundred and eleven electronic communications, with information regarding natural persons whose data were included in the notices of meetings, rallies, demonstrations and parades to the above third parties identified (cf. above, points 21 to 131), for an unexplained and unlawful purpose, knowing that their conduct was prohibited and sanctioned by law.
143. Likewise, the Municipality of Lisbon acted freely, deliberately and consciously, as it kept the information regarding the promoters of the above-identified demonstrations, even after the purpose that motivated the collection had been exhausted, knowing that their conduct was prohibited and sanctioned by law.
144. Afterwards, the Municipality of Lisbon acted freely, deliberately and consciously, in carrying out the operations on the personal information described above, without having previously or, in the first
AVG/2021/3Q0 Process
31
0
CNPD
National Data Protection Commission
communication of response, informing the respective holders, knowing that their conduct was prohibited and sanctioned by law.
145. Finally, the Municipality of Lisbon acted freely, deliberately and consciously, by not having carried out the impact assessment of the processing of information on highly sensitive personal data, due to the harmful consequences that it may have on the fundamental rights of their holders, well aware that their conduct was prohibited and sanctioned by law.
IV. Reasoning of the de facto decision
146. The facts given as established resulted from the inspection report and its annexes, which contain documentary evidence of the sending of notices from the promoters of the demonstrations to the entities described in the facts, as well as the statement obtained following that inspection.
V. Right
The. Responsible for processing personal data
147. The information relating to the natural persons who subscribed to the notices of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades, either as promoters or as representatives of associations promoting the events, because they identify these persons, correspond to personal data, under the terms of Article 4(1) of the GDPR.
148. The collection, communication, recording, analysis and conservation of this information are part of the concept of processing personal data, defined in paragraph 2) of article 4 of the RGPD.
149. According to Article 4(7) of the GDPR, the person responsible for processing personal data is the public legal person that determines the purposes and means of such processing. In the present case, given that a national legislative act provides that the notice of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades must contain certain personal data of the promoters and must be sent to the mayor of the territorially competent municipal council, there is no doubt that the person responsible for the processing of personal data in question is the legal person Municipality of Lisbon - cf. Article 2, No. 1 and 2, of Decree-Law No. 406/74, of 29 August, as amended by Organic Law No. 1/2011, of 30 November.

AVG/2021/300 31v Process
150. It should be noted that the interpretation adopted by the Municipality of Lisbon, by order of the Mayor dated May 13, 2013 (see page 31 of Annex I to the Report), according to which «the Municipality does not have unequivocal legal competence, nor the necessary police means to exercise the provisions of DL n° 406/74 of 29 August, so we limit ourselves to forwarding the communication received, and to MAI and COMETLIS/PSP responsible for any damages that result from the action or omission in the treatment of the communication», does not exclude the responsibility for the processing of personal data carried out by the Municipality.
151. In fact, regardless of the ownership of the competence to prevent or condition the exercise of the constitutional right to demonstrate, the Municipality of Lisbon collects, records and preserves personal data of the promoters and communicates them to third parties, being, therefore, indisputably responsible for these same processing of personal data.
152. Another is the question of whether the communications of personal data of the subscribers of the notices addressed to the Mayor of Lisbon will be justified in the context of the execution of that legal diploma, which will be analyzed below, in points 164 to 198.
B. Special personal data processing
153. The personal data being processed, as they concern promoters (or representatives of promoters, when these are associations) of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades, go beyond mere identification data and contact details of their holders, integrating the special categories of data, listed in paragraph 1 of article 9 of the GDPR. This with the exception pointed out in the appraisal (cf. above, point 13, xxvi to xxix) regarding the notices contained in points 521 and 528 of the Defendant's Defense and which will be taken into due account in the assessment of the fines to be imposed. In fact, since their holders are associated with the organization of initiatives for the expression and defense of certain ideas, the personal data processed reveals, in particular, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions or sexual orientation.
154. Bearing in mind the discriminatory potential of these personal data, the RGPD has a general rule forbidding its processing, only admitting it in very limited cases, which
0
AVG Process/2021/300 32
/
CNPD
National Data Protection Commission
are essentially based on the holder's explicit consent or on the basis of law and provided that the law contains appropriate safeguards.
155. In fact, the processing of sensitive data enjoys a reinforced regime of protection in the GDPR, which is based not only on the strictest conditions for its processing, but also on the obligation to carry out an impact assessment on data protection (AIPD), in accordance with Article 35(3)(b) of the GDPR.
156. The Municipality of Lisbon was obliged to carry out an IAPD, since the processed data almost invariably fall under Article 9(1) of the GDPR and its processing is carried out on a large scale, comprising the entirety of the universe of subscribers to notices of meetings, rallies and demonstrations. In fact, Lisbon concentrates a large number of initiatives of this nature, as it is the capital of the country, where the main institutions and sovereign bodies are located, as well as diplomatic representations, covering, therefore, a very wide universe of data subjects, as organizers of rallies, demonstrations and other types of meetings in public places.
157. It was found that the controller did not carry out the legally due IAPD, and from which he would not be exempt under Article 60(4) of Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August, for not having, under the previous data protection law - Law no. 67/98, of 26 October - obtained from the CNPD the proper authorization for this data processing.
158. The purpose of an IAPD is precisely to verify that the legal obligations regarding the protection of personal data are complied with, namely regarding the principles applicable to data processing, as well as to analyze the risks inherent in the processing of data to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, and adopt the necessary and appropriate technical and organizational measures to minimize such risks to acceptable levels.
159. It is therefore incumbent upon the person responsible for processing, in this case the Municipality of Lisbon, to take special care in the processing of data relating to the exercise of the fundamental right to assemble and demonstrate, as we are dealing with sensitive data, which was not the case.

AVG/2021/300 32v Process
160. Thus, the Municipality of Lisbon, by not carrying out the AIPD, violated the provisions of subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 35 of the RGPD.
d. Grounds for the legitimacy of data processing
161. The processing of personal data in question is carried out, first of all, to fulfill a legal obligation to give written notice of the intention to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades in public places or open to the public. Such notice must be signed by three of its promoters, duly identified by name, profession and address (cf. paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 2 of Decree-Law n.° 406/74).
162. It follows that this processing of personal data is based on the combined provisions of Article 6(1)(c) and Article 9(2)(g), both of the GDPR. It should be noted, however, that the processing of data, in order to preserve its legal status, must respect the purposes of the legislation that provides for it.
163. In this sense, the collection of personal data sent by the promoters, in paper or by electronic means, as well as their registration, organization and conservation by the Municipality of Lisbon constitute personal data processing operations, within the meaning of paragraph 2) of article 4 of the RGPD, and are legitimized as a whole by Decree-Law No. 406/74.
and. Dissemination of data within the Municipality
164. It is also apparent from the facts described above, in points 21 to 131, that the Municipality of Lisbon disseminated, by e-mail, to various services and municipal internal offices, not only information regarding the event to be held, but also the identity and contact details of all the promoters of these meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades, as well as other personal data contained in the aforementioned notices.
165. As an impact assessment was not carried out on the processing of data relating to notices of the exercise of the right to assemble in a public place, it is not possible to assess the reasons underlying the sending of personal data of the promoters of these initiatives to various recipients within the County.

166. It could be understood that, given the powers attributed to the Mayor by Decree-Law No. 406/74, namely that of reserving a place for the holding of events, and, therefore, the need to manage the occupation of spaces, the strict information regarding the realization of such initiatives, without the personal data of the promoters, find justification. The same applies to other municipal services that, given their functions, need to know the place, date and time of the events, such as urban cleaning services.
167. However, receiving the identity and contact details of the promoters is already absolutely irrelevant and excessive for the fulfillment of their functions.
168. The same can be said of sending the personal data of the promoters to advisors of the Mayor, not even in this case, the need to disseminate such personal data (see above, points 72 to 131).
169. It can be conceivable that, for logistical reasons in the organization of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades, it is necessary, in some cases, for a municipal service to have contact with the promoter to directly arrange planning details (e.g., for the installation of fountains on-site power). In that case, sending such data could be justified.
170. However, in compliance with the principle of proportionality, in the areas of necessity and prohibition of excess, the CNPD believes that, if there is a need to communicate to some municipal services the promoter's contacts for a direct interaction of the services with the promoters, it is not necessary In any case, the personal data of all promoters included in the notice17 must be communicated, since, in order to reach the purpose of possible contact with those who organize the initiative, it will be sufficient for the municipal services to have the name and contact details of a person, there is no need to gather the personal data of all promoters.
171. Consequently, the Municipality of Lisbon violated the principle enshrined in subparagraph c) of no. , in addition to having also sent the data of all the promoters (whose number, in some cases, reached the
17 At least three (3), as provided for in Article 2(2) of Decree-Law No. 406/74.

10 - cf. above, point 108). In accordance with the so-called data minimization principle, personal data must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”.
172. The extent of the internal dissemination of personal data of this sensitive nature, without being duly substantiated, in addition to being clearly unnecessary and excessive, potentiates the abusive disclosure of personal data, in proportion to the wide universe of people who become aware of them, without the controller has no control over it, due to the absence of technical and organizational measures for this purpose.
f. Communication of data to third parties
173. However, the communication of personal data by the controller to third parties constitutes an additional data processing, therefore it lacks a condition of autonomous lawfulness and the explanation of a specific purpose for this transmission of data to third entities. Let us then see whether Decree-Law No. 406/74 can also constitute the legal basis on which such communication of data can be based.
174. In addition to the powers expressly attributed by that legal diploma to the mayor of the territorially competent municipal council (indicated in point 6 of the Draft Deliberation 2021/16, of 30 June), some specific powers are also attributed to other authorities (named in the diploma as "competent authorities"), such as those resulting from the application of article 5 (order to interrupt the meeting), article 6 (change of scheduled routes and article 7 (adoption of necessary measures to avoid interference from counter-demonstrations, including ordering its agents to appear).
175. Bearing in mind the competences described above in the area of public safety and in the area of regulation of road traffic for traffic management, these are performed, in the territory of the Municipality of Lisbon, by the PSP and, as far as traffic regulation is concerned, by the Lisbon Municipal Police (PML) on public roads under the jurisdiction of the Municipality, possibly in cooperation with the PSP (cf. Article 4(2) and Article 5(2)(i), both of the Decree-Law no. 13/2017, of 26 January, which establishes the regime for municipal police in Lisbon and Porto).
AVG/2021/300 Case | 34
f'
176. In this regard, it should be noted that, if there is a need to change the routes initially programmed and included in the notice sent to the mayor, “the order to change the routes will be given in writing to the promoters” (cf. no. 2 of the Article 6 of Decree-Law No. 406/74). Likewise, the existence of any objections to the implementation of the initiative due to non-compliance with the legal requirements is communicated in writing to the promoters (cf. paragraph 2 of article 3).
177. However, Decree-Law No. 406/74 does not provide for who is the interlocutor of the promoters in the situations described above, nor does it provide in any rule that there is direct contact between the competent authorities (PSP and PML) and the promoters. meeting, rally, demonstration or parade. There is nothing to indicate that the competent authorities need to know in advance the identity and contact details of the organizers of the initiatives.
178. Contrary to what is stated by the controller in the standard response sent to the promoters, to acknowledge receipt of the notice, in which the forwarding of the notice with the promoters' personal data to the PSP18 is justified, for the purposes legally provided for in the Decree -Law No 406/74 with reference to the combined provisions of Article 2(1) and Article 3(2), those rules do not imply the communication of the personal data of the promoters of the initiatives.
179. In fact, the first legal provision referred to is the one that confers competence on the Mayor as the addressee of the notices; the second reference concerns possible objections to the holding of events by these: (i) having an «object or purpose» contrary to the provisions of article 1; (ii) provide for routes that need to be changed, under the terms of article 6; (iii) provide for the holding of events in a place not available for that purpose, in accordance with article 9; (iv) require distance restrictions in relation to certain buildings or spaces, pursuant to article 13. As a result, it is not the responsibility of the controller, in order to comply with the provisions of Decree-Law no. regarding the holding of the meeting, that is, date and time, place and object and, if applicable, route.

180. In fact, that legal diploma only provides, 'for security reasons', the possibility for the mayor to request an opinion, 'when necessary and convenient', from the military authorities or other entities, with the aim of preventing initiatives are carried out located less than 100 meters from some of the most sensitive areas (cf. Article 13). It is not, therefore, a matter of reinforcing the police mechanism or prohibiting the holding of the meeting, based on the identity of its promoters. Such communication of personal data is therefore not covered by law.
181. Given the free exercise of citizens' right to peacefully gather in public places, recognized in Article 45 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (CRP) and in Decree-Law No. 406/74, it is accepted that the ratio of the diploma, even due to its particular historical context, suggests that the interaction with prosecutors is not done directly with the police, but with the mayor (and, in the first version of the diploma, with the civil governor in the capitals of district), at least before the event takes place.
182. And the truth is that the amendment to the diploma in 2011 kept the same solution, without changing the ratio legis.
183. And what comes from saying is valid, in parallel, for communication to the Minister of Internal Administration and the Prime Minister (or their respective offices). Nothing in the law legitimizes such communication with personal data, which is understandable taking into account the political nature that marks most situations in which the fundamental right to assembly and demonstration is exercised. This is a communication that has no support in Decree-Law No. 406/74, a conclusion that is reinforced by the historical context of its approval and also by the fact that Organic Law No. 1/2011, when it extinguished civil governments , have specifically transferred this competence to the mayors and not to members of the Government or the security forces.
184. Even assuming that, in certain circumstances, some rules contained in Decree-Law No. 406/74, namely those related to the preparation and logistics of the initiative, were easier to implement through direct contact between the competent authorities (PSP and PML) and the promoters, the truth is that there is no legitimate basis for the Municipality of Lisbon to communicate personal data to PSP or PML, since there is no legal rule that provides for it.

185. In fact, the communication of personal data to these third parties has no legal basis, since, as data covered by Article 9(1) of the GDPR, there is a general prohibition on their processing, only derogable, in this case, by the explicit consent of the data subject or by a legal provision that expressly provides for such communication of data for certain purposes, and provided that this is proportionate to the objective pursued, respects the essence of the right to the protection of personal data and provides for measures appropriate and specific measures that safeguard fundamental rights. Given that in the two cases in which special categories of data are not involved, such reasoning is, with the necessary adaptations, applicable, since, there, too, there is no other legal basis than the consent of the data subjects. that could be seen as suitable to frame the respective treatment.
186. In short, the communication by the Municipality of Lisbon of personal data of the promoters of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades to PSP and PML lacks legitimacy, in violation of the principle of legality, enshrined in subparagraph a) of no. Article 5(1) of the GDPR, which requires that personal data be processed lawfully in relation to the data subject.
187. A completely different matter concerns the communication by the Municipality of Lisbon to the competent authorities for the purposes of Decree-Law no. without, however, letting them know the identity of their promoters, that is, without personal data.
188. The CNPD verified that the Municipality of Lisbon communicated the personal data of the promoters of the initiatives to a wide range of third parties, which regularly included the Office of the Prime Minister, the Office of the Minister of Internal Administration and the Office Security Coordinator (cf. described above, in points 21 to 129).
189. The Security Coordinating Office (GCS), in turn, is constituted, pursuant to Article 21(2) of Law No. 53/2008, of 29 August, last amended by Law No. 21/2019, of 25 February, by the following entities: Secretary-General of the Internal Security System, who presides; Secretary General of the Republic's Information System; General Commanders of the National Republican Guard (GNR) and of the Maritime Police; national directors of the PSP, the Judiciary Police (PJ) and the Foreigners and Borders Services (SEF); information service directors

and Security (SIS) and the Strategic Defense Information Service (SIEDM), National Maritime Authority; National Aeronautical Authority, National Civil Aviation Authority, President of the National Civil Protection Authority, Director General of Reinsertion and Prison Services. All these entities, as members of the GCS, are systematically recipients, and completely contrary to the law, of the identification and contact details of the promoters of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades.
190. In addition to these entities, it was still the usual practice of the data controller to send personal data from organizers of rallies or demonstrations to the public or private entity with which the initiative was planned, such as the Presidency of the Republic, the Assembly of the Republic, the Navy Museum or the Coliseu dos Recreios.
191. It was also verified by the CNPD that the personal identification and contact data of the promoters of such initiatives were communicated to embassies and consulates, when meetings were scheduled in the vicinity of these places. In addition, this communication of personal data was carried out even when the demonstrations took place in a place far from diplomatic representations. It was also verified that the Municipality of Lisbon communicated the personal data of the organizers of demonstrations to other foreign entities, such as the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (cf. above, points 23, 42, 65, 67, 88 and 104).
192. As stated above, the communication of personal data to these third parties has no basis of legitimacy, since, as data covered by Article 9(1) of the GDPR, there is a general prohibition on its treatment, which can only be derogated, in this case, by the explicit consent of the data subject or by a legal provision that expressly provides for such communication of data for certain purposes, and provided that this is proportionate to the objective pursued, respecting the essence of the right to data protection and provide for appropriate and specific measures to safeguard fundamental rights. And as for the two cases in which there are no special categories of data involved, we have also seen that only the consent of the data subjects would be an appropriate basis to authorize their treatment.
193. It is noted that each of the data communications carried out by the controller to third parties violated the principle of lawfulness, provided for in subparagraph a) of paragraph 1
AVG/2021/300 Case | 36
í
of article 5 of the GDPR, as it lacked legitimacy (or lawfulness) under the GDPR.
194. In addition, the conduct of the Municipality of Lisbon, in always communicating data of this sensitivity to such a large number of third parties, leads to the proliferation of data processing related to political, philosophical or religious convictions, outside municipal control, through the aggregation of the identification the organizers of rallies or demonstrations. This is all the more evident at the national level, with repeated sending to certain recipients.
195. However, the communication of personal data to foreign entities, because associated with expressions of displeasure or rejection of certain government policies or revealing a critical expression of decisions or other actions by certain organizations or States, may represent, in addition to the violation of the right fundamental to the protection of personal data, additional risks to the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the promoters of such initiatives.
196. The constitutional protection granted in Portugal to freedom of expression, the right to assemble and demonstrate and freedom of association (cf. Articles 37, 45 and 46 of the CRP), as well as the provisions of the Decree -Law No. 406/74, do not allow public entities to violate the law in such a gross way, putting in crisis not only these fundamental rights, but also putting at risk, eventually, the physical integrity and lives of the people who promoted this meeting, rally, demonstration or parade or their family members.
197. Moreover, it is not clear what the aims of the Municipality of Lisbon are for sending the identification and contact details of the promoters of rallies or demonstrations to the diplomatic representations, in a clear demonstration of disproportionality.
198. Furthermore, when sending personal data to embassies or consulates of third countries, the controller is also carrying out an international transfer of data, since such locations constitute the national territory of the State they represent. Under the GDPR, this would only be possible if, in addition to having a legal basis for communicating data to third parties, the Municipality of Lisbon used one of the legal instruments for the transfer of data provided for in Chapter V of the GDPR, which is also not verified.

g. Conservation limitation principle
199. It was verified by the CNPD that the Municipality of Lisbon keeps the personal data of the promoters of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades without having established any maximum period to keep this data (cf. pages 118 to 429 of Annex I of the Report).
200. In accordance with Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, personal data must be kept "only for the period necessary for the purposes for which they are processed". However, in the present case, the purposes of data processing are considered to have been achieved after carrying out the initiative object of the notice without the occurrence of incidents that would lead to the maintenance of this information for communication to the competent authorities. There would also be a need to keep the data, in situations where decisions are challenged under the terms of Decree-Law No. 406/74.
201. The RGPD admits that the data can be effectively anonymized, that is, without allowing the identification of the holders, and after this operation they are kept. In this case, it would be a matter of preserving information, even for historical or statistical reasons, on the number of initiatives carried out, the places and the object of the exercise of the right to meet in a public place.
202. However, the data controller does not have any data retention policy in relation to this treatment, a failure that the realization of an IAPD would certainly have addressed. The principle of conservation limitation is based on the assumption that the maintenance of personal data, when they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected, increases the probability that they become outdated, allows the definition of a profile of the person over time, potency to its abusive use.
203. When dealing with special categories of data, relating to political, philosophical or religious opinions and beliefs, the seriousness of storing these personal data is much higher, insofar as their processing must always be viewed as a derogation from a general rule prohibiting treatment, precisely because of its sensitive nature and its discriminatory potential, with a strong negative impact on the rights, freedoms and guarantees of data subjects.

204. In this sense, the controller should have taken special care in the processing of this personal data and reduce to the minimum possible the level of interference with the rights and freedoms of the promoters of this type of initiative.
205. It is therefore concluded that the Municipality of Lisbon violated the principle of limiting data retention, recognized in subparagraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 5 of the GDPR, by keeping the personal data of the promoters (and, in the case of associations, their representatives) of meetings, rallies, demonstrations and parades, after the purpose for which such personal data was collected has already been achieved.
206. The Municipality of Lisbon does not have any uniform procedure established for the collection of personal data, within the scope of notices concerning the exercise of the right to assemble in a public place. It also does not have any public information available on its website on how to send a notice of this nature to the Mayor, in compliance with the communication provided for in Decree-Law No. 406/74.
207. In this way, the data subjects (promoters or their representatives) are not provided with any of the information required by article 13 of the GDPR prior to the collection of personal data, namely who are the recipients of the personal data and, if there are data transfers to third countries or international organisations, the existence of an adequacy decision or under which appropriate safeguards or derogations (cf. Articles 45, 46 and 49 of the GDPR) the data are transferred, or , what is the period of storage of personal data, or the rights that the data subjects have.
208. The controller also fails to provide the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR, when acknowledging receipt of the notice, pursuant to Article 2(3) of Decree-Law No. 406/74. The CNPD verified that the Municipality gives a standard response, in which it is informed that it is up to the Lisbon City Council to forward the manifestation communications to the Office of His Excellency the Minister of Internal Administration and to Mr. Lisbon Metropolitan Commander of the Public Security Police, for the purposes legally provided for in Decree-Law No. 406/74, of 29 August.

209. Not considering, at this point, the question of the alleged competence to "forward" communications of the notices received by the Municipality of Lisbon, it only appears that, also after the receipt of the notice, the list of information of article 13 is not provided. ° of the GDPR. It should be noted, however, that data subjects are informed that their personal data will be communicated to the Office of the Minister of Internal Administration and to the Metropolitan Commander of Lisbon of the PSP, completely omitting all other recipients to whom the Municipality of Lisbon actually sends the personal data.
210. Providing information to data subjects on the processing of personal data constitutes their right, insofar as such information allows them to know exactly who is responsible for the treatment, how their personal data are processed and for what purposes, on what legal basis and for how long, to whom their data can be communicated, what rights they have.
211. Compliance with article 13 of the GDPR implements the principle of transparency, which is naturally associated with the principle of lawfulness and the principle of good faith, since personal data must be "the subject of a lawful, fair and transparent” (cf. Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR).
212. By not providing the promoters of meetings, rallies, demonstrations or parades with the information required by law, either before or after, the controller did not guarantee the right to information, in violation of article 13 of the GDPR
SAW. Non-application of rules of Law No. 58/2019, of August 8
213. The CNPD, by virtue of the primacy of European Union Law, with the grounds set out in Deliberation/2019/494, of 3 September19, decides not to apply, in the specific case, with regard to the right to information, subparagraph h) of paragraph 1 of article 37 of Law n.° 58/2019, of 8 August, under the terms imposed by article 13 of the GDPR, since it distinguishes the relevant information from the others (whose omission would only lead to an administrative offense serious - see Article 38(1)(b) of the Law), a distinction that is neither enshrined nor recognized in Article 83 of the GDPR.

214. In fact, in subparagraph b) of paragraph 5 of the latter article, the violation of the rights of data subjects under Articles 12 to 22 of the GDPR is subject to the heaviest penalty frame, distinguishing, nor leaving space to distinguish, due to the omitted information elements20.
215. Furthermore, the breach provided for in Article 83(5)(b) of the GDPR encompasses all dimensions of the right to information and not just the failure to provide information. This means that equivocal, erroneous, incomplete, dated or out-of-date information (violating article 13) also fits in the hypothesis of that rule of the RGPD, so the limitation of the sanctionable offense only to the omission of information is incompatible with the GDPR
216. The CNPD also decides not to apply, in the specific case, the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 38 of Law no. European Union, based on the aforementioned Deliberation/2019/494, of 3 September.
217. In fact, paragraph 2 of article 38 defines, for the offenses provided for in paragraph 4 of article 83 of the GDPR, different sanctioning frameworks depending on the size of the companies and the collective or individual nature of the subjects who perform data processing. In a regulatory framework intended to be uniform in the European space, the maximum limits defined in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83 of the GDPR cannot be removed by the Member States of the European Union.
218. It is true that the preamble to the aforementioned paragraphs 4 and 5 clearly assumes that the pecuniary values entered there - EUR 10 million and EUR 20 million or a percentage of turnover in the case of a company - are maximum limits and , therefore, it follows directly from it that the fines cannot exceed them in any case.
219. And a careful reading of Article 83 shows that it is directly addressed to the supervisory authorities, i.e., it is addressed to each national supervisory authority (in a court obviously susceptible to being controlled by the courts) and not the national legislator . It is enough, moreover, to compare the wording of Article 83(1) with that of Article 84(1) of the GDPR: in the former, the
20 In fact, the reference to the delimitation of the infringement to cases of non-compliance with the communication of relevant information and the delimitation of the obligation to inform to certain dimensions of this was included in article 79 of the proposal for a Regulation initially presented by the European Commission, of 25.01.2012 ( 2012/0011 COD), but it was definitively eliminated in the legislative procedure, which, as a historical element of interpretation of the current Union regime, strengthens the perspective that the Union legislator did not want, nor does it want, that the protection of rights in the sanctioning plan is somehow limited.

the addressees of the standard are the supervisory authorities; in this, the addressees are the Member States, in their capacity as legislators. Moreover, the only provision of Article 83 addressed directly to the national legislature, that contained in paragraph 7, had, precisely for this reason, to adopt a different wording from that of the other paragraphs of the article; 'Member States may provide'.
220. So much so that Article 83(9) expressly provides for the direct applicability of the article by supervisory authorities where there is no national law21. And the reading of recitals 150 and 148 reinforces this interpretation, highlighting that the provisions of that article intend to direct and bindingly guide the supervisory authorities - "[t]he present regulation should define the violations and the maximum amount and the criterion for setting the value of the resulting fines, which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case'22.
221. Hence, the abstract setting, in national law, of maximum limits lower than those provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83 of the GDPR constitutes a breach of those limits. This conclusion is supported by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its judgment in Commission v Italian Republic (Case No 39/72); referring to the legislation approved in the Italian Republic, the Court states that “any implementation modalities that may impede the direct effect of Community regulations and thus compromise their simultaneous and uniform application within the Community are contrary to the Treaty”23 - case law reiterated in the Variola judgment (Case No 34/73).
222. In addition, from the principle of the primacy of Union law, reflected in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it follows that regulations are binding and directly applicable in all Member States, thereby ruling out any possibility for a 'State [...], unilaterally, to annul its effects by means of a legislative act which can be enforced against Community texts' (cf. the aforementioned judgment of the CJEU Costa/ENEL, Case No 6/64).
21 Moreover, the absence of such a national law has nothing to do with the absence of a national definition of limits to sanctions, but rather with the absence of regulation, in certain Member States, of sanctions of this type.
22 Cf. also the WG29 guidelines on the application and setting of fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, where the only circumstance in which freedom of modeling is allowed by each State is the one regarding the execution of sanctions, available at http:// ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=611237.

223. Furthermore, nowhere in Article 83, or in the recitals relating to the sanctioning regime, is there space for an autonomous consideration of the size of the undertaking, so that
The criterion adopted by the national legislator, to distinguish between small and medium-sized companies in order to reserve the GDPR's maximum monetary limit for large companies, constitutes in itself a violation of the GDPR.
224. To that extent, raising the size of the company as a delimiting criterion for sanctions is incompatible with the GDPR and contrary to the ratio underlying it.
225. The same reasoning must apply to the setting of minimum limits, since the GDPR does not leave room for the national legislator to define a sanctioning framework different from that established in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 83 of the GDPR . When determining that '[t]he breach of the provisions set out below is subject, in accordance with paragraph 2, to fines up to...', the GDPR eliminates the legislative power of the Member States to define the sanctioning framework in in relation to the infractions foreseen in those numbers.
226. The CNPD does not yet apply, with regard to determining the specific measure of the fine, paragraph
1 of article 39 of Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August, since the GDPR does not leave room for Member States to define other weighting criteria in relation to the offenses provided for in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 83. Only under Article 84, therefore, for offenses not sanctioned in the GDPR, will it be possible for the national legislator to add criteria, provided that they guarantee sanctions that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. It is true that Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR admits the consideration of other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the factual circumstances, such as the economic benefits obtained or the losses avoided as a result of the infringement. But it seems that the choice of factors should only be made in the specific case, by the entity (administrative or judicial) that applies the specific rule, and no longer by the national legislator of each Member State. This is even clear from the second part of the body of Article 83(2) of the GDPR, where the following can be read: '[I act to decide on the imposition of a fine and on the amount of the fine in each individual case, it is the following shall be duly taken into account: [...]'.
227. Thus, in order to ensure the application of the provisions of paragraph 2 of article 83 of the RGPD, the CNPD also disregards, in the present case, paragraph 1 of article 39 of Law n° 58 /2019, of August 8th.

228. It should also be noted that, despite the fact that, in the present case, the question of the disapplication of paragraph 3 of article 39 of Law no. , in the abstract, if it were to be hypothesized that one or some of the conducts had been practiced with negligence, the CNPD would never apply such a precept.
229. In fact, the CNPD, by virtue of the principle of the primacy of European Union law and on the grounds set out in the aforementioned Deliberation/2019/494, of 3 September, would not apply the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 39. ° of Law no. reasonable period, establishes a special regime for unlawful conduct practiced with negligence that is not compatible with the regime provided for in the GDPR.
230. In fact, as is clear from the body of Article 83(2) of the GDPR, the EU legislature confers on the individual decision-maker, depending on the circumstances of each case, a discretionary power to impose fines in addition to or in instead of the measures referred to in points a) to h) and j) of Article 58(2) of the GDPR.
231. Indeed, in determining that '[de]pending on the circumstances of each case, fines are imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j) [ ...]', Article 83(2) recognizes the power of national supervisory authorities to, on a case-by-case basis, choose to impose only a fine, impose a fine and corrective measure, or apply one or more measures in isolation. remedies provided for in Article 58(2). It is this discretionary power that is indisputably attributed to the national supervisory authorities, with the obvious possibility of review by the courts, that the rule contained in paragraph 3 of article 39 of Law n° 58/2019 is restricting, imposing in abstract, the CNPD to adopt a specific measure, regardless of the circumstances of each case (since it only takes into account the negligent nature of the infraction) and without allowing the immediate cumulation of the application of a sanction.

232. However, such an imposition voids the discretionary power recognized by the GDPR to the Portuguese supervisory authority, removing or considerably reducing the useful effect of the rule that attributes it24.
233. Furthermore, the national legislator may not require its supervisory authority to adopt a corrective measure, as determined in Article 58(2)(a) of the GDPR, in cases in which a data processing operation is foreseen. data (therefore not yet implemented) that is likely to violate the rules of the Regulation, in situations where the presuppositions of this measure are not fulfilled. In other words, if the GDPR defines, in subparagraph a) of paragraph 2 of article 58, the presuppositions of the warning decision, the national law cannot impose the practice of this act when there is a situation that is not subsumed on these assumptions and fulfills another legal type for which the decision provided for in the GDPR is different.
234. In the light of such arguments, the CNPD would always decide not to apply, in the present case, paragraph 3 of article 39 of Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August.

interpretation. Freely, deliberately and consciously, the Municipality, through its President, determined the referred referral to third parties.
242. In the same free and conscious manner, the Municipality disclosed the personal information of the aforementioned promoters through the various services of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Police, contrary to the obligation imposed on it to limit to a minimum the universe of people who could have access to promoters' personal data. The level of violation of the legal obligation is clearly revealed in the fact that there is no minimum control of the number of promoters and contacts disclosed, in addition to the reiterated nature with which they were revealed to the services and to the advisors of the Mayor ( when not even a councilor) reinforce this contempt for the principle of data minimization, in terms of "need to know".
243. Regarding the violation of the right to information, or the obligation to carry out an impact assessment on data protection, as well as regarding the violation of the principle of conservation, the defendant himself does not deny the conduct, and the total absence of its compliance together with the remaining circumstances of the facts sufficient to denote a coherent, constant and immutable behavior embodied in free, deliberate and conscious actions (or omissions) through which the Municipality, well knowing that it was legally bound to comply of those obligations, he chose not to do so, resigning himself to the result, that is, to the violations of the legal provisions that dictated such obligations.

With regard to the violation of the principle of lawfulness, loyalty and transparency and the violation of the principle of data minimization, the information processing actually carried out focused on data that reveal dimensions of the life of its holders that fall within the prohibitions contained in no. 1 of article 9 of the GDPR. The same can be said about the violation of the principle of conservation which, as a result of the lack of a policy setting an adequate period for the conservation of the personal data of the promoters of the events, gave rise to the indefinite extension of that conservation, which necessarily affects categories data specials;
xi. The right to information is an obligation that, in the abstract, disregards the existence or not of special categories of data. However, whenever they exist, the provision and prior information about the treatments that affect such categories of data cannot fail to assume a special relevance;
xii. Finally, and regarding the implementation of the impact assessment on data protection, the special categories of data have an increased influence on their obligation, and their treatment, moreover, is one of the factors that weigh in the decision that those responsible for the treatment will make. to do in order to consider the need for its implementation to be insurmountable (paragraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 35 of the GDPR);

measure they did - which, in this case, resulted from the denunciation of data subjects, not resulting from any mitigating circumstances for the defendant;
xiv. Compliance with the measures referred to in Article 58(2) of the GDPR, if they have been previously imposed on the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter - this criterion not being applied, as that there were no previously determined corrective measures;
xv. Compliance with codes of conduct approved under the terms of article 40 or the certification procedure approved under the terms of article 42 - a criterion that also does not apply, as there is no code of conduct or certification procedure, under the aforementioned terms;
xvi. Any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, in light of Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement - which, in this case, do not exist.
245. Since the fine must be proportionate, one cannot fail to take into account the exceptionality of recent years, due to the pandemic context we are experiencing, resulting from the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease associated with it - to COVID-19,
- which has a clear impact on economic activity and, reflexively, on revenue collection and expenditure allocation by municipalities. In addition, local authorities have been playing a pivotal role in providing human, logistical and financial resources in the fight against the pandemic, which, as is well known, has repercussions on their financial health. Therefore, the alleged by the defendant in points 702 to 706 of the Defense is taken into account, which will be reflected in the concrete amount of the fines to be imposed.
VIII. Application of the fine
246. Bearing in mind the aforementioned criteria, the CNPD considers it necessary to impose, in the specific case, a fine on the defendant, considering that this is the effective proportionate and dissuasive measure that is imposed given the specific circumstances in which the infractions occurred.
247. The framework of fines abstractly applicable to the defendant for the 225 offenses foreseen and punishable under the terms of the combined provisions,

248. While the fine frame abstractly applicable to the defendant for the offense foreseen and punishable under the combined provisions of subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 35, with subparagraph a) of paragraph 4 of article 83 .°, all of the GDPR, has a maximum limit of € 10,000,000.00.
249. The CNPD understands that the 222 offenses foreseen and punishable under the combined provisions of paragraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 5, article 6, and paragraph 1 of article 9 and of paragraph a) Article 83(5) GDPR (109 administrative offenses), Article 5(1)(a), Article 6(5) and Article 83(5)(a). Article 5(1)(c) and Article 83(5)(a) of the GDPR (111 offences) obey a different severity matrix which will apply depending on the number of entities with which the personal data has been shared and according to the number of holders and personal data thus shared.
250. As noted in the report attached to the file, “From the analysis of the recipients of the information, it was found that the number of recipients increased over time. Otherwise let's see:

253. In turn, within each of these time gaps, it was observed that there was a set of 5 additional levels of severity attributable to the violations that were actually found and resulting from the existence of a different set of data and subjects affected by each of the data submissions , which correspond to the aforementioned violations, namely:
The. Minimal - sharing of a single promoter's personal data;
B. Low average - sharing of personal data relating to more than one promoter, up to a limit of 3 promoters, or a set of two personal data relating to one, or a set of 2 or 3 promoters;
ç. Medium - sharing of three personal data relating to a promoter or relating to at least one promoter and a maximum of 3 out of a set of 2 or 3 promoters for whom personal data is shared;
d. Medium high - sharing of one or two personal data relating to more than 3 promoters, or sharing of more than three personal data relating to a promoter or to at least one promoter from a set of 2 or 3 promoters whose personal data be treated;
and. Maximum - sharing of three or more personal data relating to more than 3 promoters, or to at least one, 2 or 3 promoters from a set of more than three promoters.
254. It should be noted that there are two additional relevant notes:
The. One concerning the fact that some of the sharing of personal data deserves an aggravation to the next higher level in view of the additional entities that are recipients of the data, since the defendant himself admits that such sharing will be considered unjustifiable, with the corresponding additional degree of censorship to their total lack of purpose. This just does not happen when the conduct is already punished with the highest level of severity;
B. Another one regarding the violation that took place on January 30, 2020, in reference to the demonstration "Solidarity Protest "Pacific Kashmir"" (Praça Martim Moniz to the Assembly of the Republic) - cf. pages 4 to 11 of Annex IV of the Report. The reason is that, despite being in the interval between the 8th of August 2019 and the 24th of April 2020, among the recipients of the message, the

Municipal Civil Protection Services. In this way, the degree of seriousness applicable to that conduct, taking into account the group of recipients, is identical to that of those that occurred in the immediately preceding period. For this reason, it was understood to group this violation in the set of violations concerning the period between January 16th and August 7th, both of 2019.

B. a fine in the amount of € 5000.00 (five thousand), for violation of paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 13 in conjunction with subparagraph b) of paragraph 5 of article 83 of the RGPD;
ç. a fine in the amount of € 10,000.00 (ten thousand euros), for violation of paragraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 5 in conjunction with paragraph a) of paragraph 5 of article 83 of the GDPR ;
d. a fine in the amount of 11,000.00 (eleven thousand euros), for violation of paragraph b) of paragraph 3 of article 35 of the RGPD in conjunction with paragraph a) of paragraph 4 of article 83 of the GDPR
267. Added to the 225 fines in installments, the result is a value of €1,423,800.00 (one million, four hundred and twenty-three thousand, eight hundred euros).
268. Once the partial sanctions are framed, it can be seen, in accordance with Article 83, no.
3 of the GDPR, that, "[w]here the controller or processor violates, intentionally or negligently, within the scope of the same processing operations or operations linked to each other, several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the fine shall not be may exceed the amount specified for the most serious breach'.
269. In the present case, the amount specified for the most serious breach is €20,000,000.00 (twenty million euros), which is the abstractly applicable maximum limit.
270. Article 19(3) of the RGCO also provides, applicable in the alternative, ex vi Article 45 of Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August, that 'The fine to be imposed cannot be lower than the highest of the fines specifically applied to the various offences.”, ie € 11,000.00 (eleven thousand euros).
271. We have, then, that the abstract frame of the single fine to be imposed lies between the minimum of €
11,000.00 (eleven thousand euros) and a maximum of €20,000,000.00 (twenty million euros).
IX. Grounds for the application of the single fine
272. The essential presupposition for the effectuation of the legal accumulation of partial fines is the practice of several infractions by the same Defendant before the conviction for any of them becomes final.
273. In this sense, in order to proceed with the legal overlap, it is necessary to verify the following requirements, of a procedural and material nature, (i) that they are sanctions related to administrative offenses practiced before the final judgment of the conviction by any of them, (ii) )

that have been committed by the same defendant and that the partial sanctions are re-conducted to the same species.
274. This is cumulatively verified in the present case, due to the existence of the effective or pure competition, either in the real or in the ideal competition aspect.
275. It was found that the defendant acted freely, deliberately and consciously, in sending notices of the manifestations containing the personal data of the promoters, either to entities external to the Municipality, or to various internal services, and even to advisors to the President of the City Council and for a councilor, without having a legal basis for that.
276. And with the same free, deliberate and conscientious character, it acted by not informing the holders of the personal data that filled in and submitted the notices of the requirements provided for in article 13 of the RGPD, by not defining a policy for the conservation of the personal data collected in this way. and for not having carried out an impact assessment on data protection, as it was required to do.
277. The duration of the breaches and the number of data subjects affected serve as factors that aggravate the conduct that cannot be neglected, as they reveal a reprehensible and persistent lack of commitment to the legal obligations that the accused was supposed to fulfill.
278. The fact that there was an attempt to adapt the internal procedures and all aspects related to the processing of personal data to the new regime provided for in the RGPD cannot be overlooked. However, this initiative appeared out of time, given the delay of (practically) two years in relation to the entry into force of the European regulation.
279. Given the conduct expressed by the vast and serious set of infractions practiced, it is understood that a sanction is due that reflects the high censorship of this behavior, which will always translate into a concrete fine whose value is close to the maximum allowed, even if at that maximum the pandemic situation we are going through is already considered.
280. In the consideration carried out to decide on the single fine to be imposed, and without prejudice to the high degree of censorship of the defendant's conduct, the CNPD considers relevant the fact that the

r
defendant does not have a history of application of administrative offenses for violation of rules of
data protection.
281. However, given the legal interests protected by the administrative offenses in question, which he committed, the application to the defendant appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive:
282. In legal terms, under the combined provisions of Article 83(3) of the GDPR and 19(3) of the RGCO, a single fine of €1,250,000.00 (one million two hundred and fifty thousand euros).
X. Conclusion
283. In view of the above, the CNPD decides to impose a single fine on the accused Municipality of Lisbon, in compliance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of article 83 of the GDPR, in the amount of € 1,250,000 (one million two hundred and fifty thousand euros) due to the violation of the principle of legality, loyalty and transparency; violation of the principle of data minimization, in terms of "need to know" (need to know); breach of the duty to provide the information provided for in article 13 of the GDPR; breach of the principle of limitation of retention and breach of the obligation to carry out a data protection impact assessment.
284. Pursuant to the provisions of articles 58, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the General Regime for Administrative Offenses, inform the defendant that:
a) The conviction becomes final and enforceable if it is not judicially challenged, under the terms of article 59 of the same diploma;
b) In the event of a judicial challenge, the Court may decide by means of a hearing or, if the defendant and the Public Prosecutor do not object, by means of a simple order.
285. The defendant must pay the fine within a maximum period of 10 days after its final nature, sending the respective payment slips to the CNPD. In case of impossibility of the respective timely payment, the accused must communicate this fact, in writing, to the CNPD.

286. The defendant came to request, under paragraph 2 of article 44 of Law no. 58/2019, of 8 August, the exemption from the application of the fine, advancing, as a justification for such request, the difficulties caused by the advent of the pandemic that we are still going through, which implies the worsening of the economic context and the collection of revenue by the Municipality.
287. Without prejudice to admitting and recognizing the reason that assists the defendant in the argument about the impact that the pandemic situation has on his activity, it should, however, be noted that the CNPD already took these elements into account when it proceeded the determination of the partial value of the applicable fines. In fact, if the financial situation were different and the effects of the pandemic were outdated or non-existent, the severity of the fines imposed would certainly be much higher, since the degree of censorship of the conduct and the risks for data subjects would justify a level of much higher penalty.
288. In view of the foregoing, it is understood that the single fine imposed does not impede the activities or financial viability of the defendant, at the same time that it reflects the minimum admissible degree of censorship for the ascertained fact and taking into account the multiple proven infractions.
