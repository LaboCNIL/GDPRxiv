16. Finally, a note on article 5 of the Project which states that IFADAP, I.P., DGAV, the Regional Directorates of Agriculture and Fisheries and ASAE are jointly responsible for the processing of personal data under article 26. ° of the GDPR.
17. This presupposes the existence of an agreement that duly reflects the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers in relation to the data subjects. The CNPD therefore suggests that the content of the article be amended in order to contain an express reference to the existence of an agreement between the various controllers that enshrines their respective responsibilities for compliance with the RGPD.
III. Conclusion
18. The analysis of the Draft Ordinance does not raise new questions from the point of view of the protection of personal data. It is only recommended to reformulate article 5 in order to contemplate the existence of an agreement between IFADAP, I.P., DGAV, the Regional Directorates of Agriculture and Fisheries and ASAE that enshrines the respective responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR.
