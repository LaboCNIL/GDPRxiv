AUTHORIZATION No. 7234/2018

Portuguese Tennis Federation, with the activity of 1, notified a processing of personal data
resulting from video surveillance, with the purpose of protecting people and property, to be carried out in their
establishment with the designation Complexo Desportivo do Monte Aventino and address Rua
Monte Aventine, s/n 4350-223 Porto

The system consists of 16 cameras, placed in the following locations:

Sports show area / Public service areas / Internal circulation areas /
Parking lots.

There is visualization of the images in real time.

There is no transmission of images outside the system installation site.

There is no Workers' Commission.

The CNPD has already commented in its Deliberation no. 61/2004, of 19 April 2 on the principles
guidelines for correct compliance with the Data Protection Law, in terms of
video surveillance, as well as the general conditions applicable to the processing of personal data for the
purpose of protecting people and property. They derive from these principles, as well as from the labor law and
jurisprudence, the following limits to treatment:

 The collection of images must allow visual control of the entire sports venue and
respective ring or security perimeter, and cannot encompass images beyond
of that limit;
 In the case of ATM payment terminals, the cameras cannot be
directed in order to capture the typing of codes;



 Cameras cannot regularly focus on workers during the activity
work, nor can the images be used to control the activity of
workers, whether to measure productivity or for accountability purposes
disciplinary (cf. articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Code);

 Only the collection of images in the declared locations is covered by this
authorization, and under no circumstances can access images be collected
or inside sanitary facilities.
 

The treatment under analysis, with the aforementioned limitations, is adequate, relevant and not excessive in view of
declared purpose (cf. article 5, no. 1, subparagraph b), of Law no. 67/98, of 26 October, amended by
Law No. 103/2015, of August 24 - LPD) and the activity carried out.

                                                           
1 Law No. 39/2009, of 30 July
2 Available at www.cnpd.pt/bin/orientacoes/principiosvideo.htm
 



The processing of personal data carried out within the scope of video surveillance falls within the concept of
privacy, provided for in article 7, no. 2, of the LPD. Article 9, no. 2 of Law no. 34/2013, of May 16 and
article 18 of Law no. 39/2009, of 30 July, constitute the foundation that legitimizes the installation
of these systems.

Thus, with the limits set, the treatment notified under the provisions of
Articles 7, no. 2, 28, no. 1, point a), 29 and 30, no. 1, of the LPD, in the following terms:
