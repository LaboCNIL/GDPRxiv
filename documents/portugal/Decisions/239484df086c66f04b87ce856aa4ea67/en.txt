As follows from the preamble of this draft Ordinance, with the publication of Decree-Law no. and dematerialization of communications between the courts and public entities.
This is what happens with the measure «Informação ao Tribunal+Direta», implemented through this draft Ordinance, which aims to simplify and speed up communications between the judicial courts and Social Security within the scope of technical advice provided in civil and tutelary proceedings. of promotion and protection, namely, requests to carry out investigations or to prepare a report, notifications for the rendering of statements, notifications to participate in the conference or in the judicial debate, notifications of judgments and the submission of reports and other information.
It is noted, however, that article 2 of the draft Ordinance is limited to mentioning that such communications are carried out electronically, by sending structured information and electronic documents between the support system for the activity of the courts and the Social Security information system. However, this normative provision proves to be manifestly insufficient to guarantee compliance with the principles relating to the processing of personal data, in particular the principle of mimicry of personal data, implementation of the principle of proportionality, enshrined in subparagraph c) of paragraph 1 of the Article 5 of the GDPR.
It is therefore important that the draft Ordinance precisely defines the terms in which such processing of personal data can take place, specifying the categories of personal data involved in the transmission of information between the judicial courts and Social Security, and specifying the types of documents transmitted electronically. Otherwise, the CNPD cannot assess or conclude on the proportionality of the data to be processed, under the terms of Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. The CNPD recommends, therefore, the densification of article 2 of the draft Ordinance in order to contain the aforementioned specifications.
It should be noted that paragraph 6 of article 2 of the project states that the implementation of interoperability between the information system supporting the activity of the courts and the information system of the Social Security will be carried out under the terms of a protocol to be concluded between the Institute of Financial Management and Justice Equipment, IP, the Institute of Informatics, IP, and the Institute of Social Security, IP, the Institute of Social Security of Madeira, IP-RAM and the Institute of

Social Security of the Azores, IPRA, without, however, mentioning the prior consultation of the CNPD.
The CNPD recalls that the protocols, insofar as they correspond to legal acts of public entities that define binding rules for the parties regarding the processing of personal data, have the nature of an administrative regulation. To that extent, under the terms of Article 36(4) and Article 57(1)(c) of the GDPR, they must be subject to prior assessment by the CNPD. So that there is no doubt as to this duty, the CNPD suggests its clarification in the text of the article.
In turn, article 3 of the draft Ordinance raises particularly relevant issues regarding the security of the communications in question, since it only states that the information systems supporting the activity of the courts and the Social Security information system guarantee respect for security and information access rules in order to ensure data confidentiality.
It is strange that the standard is completely silent on the security measures involved in the transmission of data, without specifying, from the outset, whether the transmission is carried out on a public or private network. It is still strange that the normative precept uses a notoriously vague formulation to refer to the confidentiality of data without specifying the way in which it is guaranteed. Thus, in compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality provided for in subparagraph f) of paragraph 1 of article 5 of the RGPD, the CNPD recommends amending article 3 of the draft Ordinance, in order to contain the measures of security involved in this processing of personal data.
Finally, paragraph 2 of article 3 of the draft Ordinance refers to “electronic records necessary for the knowledge of the communications made”, it is not clear whether these records are intended to record activity (iogs). It should be noted that information systems must have mechanisms that allow recording and auditing the activity, namely that concerning the transmission of information to other bodies. Due to the importance that the registration (iog) of activity has in the scope of audits and inspection, it is suggested to include in this article the duty to record such interactions.
