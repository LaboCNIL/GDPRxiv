guidelines for correct compliance with the Data Protection Law, in terms of

jurisprudence, the following limits to treatment:

 Sound collection is not allowed;
 The collection of images must be confined to the property of the person in charge and cannot



encompass images of public roads or neighboring properties;
 In the case of ATM payment terminals, the cameras cannot be

compliance with a reasoned order of the competent judicial authority.

Outside these conditions, the person responsible cannot communicate the images.

same article).

When making the images available to the data subject, the person responsible must adopt the technical measures
necessary to hide the images from third parties that may have been covered by the recording.



In order to guarantee the right to information enshrined in article 10 of the LPD,
