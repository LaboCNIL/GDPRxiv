of the qualifications of persons involved in the operation of vessels sailing on inland waterways can be transmitted to the European Commission and are included in the National System of Vessels and Maritimes, created by Decree-Law No. 43/2018, of June 18, specifying them, and also establish that persons involved in the operation of vessels sailing in inland waters are prohibited from performing any function under the influence of alcohol and psychotropic substances.
5. Now analyzing the Authorized Decree-Law, under the terms of its article 4, the Directorate-General for Natural Resources, Safety and Maritime Services (DGRM), as the national maritime administration, is the competent entity to conduct the procedures for certification and recognition of the qualifications of the crew of vessels that sail on inland waterways, issue the respective certificates and monitor and supervise the activity of training entities that provide training courses under the present legal regime.
6. It is envisaged that the information relating to the crew of vessels sailing on inland waterways and all the facts relating to the exercise of their activity is entered in the National System of Vessels and Maritimes (SNEM), created by Decree-Law no. 43/2018, of June 18, which entities involved in the procedures have access to.
7. From the point of view of data protection, paragraph 3 of article 5 is relevant «The DGRM is the entity responsible for managing the SNEM and BMar and for processing the data entered there, under the terms and for the purposes set out in legislation in force on data protection, ensuring the right of information and access to data by the respective holders, correcting inaccuracies and omissions and deleting data improperly registered, as well as guaranteeing access by other entities pursuant to article 5 of Decree-Law No. 43/2018, of 18 June».
8. Also, under the terms of paragraph 6, interested parties whose personal data, namely health data, are collected and processed have the right to be previously informed and to consult, without restrictions, the data entered in the SNEM that concerning him, as well as to request, through BMar, the updating of data and the correction of inaccuracies or omissions. It should be noted that the health data contained in the medical certificates only concern the aptitude or non-aptitude of the person concerned for the performance of duties.
9. Thus, the DGRM is responsible for the processing of data entered in the SNEM in accordance with paragraph 7 of article 4 of the RGPD, and it is responsible for guaranteeing the rights of data subjects.
10. In turn, article 6 provides that the holder's identification elements contained in the SNEM are to be collected and processed, the processing of which will take place in the situations described in paragraph 5.
