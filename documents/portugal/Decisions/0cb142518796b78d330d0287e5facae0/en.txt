8. As for the exchange of driving licences, article 125 of the Highway Code, now amended, provides that the same is conditioned to the holder's compliance with the requirements set out in the Regulation of Legal Qualification to Drive approved by Decree-Law n. 138/2021, of 5 June, with waiver of exam tests for the above-mentioned titles, among other specificities (cfr. subparagraphs a) to c) of paragraph 2 of article 128 of the Highway Code).

11. The text of the Agreement is silent as to the procedure to be observed and the security measures to be adopted for accessing information or for communicating information by email.

Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations can only be carried out if there is an adequacy decision under the GDPR or, in the absence of an adequacy decision, if the controller or processor has provided adequate guarantees under the terms of Article 46 of the GDPR. In the absence of an adequacy decision or adequate guarantees, a transfer can only be carried out on the basis of the exceptions set out in Article 49 of the GDPR.
15. Pursuant to the Commission Decision of 26 July 2000, issued pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, and concerning the adequate level of protection of personal data in Switzerland, it is considered that Switzerland offers an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from

European Union. It appears, therefore, that the Swiss Confederation benefits from an adequacy decision, which, despite having been adopted by the Commission under the terms of Directive 95/46/EC, remains in force as provided for in Article 5(5). 46 of the GDPR, which is why the reference to the respective regimes on international transfers is sufficient to ensure adequate protection of personal data.
III. Conclusion
16. Under the terms and on the grounds set out above, the CNPD understands that there is no impediment to the conclusion of the Agreement under review, recommending, even so, the expansion of article 4 with the provision of adequate security measures for the transmission of personal data by mail electronic.
