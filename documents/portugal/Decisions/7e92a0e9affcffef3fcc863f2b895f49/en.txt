II. appreciation
13. The possibility for municipalities to access car registration results from the combined provisions of paragraph 1(d) and article 5(3)(a) of Decree-Law No. 44/2005, of 27 February, last amended by Decree-Law No. 146/2014, of 9 October.

15. In accordance with subparagraph d) of paragraph 2 of article 27-E of the regime relating to the Motor Vehicle Registration, the personal data of the vehicle registration must be communicated, for the pursuit of the respective attributions, to the entities responsible for enforcement of the Highway Code.

16. Thus, there is a legitimate basis for this processing of personal data, in terms of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR.
17. Paragraph 4 of article 27-H of the regime relating to the Motor Vehicle Registration obliges the entities with competence to consult that registration to maintain an updated list of persons authorized to access the database. In this way, PMB is obliged to maintain this list, which must be updated in order to limit the possibility of undue access by users who no longer have the legitimacy to access.
18. Naturally, this obligation derives from the law, but it must also be included in the present protocol, insofar as it will have an effect on its compliance and will allow the IRN, at any time, to determine to the IGFEJ that the access credentials are disabled.
19. The IGFEJ's intervention in this protocol stems from the attribution provided for in subparagraph m) of paragraph 2 of article 3 of Decree-Law no. 164/2012, of 31 July.
20. With regard to security measures, without prejudice to the need for permanent verification of their compliance, they appear to be appropriate.
III. Conclusion
21. The CNPD considers that there is legitimacy for the Braga Municipal Police to have access to the personal data of the car registration, within the limits and conditions recommended by this protocol, so it understands that there is no impediment to its execution.
