a) Current legal framework
It is recalled that the 2004 Directive already provided for provisions obliging Member States, in accordance with national legislation in force, to allow persons carrying out the inquiry to obtain as soon as possible, among others specifically listed, “ access to any relevant information or records held by the infrastructure manager, the railway companies involved and the authority responsible for safety.”2.
Directive 2016/798 does not bring any major novelties in this chapter, adding only maintenance entities3 to those that are in possession of any relevant information or record, in the terms listed above.
Decree-Law No. 394/2007, of 31 December, successively amended, lastly by Decree-Law No. 151/2014, of 13 October, partially transposed Directive No. 2004 into the domestic legal system. /49/CE, regulating the competences and methodologies to be applied by the Security and Railway Accident Investigation Office (GISAF), the national body responsible for investigating railway accidents and incidents.
In it, more precisely in subparagraph f) of paragraph 1 of article 7, the national legislator limited itself to reproducing the European provision: “In the exercise of its powers, the responsible researcher must be provided, as soon as possible, : Access to any relevant information or records held by the infrastructure manager, the railway companies involved and the IMTT”.

It is here that the Government intends to introduce changes, in order to clarify the possibility of access to video surveillance records by GPIAAF researchers.
b) Resolution 996/2016, of June 7
The CNPD, as reported in the summary of the context that accompanies the request for an opinion, had already issued a statement, then at the request of the Security Investigation and Railway Accidents Office (GISAF), on access by its investigators to “video surveillance records” relevant for the technical investigation of railway accidents, held by those responsible for video surveillance systems in railway infrastructures and trains, REFER, EPE and Comboios de Portugal, EPE, respectively”.
The scope of the Commission's deliberation was limited, therefore, to analyzing the question of the existence of a legal basis for GISAF to be able to access video images exclusively held by REFER, EPE and Comboios de Portugal, EPE.
The CNPD's pronouncement was based, at the time, on the current legal framework, in which Law No. 67/98, of October 26, amended by Law No. of Personal Data (LPDP), assumed centrality.
Since May 25, 2018, the GDPR has been applied in the European Union, constituting, from that date, the fundamental legal instrument for regulating the processing of personal data (also) in Portugal. More recently, Law No. 58/2019, of 8 August, complemented the European regulation, having revoked the LPDP.
As for the specific regime for access to images from video surveillance systems, Law no. , “the assignment or copying of recordings obtained in accordance with this law is prohibited, and may only be used under the terms of criminal procedural legislation”.

THE
The LPDP provided for a special protection regime for a set of data that qualified
as sensitive, including those revealing information related to the life
private property, such as those resulting from the use of video surveillance systems. In this case, its article 7 only allowed the processing of this type of data “By legal provision or authorization from the CNPD, (...) responsible, or when the data subject has given his express consent for such processing, in both cases with guarantees of non-discrimination and with the security measures provided for in article 15”.
Since consent is an inappropriate basis for this type of treatment and in view of the taxation of the Private Security Law, the CNPD considered that it was not admissible to extend the possibility of accessing the images of the video surveillance systems of REFER, EPE and CP, EPE to the GISAF researchers.
The Government now intends, on the occasion of the transposition of Directive 2016/798, to change the legal framework in order not only to allow GPIAAF researchers to access images from the video surveillance systems owned by REFER, EPE and CP, EPE, but also to extend such access to any “video surveillance footage that is relevant to the investigation”4.

Accordingly, the processing of images from video surveillance systems will only be covered by this more demanding concept.

given image of that set. Even so, any processing of personal data must have a basis that enables it.
In article 6 of the GDPR we find the list of these grounds, given that only subparagraph e) seems to be mobilized for the intended treatment, that is, its necessity in view of the exercise of functions of public interest or the exercise of the public authority vested in the controller.
This foundation is, however, developed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article, the latter being decisive for the analysis of the draft Decree-Law.
Article 6(3) then tells us that The legal basis for the treatment referred to in paragraph 1(c) and e) is defined: a) By Union law; or (b) under the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject.
The purpose of the processing (...), with regard to the processing referred to in paragraph 1, point e), must be necessary for the exercise of functions in the public interest or for the exercise of the public authority vested in the person responsible for the processing . That legal basis may lay down specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation, in particular: the general conditions for the illegality of the processing by the controller; the types of data being processed; the data subjects in question; the entities to which personal data may be communicated and for what purposes; the limits to which the purposes of the treatment must comply; conservation periods; and processing operations and procedures, including measures to ensure the legality and fairness of processing, such as measures relating to other specific processing situations in accordance with Chapter IX. Union or Member State law must respond to a public interest objective and be proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued.

From the combined reading of Article 6(1) and (3) of the GDPR, it is possible for Member States to base the processing of personal data on their need for the purpose of exercising public interest functions or exercising public authority to which the controller is vested, provided that this is provided for in Union law or in the law of the Member State. If that is the case, the law (EU or) of the Member State may provide for specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation, which results, of course, the full application of the rules of the GDPR, if the national legislator does not exercise this prerogative.
If, in view of the generic framework of the GDPR, the possibility for Member States to base certain treatments on the basis provided for in Article 6(1)(e) of that regulation appears to be open, however, the requirements of the domestic law to guarantee the full legality of this hypothesis.
The Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (CRP) is clear when it reserves legislative competence in matters of fundamental rights to the Assembly of the Republic7, only assuming that the Government legislates under its authorization. And there is no doubt that the right to the protection of personal data finds constitutional consecration within the set of rights, freedoms and guarantees subject to that reservation8.
Now, knowing that the Private Security Law, in its current wording9, does not include any exception to the use of images from video surveillance systems outside the scope of criminal procedural legislation, it is understood that the Government, by mere Decree-Law, it is not possible to overcome this limitation and open the possibility of access to video surveillance images relevant to GPIAAF researchers. This impossibility has nothing to do with the assessment of the public interest of the investigative activity that they carry out, but is based on the legal basis that is used here to enshrine this possibility.

d) National legislative limits
As noted with regard to the legal grounds that can be mobilized for the legitimization of the processing of personal data advocated by the draft Decree-Law under analysis, the GDPR requires additional legislation - from the Union or the Member State - that materializes the provisions of subparagraph e) of article 6, but always with the indispensability that such legislation must respond to an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued.
However, without prejudice to what has been said about the inadmissibility of, by mere Decree-Law, the Government being able to extend access to the images of video surveillance systems, a future Law of the Assembly of the Republic or authorized Decree-Law could not fail to respond to the double criterion of its indispensability and proportionality in view of the public interest objective pursued.
Therefore, a wording such as the one proposed in the draft Decree-Law seems inadmissible, since it is not limited to expanding the possibility for GPIAAF researchers to access images from video surveillance systems “in the possession of the infrastructure manager, of the railway companies involved, the maintenance entities, the service providers, the Instituto da Mobilidade e dos Transportes, I. P., abbreviated as IMT, I. P.,”, also allowing indiscriminate access to video surveillance images “from any other relevant entity”. for the investigation”. Ultimately, it would be lawful for GPIAAF researchers to demand images from entities (and we are excluding individuals here) that were neither directly nor indirectly connected with the management of the railway.
It is accepted that the legislator does not intend such a result, but, as the wording of Article 7(1)(g) currently stands, that would be the consequence.
Finally, basic principles of the protection of personal data, would claim that what is provided for in subparagraph c) of paragraph 1 of article 5 - data minimization - is implemented in article

25.° - Data protection by design and by default all of the RGPD, appear minimally implemented in the legislation that was intended to open the range of entities with access to data from video surveillance systems. From the outset, and because the purpose of investigations is not to determine guilt or responsibilities10, the images to be given to the investigators could and should, whenever possible, be edited in advance, in order to prevent, by appropriate technical means, the identification of the people. in them constant. In fact, taking into account the purpose pursued by the GPIAAF, the provision in this draft diploma that access is limited only to previously edited images that guarantee the non-identification of the people covered by them would not raise reservations on the part of the CNPD, since, in that case, GPIAAF would not be processing personal data.
III. Conclusion
The draft Decree-Law aims to transpose Directive (EU) 2016/798 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 11 May 2016, on railway safety. It does not contain any relevant changes in relation to the existing framework under Directive 2004/49/EC, leaving it to the Member States to specify the specific means to be used. In the Portuguese context, the legislative reservation provided for in subparagraph b) of paragraph 1 of article 165 of the CRP, prevents, by mere Decree-Law, from altering the set of persons and entities authorized to have access to images of video surveillance, which are listed in paragraph 4 of article 31 of the Private Security Law.
Thus, if the intention regarding this enlargement remains, the intervention of the constitutionally competent body, in this case, the Assembly of the Republic, should be promoted, guaranteeing respect for the formalities inscribed in the CRP.
10 Recital 39 and paragraph 4 of article 20 of Directive 2016/798, as well as paragraph 3 of article 1 1 of the draft Decree-Law “The report must protect the anonymity of the people involved in the accident or incident and must not be used for purposes other than improving safety, namely the determination of faults or responsibilities.”

In addition to the dimension of constitutional reservation, the wording of subparagraph g) of paragraph 1 of article 7 of the draft Decree-Law reveals a disproportionate solution in view of the specific competences of researchers, as it gives them a power of access to images of any video surveillance systems they deem relevant.
Finally, any expansion of legitimate entities or purposes legitimizing access to images from video surveillance systems, within the framework of the provisions of Article 6(3) of the GDPR, must be based on an objective of public interest and enshrine proportionate solutions to this objective, which the content of the project does not reflect
