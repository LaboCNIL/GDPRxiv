I. Appreciation

The possibility for municipalities to access car registration stems from the

combined provisions of subparagraph d) of paragraph 1 and subparagraph a) of paragraph 3 of article 5 of the

Decree-Law no. 44/2005, of 27 February, lastly amended by Decree-Law no.

146/2014, of October 9th.

The LCG is, under the terms of the General Regulations for Parking Areas in

Limited Duration2 the entity responsible for supervising compliance with the

vehicle parking and road traffic regulations, including the

participation of road accidents, in the territorial area of the Municipality of Loulé

According to subparagraph d) of paragraph 2 of article 27-D of the Highway Code, the data

details of the car registration must be communicated, for the pursuit of the

respective attributions, to the entities responsible for supervising the Code of

Road. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 of article 27-E of the same diploma also allow

Process PAR/2020/29 2

provided that security guarantees are observed and conditioned to the execution of

protocol.

Thus, there is a basis of legitimacy for this data processing

personal data, in terms of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR.

Article 27-H(4) of the Motor Vehicle Registration requires that entities with

authority to consult that register maintain an up-to-date list of

authorized persons to access the database. Therefore, LCG is obliged to

keep this list, which must be updated in order to limit the possibility of

undue access by users who no longer have the legitimacy to access.

Naturally, this obligation stems from the law, but its transposition into

Clause 5 will have a potentiating effect on its compliance and will allow the

IRN, at any time, can determine to the IGFEJ that the access credentials

be deactivated.

The IGFEJ's intervention in this protocol stems from the attribution provided for in paragraph m)

of no. 2 of article 3 of Decree-law no. 164/2012, of 31 July.

With regard to security measures, without prejudice to the need for

permanent verification of their compliance, they seem appropriate.

 

II. Conclusion

Thus, with the above observations, the CNPD considers that there is no

impediment to the conclusion of the protocol.
