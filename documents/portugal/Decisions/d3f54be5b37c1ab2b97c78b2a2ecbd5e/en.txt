Process PAR/2020/60 v. ,
Under the terms of the CMVM's public consultation document No. 5/2020, "this draft regulation proposes to replace the report evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance control system, the risk management service and the internal audit, with a self-assessment report'. Therefore, with regard to entities subject to joint supervision by the CMVM and the Bank of Portugal, it is proposed that the self-assessment report provided for in the regulatory projects proposed by the Bank of Portugal be sent annually to the CMVM, in order to prevent these entities from being obliged to to make two reports to the supervisory authorities with different content. In turn, with regard to entities subject exclusively to the supervision of the CMVM, the draft regulation establishes the duty to prepare an annual self-assessment report on their governance and internal control systems, under the terms set out in the Annex to the draft regulation.
It should be noted that, under the terms of the aforementioned consultation document, the "model of the self-assessment report provided for in the Annex to the draft regulation, although it provides for identical elements to the self-assessment report of the entities subject to the joint supervision of the Bank of Portugal and the CMVM, includes adjustments and simplifications that reflect proportionality concerns. This proportionality will also be reflected in the information to be presented in the report by the obliged entities, as this will be consistent with the specific organizational requirements to which each entity is individually subject, under the terms of the applicable legal and regulatory regime».
The Annex to the draft regulation under analysis, provides in subparagraph d) of paragraph 1 of point A concerning the minimum content of the annual self-assessment report, the processing of personal data relating to the identification of those responsible for the internal control functions, with the indication of the respective contacts. According to the table on regulatory procedure No. 4/2020, sent by the CMVM, this identification data comprises “full names, signatures, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, professional occupations, among others”. Attention is drawn to the fact that point A(1)(d) does not densify the information in question. However, the collection and conservation of personal data comply with the principles of purpose and data minimization, so only identification elements of those responsible for the control functions strictly necessary for the purpose in question should be collected - cf. subparagraphs b) and c) of paragraph 1 of article

5 of the GDPR. It is therefore recommended to specifically list the personal data to be processed, also for reasons of procedural transparency.
On the other hand, these precepts are aimed at the processing of personal data under the terms of Article 4, paragraphs 1) and 2), of the GDPR, so it is recommended that an express reference be made to the legal regime of data protection enshrined in the RGPD, safeguarding the data subjects' rights to information, access and rectification under the terms set out in articles 14 to 16 of this legal instrument.
It should be noted that, under the GDPR, the processing of the data in question will be lawful, among others, if the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject (cf. 1(c) of the GDPR) or the exercise of the public authority vested in the controller (cf. subparagraph e) no. 1 of the same article).
With regard to the identification data of those responsible for the internal control functions, the CMVM needs this information to verify compliance with the organizational requirements to which companies are bound pursuant to article 56 of Law no. /2015, of March 4, last amended by Law No. 25/2020, of July 7 (Legal Regime for Venture Capital, Social Entrepreneurship and Specialized Investment) so its treatment is based on law in paragraph e ) Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
Finally, it is important to mention the need to establish in the draft regulation a maximum period for the storage of personal data in accordance with Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR.
B - Draft regulation amending CMVM Regulations No. 2/2007, No. 2/2015, No. 3/2015, No. 2/2002, No. 8/2018, No. 1 /2020, no. 1/2017, no. 3/2016.

Among these obligations is the need to ensure the plurality and rotation of auditors in order to protect against situations likely to generate conflicts of interest between them and collective investment undertakings, under the terms of articles 131 and 132 of the General Regime of Undertakings for Collective Investment. Articles 144 and 145 of the General Regime establish rules for the valuation and valuation of real estate, enshrining the plurality and rotation of expert appraisers.

Thus, the CMVM needs to process the information in question for the exercise of the supervisory powers legally conferred on it, so its treatment is based on lawfulness in subparagraph e) of paragraph 1 of article 6 of the RGPD.
As a final note, the CNPD cannot fail to point out the lack of provision in the draft regulation of essential elements of data processing resulting from its application, in particular the data retention period and security measures to be adopted.
