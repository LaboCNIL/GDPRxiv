One of the relevant aspects for the purpose of protecting privacy concerns the capture of images of areas intended to be used in protection and the capture of images and sounds from the interior of the house or inhabited building or its dependence.

The placement of masks considers all the planes covered by the fixed and rotating cameras” (Cf. point II of the aforementioned letter).
