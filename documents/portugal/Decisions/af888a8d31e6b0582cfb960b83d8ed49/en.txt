5. Thus, this Draft Law aims to grant the Government legislative authorization to approve the sanctioning regime applicable to the violation of the provisions of the Regulation, defining its meaning and extent in article 2.
6. In these terms, the draft Decree-Law resulting from the legislative authorization (Project) will apply to all natural and legal persons indicated in article 11 of the Regulation, which article 2 reproduces
fully.
7. In turn, article 4 of the Project determines that, for the purposes of article 2 of the Regulation, the Directorate General for Economic Activities is the competent entity, and the information "may be sent directly to the European Commission, or through the DGAE, to the electronic address indicated on the website of this entity”. Natural or legal persons must inform the DGAE of the request and granting of authorization to comply, in whole or in part, with the requirements or prohibitions referred to in the second paragraph of article 5 of the Regulation.
8. The Project defines the administrative offenses and the respective fines and gave the Authority for Food and Economic Security (ASAE) competence to open and instruct the respective processes, with DGAE reporting to ASAE all illicit acts of which it is aware in this matter. The application of sanctions is the responsibility of the inspector general of ASAE, who may delegate this competence under the terms of the law.
9. Finally, article 11 enshrines as a subsidiary right the general regime of the mere social ordering offense, contained in Decree-Law No. 433/82, of October 27, in its current wording.
10. Draft Law No. 69/XIV/la does not raise reservations from the perspective of protection of personal data, as does the text of the Draft Decree-Law.
