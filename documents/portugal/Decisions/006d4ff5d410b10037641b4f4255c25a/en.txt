National Data Protection Commission
The same diploma allows these entities to be authorized to consult data transmission lines, provided that security guarantees are observed and subject to the signing of a protocol.
16. Thus, there is a legitimate basis for this processing of personal data, in terms of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR.
17. Paragraph 4 of article 27-H of the regime relating to the Motor Vehicle Registration obliges the entities with competence to consult that registration to maintain an updated list of persons authorized to access the database. In this way, Datarede is obliged to maintain this list, which must be updated in order to limit the possibility of undue access by users who no longer have the legitimacy to access.
18. Naturally, this obligation derives from the law, but it must also be included in the present protocol, insofar as it will have an effect on its compliance and will allow the IRN, at any time, to determine to the IGFEJ that the access credentials are disabled.
19. The IGFEJ's intervention in this protocol stems from the attribution provided for in subparagraph m) of paragraph 2 of article 3 of Decree-Law no. 164/2012, of 31 July.
