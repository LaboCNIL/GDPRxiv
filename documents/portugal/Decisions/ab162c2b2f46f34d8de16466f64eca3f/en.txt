II. Analysis
3. Decree-Law No. 101-D/2020, of 7 December, established the requirements applicable to the design and renovation of buildings, transposing Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament into the national legal system and of the Council of 30 May 2018 amending Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (EPBD Directive).

7. The instruction for the application for the issuance of a professional title and respective registration includes the identification of the interested party, accompanied by proof of enrollment in the respective public association and the qualification diploma or certificate of qualifications, as well as the professional curriculum and the application for admission. to the examination under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 9 of the diploma in question.
8. However, the project is silent as to how the aforementioned request is made. Thus, if the same is sent through a platform, you must ensure that the necessary technical and organizational security measures are implemented, in compliance with the provisions of subparagraph f) of paragraph 1 of article 5 of the RGPD.
9. It should also be noted that the item does not define which identification data are required, so, taking into account the principle of transparency provided for in subparagraph a) of paragraph 1 of article 5 of the RGPD, it is suggested its densification, listing the categories of personal data in question.
10. In turn, paragraph 9 of article 9 of the project provides that ADENE1 makes available on the SCE Portal the scholarship of SCE technicians operating in national territory, whose treatment, access and research by the public must meet the requirements of the GDPR. It is important, first of all, to ensure that the personal data made available as a result of the search by the public are only those necessary for the intended purpose.
11. On the other hand, the option of establishing that these specific treatments must comply with the legal regime enshrined in the RGPD, leaving others out, may allow the presumption that the other processing of personal data provided for or arising from this Project are not subject to the RGPD .
12. In order to maintain a provision with this type of content, the CNPD recommends, rather, the autonomous forecast of the need for all data processing resulting from the application of this law to comply with the requirements of the RGPD.
13. Pursuant to article 16.02, with the exception of administrative offences, all requests, communications and notifications between SCE technicians, other technicians, owners and competent authorities are carried out on the SCE Portal, in accordance with the procedures indicated therein, integrated in the electronic one-stop shop for services referred to in article 6 of Decree-Law no. 92/2010, of 26 July, in its current wording, accessible through Portugal ePortugal.gov.pt.
1 It should be noted that under the terms of subparagraph c) of paragraph 2 of article 26 of Decree-Law no. 101-D/2020, of 7 December, ADENE is responsible for managing the central register of energy certificates in the Portal SCE as well as the rest of the information produced.
2 Which refers to article 42 of Decree-Law no. 101-D/2020, of 7 December, now amended by article 15 of the project.

It should be noted that, under the terms of paragraph 2 of article 42 of Decree-Law no. 101-D/2020, of 7 December3, within the scope of the procedures provided for in the previous number, it must be possible to use of secure authentication mechanisms and qualified electronic signatures, namely those contained in the citizen card and Digital Mobile Key using the Professional Attributes Certification system, as well as electronic identification means issued in other Member States recognized for this purpose, under the terms of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014. It is clear that there must be an alternative. The CNPD recalls, once again4, that the use by professionals of the Digital Mobile Key and the Citizen Card (through the Professional Attributes Certification System) calls for the existence of alternative means of authentication so that it is possible to affirm a manifestation of free will of its use, under the terms of the legal diplomas that provide for and regulate these authentication tools.
