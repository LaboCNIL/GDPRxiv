15. Also in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 27-E of the same diploma, these entities may authorize the consultation of data transmission online, provided that security guarantees and subject to the conclusion of a protocol that defines the limits and conditions of access.
16. The possibility for CMA to access the car registration derives from the combined provisions of Article 5(1)(d) and No.3(a) of Decree-Law No. 44/2005, of February 23.
17. To that extent, it is considered that there is a basis of legitimacy for this processing of data, in the form of access, under Article 6(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of April 27, 2016 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
18. The rule of mandatory indication of the process number that supports access as a condition for the continuation of the research and consequent access to data is highlighted as positive and essential.
19. The rule regarding individualized access per user, using unique credentials, and respective logs, always allowing tracking of each user's activity, is also underlined as adjusted.
20. As regards the security measures envisaged for the transmission of data, as well as the obligation provided for in paragraph 3 of Clause 5.a, they appear generally to be appropriate.
21. Regarding the participation of the IGFEJ as a party to this protocol, the CNPD considers this to be fully justified, given its attributions, provided for in article 3 of Decree-Law No. 164/2012, of 31 July.
22. The CNPD considers that there is legitimacy for the access by the Municipality of Amarante to the personal data of the car registration, within the limits and conditions recommended by the present protocol, therefore, it understands that there is no impediment to its execution.
