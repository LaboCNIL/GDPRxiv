The CNPD has already commented in its Deliberation n.º 61/2004, of 19 April 1 on the principles
guidelines for correct compliance with the Data Protection Law, in terms of
video surveillance, as well as the general conditions applicable to the processing of personal data for the
purpose of protecting people and property. They derive from these principles, as well as from the labor law and
jurisprudence, the following limits to treatment:

 Sound collection is not allowed;
 The collection of images must be confined to the property of the person in charge and cannot



encompass images of public roads or neighboring properties;
 In the case of ATM payment terminals, the cameras cannot be
directed in order to capture the typing of codes;

 Cameras cannot regularly focus on workers during the activity
work, nor can the images be used to control the activity of
workers, whether to measure productivity or for accountability purposes
disciplinary (cf. articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Code);

 Only the collection of images in the declared locations is covered by this
authorization, and under no circumstances can access images be collected
or inside sanitary facilities, access and interiors of changing rooms, rest areas
or other areas for workers, manufacturing areas, waiting areas,
meetings and auditoriums.

The treatment under analysis, with the aforementioned limitations, is adequate, relevant and not excessive in view of
to the stated purpose (cf. subparagraph b) of no. 1 of article 5 of Law no. 67/98, of 26 October, as amended
103/2015, of 24 August - LPD) and the activity developed.

The processing of personal data carried out within the scope of video surveillance falls within the concept of
privacy, provided for in paragraph 2 of article 7 of the LPD. Article 31 of Law no. 34/2013, of 16 May,
constitutes the foundation that legitimizes the installation of these systems.

Thus, with the limits set, the treatment notified under the provisions of
Articles 7, no. 2, 28, no. 1, point a), 29 and 30, no. 1, of the LPD, in the following terms:
