- with a complaint dated 28 January 2022, advanced to this Authority pursuant to art. 77 of the Regulation, Mr. XX, representing that he had received numerous unwanted telephone calls attributable to the Limit Call, complained about the unsatisfactory response of the aforementioned Company to the requests to exercise the rights formulated pursuant to articles 15 et seq. of the Regulation;

- Limit Call, with a note dated October 12, 2021, stated that it had acted on the basis of a consent to communication to third parties for promotional purposes issued by the interested party on August 17, 2021 at 2.32.43 pm on the occasion of registration on a website (https ://...) owned by the Spanish company XX, of which the timestamp was also produced; the claimant has denied the portal to which he would have registered, reiterating that he has not given the aforementioned consent;
- Mr. XX subsequently contacted the company XX a in order to clarify the circumstance described above, with particular reference to the alleged consent given when registering on the aforementioned website, as well as to existing relationships with the Limit Call;
- from the interlocutions with XX, it emerged that the consent to the processing of personal data, evidence of which was produced with the relative registration log, would have been provided on a date other than that indicated by Limit Call (i.e. 11 October 2021 at 20.24.25) with which XX claimed not to have any contractual relationship;
- on 10 February 2022, the Office formulated a request for information and presentation of documents pursuant to art. 157 of the Code (note prot. n. 9268/22), notified on the same date via certified email, with which it invited the Company to provide any useful element for the complete assessment of the case, "with particular reference to the documentation certifying the actual release of consent by the claimant for promotional purposes also in the light of the evidence produced by XX which declared that it has no contractual relationship with Limit Call S.r.l.s.";
- since no response was received to this request, the Office proceeded to inform Limit Call of the start of the administrative procedure aimed at adopting the corrective and sanctioning measures envisaged by art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation, inviting the same Company to send written defenses or a request for a hearing before the Guarantor within thirty days; given the previous omitted reply to the communication sent by certified email, the act of initiation of the procedure was notified by the Guardia di Finanza on 11 May 2022;

CONSIDERING that the inertia of the Company has resulted in a heavier burden of the preliminary fulfilments and a slowdown in the administrative action; this circumstance emerges per tabulas, given that the Office sent a request for information specifying that a lack of response could have led to the application of administrative sanctions;
NOTING that the aforementioned request for information pursuant to art. 157 of the Code was sent to the pec address of Limit Call as resulting from the information system of the Chambers of Commerce and, in this regard, it is useful to highlight that the d.l. 76/2020 (so-called "simplification decree"), converted with amendments of Law 120/2020, has qualified, in art. 37, the certified e-mail address of the companies as a "digital domicile" valid for the purposes of electronic communications having legal value (see provision no. 126 of 7 April 2022, web doc. no. 9771529; see provision no. 23 of 27 January 2022, web doc. n. 9746068);

NOTING that the lack of response from the Company did not allow, however, to acquire a complete picture of information, nor was it possible to ascertain the legal basis that would have legitimized the treatment in question, given the conflicting declarations of the Companies involved;
CONSIDERING, therefore, on the basis of what is in the documents, that it is not possible to attribute with certainty a subjective responsibility for the conduct complained of in the complaint in relation to the lawfulness profiles of the processing in question and that, however, on this point, it appears necessary to enjoin Limit Call, the pursuant to art. 58, par. 1 lit. a), of the Regulation, to provide feedback to the Guarantor's request for information pursuant to art. 157 of the Code remained unanswered, for a complete assessment of the aspects related to the lawfulness of the treatments;

d. failure to cooperate with the Authority, despite the fact that the Company has been the recipient of communications whose response could have allowed a complete definition of the matter (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f);
