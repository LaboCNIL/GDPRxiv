WHEREAS
1. The ascertainment of the violation and the initiation of the procedure.
With a note dated 26.2.2021, the Police Headquarters of Naples Commissariat of P.S. “Afragola” sent the service report and the report of summary information relating to an inspection carried out, on 20.1.2021, at the “Parco Ventotene” condominium located in Casoria (NA), via Ventotene 106.
During the investigation, the presence of a video surveillance system installed by Global Service s.r.l. was ascertained. near the external accesses to the headquarters of the Company located in Casoria (NA), via Ventotene 106. In the face of the processing of personal data carried out by means of the aforementioned cameras, the absence of the prescribed information signs was detected.
Based on the findings of the investigations referred to in the aforementioned minutes, the Company was notified of the act of initiating the sanctioning procedure, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 5, of the Code in relation to the violation of the general principles regarding the protection of personal data, pursuant to art. 5, par. 1, lett. a) of the Regulations and the provisions of art. 13 of the Regulation (prot. N. 58737 of 23.11.2021).
Despite having been informed of the possibility of producing defensive writings or documents in relation to the sanctioning procedure against it, the Company, the data controller, has not sent any documentation in this regard.
2. The legal framework of the processing carried out
The use of video surveillance systems may result in the processing of personal data in relation to the positioning of the cameras and the quality of the images recorded. This treatment must be carried out in compliance with the general principles contained in art. 5 of the Regulation and, in particular, of the principle of transparency which presupposes that "interested parties must always be informed that they are about to enter a video surveillance area".
For this purpose, therefore, the data controller must affix suitable information signs according to the indications contained in point 3.1. of the provision on video surveillance - April 8, 2010 [1712680] (in this sense also the Faq on video surveillance, published on the Authority's website).
Similarly, the Guidelines no. 3/2019 of the European Data Protection Committee on the processing of personal data through video devices, point 7) specify that "With regard to video surveillance, the most important information must be indicated [by the owner] on the warning sign itself (first level), while the additional mandatory details can be provided by other means (second level). The guidelines also provide that "This information may be provided in combination with an icon to give, in a clearly visible, intelligible and clearly legible way, an overview of the envisaged processing (Article 12, paragraph 7, of the GDPR) . The format of the information will have to adapt to the various locations ”. The information should be positioned in such a way as to allow the data subject to easily recognize the circumstances of the surveillance, before entering the monitored area (approximately at eye level) "to allow the data subject to estimate which area is covered by a camera in so as to avoid surveillance or adapt one's behavior, where necessary ".
3. The outcome of the investigation and the sanctioning procedure.
Based on the assessment made by the P.S. Afragola of the Naples Police Headquarters, it emerged that the video surveillance system installed by Global Service s.r.l., with registered office in Rome, Via Ovidio 20, is up and running and that the signs bearing the information referred to in art. 13 of the Regulation.
Therefore, in the present case, it is proven in documents that the party has carried out a processing of personal data, by means of a video surveillance system, in the absence of the required information.
This conduct is in contrast with the provisions of art. 5, par. 1, lett. a) (principle of transparency) and by art. 13 of the Regulation, according to which the data controller is required to provide the data subject with all information relating to the essential characteristics of the processing.
4. Order of injunction.
The Guarantor, pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, lett. i) of the Regulations and art. 166 of the Code, has the power to impose a pecuniary administrative sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, of the Regulations, through the adoption of an injunction order (Article 18. Law no. 689 of 24 November 1981), in relation to the processing of personal data carried out by the Company through the video surveillance system, in violation of the Regulations.
With reference to the elements listed in art. 83, par. 2, of the Regulations for the purposes of applying the pecuniary administrative sanction and its quantification, taking into account that the sanction must be "in each individual case effective, proportionate and dissuasive" (Article 83, par. 1 of the Regulations), that, in the present case, the following circumstances were taken into consideration:
with regard to the nature, severity and duration of the violation, the conduct of the data controller was taken into consideration, as well as the responsibility related to the non-fulfillment of the obligation to disclose the information to the interested parties;
the absence of specific precedents against the company relating to violations of the regulations on the protection of personal data;
the circumstance that the Company, the data controller, did not cooperate with the Authority during the procedure nor did it demonstrate that it had fulfilled the legal obligation.
Due to the aforementioned elements, assessed as a whole, it is believed to determine the amount of the financial penalty in the amount of € 2,000.00 (two thousand) for the violation of art. 13 of the Regulation.
In this context, also in consideration of the type of violation ascertained, it is believed that, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and art. 16, paragraph 1, of the regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, this provision should be published on the Guarantor's website.
Finally, it is noted that the conditions set out in art. 17 of regulation no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures with external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor.
