CONSIDERING the art. 1, paragraph 2, of the law of 24 November 1981, n. 689, pursuant to which the laws that provide for administrative sanctions are applied only in the cases and for the times considered in them;
NOTING that, following the outcome of the administrative procedure initiated with an appeal presented on 12 December 2016, the Guarantor for the protection of personal data (hereinafter the Guarantor) adopted provision no. 147 dated 16 March 2017 with which, among other things, it was ascertained that Idroservice Italia s.r.l. VAT number: 04321710750, with headquarters in Presicce (Le), via Mazzini n. 161, in the person of the pro tempore legal representative, did not provide any response to the request for information formulated by the Secretary General pursuant to art. 157 of the Code regarding the protection of personal data - Legislative Decree 30 June 2003, no. 196 (hereinafter referred to as the Code) and duly notified via certified email on 6 February 2017;
HAVING REGARD to the report no. 15142/113670 of 21 April 2017 drawn up by the Guarantor's Office (which is understood to be referred to in full here) with which Idroservice Italia s.r.l., in the person of the pro-tempore legal representative, was notified of the administrative violation envisaged by the art. 164 of the Code, in relation to art. 157, informing you of the right to make a reduced payment pursuant to art. 16 of the law n. 689/1981;

CONSIDERING the report no. 27714/113670 of 16 August 2017 drawn up by the Guarantor's Office (which is understood to be referred to in full here) with which Idroservice Italia s.r.l., in the person of the pro-tempore legal representative, was charged with the administrative violation envisaged by art. 164 of the Code, in relation to art. 157, informing you of the right to make a reduced payment pursuant to art. 16 of the law n. 689/1981;

CONSIDERING the art. 164 of the Code, which punishes anyone who fails to provide the information or exhibit the documents required by the Guarantor pursuant to art. 157 of the same Code, with the administrative sanction, for each of the two disputed violations, of the payment of a sum from ten thousand euros up to sixty thousand euros;
CONSIDERING that, for the purposes of determining the amount of the pecuniary sanction, it is necessary to take into account, pursuant to art. 11 of the law of 24 November 1981 n. 689, of the work carried out by the agent to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of the violation, of the seriousness of the violation, of the personality and economic conditions of the offender and that therefore: the amount of the pecuniary sanction with reference to the violation pursuant to art . 164 must be quantified as 10,000.00 (ten thousand) euros for each of the two disputes for a total amount of 20,000.00 (twenty thousand) euros;
HAVING REGARD to the documentation in the deeds;
HAVING REGARD to the law of 24 November 1981 n. 689, and subsequent modifications and additions;
HAVING REGARD TO the observations of the Office formulated by the Secretary General pursuant to art. 15 of the Guarantor's regulation n. 1/2000, adopted with resolution of 28 June 2000;
