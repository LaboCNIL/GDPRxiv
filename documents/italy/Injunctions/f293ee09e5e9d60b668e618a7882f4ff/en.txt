WHEREAS
1. The assessment of the local police force.
With a note received on 30 September 2021, the Local Police Corps - Aggregation of the Vallesabbia Local Police (Province of Brescia) sent this Authority a copy of the report of the operations carried out, on 23 September 2021, at the local site in Gavardo (BS ), Largo Ponte n. 28 of the individual company called "Turkish City" of Kalemci Musa based in XX. The report reports the presence of 3 functioning cameras placed within the aforementioned business and the lack of information signs of the presence of the cameras.
In fact, during the investigation, the presence of a video surveillance system was detected, consisting of 3 active and functioning cameras, that is, suitable for identifying the interested parties. In the face of the processing of personal data carried out by means of the aforementioned system located within the business, the absence of suitable information was ascertained pursuant to art. 13 of the Regulation.
With a note dated January 20, 2022, the Office, on the basis of the investigations carried out pursuant to the aforementioned service report, notified "Turkish City" in the person of Kalemci Musa, as owner of the aforementioned sole proprietorship, the start of the procedure for the adoption of the measures referred to in Articles 58, par. 2, and 83 of the Regulations, in accordance with the provisions of art. 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, in relation to the violation of art. 5 par. 1, lett. a) and 13 of the Regulations.
The aforementioned sole proprietorship, despite having been informed of the possibility of producing defensive writings or documents in relation to the sanctioning procedure against it, did not send any documentation in this regard.
2. The legal framework of the processing carried out
The use of video surveillance systems may result in the processing of personal data in relation to the positioning of the cameras and the quality of the images recorded. This treatment must be carried out in compliance with the general principles contained in art. 5 of the Regulation and, in particular, of the principle of transparency (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) of the Regulation) which presupposes that "the interested parties must always be informed that they are about to enter a video surveillance area" (cf. , in this sense, point 3.1. of the video surveillance provision of 8 April 2010 published in Official Gazette no.99 of 29 April 2010, web doc. no. 1712680).
For this purpose, therefore, the data controller must affix suitable information signs according to the indications contained in point 3.1. of the video surveillance provision of 8 April 2010 mentioned above (see, to this effect, also the Faq on video surveillance published on the Authority's website, web doc. no. 9496574).
Similarly, the “Guidelines no. 3/2019 on the processing of personal data through video devices ", adopted on 29 January 2020 by the European Data Protection Committee, in point 7) specify that" with regard to video surveillance, the most important information must be indicated [by the owner ] on the warning sign itself (first level), while further mandatory details can be provided by other means (second level) ". The Guidelines also provide that "such information may be provided in combination with an icon to give, in a clearly visible, intelligible and clearly legible way, an overview of the treatment envisaged (article 12, paragraph 7, of GDPR). The format of the information will have to adapt to the various locations ”. The information should be positioned in such a way as to allow the data subject to easily recognize the circumstances of the surveillance, before entering the monitored area (approximately at eye level) "to allow the data subject to estimate which area is covered by a camera in so as to avoid surveillance or adapt one's behavior, where necessary ".
3. The outcome of the investigation and the sanctioning procedure.
On the basis of the assessment carried out by the staff of the local Police Corps - Aggregation of the local Police of Vallesabbia (Province of Brescia) it emerged that the individual company "Turkish City" of Kalemci Musa, as owner, has put in place a treatment of personal data, through a video surveillance system installed at its public sale business located in Gavardo (BS), Largo Ponte n. 28; system turned out to be up and running at the time of the assessment. It was also ascertained that the aforementioned company has not prepared, as it has instead been required to provide suitable information, pursuant to art. 13 of the Regulation, to inform interested parties on the processing of their data, therefore not taking into account the indications formulated in the guidance documents listed above.
It is therefore proven in documents that the aforementioned individual company has carried out a processing of personal data, by means of a video surveillance system, in the absence of the required prior notice. This conduct is in contrast with the provisions of the general principles on the protection of personal data pursuant to art. 5, par. 1, lett. a) and by art. 13 of the Regulation, according to which the owner is required to provide the interested party with all the information relating to the essential characteristics of the processing.
4. Order of injunction.
The Guarantor, pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, lett. i) of the Regulations and art. 166 of the Code, has the power to impose a pecuniary administrative sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, of the Regulation, through the adoption of an injunction order (art. 18 of the law of 24 November 1981, n. 689), in relation to the processing of personal data carried out by the individual company "Turkish City" of Kalemci Musa, by means of the '' video surveillance system referred to in the introduction, in violation of art. 5, par. 1, lett. a) and art. 13 of the Regulation, as in the absence of suitable information.
With reference to the elements listed in art. 83, par. 2, of the Regulations for the purposes of applying the pecuniary administrative sanction and its quantification, taking into account that the sanction must be "in each individual case effective, proportionate and dissuasive" (Article 83, par. 1 of the Regulations), that, in the present case, the following circumstances were taken into consideration:
with regard to the nature, severity and duration of the violation, the conduct of the data controller was taken into consideration, as well as the responsibility related to the non-fulfillment of the obligation to disclose the information to the interested parties;
the absence of specific precedents against the company relating to violations of the regulations on the protection of personal data;
the circumstance that the Company has not cooperated with the Authority during the procedure nor has it shown that it has fulfilled its legal obligation.
Due to the aforementioned elements, assessed as a whole, it is believed to determine the amount of the financial penalty in the amount of € 2,000.00 (two thousand) for the violation of Articles 5, par. 1, lett. a) and 13 of the Regulations.
In this context, also in consideration of the type of violation ascertained, it is believed that, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and art. 16, paragraph 1, of the regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, this provision should be published on the Guarantor's website.
