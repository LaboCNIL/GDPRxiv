WHEREAS
1. The assessment by the Lombardy Carabinieri Legion and the initiation of the procedure.
With a note sent on 19 May 2019, the Lombardy Carabinieri Legion, Compagnia di Desenzano del Garda, sent this Authority the report of an investigation carried out on 18 May 2019, at the "1000 Luci Round a Bar" venue, located in Desenzano del Garda (BS), via San Benedetto incr. Mini ring road.
During the investigation, the aforementioned Command checked for the presence of a video surveillance system, consisting of 5 cameras, positioned both in the internal and external areas of the premises, active and functioning, that is, suitable for identifying the interested parties. In the face of the processing of personal data carried out by means of the aforementioned cameras, the absence of the prescribed information signs was ascertained.
The Office, therefore, on the basis of the investigations carried out, referred to in the aforementioned report, notified Mr. XX, owner of the business in question, the act of initiating the sanctioning procedure, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 5, of the Code in relation to the violation of art. 13 of the Regulation (prot. N. 21133 of 18.06.2019).
Despite having been informed of the possibility of producing defensive writings or documents in relation to the sanctioning procedure against him, Mr. XX has not sent any documentation in this regard.
2. The legal framework of the processing carried out
The use of video surveillance systems may result in the processing of personal data in relation to the positioning of the cameras and the quality of the images recorded. This treatment must be carried out in compliance with the general principles contained in art. 5 of the Regulation and, in particular, of the principle of transparency which presupposes that "interested parties must always be informed that they are about to enter a video surveillance area".
For this purpose, therefore, the data controller must affix suitable information signs according to the indications contained in point 3.1. of the provision on video surveillance - April 8, 2010 [1712680] (in this sense also the Faq on video surveillance, published on the Authority's website).
Similarly, the Guidelines no. 3/2019 of the European Data Protection Committee on the processing of personal data through video devices, point 7) specify that "With regard to video surveillance, the most important information must be indicated [by the owner] on the warning sign itself (first level), while the additional mandatory details can be provided by other means (second level). The guidelines also provide that "This information may be provided in combination with an icon to give, in a clearly visible, intelligible and clearly legible way, an overview of the envisaged processing (Article 12, paragraph 7, of the GDPR) . The format of the information will have to adapt to the various locations ”. The information should be positioned in such a way as to allow the data subject to easily recognize the circumstances of the surveillance, before entering the monitored area (approximately at eye level) "to allow the data subject to estimate which area is covered by a camera in so as to avoid surveillance or adapt one's behavior, where necessary ".
3. The outcome of the investigation and the sanctioning procedure.
On the basis of the assessment carried out by the Lombardy Legion of Carabinieri, it emerged that the video surveillance system, installed at the "1000 Luci Round a Bar" restaurant, is up and running and that the information notices have not been affixed referred to in art. 13 of the Regulation.
Therefore, in the present case, it is proven in documents that the party has carried out a processing of personal data, by means of a video surveillance system, in the absence of the required information. This conduct is in contrast with the provisions of art. 13 of the Regulation, according to which the data controller is required to provide the data subject with all information relating to the essential characteristics of the processing.
4. Order of injunction.
The Guarantor, pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, lett. i) of the Regulations and art. 166 of the Code, has the power to impose a pecuniary administrative sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, of the Regulation, through the adoption of an injunction order (Article 18. Law of 24 November 1981 n. 689), in relation to the processing of personal data carried out by the company through the video surveillance system, in the absence of the information referred to in art. 13 of the Regulation.
With reference to the elements listed in art. 83, par. 2, of the Regulations for the purposes of applying the pecuniary administrative sanction and its quantification, taking into account that the sanction must be "in each individual case effective, proportionate and dissuasive" (Article 83, par. 1 of the Regulations), that, in the present case, the following circumstances were taken into consideration:
with regard to the nature, severity and duration of the violation, the conduct of the data controller was taken into consideration, as well as the responsibility related to the non-fulfillment of the obligation to disclose the information to the interested parties;
the absence of specific precedents against the company relating to violations of the regulations on the protection of personal data;
the circumstance that the company has not cooperated with the Authority during the procedure nor has it shown that it has fulfilled its legal obligation.
On the basis of the aforementioned elements, assessed as a whole, the amount of the pecuniary sanction is determined in the amount of € 1,000.00 (one thousand) for the violation of art. 13 of the Regulation, deeming this amount appropriately effective, proportionate and dissuasive in relation to the case in question.
In this context, also in consideration of the type of violation ascertained, it is believed that, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and art. 16, paragraph 1, of the regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, this provision should be published on the Guarantor's website.
Finally, it is noted that the conditions set out in art. 17 of regulation no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures with external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor.
