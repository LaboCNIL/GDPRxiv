The company has not made use of the faculties provided for by art. 18 of the law n. 689/1981, by not sending defensive writings or documents to the Authority or asking to be heard about the alleged violations.
1.4. Only on 18 December 2020, the lawyer Giuseppe Pierfrancesco Mussumeci, in the name and on behalf of the company, sent a reply regarding the note of this Office of 9 September 2020 (notified by the Guardia di Finanza), with particular reference to the requests of Mr. XX, declaring that the company had "already for some time proceeded to delete any personal data referable to Mr. XX ".

2.1. Upon examination of the meager statements made by the data controller to the Authority during the procedure as well as of the documentation acquired, provided that, unless the fact constitutes a more serious crime, whoever, in a proceeding before the Guarantor, declares or falsely certifies news or circumstances or produces false deeds or documents and is liable pursuant to art. 168 of the Code, "False statements to the Guarantor and interruption of the execution of the tasks or the exercise of the powers of the Guarantor", it emerged that the company did not provide feedback to the request submitted pursuant to Articles 15-22 of the Regulation on 24 October 2019 by Mr. XX, concerning the aforementioned rights, including the request for cancellation of the personal data of the reporting party. The scant feedback provided by the company's lawyer, only after the notification made through the Guardia di Finanza, was not only late but also incomplete. According to the regulation, the company should have provided a reply to the interested party, even negative, in a manner consistent with the provisions of the legal system, representing, in conclusion, having deleted the data object of the request and adopting suitable measures to preclude the '' forwarding of subsequent promotional messages.
Therefore, the company has not complied with the obligation to provide feedback to the interested party, as required by art. 12 of the Regulation according to which "the data controller provides the data subject with information relating to the action taken regarding a request pursuant to articles 15 to 22 without undue delay and, in any case, at the latest within one month of receipt of the request itself ".

Art. 166, paragraph 2, of the Code establishes that the violation of art. 157 of the Code is subject to the administrative sanction referred to in Article 83, par. 5, of the Regulation.
3. Conclusions: illegality of the treatment. Corrective measures pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, Regulations.
For the aforementioned reasons, the processing of personal data relating to the reporting party carried out by the company due to the failure to reply to the requests for exercise of the rights presented by them, as well as the complete omission of the request for information formulated by the Authority pursuant to art. 157, is illegal, in the terms set out above, in relation to art. 12 of the Regulations and art. 157 of the Code.
Therefore, given the corrective powers attributed by art. 58, par. 2 of the Regulation, in light of the circumstances of the specific case:
- the Company is required to provide conclusive and unambiguous feedback to the interested party, ensuring that it has taken all necessary measures to prevent the forwarding of further communications to the whistleblower within 60 days of receipt of this provision;
- there is the application of a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to art. 83, par. 2 of the Regulations, commensurate with the circumstances of the specific case (Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i) of the Regulations).

With reference to the elements listed in art. 83, par. 2 of the Regulations for the purposes of applying the pecuniary administrative sanction and its quantification, taking into account that the sanction must "in any case [be] effective, proportionate and dissuasive" (Article 83, par. 1 of the Regulations), it is stated that , in the present case, the following circumstances were considered:
a) with regard to the nature, severity and duration of the violation, it is noted that the violation is to be considered significant, referring to the feedback to be provided to the Authority.

b) with reference to the willful or negligent nature of the violation and the degree of responsibility of the owner, the negligent conduct of the company and the degree of responsibility of its representatives who have not complied with the regulations on data protection have been taken into consideration in relation to the provisions of the Code;
c) with respect to the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, the company's failure to cooperate in all stages of the procedure was assessed;
d) the absence of specific precedents (relating to the same type of treatment) charged to the company.
