1. INTRODUCTION
 
1.1 Purpose of the report
 
The aim of this report is to provide statistical indicators of the office's activities, but above all to provide
comprehensive picture of the state of personal data protection within the Slovak Republic and also point to
the office's activities on an international and European scale. The description is no less important
of the actual state of the office with regard to its personnel, material and financial security, what
was in the monitored period and what is necessary and appropriate to change based on the indicated indicators.
 
By regulation, the European Union defined the supervisory authorities of individual member countries
unified scope of their scope, which was justified by the need for effective protection of the rights of individuals
when processing their personal data, as a result of which it expects from individual supervisory authorities,
that they will systematically fulfill this goal, with the necessary support of the state. The mentioned
unfortunately, neither the personnel potential nor the financial coverage of the activities correspond to the facts
office. In situations where the effort to consistently fulfill the tasks of the office runs into the absence of conditions that
would allow him to do so, it is impossible to achieve the level of supervision over the protection of personal data, ku
to which the Slovak Republic is obliged. Significant for the significantly unfavorable situation of the office
the fact that the office does not yet have its own within the state budget also has an impact
budget chapter, as a result of which there is a blatant contradiction with every request for removal
between the scope and difficulty of the assigned tasks, confronted with the amount of imposed fines, which
they are just a side effect of his mission.
 
The lack of employees affects the staff of the office in the form of an enormous workload,
which was not removed even by the cumulation of the functions of organizational units or the cumulation of the functions of some
employees. The mentioned facts in connection with already standard problems in security
adequate financial evaluation and sometimes even when securing the wages themselves are manifested
disillusionment, burnout, or departure of office employees to the commercial sphere or acceptance
lucrative offer from other state administration bodies. Here it is important to point out that fluctuation
of employees is devastating for the office, as familiarization with the issue of protection
personal data, regardless of the education of the new employee, is a process that does not take several years
weeks or months. Therefore, the current state and functionality of the office cannot (without using euphemisms)
describe in other ways than the words "before the collapse".
 
In November 2019, the Schengen evaluation of the Slovak Republic took place, which
an assessment of the Slovak Republic in the area of personal data protection was also part of it. According to
based on the conclusions of the evaluation, the European Union recommends that we increase personnel and budget security
office.
 
I am again pointing out the conclusions of the latest evaluation, according to which the European Union
among other things, she recommended increasing the staffing and budgeting of the office. Slovak
the Republic should the Personal Data Protection Office of the Slovak Republic:
 

-

-

-

 

 

ensure that in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the protection authority
personal data further increased its budget and number of employees,

to ensure that the part of the total state budget that is intended only for the authority for
personal data protection, clearly visible to guarantee that the authority for personal data protection
data has a separate public budget,

ensure that the National Council becomes familiar with the budget process
the opinion of the authority for the protection of personal data regarding its budgetary needs,

9

as well as the budget negotiations conducted by the Personal Data Protection Authority
with the Ministry of Finance,

 

- take measures to ensure that the Ministry of Finance cannot give to
mutual connection budget and amount of fines that the authority for personal data protection has
to choose because it could affect the nature and prioritization of the protection authority
personal data and thus affect his independence. It should be guaranteed that the budget of the body
for the protection of personal data will not be possible to reduce during the calendar year if the authority for
personal data protection will not collect the estimated amount of fines in full.

 
Since the fulfillment of the above recommendations is the basic premise of the entire process
Schengen assessment, I consider it necessary to meet these requirements repeatedly even today
draw attention. I believe that delaying the solution can have consequences for the Slovak Republic and
the functioning of the office itself, unfortunate consequences in the form of proceedings conducted against Slovenská
to the Republic by the European Commission, which would significantly negatively affect the perception
functioning of the rule of law in our country. At the same time, we are in a situation where if there are no quick and effective measures
step by step, we are waiting for the breakdown of the structures of the office so that the provision of protection to the persons concerned, as well as
the fulfillment of other tasks will remain uncovered for a long time.
 
In direct contrast to the aforementioned Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic
requested that the office deal with the request to reduce staff levels across the state
administration, namely 10% in accordance with Government Resolution no. 649 of October 14, 2020. In the conditions
the office was represented by five employees. At this time, the office was significantly understaffed
undersized, while the current state of the number of employees, after the necessary reduction of staff
of employees is alarmingly insufficient for the proper performance of the tasks of the office and its national ones
competencies. The situation at the office is currently critical, as the employees of the office must
hold more than one position cumulatively, due to the insufficient number of employees.
Today, the office is confronted with the departure of experts who are leaving not only for better conditions
to the private sector, but also to other places in the state administration, where they can offer them significantly better
conditions.
 
Beyond the scope of the above, the current situation is aggravated by the unresolved insufficient financial
the budget of the office, which we are trying to deal with in the long term. In addition to the fact that our numbers have decreased
employees, in contrast to the evaluation conclusions mentioned above, are also employees
office insufficiently motivated for their expertise and managing a wide range of agenda on
national or international level already by default beyond the scope of their working hours. Nowadays
in a young team, going on maternity leave is often one of the reasons why female employees leave
and then on parental leave.
 
Considering the above and the fact that there was a reduction in the number of employees of the office, it means
non-fulfilment, or a serious collision with the conclusions of the expert team of the Schengen evaluation
of the Slovak Republic 2019 in the field of personal data protection, which we have not fulfilled so far
not in any of the above points.
 
In conclusion, I would like to state that in the event of non-fulfillment of the obligation arising from the law of the European Union, there is a risk
to the member state proceedings for breach of obligations initiated by the European Commission pursuant to Article 258
and so on Treaties on the functioning of the European Union. In the case of proving that the state will not fulfill its obligations
the obligation imposed by EU law, the member state is threatened with possible monetary sanctions
imposition of a flat-rate fine until the time when the situation in the member state corresponds to the situation
required by EU law.

2 BUILDING, STAFFING AND BUDGET

AUTHORITY

 
2.1 Position of the office
 
The protection of personal data in the Slovak Republic is, on the basis of the law and Regulation, entrusted to
powers of the office. The Office is a state administration body with nationwide scope of execution
supervision of personal data protection and participating in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms
natural persons when processing their personal data. The office is progressing in the performance of its mandate
independently and in fulfilling its tasks, it is governed by the constitution, constitutional laws, laws, others
generally binding legal regulations and international treaties, which is Slovak
republic bound. The office is a budgetary organization according to the provisions of § 21 paragraph 1 and paragraph 5
letter a) of Act no. 523/2004 Coll. on budgetary rules of public administration and on amendments
some laws as amended.
 
2.2 Staffing of the office
 
2.2.1 Public functions of the office
 
The office is headed by a chairman, who is elected and recalled by the National People's Congress of the Slovak Republic at the proposal of the Government of the Slovak Republic.
The term of office of the head of the office is five years. Soňa held the position of chairperson of the office
Pőtheová, who was elected to the post by the NR SR on May 14, 2015 based on the voting results
of members of the NR SR (Resolution of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 1736/2015). Based on
of the government's proposal to remove her from her position, which was delivered to the NR SR on April 27, 2020 (item 74)
was on 29/04/2020 based on the result of the vote of the members of the NR SR on the proposal for her recall
dismissed from her position (Resolution of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. CRD-852/2020 of April 29, 2020). Management of the office
subsequently, in accordance with the law, the vice-president of the office took over.
 
The office's vice-president is held by Anna Vitteková, who was with effect from
On January 2, 2016, to the position appointed by the Government of the Slovak Republic by resolution no. 658/2015 from
on December 2, 2015. In connection with the dismissal of the head of the office for the entire year 2021, the office led
vice president of the office.
 
2.2.2 Personnel area of office employees
 
The employees of the office perform highly professional tasks in accordance with the law and the Regulation and other operational tasks
activities and obligations according to generally binding legal regulations. Securing them
requires the necessary number of qualified employees capable of performing professional activities
at the expert level, while it is also necessary to take into account the necessary degree of substitutability.
In terms of the office, from the point of view of the structure of the employees, in 2021 there were all employees
by employees in the state employee relationship. Selection of employees and filling of vacancies
of civil servant positions is implemented according to the conditions set by law for
individual functions exclusively on the basis of selection procedures, which the office publishes on the central office
public service portals.

From May 25, 2018, the protection of personal data is carried out in accordance with the Regulation and the law, which
they directly establish all of the authority's rights, obligations and competences. Despite the indisputable
the importance of the office's activity, which depends on the importance of the meaning and value of personal data, such as
source of information on natural persons, the office's employee limit for 2021 was reduced
to 461 compared to the office's employee limit from 2020, which was 51 employees.
 
The established limit of employees in 2021 was not sufficient in the context of the agenda, which the office
provides and which has an ever-increasing tendency in terms of the amount of work per person
employee. For the proper operation of the office and also with regard to human possibilities and efforts
for high-quality work of employees, it is necessary that the number of employees is significant
increased by at least 30 employees. This will ensure the redistribution of work and the possibility of a higher salary
the specialization of individual employees, as many now carry out cumulative activities,
each of which requires full concentration and attention.
 
The office's agenda, even in the context of the obligations arising from the Regulation, has grown disproportionately and has constantly
growing trend. The current situation is unsustainable in the long term and there is a lack of qualified personnel
of employees is inevitably reflected in the quality of work, or even results in impossibility
compliance with procedural deadlines. In order to fulfill the strategic direction of the office's activities, it is necessary,
to increase the number of employees, so that they graduate and continuously participate in the necessary
educational activities, they expanded their knowledge and were thus able to grow professionally
also reflect the demand for digitization of public and state administration.
 
It is necessary to strengthen the office with experts in information technology, as more and more
processing activities takes place electronically and it is necessary that within the proceedings,
as well as controls, the office was able to comment on the findings at an expert level
it goes
about information technologies used by operators and intermediaries.
 
The Office also feels a lack of employees dedicated to legislation, in its field
creation, as well as its comments, as it is a lengthy process of examining the submitted proposal
legal regulation or non-legislative proposal that requires high attention and concentration
and it is essential that the employee has enough time and knowledge for such work, and not only that
theoretical, but also practical. The undersized personnel side of the office is also reflected in this
                                                      
1 The reduction of the limit of the number of employees of the office occurred on the basis of the discussion and approval of the material "Budget draft
public administration for the years 2021 to 2023", material number: UV-22129/2020; on the basis of which the Resolution was adopted
of the Government of the Slovak Republic no. 649/2020 of 14/10/2020. Mandatory consideration of the reduction in the number of employees in the conditions of the office
meant a loss of 5 employees.

12

regarding the fact that the office of that time cannot even think about establishing detached workplaces, which would
was also closer to the affected persons, operators and intermediaries.
 
The undersizing of the number of employees also has the effect that it is not possible to develop the necessary
specialization by creating new branches that would take over from the existing ones and then develop them
some agendas to expert level. We consider it particularly necessary that it be an employee
the necessary training provided to the office, which will have a positive impact on the performance of their activities,
so when it comes to speed, but especially expertise.
 
The impossibility of obtaining adequate salary conditions in the long term appears to be problematic
to maintain erudite specialists, as a result of which the office is not in an equal position to
operators and their options, which is ultimately always to the disadvantage of the affected party
persons. From the application practice of the office, there is an acute need for the creation of at least two secondees
workplaces, one in central and one in eastern Slovakia. The reason for the need for creation
of these workplaces is so that the employees of the office are closer to the affected persons from these areas as well
of Slovakia and also the fact that in this way the performance of controls would be made more efficient and they would be significantly reduced
office costs for employees' travel from Bratislava; the office would also contribute to the increase
employment in these regions, where there are still enough qualified people looking for work
they can't or don't want to move.
 
2.3 Office budget
 
The office is a budgetary organization, which is linked to the state by its income and expenses
budget through the General Treasury Department, which is managed by the Ministry
of the Slovak Republic's finances.
 
For the year 2021, a budget of EUR 1,727,539.00 was initially approved for the office. During
of the year, the budget of the office was increased to the amount of EUR 1,738,043.75.
 
The utilization of the office's budget as of 31.12.2021 was in the amount of EUR 1,737,952.97, which represents 99.99%

framework

3 LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION
 
3.1 Interdepartmental comment procedures
 
The office is a state administration body with nationwide scope, exercising supervision over protection
personal data and participating in the protection of basic human rights and freedoms during processing
personal data of natural persons. The Office fulfills its role in the field of processing supervision
personal data also by overseeing and commenting on the texts of draft laws and others
generally binding legal regulations (materials of a legislative nature) and also to texts
non-legislative materials (visions, strategies, etc.). He formulates his comments on proposals
through the Portal within the MPK. The purpose of the comments applied by the office is,
so that, in particular, the quality of legislation regarding the regulation of personal data processing is
high, so that the subsequently adopted legislation is precise and unambiguous, and so in relation
to the operator, as well as in relation to the person concerned, whose personal data will be used in practice
subject of processing.
 
IN
of the monitored period, the office made comments on 89 materials from
of all submitted to the MPK (regardless of whether it was legislative or non-legislative material
nature). In total, the office made 439 comments, 337 of which were fundamental.
 
The office always tries to improve the quality of the legal regulation with the comments it makes, as the case may be
about the need to protect and respect the legislation regarding the processing of personal data
data, if the subject of comment is non-legislative material, for example, a concept that has
in the future to be the basis for the creation of legal regulations or the fulfillment of set goals.
 
Smaller deficiencies in legislation can be corrected with simple comments that
in principle, they specify the correct wording of the provision, or adjust it to a form that, as far as
about processing, is correct.
 
The essence of the office's reminder activity consists of fundamental reminders that point to
more or less fundamental shortcomings of legal standards that need to be supplemented or revised.
In the observed period, many fundamental comments of the office were directed to the respondents
determining and clarifying the purpose for which personal data are to be processed, as many purposes as there were
formulated very generally, or they were completely absent from the legal point of view
certainties
and enforceability of the legal norm in practice would certainly cause problems and be at a disadvantage
of the person concerned. The comments also related to the scope of personal data to be processed,
as often the submitter did not provide specific data, and often could not even define them
during the adversarial proceedings, which conflicted with the principle of data minimization. Another often
a recurring fundamental reminder was the reminder requesting the deletion of certain
of the proposed provisions, as the processing proposed by them in the context of the purpose went beyond the scope
necessity and necessity. In the case of such comments, it often happened that the office from the gestor
even in the adversarial proceedings, he did not receive a satisfactory answer as to why extensive processing is necessary,
possibly what it results from and what it is supposed to achieve. In several cases there was a discrepancy
deleted by explanation and wording adjusted together. Others, more and more frequently recurring
the deficiency commented on by the office is the insufficient content of the explanatory report,
especially its special part, when especially in the provisions related to the processing of personal data
the reasons and causes of the proposed amendment, explanations from the drafter of the law are absent.
The justifications in the explanatory report are often general, given in one sentence, of which there is none
it is clear why the processing is requested and why it is necessary to the extent indicated. Very often
with a recurring reminder is the absence of internal references to other special laws which
specify and supplement the very purpose of processing personal data in terms of the legal agenda, which

16

may relate to the processing, or refer to the provision of another law, where it is established
scope or list of processed personal data for the established purpose. Last but not least,
the office also encountered an insufficient modification of the restriction within the commented materials
rights of the persons concerned for the purposes resulting from the specific submitted proposal.
 
In the monitored period, it also continued to influence the creation of legislation and the method of its adoption
the pandemic of the disease COVID-19, which, from the point of view of the legislation and in the opinion of the office, reflected on
its quality rather negatively, as many legislative standards were adopted in abbreviated form
legislative proceedings, without comment. The office does not dispute that the protection of human life is
primary, but in its legislative setting in terms of preventing the spread of the disease COVID-19 would
fundamental legislative amendments should have been adopted so that they were consistent with the regulating legislation
other basic human rights, so that situations do not arise in practice where legal standards conflict with each other
they compete or collide.
 
Other deficiencies encountered by the office as part of its commenting activity were
the fact that the adversarial procedure was omitted several times to the fundamental comments which
the office applied and about the acceptance as well as the final form (whether comments were accepted or not)
learned only from the wording of the regulation published in the Collection of Laws.
 
The specific wording of the office's comments can be searched on the Portal using a filter
institutions and using the comment filter (whether it is an organization comment marked as essential,
or ordinary).
 
3.2 Methodological guidelines and information
 
The Office methodically guides operators and intermediaries in the processing of personal data
data, increases public awareness in the area of risks and rights related to the processing of personal data
data and also increases the awareness of operators and intermediaries about their obligations.
A proven form of guidance for operators and intermediaries and information
the public, especially the affected persons, based on the office's practice, became the office's methodological guidelines
and short ad hoc methodologies published on the office's website, dedicated to questions
and issues that are the subject of public interest at the given time or that are necessary
to inform.
  
Among other things, the office uses a website to inform about current events related to
protection of personal data. In the monitored period, the office published information regarding, for example:

4 COMMUNICATION OF THE AUTHORITY WITH THE PUBLIC
 
4.1 Statements of the office on issues of natural persons and legal entities
 
The issue of personal data protection does not only concern operators or intermediaries,
who have the obligation to apply personal data protection legislation in practice, but also to people,
specific natural persons - affected persons, who have questions arising from ordinary situations
life, related to their personal data and their processing. In the monitored period, with regard to
the pandemic was still dominated by questions regarding the processing of personal health data, measurements
temperatures, processing of data on children's health in schools and kindergartens, identification of employees
in employment. In connection with this topic, we referred part of the questions to the National Center
health information. Again, a relatively large part of the questions consisted of questions related to
processing personal data in apartment buildings and installing cameras in apartment buildings. On the
the office was approached by many operators about what obligations they have in connection with it
with the operation of their website. Subsequently, the rights of those affected are among the frequent questions
persons, deletion of data from the bank register, or from the non-bank register, also related questions
with the term "Responsible Person". During the monitored period, the office recorded high demand
law firms with questions in the field of personal data protection that they cannot answer
to their clients.
 
Operators and mediators of the office most often address questions of a professional nature
related to their obligations arising from the Regulation and the law, or special laws
regulating processing operations. Since municipalities and cities are also operators, several
of them contacted the office either in connection with testing, or addressed questions to the office in particular
regarding their position in the testing process, or the fulfillment of the information obligation towards the affected parties
persons or the possibility or impossibility of using municipal or city-operated cameras on
purposes of monitoring the density of people in front of the test site.
 
The employees of the office handled 685 questions in the monitored period, while it is necessary to take into account that
the records are kept on the document, not the number of questions asked in it, so it really was
answered several times more questions from the public.
 
4.2 Provision of information based on requests for disclosure of information according to the law

no. 211/2000 Coll.

 
One of the possibilities for public access to information is the possibility to submit a request in terms of
Act No. 211/2000 Coll. The Office, as an obliged person, evaluates these requests and in accordance with the law
no. 211/2000 Coll. equips.
 
In 2021, the office received 228 requests to make information available. Of this total
number, in 50 cases the office processed the request by making the required information available, in 44
cases issued a decision not to make the information available in part and at the same time made the information available,
that could have been made available, in 40 cases the office issued a decision not to make the information available,
in 30 cases, he postponed the submitted applications, as they were not within the deadline specified in the request for supplementation
supplemented. In 48 cases, the office of the office forwarded the request as the relevant department
to another relevant department of the office for processing, since their content indicated that they were not
a request to make information available, but for example a question from the public, or some advanced to
equipment to another obliged person, to whose competences they belonged based on the assessment of their content.

Communication of the office with the media

4.3
 
The subject of questions from the media were specific problems and "cases" in which it was the subject
processing or protection of personal data, or journalists' questions were directed to
specification of the rights of the persons concerned, how to apply them correctly and what is possible
the affected person to claim from the operator. Processing issues persisted for the second year
and personal data protection in connection with the pandemic, and subsequent measures and obligations,
which were related to the processing of personal data of natural persons, especially if they were the subject
processing data related to health. The repeated security measures also aroused great interest in the media
incidents involving the National Center for Health Information. Subsequently, the media became interested
about the case connected with the pre-election survey of the OĽANO movement.
 
During the monitored period, the Office reminded citizens of the following days:

and tries to make the website transparent so that it is as user-friendly as possible. In the other
during the monitored period, the office tried to improve and supplement the English version in particular, so that the affected
persons were able to obtain information even if they do not speak the Slovak language and also in the context of the fact that the office
and the Slovak Republic were the subject of the Schengen evaluation regarding personal protection
data, when access and provision of information was also the subject of interest of the evaluators
in English, or in another foreign language or the language of a national minority.
 
The website of the office was searched a total of 698,926 times during the monitored period.
 
4.5 Website of the office and reporting of violations of personal data protection
 
The website of the office is a key source of information related to the protection of personal data.
At the same time, it is also a basic service according to Act no. 69/2018 Coll. on cyber security
and on the amendment of some laws. Operators and intermediaries must ensure
continuous reliability, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
and at regular intervals assess the effectiveness of established technical and organizational
measures. Nevertheless, it may occur (either due to deliberate action, negligence, mistake or
natural event) to the violation of personal data security, which as a result may
mean accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or
making available, transmitted, stored or otherwise processed personal data.
 

21

The operator has an obligation under Art. 33 of the Regulation or to report a violation according to § 40 of the Act
protection of personal data (so-called "data breach") of the office. He can do so in relation to the office

obligations for this form, published on the website of the office, which was the beginning
of the observed period specified so that the office based on its details and answers therein
mentioned learned all the necessary information to know the reported breach of protection
personal data as best as possible.
 
In the monitored period, 165 violations of personal data protection were formally reported to the office

violation of personal data protection actually flag 137 reports. The remaining 28 reports
it mostly represented another agenda of the office, such as a proposal to initiate proceedings, which was unfounded

The number of requests that the affected persons addressed to the office, as the operator
 
In the monitored period of the office, the office received 4 requests from affected persons. In all of them
cases, the persons concerned have exercised the right to access their personal data. In three cases
information was sent to the affected persons according to Art. 15 Regulations together with the required
photocopies of their personal data. In one case, the person concerned applied the request of the person concerned
person to access their personal data by email. The email contained only the last name of the person concerned
(i.e. it did not contain any verification element). Moreover, it was not obvious from him to what extent you
affected person right according to Art. 15 Regulations applied. The concerned person was, in accordance with Art. 12
para. 6 Regulations by email requested to complete her correspondence address and signature as
of the verification element (or guaranteed electronic signature in the case of sending in electronic
form). The person concerned did not complete the required information. In view of the above, especially on
the fact that it was possible to have doubts about the identity of the person concerned, as his identity
was not properly verified and the fact that in connection with the processing of the application (by sending personal
data to any extent) there would be a risk of unauthorized provision of this data
to another person, the request of the person concerned was not processed.
 

 

24

6 APPROVAL AND CONSULTATION ACTIVITY OF THE AUTHORITY
 
6.1 Prior consultation
 
According to Art. 36 par. 1 Regulations "The operator shall carry out with the supervisory authority before processing
consultation if the data protection impact assessment pursuant to Article 35 shows that this
processing would lead to a high risk if the operator did not take measures to
mitigating that risk."
 
According to Art. 35 par. 5 Regulations "The supervisory authority can establish and publish a list as well
processing operations for which a data protection impact assessment is not required.
The Supervisory Authority sends these lists to the Committee; to the so-called of the list of processing operations which
they will not be subject to an assessment of the impact on the protection of personal data (so-called white list) Slovak
the republic has not yet joined.
 
According to Art. 35 par. 4 Regulations "The supervisory authority shall draw up and publish a list of those
processing operations that are subject to a data protection impact assessment requirement
according to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority sends these lists to the committee referred to in Article 68; list
processing operations, which are always subject to an assessment of the impact of the Slovak Republic in terms of
of the aforementioned article (the so-called black list), which is available on the office's website
"List of processing operations subject to personal protection impact assessment
data of the Slovak Republic". This list of processing operations serves, among other things, to
clarification of Art. 35 par. 1 Regulations and operators who intend the said processing
to be carried out if the processing intended by them would lead to a high risk for rights
and the freedom of the affected persons in the event that the operator does not take measures to mitigate this
risks, they are obliged to carry out a prior consultation with the office.
 
6.2 Transfer of personal data
 
The free movement of personal data is guaranteed within the EEA. However, when transferring to countries outside the EEA
or international organizations need to comply with additional protection requirements
personal data specified in Regulation and Directive 2016/680. Although some transfer tools
personal data according to both legal regulations are the same, it is always necessary to examine the material
scope of the tool used.
 
Transfers can be divided into two groups:

 transfer to third countries (international organization) guaranteeing an adequate level

protection,

 transfer to third countries (international organization) not guaranteeing an adequate level

protection.

 
6.2.1 Transfer to a country guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection
 
When transferring personal data to third countries, a distinction is made between whether it is a transfer of personal data to
of a third country guaranteeing or not guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection. Status
the EC determines the country that guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection
decision. It is necessary for the third country to insure because of its national law or
international agreements that it has signed, the level of protection of fundamental rights, which is basically
equivalent to the level of protection guaranteed in the EU legal order.
 
 

25

The EC issues a decision on adequacy specifically for the substantive scope of the Regulation and specifically for
substantive scope of Directive 2016/680. Adequacy decisions issued by the EC over time
scope of Act no. 122/2013 Coll., remain in force unless the EC changes, replaces or
shall not be canceled by a decision adopted pursuant to the Regulation. The aforementioned decisions apply only to transmission
personal data within the scope of the Regulation, not Directive 2016/680. The office publishes
adequacy decisions on its website.
 
In the evaluated period, the EC issued a decision on adequacy

6.2.2 Transfer to a country that does not guarantee an adequate level of personal data protection
 
Even when transferred to a country or international organization that does not guarantee an adequate level
protection, it is necessary to distinguish between the tools offered by the Regulation and the tools that
offered by Directive 2016/680.
 
6.2.2.1 Transfer according to the Regulation

7.3 Selection from inspections completed in 2021
 
7.3.1 Controls of personal data processing in information systems, with the help of which

ensures the practical implementation of the Schengen acquis

 
In the inspection plan, the office regularly includes inspections of the processing of personal data in information systems
systems that ensure the practical implementation of the Schengen acquis
competent authorities on the territory of the Slovak Republic, as well as representative offices of Slovakia
republics abroad. In 2021, 4 inspections started in 2020 were completed (Národná
Europol headquarters, Criminalistics and Expertise Institute of the Police Force, border crossing
and computing center of the Ministry of the Interior) and 2 inspections started in 2021 (district department
of the Police Force and the Criminalistics and Expertise Institute of the Police Force). All checks were
ended with an inspection record, no deficiencies were found.
 
7.3.2 Processing of personal data by the pharmacy
 
In connection with the reported breach of personal data protection, a focused inspection was carried out
to a medical facility providing pharmaceutical care. The security incident was unfolding
from a burglary that occurred at night in the premises of a pharmacy operated
controlled person. In addition to the financial cash deposited in the cash desks of the registers
cash registers, the electronic IDs of several healthcare workers were also stolen
employees of the inspected person and paper tickets containing names, surnames and social security numbers
customers. In relation to stolen electronic IDs of healthcare workers
intended for identification and authorization when entering the electronic healthcare system
(eHealth) and the controlled person for electronic signing of documents without delay
asked the National Center for Health Information to block the aliens and extradite them
new licenses. They had stolen tickets with the names, surnames and social security numbers of the customers
to be made by two employees of the controlled person for the purpose of simplifying the selection of medicines
prescribed by their family members. Control authority based on information and evidence
obtained during the inspection found that the inspected person did not accept adequate
security measures corresponding to existing risks, especially technical measures for
security of the building and organizational measures consisting in instructing authorized employees
to process personal data of affected persons (patients). Deficiencies detected by the inspection in question
they were subsequently reflected in the control protocol.
 
7.3.3 Processing of personal data by the technical control station
 
The control carried out on the basis of the control plan was focused on the processing of personal data
by the technical inspection station (STK) when verifying the technical suitability of vehicles for operation
in road traffic, i.e. in connection with the performance of technical control. Personal data of holders
of motor vehicles for the purpose of agreeing the date of technical inspection (so-called
pre-contractual relations) obtains MOT through an online form published on its
website, in the scope of: name and surname of the applicant, vehicle registration number, telephone number
and email contact. During the performance of the technical inspection itself, it processes (obtains) personal data
professionally qualified person – technician to whom technical inspection of the vehicle is assigned. Total
conditions for carrying out technical checks, including the specified scope of processed
personal data, including through monitoring recording devices (cameras
systems),

on the operation of vehicles in road traffic. The aforementioned law also determines the conditions of operation
of the national information system of technical controls, which is operated by the authorized
technical inspection service according to § 70 par. 4 of this Act. Authorized MOT technicians

electronic protocol for each technical inspection. During the inspection, the office emphasized on
provision of transparent information to affected persons, scope of personal data processed
data, processing security and the presence of another entity participating in the processing
personal data. In order to comply with the principles of personal data processing, it is an obligation
the operator to clearly and transparently inform the data subject about the processing operations
and the reasons that authorize the operator to perform specific processing operations.
The controlled person provided the concerned persons with information in a confusing manner, while the information
it also incorporated the consents of the persons concerned, which were not necessary for the processing and did not comply at the same time
conditions of freely given consent. Controlled person except as specified by law
monitoring device with recording had its own camera system installed, which
operated for the purposes of legitimate interests without performing the so-called
proportionality test. Operation of the mentioned camera system without a pre-conducted test
proportionality, the controlled person acted in violation of the principle of legality according to Article 5
para. 1 letter a) Regulations. The inspection also revealed deficiencies in determining the retention period
camera recordings, as the controlled person set an unreasonably long 10-day period
their storage, thereby contradicting the principle of minimizing data storage
according to article 5 par. 1 letter c) Regulations. When evaluating the level of security, it was found that
the controlled person did not have prepared records of processing activities. They were the control
terminological inaccuracies in contracts on the processing of personal data that were not found
caused by the controlled person, since the contract in question is drawn up by the operator
of the national information system for all MOTs. The inspection was completed with a protocol
about control.
 
7.3.4 Processing of personal data by the medical facility
 
On the basis of notification of the person concerned, to whom it was in the past from the controlled party
health care provided by the medical facility, the office dealt with the suspicion that
the personal data of this person concerned were not processed in accordance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality
according to article 5 par. 1 letter f) Regulations, as there was supposed to be a loss of the medical part
documentation. Responsibility for the safe storage of medical documentation follows
to the health care provider under the Health Care Act and how
to the operator processing personal data related to the health of patients also from the Regulation.
To carry out a check, during which it would be possible to get acquainted with data on the health of the person concerned
person in connection with the verification of the loss of part of his medical documentation, it was necessary
have the written consent of this person concerned. The institute was also used during the inspection
cooperation, in which the law enforcement authorities provided expert opinions, which
among other things, they also commented on the fact whether the medical documentation is related to the medical
performance provided in a controlled medical facility is complete. The control dealt
exclusively by maintaining health documentation as an integral part of providing health care
care in the sense of its preservation by the controlled person as a healthcare provider
care had to be kept for 20 years from the last provision of health care
care. The control was in connection with the processing of personal data in the health department
in the documentation, at least one person found a contradiction with the principle of integrity and confidentiality, as
the set of personal data forming the health documentation of the person concerned was not processed
in a way that guarantees adequate security of personal data, including protection against
unauthorized or illegal processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage
through appropriate technical and organizational measures. They were found by inspection
also other shortcomings in connection with the obligation of the controlled person to carry out an assessment of the impact on
personal data protection when the controlled person did not assess the necessity and adequacy
processing operations in relation to the purpose and did not deal with the assessment of risks for rights and freedoms
of the persons concerned, which was largely related to the weak level of the controlled person's response to
new legislation applicable to the field of personal data protection. A controlled person in a relationship

33

to information provided to data subjects through its website
at the same time, it did not provide complete, clear and understandable information, as it did not provide the information
on the purpose (providing health care as the basic activity of a medical facility)
and the legal basis for the processing of personal data (the processing of personal data follows
healthcare provider by law). Deficiencies detected by the inspection in question
they were subsequently reflected in the control protocol.
 
7.3.5 Processing of personal data by the city's camera system
 
Inspection of the city's camera system initiated by suspicion of violation of duties at
processing of personal data was focused on the obligations of the operator in monitoring
spaces accessible to the public. During the inspection, it was found that the operator at
processing of personal data of the persons concerned for the purpose of protecting property and ensuring safety
of citizens and visitors to the city, he proceeded in violation of the principle of minimization of storage according to
Article 5 par. 1 letter e) Regulations by keeping the personal data of the persons concerned for a period of time
longer than the time necessary to achieve the intended purpose. The inspection further revealed,
that the operator acted contrary to the principle of data minimization according to Article 5 par. 1
letter c) Regulations by using some cameras to monitor the space beyond the range necessary for
achieving the purpose of processing. In relation to the information provided to the persons concerned at
obtaining their personal data, compliance with the requirements was noted by the control authority
Regulations. Deficiencies found during the inspection were subsequently reflected in the protocol
about control.
 
7.3.6 Processing of personal data for the purpose of issuing resident parking cards
 
On the basis of the suspicion of violation of obligations in the processing of personal data, the office carried out
control of the processing activities of the operator entrusted with the operation of parking lots
area of the city (city district). During the inspection, it was found that the inspected person based
applications are issued to persons with permanent residence in the so-called resident parking cards
(RPK), while for the purpose of issuing the RPK it requires personal data from the affected persons (applicants).
in the scope of: first name, last name, address of permanent residence, apartment number, telephone contact, e-mail
and the registration number of the vehicle for which the applicant requests the issuance of an RPK. Together with the request for extradition
RPK requires the inspected person to send a copy of the Vehicle Registration Certificate (Part I), a document
proving the applicant's relationship to the apartment (ownership certificate, lease agreement or other document)
and a certificate of permanent residence issued by the relevant city district (in the case of the first application or
changes of permanent residence). In the past, the controlled person also required the applicant to send
photocopies of the identity card. Control authority based on information and evidence obtained
during the inspection, he found that the inspected person violated the principle
minimization of personal data according to Article 5 par. 1 letter c) Regulations, insofar as it had data
verify permanent residence and apartment number through the relevant city district (contract
obligation of the city district) and only if the city district does not have certain data, it should
for the purposes of prevention against the abuse of RPK, request a document proving it from the person concerned
the applicant's relationship to the apartment. During the inspection, a violation of Article 14 of the Regulation was detected
by the fact that the controlled person did not inform the affected persons about the acquisition of personal data
from the information systems of the relevant city district. The inspection was completed with a protocol
about control.
 
7.3.7 Monitoring tables in a fast food facility
 
By checking the processing activities of an entity operating in the field of service provision
of fast food, which the office carried out based on the initiative of the person concerned, was found
unwanted monitoring of tables where customers were consuming food and drinks. Controlling

34

the authority concluded that the established fact collides with the principle of data minimization according to the article
5 par. 1 letter c) Regulations. At the same time, the controlled person did not prove that the monitoring is
necessary for the purposes of the controlled person's legitimate interests, or she did not prove that her
legitimate interests in such processing prevail over interests or fundamental rights
and freedoms of affected persons (customers). Due to the identified processing deficiencies
the control of personal data by the controlled person was terminated by the control protocol.
 
7.3.8 Monitoring of publicly accessible spaces by a state institution
 
The inspection was carried out on the basis of a tip pointing to a camera system in operation
central authority of the state administration. The inspection found that the processing of personal data
camera system is in a specific case aimed at the protection of state property under management
controlled person and to protect the life, health and safety of employees and visitors,
respectively is considered necessary by the controller for the purposes of legitimate interests which
the controlled person is watching. The necessity of processing personal data and the condition
predominance of their interests over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned
the controlled person was involved in the proportionality test, where he identified his authorized person
interest, assessed its legitimacy, necessity and appropriateness, and subsequently assessed it
proportionality in relation to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned. Justifications
stated in the proportionality test, the office accepted as sufficient. Via camera
the system monitored the entrance area to the controlled person's object and the immediate area
the surroundings of the building (parking lot and entrance for vehicles). The inspected person had a set deadline
storage of personal data by the camera system for 72 hours and records from all cameras
were subsequently lubricated. During the inspection, the images of individual cameras were also checked - in the case
of the camera monitoring the entrance for vehicles, it was found during the inspection that the inspected person except
its entrance for vehicles also monitors part of the public footpath, i.e. the area of which
monitoring is not necessary to fulfill the stated purpose of personal data processing.
On the basis of the detected contradiction with the principle of data minimization according to Article 5 par. 1 letter c)
The inspection of the Regulations was concluded with an inspection report.
 
7.4 Conclusions
 
Despite the continuously modified bans and restrictions related to the disease pandemic
In the evaluated period, the standard level of control activity of the office was maintained due to COVID-19.
However, an increasing burden was identified with the checks of camera systems, which are
to a significant extent operated by natural persons - individuals in their dwellings, while
in these cases, the protection of the rights of the monitored affected persons often overlaps with those of the neighbors
or other disputes.

8 PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION PROCEEDINGS
 
The purpose of the procedure on the protection of personal data is to determine whether there has been a violation of the rights of natural persons in
processing of their personal data or there has been a violation of the provisions of the Regulation, or the law,
and in case of detection of deficiencies, if it is reasonable and expedient, to impose corrective measures, as appropriate
fine. The provisions of the administrative order apply to proceedings on the protection of personal data.
 
If the competence of the office is not given to act and decide on the matter, the office has the obligation to submit
forward to the relevant administrative authority. In the monitored period, the office forwarded a total of 49 submissions
to another competent administrative authority for action and decision.
 
Legal regulations in the field of personal data protection allow the office to submit in exhaustive form
postpone in specified cases. The office had to postpone the submission in his case
groundlessness, in the event that the matter to which the submission was concerned was discussed by a criminal enforcement authority
proceedings, in case the applicant did not provide the necessary cooperation to the office at his request, while without
it was not possible to handle the matter without his active participation, and in the event that, from the event to which the submission was related,
more than three years have passed on the day of its delivery. The most common reason for postponement was
the groundlessness of the submission, when it was already clear from the evidence submitted by the person concerned,
that there was no violation of legal regulations in the field of personal data protection. In the watched
period, a total of 306 submissions were postponed.
 
The Office, as part of its supervisory activities, conducts proceedings on the protection of personal data with the aim of protecting rights
natural persons from unauthorized interference in their private life during their processing
personal data, while also examining compliance with the obligations set by the Regulation
and the law. If it detects a violation of the rights of the person concerned or non-fulfillment of obligations during processing
personal data, by decision, if it is reasonable and expedient, to the operator or
to the intermediary to take measures to eliminate deficiencies and causes within the specified period
of their occurrence, or imposes a fine on him, depending mainly on the seriousness of the detected violation.
Otherwise, the proceedings on personal data protection will stop.
 
Proceedings on the protection of personal data are initiated at the request of the petitioner or on his own initiative
office. Proceedings on the authority's own initiative are initiated on the basis of an initiative, on the basis of results
control, by which deficiencies were detected or based on the findings of the office from its own activities
on suspicion of violation of legal regulations in the field of personal data protection, as proceedings
started without a proposal.
 
In the monitored period, the office initiated a total of 218 administrative proceedings, of which 135 were initiated
at the proposal of the person concerned, 43 started based on the initiative, 19 started based on the results
inspections, which identified deficiencies and 21 proceedings were conducted by the office on its own initiative based on
suspicions of violation of legal regulations in the field of personal data protection.

The decision of the office, as an administrative body in the first instance in proceedings on the protection of personal data,
it is based on a reliably ascertained state of affairs. For this purpose, the office is in the process of personal protection
authorized to request cooperation from anyone, while in the evaluated period the office requested

36

by cooperation a total of 967 times. In the proceedings on personal data protection, there were two cases when
the entity from which cooperation was requested did not respond to it and the office even after being asked to comply
did not provide cooperation obligations (in the given cases, proceedings were initiated against the subjects
on a fine or on an orderly fine).
 
In connection with raising awareness of personal data protection among the public, cases or
the media were also often interested in the results of the proceedings. The Institute of Legal Representation was evaluated
period used in a considerable number of cases, and the cases where all
the participants in the proceedings were represented by legal representatives.
 
The most frequent subject of proceedings on the protection of personal data was review or processing
personal data of the persons concerned in the information system, which included cameras,
there was no violation of legal regulations in the field of personal data protection.
 
Among the most frequent violations was the processing of personal data contrary to the policy
legality, when personal data was processed without a legal basis, or
in violation of the legal basis and processing in violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality, which
it was related to the failure to take adequate security measures.

9 COOPERATION AND CONSISTENCY MECHANISM
 
The functioning of the internal market requires that there is no free movement of personal data within the Union
limited or prohibited, not even for reasons related to the protection of natural persons during processing
personal data, which is also reflected in the provisions of Art. 1 paragraph 3 Regulations. On the said Regulation
responds by introducing cooperation and consistency mechanisms to guarantee consistency
and a similarly high level of personal data protection in each member state regardless of
place of residence of the person concerned.
 
9.1 Cooperation mechanism
 
The Regulation regulates the cooperation between supervisory authorities, whether the need is mutual
cooperation will arise as part of the investigation of a specific suspicion of a violation of personal protection
data or as part of other activities of the supervisory authority (e.g. solving legal issues,
provision of consultations). Given that the rules of cooperation are regulated directly
in the Regulation, no further special agreements between member states are required
for this purpose.
 
9.1.1 Cross-border processing
 
Pursuant to Art. 55 Regulations, each supervisory authority fulfills the tasks and exercises the powers published
By regulation on the territory of your state. However, the regulation also specifically regulates the procedure and jurisdiction
in proceedings for cross-border processing of personal data. Cross-border processing is within the meaning
Art. 4 point 23 of the Regulations a) processing of personal data that takes place in the Union in the context
activities of the operator's or intermediary's establishments in more than one member state
state, while the operator or intermediary is established in more than one member state
the state; or b) processing of personal data that takes place in the Union in the context of the activities of the sole
establishment of the operator or intermediary in the Union, but which significantly affects
or is likely to significantly affect data subjects in more than one Member State.
 
The Regulation regulates cooperation between supervisory authorities, primarily in connection
with the mechanism of a single point of contact (the so-called one-stop-shop) regulated in Art. 56
para. 1 of the Regulation, according to which the supervisory authority is the main establishment or the only one
establishments of the operator or intermediary authorized to act as a supervisor
authority for cross-border
of this operator,
respectively intermediary. According to Art. 56 par. 2 of the Regulations, each supervisory authority is competent to deal with
with a complaint submitted to him or a possible violation of the Regulation, if the facts are relevant
only establishments in its member state or substantially affects the persons concerned only in its
member state. In accordance with Art. 4 point 22 of the Regulations other supervisory authorities will be for this
processing in the position of the concerned supervisory authorities, if a) the operator or
the intermediary is established in the territory of the member state of this supervisory authority; b) affected persons
residing in the member state of this supervisory authority are significantly affected or will be
likely to be substantially affected by processing; or c) the complaint was submitted to this supervisor
authority.
 
The determination of the lead supervisory authority and the concerned authorities is carried out in the IMI system
(Internal Market Informational System - Information system about the internal market), within which
there is an exchange of information about specific processing between the individual supervisory authorities
and a specific suspicion of a violation of personal data protection, or as long as the investigation
started on the basis of a complaint from the person concerned, as well as about the content of this particular complaint. Exchange
information is provided in English.

In the monitored period, the office received 1071 notifications regarding determination in the IMI system
the head and the supervisory authority concerned. Based on careful consideration of each item
the office assessed that it is the concerned supervisory authority in 184 cases; most often for the reasons that
the processing of personal data in question significantly affects or is likely to significantly affect
will affect affected persons residing in the territory of the Slovak Republic. Most often it went
o operators of social networks, various airlines, operators providing
online games, various e-shops, etc. In some cases, the office was also concerned because
the operator or intermediary is established on the territory of the Slovak Republic, i.e. on the territory
The Slovak Republic has one or more establishments. If the office has assessed that it is the affected person
supervisory authority, marked it in the IMI system and followed up the case further. In accordance with Art. 60 Regulations
the office had the opportunity, as necessary, to comment on the requests of the head of the supervisory authority, on his
the procedure and the results of the investigation and also to comment on draft decisions. If the office
to the concerned supervisory authority due to the fact that it received a complaint, the office acts as
point of contact for the person concerned and informs him of the decision of the head of the supervisory authority.
 
A total of 31 submissions containing elements were delivered to the Office in the monitored period
of cross-border processing and 13 notifications of violations of personal data protection, so-called data breach.
These submissions were received either from foreign persons or directed towards foreigners
operators, among others, for example, towards operators established in Belgium,

10.3 Selected cases from the office's supervisory activities
 
10.3.1 Postponements
 
10.3.1.1 Forwarding of Anonymous Submission
 
The Office assessed the proposal of the petitioner, who turned to the operator with a submission where he requested,
so that the applicant's identity is kept secret during its processing. The operator to whom
the petitioner addressed the submission, forwarded it due to affiliation, while considering
he did so in the form of a photocopy without personal data at the petitioner's request to conceal his identity
the petitioner. The petitioner claimed in the proposal that despite the fact that the operator upon assignment
of the submission, his request for anonymity was formally granted by the body to which the submission was made
forwarded, he could, based on several circumstances, find out that the submitter is the petitioner
and the operator thus violated the protection of the petitioner's personal data. Authority after review
of the documents submitted by the petitioner stated that the circumstances from which the petitioner
judged on the possibility of finding out that the submitter of the anonymized submission is the operator
he could neither foresee nor have any influence over them; the operator based on the petitioner's
the request for the secrecy of his identity assessed whether it is necessary to provide for the purpose of forwarding the submission
personal data of the submitter,
that he forwarded the petitioner's submission
without data about his person, thereby proceeding in accordance with the principle of data minimization according to Art. 5
para. 1 letter c) Regulations and took appropriate measures to preserve the petitioner's
anonymity. For the stated reasons, the Office postponed the proposal according to § 100 par. 5 letters a) of the Act
no. 18/2018 Coll.
 
10.3.1.2 Disclosure of personal data in reports
 
In the monitored period, the Office received several submissions in which the submitters objected to publication
personal data of the persons concerned through reports broadcast on television and later
available on the operators' websites. Based on published by the operator
personal data thus it was possible to identify a natural person. In case of publication of personal data
data by the media, the right to personal data protection conflicts with the right to freedom
expression and the right to information, both of which represent fundamental rights in a democratic society
companies. The regulation established the right for member states to harmonize national regulations
for the protection of personal data and the right to freedom of expression and the right to information, including processing
for journalistic purposes and establish exceptions or deviations from some chapters of the Regulation.
In relation to the submissions in question, the office stated that the operators upon publication
of personal data proceeded according to § 78 par. 2 of the Act, according to which the operator can
process personal data without the consent of the person concerned even if the processing of personal data is
necessary for the needs of informing the public by means of mass communication and if
personal data is processed by the operator, to whom it follows from the subject of the activity (subject
the provision provided a legal basis for the given processing – publication of personal data).
Processing of personal data of affected persons by the operator for information purposes

in conclusion

Sat

43

to the public resulted from the subject of the activity. The operators are in accordance with the applicable legislation
authorized to obtain true, timely and comprehensive information for the purpose of informing the public
and are not responsible for the content of the information provided by a defined group of persons. However, it is also true that
operators by processing the personal data of the persons concerned for journalistic purposes according to
§ 78 par. 2 of the Act must not violate the right of the person concerned to protect his personality or the right
to protect privacy. Assessing the fact or publishing the personal data of the persons concerned
the right to protection was interfered with by means of mass communication for journalistic purposes
the personality and privacy of the persons concerned falls under the jurisdiction of the general court (personality protection).
In the case of the publication of such personal data by means of mass communication, which would
could cause an unauthorized interference with the right to protect the personality and privacy of the person concerned,
the person concerned has the right to seek protection in court. Office for the stated reasons (existence
of the legal basis of publication) postponed submissions (proposals and suggestions) due to their unfoundedness.
 
10.3.2 Proceedings
 
10.3.2.1 Processing of telephone number
 
The Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data based on the proposal, according to which the operator
processed the petitioner's phone number in an illegal manner, as he contacted the petitioner
by phone call with an offer of services, while the applicant does not give his phone number or consent
did not provide it to the operator for processing, and the caller asked the petitioner where he got it from
his phone number, he did not give him an answer, which the petitioner did not get even with a written request for this
information with which he subsequently contacted the operator. The operator objected that in his
information systems does not process any personal data of the applicant, does not process him
phone number and he doesn't even know it. The phone call in question was made by an authorized employee
acquire new clients for the operator, who, however, did not act in this way on the basis of instructions
the operator, he does not in any case authorize employees to use it for the performance of work
personal data that would not come from its databases and for which it would not have the legal right to process
basis. Therefore, according to the operator, in the given case, there were no violations of the Regulation on his part,
but about the individual misconduct of the employee in the field of labor law, where the operator
carried out the remedy by re-instructing the employee on the performance of work duties.
The operator also communicated these facts to the petitioner in response to his request and has
for equipping her with it properly. The office stated that even if the employee in a specific case
he did not actually act on the operator's instructions, he made the given phone call as a person acting
based on the authorization of the operator, i.e. j. as the person whom the operator entrusted with the acquisition
new clients, which was the employee's own work activity and at the same time the only one
the purpose of the given phone call; the employee processed the applicant's phone number for the purpose of the activity,
which is carried out by the operator through its employees and is in accordance with the principle
responsibility according to Art. 5 par. 2, Art. 24 par. 1, Art. 32 par. 4 Regulations obliged to ensure that
employees processed personal data in accordance with the Regulation and only on the basis of instructions
operator. The office concluded that the operator of the processing operation with the telephone
by the petitioner's number, which he carried out by contacting his employee by phone
the petitioner
whereas
to the appellant's question where he got his phone number, he did not give him an answer, he processed it
petitioner's personal data without a legal basis according to Art. 6 par. 1 Regulations and without compliance
obligations according to Art. 14 par. 2 letters f), par. 3 letters b) Regulations, thereby violating the principle of legality
and transparency according to Art. 5 par. 1 letter a) Regulations. At the same time, the Office stated that the petitioner
by a written request for information on how the operator obtained his phone number, properly applied
the right of the person concerned to access personal data according to Art. 15 par. 1 letter g) Regulations which
the operator's response was not fulfilled because it did not provide any information about the source
of the data in question, nor did he state that the requested information is partially or fully available to him
unavailable and for what reasons. The Office imposed a corrective measure on the operator according to Art. 58

to the operator

client,

for

para. 2 letters c) Orders to provide the claimant with any available information unless
this is the source from which his phone number was obtained for the processing operation in question.
 
10.3.2.2 Processing of personal data as part of an insurance claim
 
During the monitored period, the Office conducted proceedings based on the petitioner's proposal, in which she objected
unauthorized processing of personal data listed in the technical license of the newly purchased product
motor vehicle for the purpose of payment of insurance benefits. According to the claims of the petitioner,
the operator in connection with the payment of insurance compensation for total damage to the motor vehicle
requested the documentation of the technical license for the newly purchased motor vehicle. The petitioner
stated that the operator conditioned the technical license for the newly purchased vehicle
payment of the insurance payment for the highway stamp and for the fee for registering a new vehicle.
The petitioner stated that, based on this pressure, this technical license was finally issued
provided to the operator. However, the petitioner claimed that the operator of this document
he requested despite her warnings that this document was not necessary. The petitioner objected,
that the newly purchased vehicle cannot have any connection with the insurance event that happened
even before purchasing a new vehicle. The operator during the procedure on personal protection
data in cooperation with the company that liquidated the claimant's insurance claim
ensured, investigated the processing of data from
technical license of the new vehicle
petitioners, while the operator came to the conclusion that with regard to the application of the principle
minimization, the liquidation of the insurance event in question could be processed even without data
from the technical license of the applicant's new vehicle and these data subsequently from the information
systems deleted. The office concluded that the operator violated Art. 5 par. 1 letter c) Regulations
(principle of minimization of personal data) by the fact that during the process of liquidation of the insurance claim
the petitioner also processed data from the technical license of the petitioner's new vehicle, while
the operator, after re-investigating the liquidation process, concluded that the liquidation of the insurance premium
the petitioner's events could have been processed even without this data. The office stated that
the operator is authorized in accordance with legal regulations within the framework of the occurrence of a damage event from
injured parties to request the documents necessary for a true explanation of the occurrence and scope of the insurance event
as well as its consequences. However, the operator should require these documents in accordance with the principle
data minimization according to Art. 5 par. 1 letter c) Regulations, and thus require only such documents
and personal data that is reasonable, relevant and limited to the extent that is necessary
considering the purposes for which they are processed. On the basis of the established facts, the Office did not impose
corrective measures to the operator, because in view of the steps taken by the operator
(deletion of all records about
technical license of the petitioner's new vehicle
from the operator's information systems) the office did not consider it expedient and reasonable to impose on him
corrective measures, however, the office imposed a fine on the operator for the detected violation.
 
10.3.2.3 Monitoring of employees through the location of their SIM card
 
In 2021, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data based on a proposal in which
the petitioner stated that the operator, as his employer, monitors the petitioner's location
at the time of his vacation, i.e. at the time when the petitioner was not performing his duties as an employee
obligations. Through the investigation, the Office found that the operator, by the above procedure, without serious
reasons violated the employee's privacy by monitoring him during his time off. Operator
therefore, he did not have an adequate legal basis for the said processing operation. Saving
it was further established that the operator did not even demonstrate an adequate legal basis in the proceedings
for the processing of personal data in the case of monitoring the location of employees within their
working time. Basic rights and freedoms on the one hand and legitimate interests of the operator
on the other hand, they must be carefully examined and compared. Operator within the proceedings
did not demonstrate an adequate legal basis for such a processing operation, as in the given
in this case, he did not deal at all with the comparison of the individual rights of the affected persons with his corrected one

45

interest. In the matter in question, the Office imposed corrective measures and a fine on the operator.
 
10.3.2.4 Publication of the social security number in the report
 
In 2021, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data based on an initiative in which
the applicant objected to the publication of personal data of the person concerned, including his social security number
through news reports broadcast on television and available later
in the archive on the website of the operator. The personal data of the person concerned were not in the report
anonymized in any way. The operator must for each purpose of personal data processing
data have an adequate legal basis that defines the conditions under which it is
legal processing. When processing personal data, it can be used for the purpose of determining the physical
a person's generally usable identifier - social security number only if its use is necessary
to achieve the given processing purpose. The investigation revealed that it was not congenital in the given case
the number of the person concerned needs to be processed at all, since the purpose of the processing operation
(providing services to the public in the field of television broadcasting) could be achieved even without
publication of the birth number of the person concerned (by anonymizing it). In addition, publish the birth
number is law no. 18/2018 Coll. exclusively prohibited (unless it was published by the affected person
person). The Office did not impose remedial measures on the operator for the given violation, as
the operator, even before the start of the procedure, the birth number of the person concerned in the report available at
anonymized the operator's website, thereby removing the illegal status and the imposition of measures
for correction was no longer reasonable and expedient in the given case. However, the office imposed a fine for the given violation
fine to the operator.
 
10.3.2.5 Sending correspondence containing personal data in unencrypted form
 
In 2021, the office conducted proceedings on the basis of a proposal in which the applicant objected to sending her
personal data to the operator in the scope of name, surname, address, address of the insured
real estate, insurance policy number, claim number, type and type of insurance through
an email containing this data to a foreign email address. The investigation revealed that the petitioner
the mentioned data were sent to a foreign email address in an unencrypted form. Address of the insured
real estate, insurance policy number, claim number, type and type of insurance per se are not
are personal data, but in connection with the name, surname or address of the applicant represent
personal data relating to a specific person (applicant), which is possible on the basis of
reliably and unmistakably identify the given data. In case of sending personal data
at the same time, there was unauthorized access to the petitioner's email address
personal data of the petitioner to another person (the operator did not have adequate legal
basis in the sense of Art. 6 par. 1 of the Regulations). In terms of the principles of integrity and confidentiality, they must be
personal data processed in a way that guarantees adequate security of personal data
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss,
destruction or damage, through appropriate technical or organizational measures
measures (e.g. password security in the case of sending email attachments). Regarding
unauthorized disclosure of personal data of the petitioner occurred on the part of the operator
to the violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality in accordance with Art. 5 par. 1 letter f) Regulations. Considering
to the fact that, as part of the procedure, it was found that the operator additionally introduced the obligation to send
electronic mail in encrypted form, the office did not impose corrective measures on the operator.
However, the office imposed a fine on the operator for the given violation.
 
10.3.2.6 Evaluation and profiling of personality aspects related to natural persons

employers

 
In 2021, the office, on its own initiative, conducted proceedings based on a notification of a breach of protection
personal data through the form for the operator to report security

46

incidents in the sense of art. 33 of the Regulations and § 40 of Act no. 18/2018 Coll. The subject of the violation
of personal data protection was an incident related to the activity of the operator in the matter
evaluation and profiling of the personal aspects of the affected persons (employees
operator) by a psychological survey, which was to be carried out without adequate
legal basis, without securing a contract according to Art. 28 Regulations with and without an intermediary
conducting a data protection impact assessment. The investigation revealed that the operator
did not have an adequate legal basis for processing the personal data of the persons concerned,
as it did not meet the consent to the processing of personal data required by the operator
conditions of consent in accordance with Art. 4 par. 11 Regulations. Consent must be freely given, specific,
informed and unambiguous expression of the will of the person concerned. Given the dependency that follows
from the employer/employee relationship, it is unlikely that the person concerned would
she could refuse to give consent for data processing to her employer without feeling
fear or real risk of adverse consequences of refusal (i.e. unlikely to
consent was given freely). Consent is not considered freely given even if it is not possible
to give separate consent to individual processing operations of personal data despite the fact that it would
was appropriate in a particular case. As part of the procedure, it was also found that the operator
did not fulfill the information requirements for the persons concerned in connection with the evaluation of their personality aspects
obligation according to Art. 13 Regulations at the latest when obtaining their personal data. Natural persons
should be in addition to the identity of the operator, the purposes of processing and other information as well
informed about the risks, rules, guarantees and rights in the processing of personal data, as well as how
to exercise their rights in such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data
process should be explicitly stated and legitimate and determined at the time of obtaining personal data
data. The investigation also revealed a violation of the principle of responsibility, as the operator
in the proceedings he did not prove in any way that at the time of the implementation of the psychological survey
aimed at evaluating the personality aspects of the persons concerned had
the contract concluded with the intermediary according to Art. 28 Regulations not even in connection with profiling
of the persons concerned did not demonstrate that an assessment of the impact on the protection of personal data had been carried out. Within
principles of responsibility, the operator is obliged to the office as a supervisory authority (not the other way around)
prove that the personal data of the persons concerned is processed in accordance with the Regulation. Regarding
with the evaluation of the personality aspects of the persons concerned by a psychological survey
by the operator several times to violate the principle of legality, justice
and transparency in the sense of Art. 5 par. 1 letter a) Regulations, to violate the principle of responsibility
according to Art. 5 par. 2 of the Regulation, as well as to the violation of some obligations established by the Regulation.
Due to the fact that during the procedure it was found that the operator is processing personal data
of the persons concerned in connection with the evaluation of their personality aspects ended and further with the following data
does not have, the office did not impose corrective measures on the operator. However, the office to the operator
imposed a fine for the given violation.

15 ASSESSMENT OF THE STATUS OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

IN THE MONITORED PERIOD

 
Citizens undoubtedly always ranked their health high on their list of values, but in
2021, when the pandemic continued, they perceived him more sensitively and cared for him more than before
by that, we all realized its value and fragility.
 
Nowadays, when personal data is no stranger to anyone, they also require a lot of attention
in the health sector, while the need for their protection was inevitable. Therefore, it can be concluded that
The pandemic drew attention and also raised citizens' awareness of the topic of personal data in
general, as well as health data, which represent a special, sensitive category.
 
In 2021, the processing of personal data reached a different dimension, as the influence still persisted
pandemic, and thus the transition of work and private life to the online more and more often occurred
environment. Citizens have realized that the changes associated with their "online life" represent a big one
measures of personal data that are the subject of protection but also of interest. In connection with the overall situation
there was a need to pay more attention to protection and information about personal protection
data in the online environment. In addition to being the subject of trading and interest, personal data are
also confronted with information security.
 
The year 2021 can also be marked as the year when personal data also became the subject of interest for hackers,
who didn't just want to draw attention to the imperfection of the system, but who wanted them at the same time
to appropriate for one's own interests. It is all the more necessary to ensure the protection of assets, including personal assets
data in the private sector as well as in the public sector.
 
It remains only to believe that the year 2022 will be successful for the office also from the point of view of the election of the chairman of the office, as
there are enough people in the Slovak Republic who are not indifferent to the protection of personal data
and who want to change, improve or streamline the functioning of the office they represent in this regard
an institution focused on the protection of personal data of natural persons, while its employees perceive
work not only as an obligation, but also as a mission.
