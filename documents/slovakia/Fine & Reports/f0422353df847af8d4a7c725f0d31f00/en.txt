The protection of personal data has been carried out since May 2018 in accordance with both the Regulation and the law, which
directly set out all the responsibilities of the Office. Despite the undeniable importance of its activities,
which is constantly increasing, as is the importance and value of personal data as a resource
information on natural persons, the number of staff of the Office is essentially unchanged and is already oscillating
several other years around the number 40. In particular since the period of application of the Regulation Office
feels that the current number of staff is insufficient and that it is necessary
number significantly increased. Many employees currently perform some functions
cumulatively, which does not contribute to their work comfort and mental demands
work, it is not right and sustainable. To illustrate, the number of "live proceedings."
per head ”in the department of administrative proceedings is for some employees of this department almost
100, which is an alarming situation that is unsustainable in the long run. From application practice
more than ever before, there is a need for at least two
detached workplaces, one in central and one in eastern Slovakia. The reason
The need for the establishment of these workplaces is that in this way the employees of the Office would be more closely affected
persons from these areas of Slovakia and also the fact that, for example, the performance of inspections would be as follows
streamlined, as it would not be necessary to spend such large sums of money on
travel of employees always from Bratislava to central or eastern Slovakia. About time
saving employees, speeding up and streamlining procedures, not to mention.

Similarly, the need to increase the number of employees in the context of increasing activity
and responsibilities of the Office, due account must be taken of the growing agenda and material needs

and the international agenda, where the staff of the Office is directly involved and must regularly
participate in meetings of the Committee 's expert groups and Council working groups, of which
the subject matter is important guidelines and documents affecting the Office's activities on behalf of
Slovak Republic.

regulations, for example under REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
Euratom) 2019/493 of 25 March 2019 amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1605/2002 1141/2014,

elections to the European Parliament (see Article 10a (2) of that Regulation). If the office
decides in personal data protection proceedings that a natural or legal person has infringed
the relevant rules on the protection of personal data and if it follows from the decision or if they are

12

other reasonable grounds to believe that the infringement is linked to European political activities
political party or European political foundation in the context of the European elections
Parliament, the decision shall be notified to the Office for European Political Parties and Foundations.

COMMUNICATION OF THE OFFICE WITH THE PUBLIC
4.1 Opinions of the Office on the issues of natural and legal persons
The issue of personal data protection is not limited to operators or
intermediaries who are obliged to apply personal data protection legislation
in practice, it also affects people affected who have issues arising from common situations
related to their personal data.
The Office's operators and intermediaries most often address questions of a professional nature
related to their obligations under the Regulation and the law, as specific to it
provisions to be applied in practice.
Recently, there has been an increase in questions from the law firms representing
operators who address to the Office often to answer entire case studies to the Office
answered the questions and assessed the processing of the personal data of the "client" of the law firm.
If the subject of the question is only a specific part concerning processing, when is it also proposed
solution, or solution to the problem, such a question is acceptable, provided that it is the subject of the question
the entire processing or assessment of the operator's position without the proposed consideration
solutions, the Office generally does not respond to such questions, as it is not correct and possible for it to provide
legal service to law firms, moreover, such its activity goes to the detriment of others, which
has an obligation to perform. At the expense of an increasing number of such complex issues office
He also responded to this activity by publishing a notice on his website, giving the opinion of the Office
reflects the views of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.
The Office also continued in contact with the public through a limited regime
telephone consultations. In the monitored period, the Office provided up to 200 telephone calls
consultations, mostly during 2018. In 2019, the Office already consulted by telephone in
did not provide the time allowed, as this activity was very burdensome and within the activities
carried out in the context of the Regulation, the number of other activities required by it has increased
to cover.
The Office replied to the public's written and e-mail questions during the period under review
more than 1500 such questions.

4.2 Communication of the Office with the media
Over the period under review, media interest in personal data protection has increased as
Regulation and law, ie both legal norms bringing new rules in the field of protection
personal data have started to apply. In the period under review, the Office provided 67 statements for
media (print, radio and television together).
Media interest initially focused on describing the main differences between the newcomers
and the "old" legislation, then, over time, focused on quantification
proceedings, or to fines already imposed under the new legislation.
In 2019, media interest calmed down and gradually focused on specific issues and "cases"
in which the processing or protection of personal data was also the subject, or there were questions
journalists aimed at specifying the rights of the persons concerned, how to exercise them correctly and what
everything can be claimed from the operator as a person concerned.

4.3 Privacy Day
The Day of Personal Data Protection, January 28, is the date of the signing of Convention 108, which was
signed in Strasbourg in 1981. This day has been declared by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe

4.5 The Office's website and reporting privacy breaches through a designated
form (reporting data breach)
Operators and intermediaries must ensure the continued credibility, integrity,
availability and resilience of processing systems and services and at regular intervals
assess the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures in place. Nevertheless, it can
(whether due to willful negligence, negligence, error or natural disaster)
security of personal data which, as a result, may involve accidental or
unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized provision or disclosure,
personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
The operator has an obligation under Art. 33 Regulations or according to § 40 of the Act to report
data breaches can do so in a number of ways,
one of which is the possibility to use the form created to fulfill this obligation.
The obligation to report a personal data breach during the reporting period was
performed a total of 95 times. Reporting is an obligation for operators
and intermediaries, not for the persons concerned.
In the monitored period, we registered a total of 95 personal data breaches reported
of the Office, of which 6 applications were reported by the persons concerned and 89 by the operators. In this
In this context, we would like to state that in cases where data breaches have been reported by the persons concerned, these
they also stated in their notification that they had reported data breaches on the grounds that the operator had stated that
he will not report data breaches or incidents for data breaches that need to be reported
the Office. We would also like to appeal to the operators to get theirs
obligations themselves, as if the Office finds that there have been data breaches that did not
reported to the Office, this may, for example, be of a personal data protection nature
An "aggravating" circumstance which the Office will take into account in the proceedings.

6 APPROVAL AND CONSULTATION ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE
6.1 Prior consultation
Pursuant to Art. 36 par. 1 Regulations shall be made by the operator with the supervisory authority before
consultation, if the data protection impact assessment pursuant to Art. 35 shows that
such processing would lead to a high risk to rights and freedoms if
the operator has not taken measures to mitigate this risk.
The Office received 5 requests for prior consultation from operators. After
examination of their content, two applications were excluded, and were assessed as applications for legal
advice in relation to prior consultation and impact assessment. So the real office
has carried out 3 previous consultations.

6.2 Transfer of personal data
The free movement of personal data is guaranteed within the EEA. However, when transferred to countries outside
EEA or international organizations need to comply with additional requirements for
protection of personal data referred to in Regulation and Directive 2016/680. Although some tools
for the transfer of personal data under both laws are the same, it is always necessary
examine the material scope of the instrument used. A novelty compared to the previous legislation
is that the transmission is also regulated to international organizations.
Transfers can be divided into two groups:
 transfer to third countries (international organizations) guaranteeing an adequate level
protection a
 transfer to third countries (international organizations) not guaranteeing adequate
level of protection.
6.2.1 Transfer to a country guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection
When transferring personal data to third countries, a distinction is made between the transfer of personal data
to a third country guaranteeing or not guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection.
The status of the country that guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection is determined by the EC
decision. It is necessary for a country or international organization to provide for its own sake
national law or international agreements it has signed, the level of protection
fundamental rights, which is essentially equivalent to the level of protection guaranteed in the legal order
EU.
The EC issues a decision on adequacy separately for the material scope of the Regulation and separately for
the material scope of Directive 2016/680. Adequacy decisions issued by the EC over time
scope of Act no. 122/2013 Coll., Remain in force until the EC changes them, does not replace them
or not annulled by a decision taken under the Regulation. Those decisions shall apply only to
transfer of personal data within the material scope of the Regulation, not Directive 2016/680. Office
publishes adequacy decisions on its website.
During the period under review, the EC issued a decision on adequacy under the Japan Regulation,
which concerns only the transfer of data within the private sector, which is regulated by the Japanese
The Act on the Protection of Personal Information.
At the same time, Japan adopted a decision on adequacy for the EU / EEA. These two decisions

20

together they create the largest area of secure and free transfer of personal data in the world
based on a high level of protection. Both decisions apply from 23 January 2019.
During the period under review, the EC did not issue any decision on adequacy under the Directive
2016/680.
6.2.2 Transfer to a country that does not guarantee an adequate level of personal data protection
Even when transferred to a country or international organization that does not guarantee an adequate level
protection, it is necessary to distinguish between the instruments offered by the Regulation and those
offered by Directive 2016/680.
6.2.2.1 Transmission according to the Regulation
If the EC has not issued a decision on adequacy, or annulled the decision on adequacy,
the operator or intermediary may also use the following institutes for the transfer:
(a) a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities; or
public bodies
No such instrument was adopted during the period under review.
(b) binding internal rules
Those adopted under the previous legislation remain valid as long as
do not amend, replace or revoke the supervisory authorities. They were not accepted during the period under review
no binding internal rules under the Regulation.
(c) the standard data protection clauses adopted by the EC
Those adopted under the previous legislation remain valid as long as
do not amend, replace or repeal the EC. None were accepted during the period under review
standard clauses under the Regulation.
(d) standard data protection clauses adopted by the supervisory authority;
It is a new tool for transferring personal data. None were accepted during the period under review
standard clauses adopted by the Office under the Regulation.
(e) an approved code of conduct
It is a new tool for transferring personal data. None were approved during the period under review
codes.
(f) an approved certification mechanism
It is a new tool for transferring personal data. None were approved during the period under review
certification mechanisms.
(g) contractual clauses

4/2019 on the draft administrative arrangement on the transfer of personal data between the
financial supervision within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the financial authorities
supervision outside the EEA. The Office did not approve such arrangements during the period under review.
(i) a judgment of a court / tribunal or a decision of an administrative authority of a third country
(j) exceptions for special situations under Art. 49 Regulations
In addition to these exceptions, the Committee adopted Guidelines no. 2/2018
on exemptions under Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

21

k) single transfer of personal data according to Art. 49 par. 1 second subparagraph
Also regulated in Guidelines no. 2/2018 on exemptions under Article 49 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679.
6.2.2.2 Transmission according to Directive 2016/680

to a third country or international organization may be carried out using the following instruments:
(a) a legally binding act providing adequate safeguards for the protection of personal data; or
b) the controller has assessed all the circumstances of the transfer of personal data and has come to a conclusion,
that there are adequate guarantees for the protection of personal data,

7.2 Inspections initiated during the period under review
Controls of personal data processing started from 25.05.2018 (ie controls started at
application of the Regulation and the effectiveness of the law) were carried out in the period under review
personal data protection proceedings, on the basis of a control plan as well as on the basis of suspicion
from a breach of personal data processing obligations laid down in the Regulation, or
by law. The focus of the controls was on the real state of personal data processing
23

with an emphasis on the compliance of processing activities with the requirements of the new legislation
represented by the Regulation and the law, which resulted in time and professional demands
implementation of the controls themselves.
In the creation of the inspection plan, as well as in the selection of inspections initiated by the Office on an ongoing basis
The Office drew mainly suspicions of breaches of personal data processing obligations
from own experience gained in the exercise of supervision in the previous period and trends
further development, ie he applied the empirical-intuitive method.
By delivering the notification of the inspection to the inspected person, the Office started in the evaluated period
51 inspections, of which 6 on the basis of a plan of inspections, 26 on the basis of a suspected breach of obligations
in the processing of personal data and 19 in the framework of personal data protection proceedings.

7.2.1 Checks in the framework of personal data protection proceedings
The performance of checks in the framework of personal data protection proceedings is ex lege preferred over
inspections carried out on the basis of the inspection plan as well as prior inspections
on suspicion of a breach of personal data processing obligations.
7.2.1.1 Selected inspections - camera systems
As part of the personal data protection procedure, five camera inspections were carried out
systems operated by natural persons. Inspections of camera systems were focused
on the principles of personal data processing, provision of information in the collection of personal data
from the persons concerned, the definition of the legal basis for the processing and the examination of the processing

natural persons, in particular because of repeated attacks on themselves and out of concern for themselves
safety and health. In the remaining two cases, individuals did not use real
camera system, but they had dummy cameras installed, as a result of which there was no
for processing personal data by a camera system, resp. these natural persons did not acquire
operator status.
7.2.2 Inspections based on the inspection plan
The inspection plan for 2018 was in order to create sufficient time
to harmonize the practices of operators and their intermediaries with the requirements
Regulations and the law targeted at compliance with the provisions of Act no. 122/2013 Coll.,

disclosure of personal data) and other undesirable processing operations with personal data
data.
The inspection plan, which is divided into two parts according to the focus of each inspection (focus
to the Schengen acquis and focus on the type of processing activity), includes processing
activities carried out by public and private entities. The first part of the inspection plan
is aimed at identifying the status of personal data processing in national districts

abroad. Checks consist of continuous monitoring of competence
authorities to process personal data securely and lawfully in specific information
systems used to protect the Schengen area (eg SIS II, VIS, Eurodac,
Europol). The second part of the control plan focuses on the consistency of the processing of personal data
with the requirements of the Regulation and the law. The part of the control plan in question also reflects the risks involved
with specific processing activities or with the use of new technologies
and procedures.

when obtaining personal data from the data subject, no information is provided to that person,
resp. are provided to the data subject only at his or her request. In line with the principles of transparency
and justice, it is desirable that information on the processing of personal data be given to the data subject
provided before their acquisition, but at the latest at the time of their acquisition. Control
terminated by the inspection protocol, a non-disclosure error was found
information to the data subjects when obtaining personal data (directly) from the data subject;
no deficiencies were found in relation to the other parts of the subject matter.
7.2.3.2 E-shops
Control of the processing activities of two online stores operating in the territory
Of the Slovak Republic was focused on the consistency of the collection of personal data at a distance and their

further processing with the principles of personal data processing, to meet the condition of them
lawful processing, conditions for expressing consent, fulfillment of information obligation
and obligations related to the involvement of the intermediary. Controlled persons in progress
the inspections have not shown that they require the consent of the persons concerned in accordance with the Regulation, whereby
one inspected person has not proved the very existence of the consent of the person concerned, resp.
processing of personal data for the purpose of sending the questionnaire was based on a non-transparent
(confusing, misleading) obtaining “disagreement” of the data subject, and the other person
did not allow the data subjects to freely consent or disagree with the processing
personal data for the purpose of sending information about news, special offers, discounts
and price promotions. The procedures applied by the audited entities conflicted with the principles
legality, justice and transparency. At the same time, it was found that one checked
the person in the position of the operator entrusted the processing of personal data to the intermediary
(law firm), which has a privileged (ex lege) position in the practice of advocacy
operator. Both inspections were completed by an inspection protocol.
7.2.3.3 Fees for personal data protection
The subject of the inspection was the processing activities of the housing cooperative based on the diction of the law
on the ownership of flats and non-residential premises. Inspected person by the representatives of the apartment owners
has announced its intention to charge a reasoned data protection fee
consisting of the increased administrative burden generated by the consistent application of the Regulation
and the law. The inspected person based on negative reactions from apartment owners
and non-residential premises has finally decided to abolish the fee; fee
for the protection of personal data, which the owners of flats and non-residential premises have already paid, he had
be returned in the annual accounts. The inspected person in the position of the operator was according to
Regulations are required to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance
processing of personal data with the requirements of the Regulation. From the related provisions
No operator shall be entitled to reimbursement of the costs associated with the Regulation
with the fulfillment of their own duties, resp. the Regulation itself declares the right of the persons concerned to
protection of their personal data and ensuring the protection of personal data
to the operator as his gratuitous obligation. As a condition of protection
personal data by paying an illegal fee is a flagrant violation of the principles of legality
and justice provided for in the Regulation, the inspection was terminated by the inspection protocol.
7.2.3.4 Hospital
During the period under review, the Office checked the processing of personal data by the provider
health care. The inspection focused on the consistency of the processing of personal data
with the principles of personal data processing, the conditions of lawful processing,
the conditions for expressing consent and the conditions for processing specific categories of personal data
data, fulfillment of information obligations, fulfillment of obligations arising from the relationship between
operators and intermediaries, processing on behalf of the operator
or intermediary and the designation of the responsible person. No inspection was found
shortcomings; the inspection was terminated by the inspection record.
7.2.3.5 Camera systems
Based on suspicion of a breach of obligations established by the Regulation and the law
(anonymous submissions, suggestions from persons other than the persons concerned and media coverage) was
six inspections were carried out. In addition to two natural persons, four include this group of controls

29

cities and municipalities operating camera systems. Cities and municipalities as operators
camera systems were included among the inspected persons in the context of continuity with the plan
inspections carried out by 24.05.2018. All inspections of camera systems were focused
on the principles of personal data processing, provision of information in the collection of personal data
from the persons concerned, the definition of the legal basis and, in the case of natural persons, etc.
to examine the processing in the light of the material scope of the General Protection Regulation
data.
According to the division of CCTV operators into natural persons and cities (municipalities) was
in the case of two natural persons in the evaluated period, the inspection ended with a record
on control. In both cases, the monitoring of private land was qualified as
processing of personal data in the context of a purely personal or domestic activity which does not fall within
within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation.
In the case of four towns and villages, it was found in relation to the operation of camera systems
in three cases non-compliance with applicable legislation and inspections were terminated by protocols
on control. The shortcomings concerned in particular the failure to provide accurate information to the persons concerned
(failure to provide information on the legal basis for processing and failure to provide information on site
entry into the monitored area), thereby violating the rights of the persons concerned and consequently
also in breach of certain principles of personal data processing. Preservation was also a problem
camera footage for longer than necessary to achieve the specified purpose
processing of the personal data of the persons concerned by the camera system.

7.3 Conclusions arising from the Office's control activities
In general, the results of the controls carried out during the period under review show an effort
operators to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Regulation and the law, but at the same time they are
Some categories of operators have also been identified, which need to be increased
attention in the coming period.
The control activity of the Office, the basic mission of which is to act preventively
personal data processed by controllers and their intermediaries is therefore desirable
to support other forms of the Office's activities, in particular due to a fundamental change in legislation
processing conditions represented by the Regulation and the law applicable in the territory of Slovakia
Republic shall apply from 25.05.2018.
The basic precondition for achieving compliance with the requirements of the Regulation and the law
is a general identification with the intention that this legislation formalizes.

Decision of the Office as the administrative body at first instance in personal protection proceedings
data is based on a reliable state of affairs. For this purpose, the Office is in proceedings for protection
personal data is entitled to request the cooperation of anyone, while in the evaluated
period, the Office requested cooperation a total of 601 times. In personal data protection proceedings,
there have been three cases where the entity from which co-operation has been requested
he did not react to it and did not cooperate with the Office even after being called upon to fulfill its obligations
(in the given cases, fine or disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the entities
fine).
In the context of raising public data protection awareness, cases where
resp. the results of the proceedings were often also of interest to the media. The Institute of Legal Representation was
used in a significant number of cases during the period under review, with the exception of cases
when all the parties to the proceedings were represented by lawyers.
The most common subject of personal data protection proceedings was examination or processing
personal data of the data subjects were violated by cameras
regulations in the field of personal data protection.
One of the most common violations was the processing of personal data in conflict
with the principle of legality when personal data were processed without a legal basis,
resp. contrary to the legal basis and processing contrary to the principles of integrity and confidentiality,
which was related to the failure to take appropriate security measures.
In the proceedings on personal data protection, several pieces of evidence were used in the evaluated period
the means by which the true state of affairs can be ascertained and, for that purpose,
in more complicated matters, the inspection was used directly by the operator or

32

intermediary. Inspection has proven to be an effective means of establishing the true
and complete condition, especially when inspecting the cameras at a location where it has made it possible to reliably determine the method
and individual aspects of monitoring and, on that basis, to assess the invasion of privacy accordingly
monitored persons. In order to find out the real state of affairs, there is also a relatively high number
requests for co-operation through which they were provided in the file
in particular documentary evidence. The persons concerned submitted mostly precise proposals containing all of them
required requirements, with only a minimal amount to be called upon
rectification of deficiencies in the application (only sporadically the petitioner his application to initiate proceedings after
not completed).
Personal data protection proceedings, as a type of administrative procedure, are characterized by sensitivity
the issue of respect for and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms
in the field of personal data.
The personal data protection procedure is a non-public procedure, which involves several
peculiarities that complement, resp. extend the legal regulation of Act no. 71/1967 Coll., Or there
where necessary, exclude the application of Act no. 71/1967 Coll. These specifics are important
in terms of the correct application of personal data protection, with the Office
at first instance, where appropriate and necessary. Such
a special institute in proceedings on personal data protection is e.g. secrecy of identity
the petitioner in cases where his or her rights and rights could be violated
protected interests (as the person concerned), or negative action by
operator. The secrecy of the petitioner's identity found its justification and the persons concerned
in the interest of their protection, they used it in the evaluated period in the proposals they demanded
protection of their rights and the interests protected by law in the exercise of their profession.
During the period under review, operators often in the course of personal protection proceedings
data before attempting a substantive decision, they tried to dispose of the findings voluntarily
shortcomings in the processing of personal data and to adopt effective safeguards
lawful processing of personal data. Remedial action taken and implemented
As a rule, the participants in the proceedings informed the Office of the identified deficiencies within the imposed deadlines.

9 COOPERATION AND CONSISTENCY MECHANISM
The functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not impeded
restricted or prohibited, not even for reasons related to the protection of individuals
in the processing of personal data, which is also reflected in the provisions of Art. 1 par. 3 Regulations.
It responds to that Regulation by establishing cooperation and consistency mechanisms in order to:
a consistent and similarly high level of personal data protection was guaranteed in each
Member State, regardless of the place of residence of the person concerned.

9.1 Cooperation mechanism
The Regulation regulates cooperation between supervisory authorities, whether the need for mutual
cooperation arises in the investigation of a specific suspected breach of protection
personal data or in another activity of the supervisory authority (eg dealing with legal issues,
providing consultations). Given that the rules of cooperation are regulated directly
Regulation, no further specific agreements are required between Member States
States for this purpose.
9.1.1 Cross-border processing
Pursuant to Art. 55 Regulations, each supervisory authority performs the tasks and exercises the powers published
By regulation in the territory of its State. However, the regulation also specifically regulates the procedure and jurisdiction
in proceedings for the cross-border processing of personal data. Cross-border processing makes sense
Art. 4 pt. 23 of the Regulation (a) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in context
activities of the operator's or intermediary's premises in more than one Member State
where the operator or intermediary is established in more than one Member State
state; or (b) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of activities
the only establishment of the operator or intermediary in the Union, but which substantially
affects or is likely to significantly affect the persons concerned in more than one
Member State.
The regulation governs cooperation between supervisory authorities, in particular in relation to
with the mechanism of a single contact point (so-called one-stop-shop) regulated in Art. 56 par. 1
Regulations under which the supervisory body is the principal place of business or sole
the establishment of the operator or intermediary authorized to act as chief supervisor
the authority for cross-border processing carried out by that operator,
resp. intermediary. In accordance with Art. 4 point 22 of the Regulation other supervisory authorities will be
for such processing in the positions of the supervisory authorities concerned, if (a) the controller; or
the intermediary is established in the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority; (b) concerned
persons residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are or will be significantly affected
likely to be significantly affected by processing; or (c) the complaint is made against that
supervisory authority.
The designation of the lead supervisor and the authorities concerned is done in IMI
(Internal Market Informational System), under the
which the exchange of information on a specific
processing and specific suspicion of a breach of personal data protection, resp. as long as
the investigation was opened on the basis of a complaint from the person concerned as well as the content of this particular one
complaints. The exchange of information takes place in English.

34

During the period under review, 1,035 notifications were received by the Office in IMI
designation of the supervisory authority concerned. Office on the basis of a careful assessment
in each case, assessed that it was the supervisory authority concerned in 421 cases;
most often on the grounds that the processing of personal data in question significantly affects or
likely to significantly affect the persons concerned residing in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
The most common were operators such as Facebook (and its platforms Instagram, Youtube),
Google, Paypal, airlines. In some cases, the Office was also affected because
the operator or intermediary is established in the territory of the Slovak Republic, as
e.g. in the case of Amazon or Microsoft, which have in the territory of Slovakia
one or more establishments. If the Office has assessed that it is the supervisory authority concerned
authorities, identified its position in IMI and followed up the case. In accordance with Art. 60
The Office commented on the requests of the head of the supervisory authority, as appropriate,
to its procedure and to the results of the investigation, and also commented on the draft decision. Unless
the Office would be the supervisory authority concerned because it had received a complaint, the Office would
acted as a contact point for the person concerned and notified his decision.
In the monitored period, a total of 19 submissions containing elements were delivered directly to the Office
cross-border processing (of which 15 proposals from data subjects and 4 initiatives). These submissions
were delivered either from foreign persons or were directed towards foreign operators,
among others, for example, to operators established in India or Ukraine. Office
instructed foreign complainants in English on the merits of the proposal
and the obligation to use the Slovak language in personal data protection proceedings. If filed
established a reasonable suspicion of a personal data breach, the Office made the allegations
also checked in cooperation with foreign operators. In one case, the Office
received in IMI and dealt with it in cooperation with the Dutch supervisory authority
authority which was the lead supervisory authority for the processing in question.
9.1.2 Mutual assistance
The Office also cooperates with other supervisory bodies outside the one-stop-shop mechanism. This
cooperation also takes place in IMI, which allows specific requests to be sent
selected supervisory authority. However, the Office also continuously handles email or written
requests from other supervisory authorities.
During the reporting period, the Authority received 21 requests from other supervisors in IMI
for cooperation within the meaning of Art. 61 Regulations. The highest number of applications (five) was received from the Hungarian
supervisory authority, four came from the Maltese supervisory authority, three from the Czech supervisory authority
and two applications from the Polish supervisory authority. In the applications in question, the supervisory authorities
asked the Office for its legal opinion, in particular as regards the interpretation of the provisions of the Regulation.
The requests concerned e.g. designation of the responsible person by trade unions, interpretation of Art. 26
and Art. 80 Regulations and implementation of Art. 87 Regulations. The Hungarian supervisory authority was interested in the practice
the Office in controlling the operation of camera systems (ie how the Office applies the Regulation
for camera dummies, as is the case when cameras capture private land or
neighbor's land, and others). Some supervisory authorities have informed the Authority in this way
on the received notification of a personal data breach and the Polish and Czech supervisory authorities
used this method to consult a specific case before launching the onestop-shop mechanism.
During the reporting period, the Office sent 1 request for cooperation in IMI pursuant to Art. 61
Regulations concerning the independence of the supervisory authority in the processing of data by the supervisory authority

35

authorities in a state cloud and addressed to the supervisory authorities of all Member States.
However, the Office also used other forms for mutual cooperation with other supervisory authorities
communications such as IMI (email, written and telephone), which he used
contacts acquired in the course of its activities, including contacts acquired under the
membership of the Committee's expert groups.
9.1.3 Joint supervisory operations
Under the cooperation mechanism, pursuant to Art. 62 Regulations may also implement joint
supervisory operations, including joint investigations and joint actions in the field
enforcement. During the period under review, the Office did not initiate or accept a request for execution
such joint supervisory operations.

9.2 Consistency mechanism
An important feature of the Regulation is its consistent application in order to achieve this goal,
The Regulation provides for a consistency mechanism, which can be understood as cooperation between
EEA supervisory authorities and, where appropriate, the EC.
9.2.1 Opinion of the Committee
The purpose of Article 64 of the Regulation is for the Committee to deliver an opinion where it is competent
the supervisory authority plans to take specific measures. To this end, the Authority should have a Committee
notify its draft decision. The regulation regulates the cases in which the supervisory body is obliged
to ask the Committee for an opinion (Article 64 (1) of the Regulation) and when it has the opportunity to request an opinion
(Article 64 (2) of the Regulation).
The Authority requested the Committee's opinion during the period under review, as it planned to adopt the list
processing operations which are subject to a protection impact assessment requirement
data, so-called blacklist of processing operations. The committee delivered its opinion 21/2018
to the proposed list of the competent supervisory authority of Slovakia in this matter on 25 September
2018. The Office subsequently adopted a blacklist of processing operations
9.2.2 Settlement of disputes by the Committee
Dispute settlement by the Committee allows the Committee to take a binding decision to secure
consistent application of the Regulation in the following cases:
 The relevant reasoned objection was raised by the supervisory authority concerned
or rejected by the lead supervisory authority (Article 60 of the Regulation);
 Disagreement with the appointment of the head of the supervisory body (Article 56 of the Regulation);
 Absence of consultation of the Committee (Article 64 of the Regulation);
 The Authority did not follow the Committee's opinion (Article 64 of the Regulation).
During the period under review, the Committee did not resolve the dispute with the Office.
9.2.3 Emergency procedure
Article 66 of the Regulation provides for an urgency procedure. In exceptional
in cases where the supervisory authority concerned considers it urgent to protect rights and freedoms
concerned, it may take interim measures having legal effect in its territory.

36

These measures may not exceed a period of three months. In this case, he is affected
the supervisory authority is obliged to inform the other supervisory authorities, the Committee and the EC.
If the Authority considers that definitive action is needed urgently, it may
request the Committee for an urgent opinion or a binding decision. Every supervisor
the institution may request an urgent opinion or a binding decision from the Committee in cases
where the competent supervisory authority has not taken appropriate action and there is an urgent need to act.
The Office did not apply this article during the period under review.

37

10.3 Selected cases from the supervisory activities of the Office
10.3.1 Postponements
10.3.1.1 Fulfillment of the information obligation towards the person concerned
In 2018, the Office received a proposal from the person concerned against the company to the person concerned
sent a document informing her that, as an operator, she was processing her personal
the data for which they process them, the categories of data processed, the recipients, the time
retention, the rights of the person concerned, the right to lodge a complaint with the Office. Affected person upon delivery
letter, the company suspected that its personal data were being misused because of their personal data
the company did not provide or give consent to the processing. The letter showed her personal
the data are processed for the purpose of recovery of the claim. The person concerned objected that for a long time
has no contractual or non-contractual relationship with any organization against which it would
a financial obligation has arisen.
It was apparent from the content of the company's document that, as an operator vis-à-vis the person
whose personal data have already been processed in the previous period, by application of the Regulation
from 25.05.2018 fulfilled the information obligation to the necessary extent according to Art. 13 and 14 of the Regulation.
The Office further verified that the controller obtained the personal data of the data subject for processing
on the basis of a contract on the assignment of claims from the original creditor and for the processing of personal
due to the performance of the contract due to late payment of the data subject.
The purpose of processing the personal data of the data subject was to manage the claim, whereby
the legal basis for the processing of personal data was the legitimate interest of the controller.
Given that the purpose did not materialize at the time the application was lodged,
settlement of the claim against the person concerned, his personal data legitimately the operator
processed. The assessment of the case did not reveal any facts that would indicate the procedure
operator in breach of the Regulation and therefore the proposal of the person concerned was postponed as
manifestly unfounded.
10.3.1.2 Disclosure of personal data in a public decree
In 2018, the Office received a proposal from the person concerned against the operator, which was
village. In the application, the data subject objected to the unauthorized disclosure of his personal data
on the website of the operator and his physical official notice board in the posted appeal,
filed by the person concerned in the construction proceedings. The person concerned stated that the operator
He placed her appeal on the website and on the official board in order to allow other participants
proceedings could comment on the objections. The person concerned considered that the parties could
comment on the content of its submission and not on its person, therefore the operator should ensure protection
her personal data, for example by anonymisation.
The Office documented the evidence from the operator's website and found that the document was
published in the public notice in order to notify the participants of the construction
the appeal procedure and the invitation to submit observations within a specified period. The document in question
should be published for 15 days on the official notice board in accordance with a special regulation.
The Office found in the investigation that the public decree together with the appeal of the person concerned (participant
construction proceedings) was published on the official notice board of the municipality during the legal deadline. The purpose
processing of the personal data of the data subject in such a way that his or her personal data were
appeal published on the official notice board of the municipality, was the service of the document (appeal against

39

building permit) to other participants in the construction proceedings by a public decree within the meaning of
special regulation for a period of 15 days. At the end of this legal period of posting the document
on the official board of the administrative body or on the website of the administrative body, there was also
to end the purpose of disclosing the personal data of the data subject and it was necessary to terminate
disclosure of personal data in the posted document. The Office has verified that
if, on the expiry of the 15-day period, the public decree and the appeal of the person concerned were
personal data from the online and physical official board of the municipality posted. Delivery to your own
hands as well as service by public decree are equivalent forms of service of documents
in administrative proceedings, where the same applies to documents delivered in administrative proceedings in the form
of the public decree are also delivered to the participants in the administrative proceedings in question, to which
this participant shall always have the right to be heard, without the intervention of the administrative authority in these
documents, ie. in non-anonymized form. As no reasons were found
to initiate personal data protection proceedings against the controller, the proposal was affected
postponed as manifestly unfounded.
10.3.1.3 Publication of personal data in the auction notice on the Internet
In 2019, the Office received a joint proposal from the two persons concerned against an entity which:
had to improperly publish their personal data on the Internet in the announcement of the auction held in
2016. The persons concerned did not identify the person to whom the proposal is directed. They attached only to the proposal
document marked as "Auction notice according to § 17 of Act no. 527/2002 Coll. on voluntary
auctions .... as amended ”. The persons concerned stated that the disclosure of personal
The data in the auction notice causes them problems in their surroundings. Auction notice
contained the personal data of the persons concerned as the owners of the subject of the auction to the extent of the name,
surname, maiden name, date of birth, place of residence and others related to the subject of the auction.
Whereas the request for initiation of personal data protection proceedings must contain:
requisites stipulated by Act no. 18/2018 Coll., The Office invited the persons concerned to supplement
missing elements of the proposal submitted by them. As the persons concerned as petitioners
they did not complete their proposal within the set time limit, the Office postponed their proposal due to the fact that the petitioners
did not provide the necessary cooperation at his request.
The Office follows up on the content of the incomplete proposal and found that by entering data about their persons
a link to the page that contained the notification in question was found in a Google search engine
on the auction, the case continued to be investigated. The found website mainly offered real estate -
reality. The Office called for the cooperation of the operator of the given portal. The Office found that
The announcement of the auction was part of the advertisement of the legal entity, taking public display
The ad for visitors was canceled in 2016 and based on the fact that the company as
the portal operator is entitled to remove the notification in this particular case
about the auction from its portal, has taken the necessary steps to prevent further interference
to disclose the personal data of the persons concerned in the auction notice.
10.3.1.4 Expert opinion prepared from medical documentation
In 2019, the Office assessed a proposal directed against an operator who, as an expert
based on a court ruling, he prepared an expert report on the petitioner's health and had
in so doing, infringe his right to the protection of personal data by including in an annex to the report
data from the applicant's medical records, to a large extent, including information
which are not necessary as evidence. The Office found that the objected processing was reasonable
legal basis established by Act no. 576/2004 Coll. on health care, services

40

related to the provision of health care and to amend certain laws
as amended and Act No. 382/2004 Coll. about experts, interpreters
and translators and amending certain laws as amended (hereinafter
only "Act no. 382/2004 Coll. ”). Due to the petitioner's objections to the scope of personal
data in the annex, the Office assessed the expert opinion submitted by the applicant in terms of whether
the operator has complied with the principle of data minimization, ie whether the scope of personal
data in the annex corresponds to the purpose according to § 17 par. 4 letter e) and par. 5 of Act no. 382/2004 Coll.,
with the result that, in the given case, the scope of the processed data corresponds to the established purpose,
which is to ensure the verifiability of the expert opinion. For the above reasons
the Office found that the application was manifestly unfounded and postponed it.
10.3.2 Procedures
10.3.2.1 Exercising the data subject's right of access to personal data
In 2018, the Office received a proposal from the person concerned against the operator with whom
exercised its rights in the processing of personal data. The person concerned requested the operator
for access to their personal data processed through camera recordings
and audio recordings on a given day in connection with the performance of a traffic control. Considering that
the operator did not comply with the request of the person concerned and provided him with only information that the records
camera systems and audio recordings are stored for a period of 15 days and are provided
in particular to law enforcement authorities, the person concerned considered this to be the case
operator for infringing his rights.
According to recital 63 of the Regulation, the data subject should have the right of access to personal data,
obtained and the right to be exercised easily and at reasonable intervals,
so that you are aware of the lawfulness of the processing and can verify it. Pursuant to Art. 23 Regulations
to limit the rights and obligations arising from Art. 12 to 22 Regulations governing rights
concerned, possibly only through a legislative measure in European Union law
or in the law of a Member State. The investigation revealed that the personal data of the data subject were not
processed in the operator's camera system. The processing of the personal data concerned
however, by means of an audio recording made at the time of the transport inspection, which
the operator disposes of it within 15 days. At the time of receipt of the application, the operator had
persons in the matter of the right of access to personal data, the audio recording in question was available and was therefore
obliged to process the application in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation. The Office did not question the fulfillment
the obligation of the operator to provide or make available the prepared camera or audio
records to bodies active in criminal proceedings, courts, or other eligible entity, however
in this case, it was a question of fulfilling a different obligation, namely the obligations of the operator
in relation to the exercise of the data subject's rights of access to his or her personal data, which
the operator obtained for processing in its information system defined on it
purpose. The Office imposed the operator on the basis of the detected violation of the right of the person concerned
corrective measures as well as a fine.
10.3.2.2 Finding documentation with personal data in the collection yard
In 2018, the Office received an e-mail regarding a suspected breach of processing obligations
personal data, which were found in documents thrown in the premises of the collection yard of the municipality.
For example, the sender of the e-mail also discovered loan agreements with personal documents in the discarded documents
data. Given that he took this found documentation from the collection yard and announced it
the Office was subsequently secured by the Office to its premises as evidence.

41

The Office initiated proceedings on the protection of personal data on its own initiative against the person responsible
to the operator. The discarded documentation included, inter alia, currency loan agreements with
surnames, birth numbers, identity card numbers, permanent residence addresses,
employers, also contained copies of official documents such as an identity card, birth certificate.
The contracts found were from the period of 2006, 2009, 2011. The persons concerned were
customers buying goods in installments who applied for a loan.
According to the principle of integrity and confidentiality within the meaning of Art. 5 par. 1 letter f) Regulations must be personal
data processed in a way that guarantees adequate security of personal data, including
protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and accidental loss, destruction
or damage, through appropriate technical or organizational
measures. The Authority's investigation found that the operator was responsible for safe disposal
personal data in documents, which is one of the processing operations with personal
data. Despite the fact that, according to the operator, it was old personal data, it can be stated that
it is irrelevant whether any of this personal data was already out of date or untrue,
the controller is responsible for the safety of processing throughout the processing cycle (from their
acquisition only after liquidation). The information gathered showed that there was no mistake in
systematic processing of personal data, but in this individual case it was a one-off
error in securing the destruction of personal data. The Office ordered the present case
corrective measures and a fine to the operator.
10.3.2.3 Loss of personal documents
In 2018, the Authority adopted a joint proposal of the two persons concerned against the operator,
requested to provide a residential social service. The persons concerned had
provide the operator with his personal data in documentary documents in this connection,
in particular on applications for social services and the necessary documents. Touched
after some time, the persons have found that these documents are not with the operator. They acquired
suspected breach of the protection of their personal data.
According to the principle of integrity and confidentiality within the meaning of Art. 5 par. 1 letter f) Personal data regulations must
be processed in a way that guarantees adequate security of personal data, including protection
from unauthorized or illegal processing and accidental loss, destruction or
through appropriate technical or organizational measures.
The operator is further obliged to take steps to ensure that each natural person
acting on his behalf who has access to personal data has processed that data
only on the instructions of the operator.
The Office found out through the investigation that the operator processed the personal data of the persons concerned in paper
form in its information system to the extent and for the purpose established by a special law
governing the provision of social services. Personal data were processed by the operator
through staff whom he has demonstrated to be processed on his basis
instructions and at the same time the controller had received reasonable in the processing of personal data
precautions. The operator performed an internal audit of the matter, investigated the matter and accepted it
corrective measures (including staff in which he terminated his employment)
with the responsible employee). In this case, the Office found a breach of security
processing of personal data and, in the light of the findings, imposed on the controller
measures.

10.3.2.4 Posting a photo on the social network Facebook
In 2018, the Office accepted the proposal of the legal representative of the affected person (child)
against the operator who posted a photo of the child on his official Facebook page
page. By exercising the right of the person concerned, the legal representative requested the operator to delete
photos from the internet, as the operator for such processing of personal data
does not have the consent of the person concerned or any other legal basis. Operator equipped
request the person concerned by informing him of the reasons why the photograph cannot
delete.
The Office found in the investigation that the operator concludes with the legal representatives of the persons concerned
written contracts for the purpose of providing their childcare services, through
from which it obtains personal data. At the same time, the operator fulfills its information obligation towards
concerned. In this particular case, a photo of the child was to be taken
operators during the activities and its publication took place with the consent of the law
the representative provided in this individual case during the communication.
The controller has demonstrated that the consent of the data subjects to the processing of personal data
obtained in writing, via e-mail or chat. However, the Office in this case
found that the operator had failed to fulfill its information obligation under the Regulation
to a sufficient extent.
If the controller has determined a legal basis for the specific processing of personal data, which is
consent of the person concerned, he must take into account that the person concerned may at any time give his consent
call off. If the controller has also determined another purpose of processing, namely proof, application
or defending their legal claims, they must also determine the appropriate means of security
preservation of evidence for the purposes of criminal or civil proceedings for the time necessary,
that the related processing of personal data does not infringe the principles within the meaning of
Regulations. In this particular case, the operator continued to publish the photograph of the child
after revoking the consent of the person concerned on the grounds that he or she is to serve as evidence for the authorities
active in criminal proceedings. The Office therefore found a violation of the principle of legality under Art. 5 par. 1
letter a) Regulations, as the controller revokes the consent to the disclosure of personal data
and by applying for its deletion, he continued to publish the photograph with the portrait, while being entitled
the operator's interest in its further publication on the Internet did not outweigh the right of the person concerned
(child) over the protection of his personal data. The Authority did not impose a corrective action on the operator
measure, as the operator ensured the deletion of the photograph from the Internet and its during the proceedings
processing solely for the purpose of proving, applying or defending its legal
claims. However, the Office imposed a corrective measure on the operator in relation to the fulfillment of the information
obligations towards the persons concerned.
10.3.2.5 Indication of the date of birth on the delivered envelope
In 2018, the Office initiated proceedings on the protection of personal data on the basis of the proposal
suspicion of unauthorized processing by the Bailiff

or a third party. On the basis of the documents and evidence gathered during the proceedings, the Office found that
that the Bailiff's Office delivered the petitioner a document in an envelope stating, in addition to the name,
surname and address as well as her date of birth. In this case, the Office evaluated the proceedings
operator in accordance with Art. 6 par. 1 letter f) Regulations, as the proportionality assessment

43

between making the date of birth available and ensuring security of processing (secure
delivery of the consignment to the addressee and not to another person) the Office found that the
envelopes before third parties prevail over disclosure of date of birth as personal data,
which is not a special category. As the Office did not find an infringement of the appellant's rights in the proceedings
(the person concerned) or a breach of the Regulation, he stopped the proceedings.
10.3.2.6 Unauthorized processing of a telephone number
In 2018, the Office initiated proceedings on the protection of personal data on the basis of which
city police beyond the scope established by Act no. 564/1991 Coll. on the General Police as amended

stated that in accordance with § 24 par. 3 of the Municipal Police Act, the telephone number does not belong among
data that the city police is authorized in connection with the parking of a motor vehicle
from the registration of motor vehicles. By processing a phone number beyond the range specified

Of the United Kingdom from the EU and raised the issue of relations and the future application of the Regulation
in practice with the United Kingdom as a third country. An important element that was
visible in the discussions, was the focus of UK trade attention
to the USA. Setting up privacy and data protection relationships is an obvious priority at
islands, relations with the EU seem to remain secondary.
The simulation of mass data breaches was extremely interesting. The participants were divided into
groups and deal with the task from the position of operator, intermediary, supervisory body,
concerned, the media and the public. It was interesting to see how they deal with it
especially those who represent operators and intermediaries in real life. From our
from the point of view of the regulator, it was surprising how insufficient they took into account compliance
deadlines for reporting data breaches, as they escaped the basic obligations arising from the Regulation.
From this point of view, it can be stated that there is a lack of preparedness for the consequences
from an infringement of the Regulation.

14 ASSESSMENT OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION STATUS
IN THE MONITORING PERIOD
In the monitored period, interest in personal data protection and personal data as a result
application of the new legislation has grown enormously, not only the interest of journalists but also
the public and the controllers who are to apply the data protection rules
in practice.
Awareness and awareness of personal data about personal data has increased significantly; people
are interested in their personal data, protect it and ask operators much more than
and why they process their personal data. This trend is also confirmed by the operators. People are you
they are much more aware of their rights and are not afraid to demand their fulfillment in practice.
Personal data is becoming an important business item, therefore a necessity today
digital reality are strict data protection rules. They are and will be the focus of many
companies, but also the state, the more it is necessary to pay attention to their consistent protection, legal
processing and the correct setting of the legislation governing their processing. In particular
Recently, the Office has learned from its activities that it is a trend to prioritize
economic interests against the protection of the individual and his personal data, when unfortunately necessary
to state that the economy still wins over the legal side and the fact that
legislation only catches up with research and application practice and not the other way around. This trend needs to be reversed
what the office strives for in the work of its employees to the extent that it is personal and economic
possible to cover by him; it is therefore very important that the priority of the state becomes sufficient
staff and material security of the Office and that the right to protection is sufficiently ensured
personal data as a fundamental human right. Any underestimation of the protection situation
the rights of the individual can have very negative consequences in the future. Necessary significant
increase the Office 's budget, has a real foundation and support at European level as well (Communication
Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, see point 3.3). It is also necessary, within
public sector, to ensure equal and fair cooperation between stakeholders so that
their interaction resulted in legal norms that met the criteria for protection
personal data in accordance with the Regulation, which will not be prepared quickly and whose quality
review the time of their effectiveness and little or no need for their frequent amendment.
