The protection of personal data has been carried out since 25 May 2018 in accordance with the Regulation and the law, which
directly determine to the Office all its rights, obligations and competences. Despite the undisputed
the importance of the Office 's work, which depends on the importance and value of personal data, such as
sources of information on natural persons, the number of staff of the Office did not change significantly
and even in 2020 was not sufficient in the context of the agenda that the Office ensures and that it still has
an increasing trend in terms of the volume of work per employee. For the right
activities of the Office and also with regard to human capabilities and the pursuit of high-quality work of employees
it is essential that the number of employees be significantly increased. This will ensure a redistribution of work
and the possibility of higher specialization of individual employees, as many now perform
cumulative activities, each of which requires full concentration and attention.
The Office had a set limit of 51 employees in 2020, and it notified annually
and warns of the need to increase their number, ie to increase the said limit of the maximum number
employees at least 30. Nevertheless, for 2021, the Office's staff limit was reduced
to 461. The Office's agenda, even in the context of the obligations arising from the Regulation, has increased disproportionately and has
constantly growing trend. On average, there are more than 120 files per employee per
equipment. The current situation is unsustainable in the long run and there is a shortage of skilled people
employees is inevitably reflected in the quality of work, or results in impossibility
compliance with procedural deadlines. In connection with non - compliance with procedural deadlines, the Office was also contacted
by the Ombudsman, who was approached by two parties precisely because of the disproportionate nature
long duration of personal data protection proceedings. On the basis of an examination of those proceedings
the Ombudsman found that the administrative procedure had been followed by an administrative body, but
non-compliance with the legal deadline for issuing a decision. To this end, the Ombudsman
imposed on the Office measures aimed at streamlining communication with the parties to the proceedings
regarding the time limit of the proceedings themselves. To fulfill the strategic direction of the Office 's activities is
necessary to increase the number of staff to complete and participate on an ongoing basis
The reduction of the limit of the number of employees of the Office occurred on the basis of discussion and approval of the material "Draft Budget
public administration for the years 2021 to 2023 ", material number: UV-22129/2020; on the basis of which the Resolution was adopted
Government of the Slovak Republic no. 649/2020 of 14/10/2020. Mandatory consideration of staff reductions in the conditions of the Office
meant the loss of 5 employees.

necessary educational activities, they expanded their knowledge and were thus able in addition to professional
growth should also reflect the requirement to digitize public and state administration.
The Office also needs to be strengthened by information technology experts, as more and more
processing activities takes place in electronic form and it is necessary that, as part of the
as well as inspections, the Office was able to comment at expert level on the findings
on the information technologies used by operators and intermediaries.
The Office also feels the lack of staff dedicated to legislation, both in its area
as well as its comments, as this is a lengthy process of examining the submitted proposal
legislation or a non-legislative proposal that requires high attention and concentration
and it is essential that the employee has sufficient time and knowledge for such work, and not only
theoretical but also practical. The undersized personnel side of the office is also reflected in this
that the Office at that time could not at all consider setting up seconded workplaces, which would
it was also closer to the persons concerned, the operators and the intermediaries.
Underestimation of the number of employees also has the effect that it is not possible to develop what is necessary
specialization by creating new departments, which would take over from the existing ones and subsequently develop
some agendas to the expert level. We consider it especially necessary for it to be an employee
the Office is provided with the necessary training, which will have a positive impact on the performance of their activities,
so in terms of speed, but especially expertise.
The very limited possibility of training current employees also seems to be problematic
and the inability to obtain and keep erudite in the long run with adequate pay conditions
specialists, as a result of which the Office is not in an equal position vis-à-vis operators and their
possibilities, which is ultimately always to the detriment of the person concerned. From application practice
The Office has an urgent need to establish at least two seconded workplaces, one at
Central and one in eastern Slovakia. The reason for the need for these workplaces is to
the employees of the Office were closer to the affected persons also from these areas of Slovakia and also the fact that
that this would make the performance of controls more efficient and significantly reduce the Office's travel costs
employees from Bratislava; The Office would also contribute to increasing employment in those regions where
there are still enough qualified people who cannot or do not want to move.

2.3 The Office 's budget
The Office is a budgetary organization that is tied to the state with its revenues and expenditures
budget through the chapter General Treasury Administration, which is administered by the Ministry
of Finance of the Slovak Republic.

international agenda, where the staff of the Office is directly involved and must regularly
participate in meetings of the Committee 's expert groups and Council working groups, of which
the subject is important guidelines and documents influencing the activities of the Office on behalf of Slovakia
of the Republic.
The Office carries out activities arising not only from the Regulation and the law, but also from other special ones
regulations, for example under REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
Euratom) 2019/493 of 25 March 2019 amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1605/2002 1141/2014,
as regards the procedure for verifying infringements of personal data protection rules in context
elections to the European Parliament (see Article 10a (2) of that Regulation). If the Office decides
in personal data protection proceedings, that a natural or legal person has infringed the relevant rules
on the protection of personal data and if it follows from the decision or if others are justified

reasons to believe that the breach relates to the political activities of a European political party
or a European political foundation in the context of the European elections, so the decision

In the period from 15.07.2020 to 03.09.2020, a Government audit focused on verification was performed
compliance with the measures taken to remedy the deficiencies and to eliminate the causes of their identification
Government audit during the inspection in 2018. The aim was also to verify and evaluate others
facts, if so provided by a special regulation. Government Audit Report dated September 10, 2020
noted that the Office was functioning well for the audited period, but some more needed to be done
improvements. Based on the above-mentioned Government Audit Report, the Office prepared a list
measures taken and sent to the Office of Government Audit, Bratislava office and the measures were
and are subsequently implemented and applied in the application practice of the Office.

3 LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION
3.1 Interdepartmental comment procedures
The Office is a state administration body with nationwide competence performing protection supervision
personal data and involved in the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms in processing
personal data of natural persons. The Office fulfills its role in the field of processing supervision
personal data also by supervising and commenting on the texts of draft laws and others
generally binding legislation (legislative materials) as well as texts
non-legislative materials (visions, strategies, etc.). He formulates his comments on the proposals
through the Portal within the MPK. The purpose of the observations submitted by the Authority is
in particular, the quality of the legislation regarding the processing of personal data is
high that the legislation subsequently adopted is precise, unambiguous and thus in a relationship
to the controller as well as in relation to the data subject whose personal data will be in practice
subject to processing.
During the period under review, the Office submitted comments on 23 materials from
all submitted to the MPK (regardless of whether the material was legislative or non-legislative
nature). In total, the Office submitted 86 comments, 69 of which were substantial.
The Office always strives to improve the legal regulation with the applied comments, or
o drawing attention to the need to protect and respect the legislation concerning the processing of personal data
data if the subject of the comment is non-legislative material, such as a concept that has
in the future to be the basis for drafting legislation or meeting the set goals.
Minor shortcomings in the legislation can be corrected by ordinary comments that
in principle, they clarify or adjust the correct wording of the provisions in a form which, as far as
about processing is correct.
The essence of the Office 's observations consists of fundamental observations which refer to
more or less fundamental shortcomings of legal norms that need to be supplemented or revised.
During the period under review, many of the Office's key comments were addressed to the responsible authorities
determining and specifying the purpose for which the personal data are to be processed, as long as the purposes were
formulated very generally or completely absent, which in terms of legal certainty
and the enforceability of the legal norm in practice would certainly cause problems and be to the detriment
the person concerned. Another often recurring key comment was the requesting one
deletion of certain proposed provisions, as their proposed processing in context
purpose went beyond necessity and necessity. In the case of such comments, it often happened that
that the office did not receive a satisfactory answer from the manager even at the dispute, why it is extensive
necessary or what it results from and what is to be achieved by it. In several
In some cases, the discrepancy was removed by an explanation and the wording adjusted together. To others, still
a more frequent recurring commented deficiency on the part of the Office is in terms of content
insufficient explanatory statement, especially its special part, when in particular in the provisions concerning
reasons for the proposed regulation are missing, the explanations from
by the draftsman. The justifications in the explanatory memorandum are often general
one sentence from which it is not clear why processing is required and why it is necessary
to that extent. A very common recurring remark is the absence of internal references
to other special laws that specify and supplement the very purpose of personal data processing
in accordance with the legal agenda to which the processing may relate, or refer to a provision
another law, where the scope or list of personal data processed is established on
established purpose.

COMMUNICATION OF THE OFFICE WITH THE PUBLIC
4.1 Opinions of the Office on the issues of natural and legal persons
The issue of personal data protection does not only concern operators or intermediaries,
who have a duty to apply personal data protection legislation in practice, but also people,
specific natural persons - affected persons having issues arising from normal situations
related to their personal data and their processing. In the observed period with respect to
The pandemic was dominated by issues related to the processing of personal health data, temperature measurement,
processing data on the health of children in schools and kindergartens with a view to their follow-up
attending a preschool or school facility. Again, a fairly large number of questions
formed issues related to the processing of personal data in apartment buildings and the installation of cameras
in apartment buildings. Many questions led to extensive testing and processing of personal ones
data of tested persons. As many of the issues were within the material scope of the ÚVZ SR, these were to him
were transferred to the equipment.
The Office's operators and intermediaries most often address questions of a professional nature
related to their obligations arising from the Regulation and the law, or special laws
governing processing operations. As municipalities and cities are also operators, several
one of them addressed the office in connection with either testing or its preparation and addressed questions
the Office, in particular with regard to their position in the testing process or the fulfillment of their information obligations
against the persons concerned or the possibility or impossibility of using municipal or city
operating cameras for the purpose of monitoring the density of persons in front of the test site.
The staff of the Office dealt with 975 questions during the period under review, taking into account that
records are kept on the document, not the number of questions asked in it, so it really was
equipped with several times more questions from the public.

4.2 Provision of information on the basis of requests for access to information in accordance with the law
no. 211/2000 Coll.
One of the possibilities for public access to information is also the possibility to submit a request within the meaning of
Act no. 211/2000 Coll. The Office, as the liable person, will evaluate these applications in accordance with the law
no. 211/2000 Coll. equip.
In 2020, the Office received 212 requests for access to information. Of this total
In 50 cases, the Office processed the request by making the required information available, in 44
in some cases, it issued a decision not to disclose the information in part and at the same time
which could have been disclosed, in 40 cases the Office issued a decision not to disclose the information,
in 30 cases, he postponed the submitted applications because they were not within the deadline specified in the call for completions
supplemented. In 48 cases, the Office forwarded the Office as the relevant application processing department
these to another relevant department of the Office of Equipment, as their contents indicated that they were not
request for disclosure of information, but for example a question to the public, resp. some advanced on
equipping another liable person to whom the competencies belonged on the basis of the assessment of their content.

4.3

Office communication with the media

The issues raised by the media were specific issues and "cases" in which it was the subject
processing or protection of personal data, or journalists' questions have been directed at
specification of the rights of the persons concerned, how to exercise them correctly and all that is possible
the person concerned may seek redress from the operator. Especially since March of the period under review
issues of processing and protection of personal data in connection with the pandemic have come to the fore,
and the follow-up and obligations related to the processing of personal data
18

natural persons, in particular where health data have been processed. Also big
repeated security incidents involving the National Center have aroused media interest
health information; specifically leak information about Covid 19 positive people called. “Covid
map ”or a breach of My eHealth. The topic of processing and protection of personal data
data related to the coronavirus pandemic dominated journalistic issues to the end
period and was only exceptionally "interrupted" by another, currently current topic.

4.4 Office website and its traffic
The Office's website meets the conditions and technical criteria in accordance with the Decree of the Ministry of Finance
SR on standards for public administration information systems, reflects on the new legislation
in the field of personal data protection, and is gradually supplemented by new functionalities and up-to-date
forms, methodologies and guidelines. The Office also bases its appearance on and the division of its website
and tries to make the website more transparent as user-friendly as possible. In the rest
During the period under review, the Office sought to improve and supplement, in particular, the English version
persons knew how to get information even if they do not speak Slovak and also in the context of that office
and the Slovak Republic have been the subject of a Schengen evaluation as regards the protection of personal data
data, where the evaluators were also interested in accessing and providing information
in English, or another foreign language, or the language of a national minority.
The Office 's website was searched a total of 734 654 times during the reporting period, which is
an increase of more than 300,000 visits compared to 2019.

4.5 The Office's website and reporting privacy breaches
The Office's website is a key source of information related to personal data protection.
At the same time, it is also a basic service according to Act no. 69/2018 Coll. on cyber security
and amending certain laws. Operators and intermediaries must ensure
the continued credibility, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
and to assess at regular intervals the effectiveness of the technical and organizational arrangements in place
measures. Nevertheless, it may occur (whether due to intentional action, negligence, error or
natural disaster) to a personal data breach which, as a result, may
mean accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or
disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
The operator has an obligation under Art. 33 Regulations or to report a violation pursuant to Section 40 of the Act
protection of personal data (so-called "data breach") of the Office. He may do so in relation to the Office
in several ways, one of which, recommended, is the opportunity to take advantage of this
the designated form, published on the Office's website, which was the beginning
during the reference period, so that the Office, on the basis of its details and answers in it
provided all the information necessary to know the breach of protection
personal data.
In the period under review, 159 personal data breaches were formally reported to the Office
(in all specified ways). After examination and evaluation of this number, it was possible as
privacy violations actually mark 107 reports. The remaining 52 reports
represented, for the most part, another of the Office's agendas, such as the request to initiate proceedings, was unfounded
a complaint lodged without relevant information or any other non-compliant document
breach of personal data protection within the meaning of Art. 33 Regulations. Violation report is
obligation for operators, not for the persons concerned. In cases of breach of protection
personal data were reported by the data subjects, they often stated that they had reported a breach
that the operator stated that he would not report it to the office because it was not an incident
19

evaluated as such, which must be reported to the Office. We would also like to appeal this way
operators to fulfill their obligations themselves, as if the Office finds that they have occurred
to a breach of personal data which has not been reported to the Office and should have been, it may
be considered an aggravating circumstance by the Office in any personal data protection proceedings
with a direct impact on a possible increase in the fine imposed.
The most frequent violations of personal data protection in the monitored period occurred due to:
 unauthorized disclosure or disclosure of personal data, a total of 62 cases;
 cyber attack, a total of 24 cases;
 theft by burglary and theft of media containing personal data, a total of 6 cases;
 isolated cases of personal data breaches due to unauthorized use
opening of mail, exchanges of persons and thus also exchanges of personal data.
4.5.1 Electronic services of the Office for Personal Data Protection of the Slovak Republic
In order to achieve full legislative compliance in the field of information and cyber
security and also the provision of electronic services of the Office on 17.12.2020 Office and the Ministry
of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic on behalf of the Ministry of Investment, Regional Development
and informatization of the Slovak Republic signed Contracts on the provision of non - repayable financial
contribution in the amount of EUR 4,276,620.28 for the implementation of the Office 's Electronic Services Project at

Control of the processing of personal data in a sports association, which is a civic association
association

One of the inspections that the Office completed in 2020 was the inspection of personal data processing
in a sports association, which is a civic association. The subject of the inspection was the conformity of processing
personal data with the requirements of the Regulation in the processing of personal data of the persons concerned.
The inspection was focused on the processing of personal data of those interested in membership in the union and members
union. The inspected person obtained the personal data of the persons concerned through the application,
which also required a photograph of the applicant for membership in the association. The inspected person subsequently
through its website it published a list of its members, including the so-called
an electronic registration card which contained personal data, including a photograph (at the time of
electronic registration cards have already been published without a photograph).
The inspection revealed that the person concerned did not have the opportunity to agree or disagree with
processing of personal data for the individual purposes of personal data processing and were not
provided or unambiguous information on the legal basis of the processing according to the purpose of the processing.
At the same time, the inspection found that the inspected person did not meet the condition arising from the article
7 of the Regulation by failing to inform the persons concerned of the possibility of consent prior to granting consent
revoke at any time. The audit also found errors related to the provision of information,
which the inspected person was obliged to provide to the persons concerned in obtaining their personal data
data. Based on the identified deficiencies, the inspection was terminated by the inspection protocol.
7.3.5

Control of the processing of personal data of the data subjects by the controller who:
is a healthcare provider in the field of aesthetic and plastic surgery
and corrective dermatology

In 2020, the Office checked the processing of personal data of the persons concerned by the operator,
which is a healthcare provider in the field of aesthetic-plastic surgery
and corrective dermatology, where all procedures (including surgical procedures) are performed on
based on the client's request and paid for by the client himself. Personal data of their clients
the operator processes them autonomously and does not systematically provide them to any other
medical facility or any health insurance company; the only exception is medical
laboratory for diagnostic purposes in case of histological examination of a sample taken from the client.
The client's personal data are processed by the operator for the purpose of performing medical procedures
as personal data necessary to fulfill the legal obligation of the controller and are processed
to the extent that medical records are processed in the provision of healthcare
on the basis of the Health Care Act. Data processed for the purpose of providing
healthcare are health-related data, ie a special category of personal data
data; the inspection did not reveal any processing of health data other than by law
defined purposes. However, the inspection revealed that the operator in obtaining personal data
provided to potential clients through an online form on its website
outdated information on the rights of the persons concerned, using a single, universal one
e-mail address for two different purposes (communication with the public and exercise of rights
persons concerned). Based on the identified deficiencies, the inspection was terminated by a protocol
on control.
7.3.6

Control of the operator (legal entity) who performs the guard service

The subject of control of the operator (legal entity) performing the guard service was
compliance of the processing of personal data of the data subjects by the camera system with the requirements
Regulations with an emphasis on verifying the processing of personal data of employees for the purpose of the so-called
control mechanism of the employer according to the Labor Code. The person inspected had
several IP cameras, recording equipment and output display units in operation. Control
28

In carrying out the inspection, the authority focused mainly on the principles of personal data processing, legality
processing of personal data, information to be provided in the collection of personal data
data from the data subject and the security of the processing of personal data. Personal processing
staff data through a camera system for the purpose of the control mechanism
employer was presented by the inspected person as his legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6
para. 1 letter f) Regulations arising from its authorization pursuant to a special law (§ 13 par. 4
Labor Code). However, during the inspection, the inspected person does not in any way (e.g.
proportionality test) has not demonstrated that its legitimate interests outweigh the interests of or
fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned (own employees). Legal basis
processing of personal data of employees for the purpose of the control mechanism was in various
documents submitted by the audited entity formulated differently (once as a legitimate interest,
other than § 13 par. 4 of the Labor Code), ie from the point of view of the persons concerned (employees)
misleading, non-transparent. At the same time, the inspected person was found to be the inspected person
one camera processes employees' personal data to an unreasonable extent (above the scope of
necessary to achieve the purpose of the processing), that is to say, in breach of Article 5 (1) 1 letter c)
Regulations (data minimization principle). The inspection authorities also found that
the inspected person acts in breach of Article 5 para. 1 letter (e) Regulations (principle
retention minimization) by retaining the personal data of the persons concerned (employees) after
longer than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose. Based on the findings
deficiencies, the inspection was terminated by the inspection protocol.
7.3.7

Control in a trading company mainly engaged in providing targeted
advertising and population analysis

The Office carried out on the basis of a suspected breach of personal data processing obligations
control in a commercial company mainly engaged in the provision of targeted advertising
and creating population analyzes. Initiative to verify the lawfulness of the processing of personal data
was delivered to the office by a journalist who was interested in one of the audited person's population analyzes.
The inspection focused on the area related to the processing of the location data concerned
persons by tracking the location of SIM cards, the purpose of which was to determine the number
population migrating for work outside the district or county. This analysis of population movements
performed by the inspected person on the basis of an order from another entity that wanted the results of the analysis
use in traffic planning. The inspected person created an analysis of population migration
within a period of two weeks, on the basis of the data provided to it
telecommunications operators under concluded contracts. The data was provided controlled
to a person in a form which did not allow their reassignment to the particular person concerned.
The inspection, which did not reveal any non-compliance with the Regulation, was terminated by an inspection record.
7.3.8

Control of camera systems operated by natural persons

The Office also deals with the processing of personal data of the persons concerned via camera
systems operated by natural persons. In the specific case, at the initiative of the inspection
it turned out that the inspected (natural) person also monitors the premises he does not own, as a result
which cannot be explicitly domestic or personal activities of the natural person to whom the regulation applies
does not apply. However, the inspected person declared during the inspection and subsequently also
proved that it is a non-functional imitation (dummy) of the camera, as a result of which there is no
to any processing of personal data. The inspection was completed by the inspection record.
However, in relation to CCTV systems operated by individuals, it is desirable
point out that to monitor one's own home (such as a family house) in many
cases may not be exempted from the scope of the Regulation under Article 2 (1). 2 letter c)
(processing of personal data in the framework of exclusively personal or domestic activities) on the grounds that
29

the camera system in question even partially monitors the real estate of another person (for example
land or neighbor's family house) or public space (for example, part of a street). In such
In some cases, the natural person operating the camera system also acquires the status
operator, as a result of which it is fully covered by all obligations
resulting from the Regulation.

8 PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION PROCEDURE
The purpose of personal data protection proceedings is to determine whether the rights of natural persons have been violated during
processing of their personal data or there has been a violation of the provisions of the Regulation or the law,
and, if justified and appropriate, to remedy the deficiencies, if necessary
fine. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Code apply to personal data protection proceedings.
If the competence of the Office to act and the decision in the case is not given, the Office is obliged to file it
forward to the competent administrative authority. In the monitored period, the Office forwarded a total of 34 submissions
another competent administrative body for action and decision.
Personal data protection legislation allows the Office to file in an exhaustive manner
postponed in certain cases. The Office had to proceed with the postponement of the application in his case
unfoundedness, if the matter to which the application relates was heard by a criminal authority
proceedings, if the applicant has not provided the Office with the necessary cooperation at its request, without
his active participation, it was not possible to settle the matter and, if, since the event to which the
more than three years have elapsed on the day of its delivery. The most common reason for the postponement was
the unfoundedness of the application, when it was already clear from the evidence submitted, in particular by the person concerned,
that there has been no breach of personal data protection law. In the monitored
a total of 289 submissions were postponed during the period.
The Office, in the framework of supervisory activities, conducts proceedings on the protection of personal data in order to protect rights
individuals against unauthorized interference with their private life in the processing of them
personal data, while also examining compliance with the obligations laid down in the Regulation
and the law. If it finds that the rights of the data subject have been infringed or that there have been no processing obligations

the intermediary to take measures to remedy the deficiencies and causes within a specified period
or, depending in particular on the gravity of the infringement found, impose a fine.
Otherwise, it will stop the personal data protection proceedings.
The personal data protection procedure is initiated on the proposal of the petitioner or on his own initiative
office. Proceedings on the Office's own initiative are initiated on the basis of an initiative, on the basis of results
inspections which revealed deficiencies or on the basis of the Office's own findings
on suspected breaches of personal data protection legislation, such as proceedings
started without a proposal.
In the period under review, the Office initiated a total of 219 administrative proceedings, of which 138 were initiated at
proposal of the person concerned, 57 initiated on the basis of the initiative, 16 initiated on the basis of the results

Decision of the Office, as the administrative body at first instance in personal data protection proceedings,
it is based on a reliably ascertained state of affairs. For this purpose, the Office is in proceedings for the protection of personal data
authorized to request the co-operation of anyone, and the Office requested it during the period under review
for cooperation a total of 972 times. In personal data protection proceedings, there have been three cases where
31

the entity from which the co-operation was requested did not respond to it and the Office even after being called upon to comply
did not cooperate (in these cases proceedings were initiated against the entities
on a fine or a disciplinary fine).
In connection with raising awareness of personal data protection among the public, the cases, resp.
the results of the proceedings were often also of interest to the media. The Institute of Legal Representation was evaluated
used in a significant number of cases, with the exception of cases where all
the parties were represented by lawyers.
The most common subject of personal data protection proceedings was the examination or processing
personal data of the data subjects in the information system of which the cameras were
there has been no breach of personal data protection law.
One of the most common violations was the processing of personal data in breach of the principle of non-discrimination
legality, when personal data was processed without a legal basis, resp.
contrary to the legal basis and processing contrary to the principles of integrity and confidentiality, which
related to the failure to take appropriate security measures.

9 COOPERATION AND CONSISTENCY MECHANISM
The functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not impeded
restricted or prohibited, not even for reasons related to the protection of individuals during processing
personal data, which is also reflected in the provisions of Art. 1 par. 3 Regulations. To that Regulation
responds by establishing cooperation and consistency mechanisms to ensure consistency
and a similarly high level of personal data protection in each Member State, regardless of
place of residence of the person concerned.

9.1 Cooperation mechanism
The Regulation regulates cooperation between supervisory authorities, whether the need for mutual
cooperation will arise in the framework of the investigation of a specific breach of personal data protection
data or other activities of the supervisory authority (eg addressing legal issues,
providing consultations). Given that the rules of cooperation are regulated directly
Regulation, no further specific agreements are required between Member States
for this purpose.
9.1.1

Cross - border processing

Pursuant to Art. 55 of the Regulation, each supervisory authority performs the tasks and exercises the powers published
By regulation in the territory of its State. However, the regulation also specifically regulates the procedure and jurisdiction
in proceedings for the cross-border processing of personal data. Cross-border processing makes sense
Art. 4 pt. 23 of the Regulation (a) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in context
activities of the operator's or intermediary's premises in more than one Member State
where the operator or intermediary is established in more than one Member State
state; or (b) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of a single activity
the establishment of an operator or intermediary in the Union but which significantly affects it
or likely to significantly affect the persons concerned in more than one Member State.
The regulation governs cooperation between supervisory authorities, in particular in relation to
with the mechanism of a single contact point (so-called one-stop-shop) regulated in Art. 56 par. 1
Regulations under which the supervisory authority is the main establishment or the sole establishment
operator or intermediary authorized to act as lead supervisory authority for
cross-border processing carried out by that operator or intermediary.
According to Art. 56 par. 2 of the Regulation, each supervisory authority is competent to deal with it
complaint or possible infringement of the Regulation, if the facts concern only
establishment in its Member State or significantly affects the persons concerned only in its own Member State
Member State. In accordance with Art. 4 point 22 of the Regulation other supervisory authorities will be for this
processing in the positions of the supervisory authorities concerned, if (a) the controller; or
the intermediary is established in the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority; (b) the persons concerned
resident in the Member State of that supervisory authority are significantly affected or will be significantly affected
likely to be significantly affected by processing; or (c) the complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority
authority.
The designation of the lead supervisor and the authorities concerned is done in IMI
(Internal Market Informational System), within which
the exchange of information on specific processing takes place between the different supervisory authorities
and a specific suspicion of a breach of personal data protection, resp. if the investigation
started on the basis of a complaint from the person concerned as well as the content of that particular complaint. Exchange
information is in English.
33

During the period under review, the Office received 726 identification notifications in IMI
the head and the supervisory authority concerned. Based on a careful assessment of every single thing
assessed that it was the supervisory authority concerned in 154 cases; most often for reasons that
the processing of personal data in question significantly affects or is likely to significantly affect
will affect the affected persons residing in the territory of the Slovak Republic. It went most often
on social network operators, airlines, fitness center operators,
companies providing online games, various e-shops, etc. In some cases, the office was affected
also due to the fact that the operator or intermediary is established in the territory of the Slovak Republic,
ie. has one or more establishments in the territory of the Slovak Republic. If the Office evaluated that
is the supervisory authority concerned, identified this in IMI and followed up the case. In accordance with Art.
60 of the Regulation, the Office had the opportunity to comment on the requests of the Chief Supervisor as required
authority, its procedure and the results of the investigation, as well as to comment on draft decisions.
If the Office is the supervisory authority concerned because it has received a complaint, the Office
would act as a contact point for the person concerned and would notify the manager's decision
supervisory authority.
A total of 39 submissions containing elements were received by the Office during the period under review
cross-border processing and 11 notifications of personal data breaches, so-called data breach.
These submissions were either delivered from foreign persons or directed against foreign ones
operators, including, for example, to operators established in the USA, the Czech Republic
Republic or Ireland. Within each filed submission, the Office first examined (so - called
preliminary examination of the complaint) whether the subject of the application meets the requirements of the application, resp. initiative
according to § 100 par. 3 of the Act and also whether it meets the conditions for cross-border processing according to Art. 4
point 23 of the Regulation, resp. whether the definition according to Art. 56 par. 2 Regulations. If the subject
filing a reasonable suspicion of a personal data breach, the Office stated
shall also verify the allegations in cooperation with the supervisory authority of the Member State in whose territory
the operator had a principal or sole establishment. In 10 cases, the Office entered the received
IMI submissions and further dealt with them in cooperation with the supervisory authorities that were
processing by the lead supervisory authority. The Office forwarded these complaints via
IMI system to Ireland, Hungary, Sweden, Luxembourg and the Office forwarded three complaints to the
supervisory authority. The Office was designated as the leading supervisory body during the period under review
in 4 cases, based on the location of the operator's headquarters, these complaints
came from citizens of Austria (a total of 3 complaints) and one complaint was lodged by a Slovak citizen
living in Germany.
9.1.2

Mutual help

The Office also cooperates with other supervisory bodies outside the one-stop-shop mechanism. This
cooperation also takes place in IMI, which allows specific requests to be sent
selected supervisory authority. However, the Office also continuously handles email or written requests
other supervisory authorities.
During the reporting period, the Authority received 43 requests from other supervisors in IMI
for cooperation within the meaning of Art. 61 Regulations. In the requests in question, the supervisory authorities requested the Office
for its legal opinion, in particular as regards the interpretation of the provisions of the Regulation. The requests concerned
e.g. interpretation of individual provisions, the legal basis for the processing of personal data,
responsible persons, the coherence of the Regulation and national protection rules
personal data, ascertaining the receipt of a specific complaint, the interpretation of Art. 10 Regulations, scope
Regulations on religious societies, processing of personal data during a pandemic, recovery
artificial intelligence in the work environment, processing of a special category of personal data,
the tasks of the external responsible person, biometric data, the method of handling the complaint, etc.
34

In this way, some supervisory authorities informed the Office of the notification of the infringement received
protection of personal data or have used this method to consult a specific case before
by launching a one-stop-shop mechanism.
During the period under review, the Office sent 12 requests for cooperation in IMI pursuant to Art. 61
Regulations. The requests concerned information on specific cross-border cases, consultations
individual cases or the legal opinion of other supervisory authorities on interpretation
Regulations. For example, the Office asked other supervisory authorities about the interpretation of Art. 2 par. 2
letter c) Regulations, deadlines for cameras that capture public space, identification
operator, resp. provider of the Internet domain, territorial scope in connection
with codes of conduct. The Authority has also asked other supervisory authorities to cooperate, for example
also in connection with the interpretation of Art. 18 par. 1 letter d) Regulations or responsibilities of the responsible person
persons. The Office also used other forms for mutual cooperation with other supervisory authorities
communications such as IMI (email, written and telephone communications) in which it used
contacts acquired in the course of its activities, including contacts acquired under the
membership of the Committee's expert groups.
9.1.3

Joint supervisory operations

Under the cooperation mechanism, pursuant to Art. 62 Regulations may also carry out joint operations
supervisory authorities in the field of joint investigations and joint actions in the field
enforcement. During the period under review, the Office did not initiate or accept a request for the implementation of such
joint operations of supervisory authorities.

9.2 Consistency mechanism
An important attribute of the Regulation is its consistent application. In order to achieve this objective,
The Regulation provides for a consistency mechanism, which can be understood as cooperation between
EEA supervisory authorities and, where appropriate, the EC.
9.2.1

EDPB opinion

The purpose of Article 64 of the Regulation is for the EDPB to issue an opinion in cases where the competent supervisory authority
the authority plans to take specific measures. To that end, the supervisory authority should notify the EDPB of its
draft decision. The Regulation regulates cases where the supervisory authority is obliged to apply to the EDPB
for an opinion (Article 64 (1) of the Regulation) and when it has the opportunity to request an opinion (Article 64 (2) of the Regulation)
Regulations). The Authority did not request an opinion from EDPB during the period under review.
9.2.2

EDPB Dispute Resolution

Dispute resolution The EDPB allows for binding decisions to ensure consistency
application of the Regulation in the following cases:
 The relevant reasoned objection was raised by the supervisory authority concerned or
rejected by the lead supervisory authority (Article 60 of the Regulation);
 Disagreement with the appointment of the head of the supervisory body (Article 56 of the Regulation);
 Absence of consultation of the EDPB (Article 64 of the Regulation);
 The Authority did not follow the opinion of the EDPB (Article 64 of the Regulation).
EDPB did not resolve any dispute during the period under review.

35

9.2.3

Emergency procedure

Article 66 of the Regulation provides for an urgency procedure. In exceptional
in cases where the supervisory authority concerned considers it urgent to protect rights and freedoms
concerned, it may take interim measures having legal effect in its territory. Validity
these measures may not exceed three months. In this case, the supervisory authority concerned is concerned
obliged to inform the other supervisory authorities, the EDPB and the EC.
If the Authority considers that definitive action is needed urgently, it may request it
EDPB for an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision. Each supervisory authority may
request an urgent opinion or a binding decision from the EDPB in cases where the competent authority
the supervisory authority has not taken appropriate action and there is an urgent need for action. In the evaluated
period, the Office did not apply this article.

36

10 SANCTATION
Sanctions for violations of the Regulation and the law are fines and disciplinary fines. Sanctions are in place
optional legal standards, ie. that not every detected violation has to be done automatically

each individual case. When deciding on the imposition of a fine and determining its amount
taking into account, in particular, the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the number of persons concerned, the extent of the damage,
if any, the possible breach of personal data protection and the measures taken
to mitigate the damage suffered by the persons concerned. The Office also takes into account the previous ones
breaches of personal data protection, the degree of co-operation with the Office in rectifying breaches and mitigating them
possible adverse consequences of the breach, the category of personal data to be breached
and the way in which the Office learned of the personal data breach.

to a person who is not an operator or intermediary for failing to provide the requested
37

cooperation of the Office in the performance of supervision. In the period under review, the Office imposed two disciplinary fines
in the total amount of 2,500 euros, both for failure to cooperate.

10.3 Selected cases from the supervisory activities of the Office
10.3.1 Postponements
10.3.1.1 Processing of personal data by a natural person
In 2020, the Office accepted the proposal of the affected person addressed to a natural person - an official
the city police, which was supposed to violate the protection of personal data by sending documents containing
personal data of the data subject in the range of name, surname and signature of various branches. Office
After examining the application of the person concerned and the documents annexed to it, he found that he was not
authorized not only to conduct personal data protection proceedings against an individual, but is not the same
entitled to impose a fine on such a natural person. Authority of the Office to initiate protection proceedings
personal data against entities (exhaustively) determined by law is defined in § 99
para. 3 of the Act (operator, intermediary, certification body, monitoring body),
whereas by law it is not possible for a natural person in personal data protection proceedings for
breach of personal data protection rules and therefore fined the case. The office subsequently
the matter was resigned for assessment by the relevant part of the Police Force of the Ministry of the Interior
Of the Slovak Republic with suspicion that the case does not meet the factual elements of the crime
Unauthorized handling of personal data under the Criminal Code.
10.3.1.2 Disclosure of personal data by the media
In 2020, the Office received several submissions in which applicants objected to the disclosure of personal data
data of the persons concerned through the press or news reports broadcast
on television and later available on the operators' websites. Based on
the operator of the personal data published thus made it possible to identify the natural person.
In case

rights
protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and the right to information, both
represent fundamental rights in a democratic society. It follows from the Regulation that Member States
to harmonize the right to the protection of personal data and the right to liberty under national law
speech and the right to information, including processing for journalistic purposes, and to provide for exceptions or
derogations from certain chapters of the Regulation. Such national rules in the conditions
Of the Slovak Republic is the law. In relation to the submissions in question, the Office found that
when publishing personal data, the operators proceeded in accordance with § 78 par. 2 of the Act, according to
whose controller may process personal data without the consent of the data subject, even if
the processing of personal data is necessary for the needs of informing the public
media and if personal data are processed by the controller to whom it is processed
results from the subject of the activity. Operators process personal data of the persons concerned
for the purposes of informing the public, it resulted from the subject of the activity. Operators are in the sense of
the right to obtain truthful, timely and comprehensive information in order to obtain
information to the public and are not responsible for the content of the information provided by the defined area
persons. However, it is also true that operators by processing the personal data of the persons concerned on
journalistic purposes according to § 78 par. 2 of the Act must not violate the right of the person concerned to protection
her personality or the right to privacy. Assessment of fact or disclosure
personal data of the persons concerned by means of communication for journalistic purposes
the right to protection of the personality and privacy of the persons concerned has been infringed
General Court (protection of the individual). In the case of disclosure of such personal data
by the media, which could cause an unauthorized interference with the right to
protection of the personality and privacy of the data subject, the data subject has the right to seek protection against
38

in court.
10.3.2 Procedures
10.3.2.1 Jubilants - congratulations of the village on its life anniversary
In 2020, the Office adopted several proposals to initiate proceedings on personal data protection
affected persons who have challenged the publication of personal data in the magazines of the municipalities in the sections
"Anniversary congratulations" in the name, surname, age of the person concerned, as well as
in a section such as "Married, Married" in the scope of personal data name,
surname, title and date of marriage of the person concerned. Office examining the case in the proceedings
on the protection of personal data found that none of the operators against whom it
has not proved that the personal data in question were processed on an appropriate legal basis pursuant to Art. 6
para. 1 of the Regulation, and therefore the Office assessed such conduct of the operator as contradictory
with the basic principle of lawfulness of personal data processing according to Art. 5 par. 1 letter a)
Regulations. Several controllers have claimed in the privacy proceedings that they are processing
personal data for the purpose of congratulating the persons concerned in the magazine or on its website
on the legal basis of Art. 6 par. 1 letter e) Regulations, or in the legitimate interest
operator according to Art. 6 par. 1 letter f) Regulations, which, however, were not a correct statement.
In order for the operator to proceed in accordance with Art. 6 par. 1 letter e) Regulations, would have to in the given
in this case exist at the same time according to § 6 par. 3 of the Regulation provisions of a special law governing
the legal authorization of the controller to process the personal data in question to the extent necessary to
given purpose (for example, for the purposes of important life events of its citizens). None of the special
laws used by municipalities, for example for the purposes of registry registration, population registration, or
Act on Municipalities, however, this legal condition, resp. legal authority to process personal
concerned for the above purpose. The Office also stated in this case that the municipality
as an operator, it needs to have the legal basis for two processing operations
with personal data, for the processing of personal data to a certain extent on
the purpose of congratulating the inhabitants of the municipality and the processing operation of publishing personal data
to a certain extent. Under the current legal status, the municipality is entitled to process personal data on this
purpose on a legal basis, which is the consent of the person concerned under Art. 6 par. 1 letter (a) Regulations, namely:
thus in relation to the acquisition of personal data from the population register or the register register by the municipality,
as well as in relation to the publication of the data in question by the municipality in a general journal or on the web
the seat of the municipality. The Office also found that the operators (municipalities) following the violation
At the same time, the principles of legality infringed the principle of limitation of the purpose of the processing of personal data under
Art. 5 par. 1 letter (b) Regulations where the personal data of the persons concerned have already been obtained on the basis of
a special regulation stipulating the specific purpose of obtaining personal data, they also used
to another, resp. another purpose, thereby exceeding the originally intended purpose of the processing of personal data, for
which a fine was imposed on them.
10.3.2.2 Requiring a verified signature of the data subject in exercising his / her right to
access to personal data pursuant to Art. 15 Regulations
During the period under review, the Office accepted the person concerned's request for a breach of the right of access
to personal data, as it has asserted its own with the financial service provider
the right of access to personal data, which subsequently referred her to a standardized form
"Request for the exercise of the rights of the data subject under the GDPR". This request showed that
the operator requires their verified signature when exercising the rights of the persons concerned. From the background
acquired in the proceedings on personal data protection, the Office expressed its non-compliance with Art. 12 par. 5 of the Regulation,
because the operator has requested the right of access from the person concerned for the purposes of exercising it
verified signature, which, in accordance with Recitals 59, 63 of the Regulation, as well as Art. 12 par. 1 Regulations complained
by imposing conditions which were undoubtedly of a financial nature,
39

exercise of rights under the Regulation. The operator this disproportionate condition during
personal data protection proceedings, it was therefore not necessary to impose measures on
elimination of identified deficiencies.
10.3.2.3 Illegal collection of personal data by a financial institution for the purpose of addressing
persons concerned with an offer of financial intermediation or advice
During the period under review, the Authority accepted the proposal of the person concerned who claimed that the operator
(financial institution) without its legal basis processes its personal data to the extent of name, surname,
telephone number, the specific product, so that the authorized person of the operator by telephone
contacted in order to submit a call or an offer of financial intermediation, or
financial advice. The Office found from the documents obtained that the person concerned had never been
the operator’s client, as confirmed by the operator itself. However, the operator stated that
processed the personal data of the data subject on the legal basis of his or her legitimate interest, namely
purposes of direct marketing according to Art. 6 par. 1 letter (f) Regulations, also referring to
Recital 47 of the Regulation. With these claims of the operator and his determination of the legal basis
However, the Office did not identify a legitimate interest because, as stated in Recital 47 of the Regulation, the
which, incidentally, the operator himself has pointed out, the legitimate interest of the operator as
the legal basis for the processing of personal data can only exist if they exist
reasonable expectations of the person concerned based on their relationship with the operator, such
a legitimate interest of the operator could exist, for example, if between the parties concerned
there was a relevant and reasonable relationship between the person and the operator (the person concerned
in the client's position vis-à-vis the operator or in its services), which, however, in the given case
was not met. As the petitioner has never been a client of the operator, moreover alone
confirmed by the operator, ie that he does not register any contract with the proposer
in the databases, the person concerned (the petitioner) could reasonably never have expected such
processing, resp. contact by the operator's subordinate financial agent.
For this reason, the Office alleged a violation of the principle of legality of personal data processing
according to Art. 5 par. 1 letter (a) Regulations, as the operator has not shown in the proceedings that he has
adequate legal basis for the processing of personal data pursuant to Art. 6 par. 1 Regulations on
for this purpose and imposed a fine on the operator.
10.3.2.4 Publication of birth numbers of applicants for study in the results list
The Office accepted the complaint of a natural person against the operator, which was the school. According to its content
and the attached evidence, the school should have published the results on its official website
order from the admission procedure for the school year 2020/2021 ranking, points and birth numbers
applicants for a four-year study at school. The Office examined the school's website to find that
the given result list with birth numbers is no longer published. However, the Office
the facts set out in the complaint and the accompanying evidence began against the school as
to the operator on his own initiative. The Office investigated the case in question
written cooperation with the school. According to § 78 par. 4 last sentence of the law applies to publish
a universally applicable identifier is prohibited; this does not apply if the universally applicable identifier
published by the person concerned. Section 78 of the Act supplements the special processing rules
personal data provided for in the Regulation. Specifically, it is also a special processing arrangement
national identification number, namely the generally applicable identifier which is currently
time in the Slovak Republic birth number of a natural person. The office had found the school as
the operator processed in his information system the birth numbers of natural persons -
applicants for a four-year study for the school year 2020/2021 for the purposes of the admission procedure, which
was authorized to process, following the operator's procedure in announcing the results
the birth numbers were published in the results list on its website
page. The publication of birth numbers was stopped on the operator's own initiative
40

before the commencement of the proceedings. In view of this finding of the end of the publication of birth numbers
and ensuring compliance with the law, as well as the circumstances surrounding this one-off procedure
operator in identifying candidates on the basis of their birth numbers (lack of time for
distribution of identification codes for study applicants with regard to the situation that has arisen
pandemic COVID-19) the Authority did not impose corrective measures on the operator. However, the Office
to the operator for violation of the provisions of § 78 par. 4 of the Act when publishing birth numbers
imposed a fine on the persons concerned.

an employment contract concluded with the operator for the effectiveness of the Regulation and personal data
of the petitioner were processed for the purposes of the personnel and payroll agenda. Legal basis
processing of the petitioner's personal data in the conclusion of employment and fulfillment of obligations
resulting from the employment contract was not the consent of the person concerned within the meaning of Art. 4 par. 11 Regulations
in conjunction with Art. 7 Regulations. In this particular case, the employment contract should not have included
a statement of the employee's consent as the data subject, as the legal basis for the processing was
performance of the contract (employment contract) or legal obligation (special laws). The Office also found
that even the form of consent was given in the declaration, as the consent was not given
free (there was no free choice to give or not to give consent). The operator 's procedure by:
the employment contract with the employee contained his statement of consent to processing
personal data by an employer who, on the one hand, was not obtained freely or was
appropriate legal basis for the processing of the claimant's personal data for the purposes of the conclusion
employment contract, there was a violation of the principle of legality under Art. 5 par. 1 letter (a) Regulations.

considered to be sensitive personal data and no breach of integrity or breach has been identified
availability of personal data. The operator proved that he had received before the incident
security measures to prevent this type of security incident, but in a specific
Insufficient compliance with the measures taken should have led to a human factor failure.
The operator informed the persons concerned about the occurrence of the incident in accordance with Art. 34 Regulations. Office at
based on the assessment of the collected documents, he assessed that there was no reason to impose corrective ones
measures, as the operator has complied with Art. 33 and Art. 34 Notification regulations

and organizational measures to prevent recurrence of the infringement in the future as well as measures to
mitigation of potential adverse consequences for the persons concerned. Office in this particular

previously concluded loan agreement. The operator contacted the person concerned in connection
with the waiver of part of the debt. The data subject objected that the controller was not authorized to process it

AND INTERNATIONAL
PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA

LEGISLATIVE

PACKAGE

12.1 Legislative process at EU level
On 10 January 2017, the EC submitted a proposal for a regulation on respect for privacy and protection
personal data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58 / EC (Directive
on privacy and electronic communications) in order to ensure consistency with the common approach
to protect personal data throughout the EU. The draft e-privacy regulation will be in relation to the Regulation
lex specialis. For this reason, the Office is co-responsible in the legislative process of adopting the proposal
e-privacy regulations at European level. The aim of the draft e-privacy regulation is to ensure
strict privacy rules for users of electronic communications services
and a level playing field for all market participants. Electronic communications data
understands their content, such as the content of private messages, but also metadata, which includes e.g.
numbers called, websites visited, geographical location, time of the call or
news.
The European Parliament adopted its opinion on the draft e-privacy regulation on 26 October 2017.
At the same time, negotiations took place between the representatives of the individual states in the Council of the EU, which, however, did not
did not reach a joint agreement on the text during the period under review. Croatian and German Presidencies
At the end of their term in 2020, the EU Councils presented a progress report. This
the report points to the efforts of both countries to offer solutions to problematic issues in the proposal
e-privacy regulations. This is, for example, the creation of new reasons for which it will be possible to process
electronic communications data such as legitimate interests or other compatible
processing of this data. The draft e-privacy regulation remains the subject of ongoing negotiations
on EU soil with a view to reaching an agreement on its text as soon as possible.
On 10 September 2020, the EC submitted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council

child abuse online. The reason for the proposed regulation was the entry into force
European Electronic Communications Code, which introduces, among other things, a new definition
electronic communications services, which also includes service providers without a number
(applicable from 21 December 2020). The provisions of the e-privacy directive will take effect on this date
also apply to providers of interpersonal communication services independent of
numbering, making it difficult / impossible for them to continue using technology for combat purposes
against child sexual abuse online. At the end of October 2020, the EU Council approved a mandate for

14 ASSESSMENT OF THE PROTECTION STATUS
IN THE MONITORED PERIOD

PERSONAL

DATA

2020 was a year that probably none of us were ready for and did not expect that in that period
will affect several fundamental human rights to the extent that this has happened as a result
the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic and the efforts of the competent authorities to stop it, or
minimal slowdown in its spread. It was a year in which the pandemic affected not only human health but
was also reflected in the legislative activity of the state. Especially in terms of trying to prevent its spread
personal data were processed on a massive scale and this processing also became the subject
general debate and the focus of the public, as so massively and so often on the physical
persons have not processed health data in the history of the independent Slovak Republic even once.
Also, abbreviated legislative procedures have in some cases led to swift but fundamental ones
amendments to laws, the subject of which was also the regulation of personal data processing, where without
the previous interdepartmental comment procedure did not have an office or other institutions
dedicated to the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms
comments to correct the proposed changes, which in a context is sometimes quite radical
interference with the provisions of certain laws has led to such changes with which the Office within the meaning
its scope is not always identified.
The year 2020 can be characterized, especially from the outside, as a year when the office figuratively
in other words, he stood on one side of the barricade and other state authorities on the other, among them were
legal norms, provisions, decrees, which by their obligations also apply to processing
personal data aroused the passions of the public and the office was repeatedly overwhelmed several times a year
these legal norms and the obligations arising from them. It was necessary
respond to questions from the public, both lay and professional, about the legality of the provisions
and how they are to be met in practice, or not at all. This hectic period was so challenging for
the public, as well as for the staff of the Office, who sometimes dealt with all their might
their agenda and the growing outrage of the public seeking a response, with the Office
within its material competence, it could provide only some. Also based on this experience
there is a need to learn from them in the future and to try to make legislation, in particular
in this difficult period, a collegial work, not an individual creation, which after a short time
application practice inevitably leads to subsequent amendments. Office, though in terms of
The staffing is undersized and has professionals who are willing and able to participate
their knowledge of law-making.
The processing and protection of personal data reached a completely new level in 2020 as a result of the pandemic
dimension created by the transition of work and private life to the online environment.
Over the last year, huge changes have taken place in this direction, and many people are influencing their own
"Online" life to the extent that their personal data is subject to need and interest.
Only in the last year have many recognized the need to protect and inform about the processing
personal data much more attention, as personal data are not just the subject of trafficking
and interest, but the online environment as a whole is also attacked in terms of security. Also based on
continuing distance education of pupils and students are also their learning outcomes, their
personal data much more vulnerable. All these newly created aspects of life were highly perceived by the office
also in its work in 2020. Only the questions of the public were so wide-ranging that they responded
it required them to know and describe many times the knowledge and connections between several laws,
to which they concerned.
In conclusion, the year 2020 can be evaluated as a year when the protection of personal data, their processing
have come to the fore at some point, whether in terms of newly adopted legislation, or
51

obligations imposed by this legislation and their implementation in practice has been linked
with personal data.
2020 can be seen as a year that has not only affected our lives, but also changed our perspective
society on personal data and the need to protect them, as in spite of all the
measures and responsibilities are also needed to protect the highest value of life
protect other fundamental rights and freedoms and not diminish their value and importance.
