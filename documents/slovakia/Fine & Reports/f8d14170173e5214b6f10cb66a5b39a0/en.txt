The protection of personal data has been carried out since 25 May 2018 in accordance with the Regulation and the law, which
directly determine to the Office all its rights, obligations and competences. Despite the undisputed
the importance of the Office 's work, which depends on the importance and value of personal data, such as
sources of information on natural persons, the number of staff of the Office does not change significantly.
The current number of staff of the Office is not sufficient in the context of the agenda set by the Office
which has an ever-increasing trend in terms of the volume of work that falls on one
employee. For the proper functioning of the office and also with regard to human possibilities and effort
For high quality staffing, it is essential that the number of employees be significant
increased. This will ensure a redistribution of work and the possibility of higher specialization of individuals
employees, as many now perform cumulative activities, each of which they
requires full concentration and attention.
The Office currently has a limit of 51 employees, and notifies the need each year
increase in their number, ie increase the said limit of the maximum number of employees
at least 25. The Office's agenda is also disproportionate in the context of the obligations arising from the Regulation
has risen and is still rising. On average, there are about 110 files (cases) per employee
equipment. The current situation is unsustainable in the long run and there is a shortage of skilled people
employees is necessarily reflected in the quality of work, or sometimes it results in
impossibility of meeting procedural deadlines. To fulfill the strategic direction of the Office 's activities
it is essential that the number of staff be increased so that they complete and participate on an ongoing basis
necessary educational activities, they expanded their knowledge and were thus able in addition to professional
growth should also reflect the requirement to digitize public and state administration.
The Office also needs to be strengthened by information technology experts, as more and more
processing activities takes place in electronic form and it is necessary that, as part of the
as well as inspections, the Office was able to comment at expert level on the findings
on the information technologies used by operators and intermediaries.
The Office also feels the lack of staff dedicated to legislation, both in its area
as well as its comments, as this is often a lengthy process of examining the proposal
legislation that requires high attention and concentration and is essential to have
employee enough time and knowledge for such work, not only theoretical but also
practical. The undersized personnel side of the Office is also reflected in the fact that the Office does
time cannot think at all of setting up detached workplaces, which would be closer to
to the persons concerned, operators and intermediaries across. Undersizing the number
11

employees also has the effect that it is not possible to develop the necessary specialization by creating
new unions, which would take over from existing ones and subsequently develop some agendas to
expert level. The very limited possibility of educating the current ones also seems to be problematic
employees and the inability to obtain and maintain long-term pay conditions
specialists, as a result of which the Office is not in an equal position vis-à-vis
operators and their capabilities, which is ultimately always to the detriment of the person concerned
persons. The application practice of the Office implies an acute need for at least two detached persons
workplaces, one in central and one in eastern Slovakia. The reason for the need
of these workplaces is that the employees of the office are closer to the persons concerned also in these areas
Slovakia and also the fact that this would make the performance of controls more efficient and significantly reduced
the Office's staff travel costs from Bratislava and the Office would also contribute to the increase
employment in these regions, where there are still a sufficient number of qualified people to work
they cannot or do not want to move to the west of Slovakia or directly to Bratislava.

2.3 The Office 's budget
The Office is a budgetary organization that is tied to the state with its revenues and expenditures
budget through the chapter General Treasury Administration, which is administered by the Ministry
of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The budget for 2019 was originally approved for the Office in the amount of EUR 1,442,263.00, which was
increased by valorisation in May 2019 to the amount of EUR 1,561,419.00 and in September 2019 was

or a European political foundation in the context of the European elections, so the decision

LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

3.1 Interdepartmental comment procedures of generally binding legal regulations
The Office is a body with nationwide competence supervising personal data protection
and involved in the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data
natural persons. The Office fulfills its role in supervising the processing of personal data, etc.
by supervising and commenting on the texts of draft laws and other generally binding ones
legislation (legislative materials) as well as non-legislative texts
(vision, strategies, etc.). It formulates its comments on the proposals through the Portal within the
MPK. The purpose of the Office's comments is, in particular, to ensure the quality of the legislation as far as it is concerned
on the regulation of personal data processing was high, so that the subsequently adopted legal regulation was
accurate, unambiguous, both in relation to the operator and in relation to the person concerned,
whose personal data will in practice be subject to processing.
During the period under review, the Office submitted comments on 19 of the submitted materials. Together
He submitted 78 comments, 51 of which were substantial.
With his comments, he asked, for example, to modify the list or the scope of processing
personal data in relation to the purpose of processing, the Office has also often fundamentally requested
draft responsibilities for processing have been clarified and clarified in the draft legislation
personal data in the processing of the entities involved. Specific wording applied
The Office's comments can be found on the Portal using the filter institutions that comment
and using a comment filter (whether it is an organization comment marked as essential,
or ordinary).

3.2 Methodological guidelines
The Office methodically guides operators and intermediaries in the processing of personal data
data, raises public awareness of the risks and rights associated with the processing of personal data
data and also raises the awareness of controllers and intermediaries about their obligations.
Proven form of operator and intermediary guidance and information
based on the practice of the Office, the methodological guidelines of the Office have become public, especially of the persons concerned
and short ad hoc methodologies published on the Office's website. The Office published within it
The methodology addresses issues and issues that are of the greatest interest at the time
public.
Of course, the Office also monitors developments in the field of personal data protection in the case of judgments, whether or not

publishes decisions affecting the protection and processing of personal data on its website
Legislation and case law and informs about important decisions in a short form
news directly in the news on its website. It was significant in the observed period
Judgment on the storage of cookies by Internet users.
The subject of publication and indirectly also the subject of education of interested subjects is also
the publication of information and guidelines issued by the EDPS and the EDPB on the Office 's website, which
attention must also be paid.

COMMUNICATION OF THE OFFICE WITH THE PUBLIC

4.1 Opinions of the Office on the issues of natural and legal persons
The issue of personal data protection does not only concern operators or intermediaries,
who have an obligation to apply personal data protection legislation in practice. It also affects
people, persons affected, having issues arising from everyday life situations related to them
personal data and their processing.
The Office's operators and intermediaries most often address questions of a professional nature
related to their obligations arising from the Regulation and the law, or special laws
governing processing operations.
Compared to the last Report on the state of personal data protection, there is a relatively sharp decline in issues
by law firms; We attribute this decline to the time it has been
The regulation and the law apply and also the relatively vigorous but necessary approach of the Office when
after negative experiences, he made it clear that it was not possible to expect him to work out the whole
case studies for the processing of personal data provided by many law firms
they sent. The Office welcomes this changed position of law firms and is, of course, ready for them
to comment, but on specific issues, not on the case as a whole.
In the monitored period of 2019, the Office was already consulting the telephone by the allotted time
did not provide, as this activity was very burdensome and within the activities carried out
in the context of the Regulation, the number of other activities that needed to be covered has increased. Despite of
Due to the great popularity of telephone consultations with the public, these were not possible during the period under review
renewed despite considerable efforts, as these consultations relieved the Office of otherwise sent
questions to the public in writing or electronically. In the event of an increase in the number of employees
it is possible that the office would restore this very popular form of communication, at the present time
However, this is not feasible.
Regarding written and e-mailed questions to the public during the period under review
the staff of the office handled up to 800 questions.

4.2 Communication of the Office with the media
Over the period under review, media interest in privacy has decreased slightly, as has been the case
There was no longer a regulation or a law introducing new rules in the area of personal data protection
completely new and gradually used by both operators and intermediaries.
In the period under review, the Office provided a total of 50 statements for the media (print, radio and television)
together). The issues raised by the media were specific issues and "cases" in which there were
subject to the processing or protection of personal data, or questions from journalists
aimed at specifying the rights of the persons concerned, how to exercise them correctly and all that
possible as a person concerned to claim from the operator. Especially in late May and early June
media interest focused on summarizing the first year of application of the Regulation and the law in practice
and the Office’s experience this year.

4.3 Office website and its traffic
The Office's website meets the conditions and technical criteria in accordance with the Decree of the Ministry of Finance
SR on standards for public administration information systems, reflects on the new legislation
in the field of personal data protection, and is gradually supplemented by new functionalities and up-to-date
forms, methodologies and guidelines. The Office also bases its appearance on and the division of its website
16

and tries to make the website more transparent as user-friendly as possible. In the rest
During the period under review, the Office sought in particular to improve the English version so that the persons concerned were aware
obtain information even if they do not speak Slovak and also in the context of the Office and the Slovak
Republic have been the subject of a Schengen evaluation in terms of personal data protection when
The evaluators were also interested in accessing and providing information in English.
The Office 's website was searched 416 903 times during the period under review, namely
most often through websites and browsers google.sk, google.com, bing.com,
facebook.com.

4.4 The Office's website and reporting privacy breaches through a designated
form (reporting data breach)
The Office's website is a key source of information related to personal data protection.
At the same time, it is also a basic service according to Act no. 69/2018 Coll. on cyber security
and amending certain laws. Operators and intermediaries must ensure
the continued credibility, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
and to assess at regular intervals the effectiveness of the technical and organizational arrangements in place
measures. Nevertheless, it may occur (whether due to intentional action, negligence, error or
natural disaster) to a personal data breach which, as a result, may
mean accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or
disclosure of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. Operator
has an obligation under Art. 33 Regulations or, pursuant to Section 40 of the Act, to report a breach of protection
personal data breaches of the Office. He can do so in several ways, one
one of them is possible to use the designated form to fulfill this obligation.
During the period under review, 70 personal data breaches were reported to the Office. Reporting
is an obligation for the operators, not for the persons concerned. In cases where the violation
data protection authorities have been reported by the data subjects, who have also often reported that they have reported a breach
because the operator stated that he would not report it because there was no incident
evaluated as such, which must be reported to the Office. We would also like to appeal this way
operators to fulfill their obligations themselves, as if the Office finds that they have occurred
to a personal data breach that has not been reported to the Office and should have been, it may be
considered by the Office to be an aggravating circumstance in any personal data protection proceedings.
The most frequent breach of personal data protection in the period under review was erroneous
service of a document on a person other than the one who was supposed to be (sometimes a single case, sometimes
several at once), loss of documentation containing personal data, cyber attack on
operator and theft of materials containing personal data. The most statistically most common
personal data breaches are reported by bank operators
and insurance, health services, energy industry, tourism follow
state institutions, cities, schools and school facilities.

in not providing any, inaccurate or incomplete information to the persons concerned
and failure to prove compliance with the conditions of lawfulness of the processing of personal data. Doubts
At the same time, the persons inspected were identified in relation to the retention of videos for a period of
longer than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose of the processing, as well as in the relationship
to the disproportionate size of the monitored area, thus violating the related principles
processing of personal data (in particular the principle of data minimization and the principle of minimization
storage). Identified violations of the obligations of controllers in the processing of personal data
were reflected in the inspection reports.

7.3. CONCLUSIONS ON THE OFFICE 'S CONTROL ACTIVITIES
In general, the results of the controls carried out during the period under review show an effort
operators to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Regulation and the law, but at the same time they are
long-term identified categories of operators that need to be given increased
attention for objective reasons (large scale of personal data processing, sensitivity
personal data processed, and the like) as well as subjective ones (especially intentional or
negligent prioritization of one's own interests over the rules of personal processing
data).
The supervisory activity of the office, whose basic mission is undoubtedly also preventive action
for the protection of personal data processed by controllers and their intermediaries, is already
long-term desirable to support other forms of activities of the Office, which are directly proportional to its financial,
material and personnel situation, which currently does not allow for implementation and permanent application
sophisticated (especially in the field of information technology) or otherwise demanding
the Office's procedures aimed at protecting the personal data of the persons concerned, ie all of us.
However, the basic precondition for achieving compliance with the requirements of the Regulation and the law is also
general identification with the intention formalized by this legislation.

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION PROCEDURE

The purpose of personal data protection proceedings is to determine whether the rights of natural persons have been violated during
processing of their personal data or the provisions of the Regulation or the law have been violated.
In the event of deficiencies being identified, if justified and expedient, impose remedial action, if any
fine. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Code apply to personal data protection proceedings.
If the competence of the Office to act and the decision in the case is not given, the Office is obliged to file it
forward to the competent administrative authority.
In the period under review, the Office forwarded a total of 14 submissions to another, competent administrative
authority for action and decision.
Personal data protection legislation requires the Office to make the submission exhaustive
postponed in certain cases. The most common reason for the postponement was the unfounded submission,
when it was already clear from the evidence submitted by the person concerned that the law had been infringed
regulations in the field of personal data protection.
In accordance with the law, there must be a filing if one of the grounds for postponing the filing occurs
deferred obligatory.
In the monitored period, a total of 138 submissions were postponed, of which
• 94 were postponed because the proposal was manifestly unfounded,
• 6 because the case to which the application related was heard by a court or a criminal body
proceedings,
• 33 because the petitioner did not provide the Office with the necessary cooperation at his request,
• 5 due to the fact that more than three have elapsed since the event to which the proposal relates on the day of its delivery
years.
The Office, in the framework of supervisory activities, conducts proceedings on the protection of personal data in order to protect rights
individuals against unauthorized interference with their private life in the processing of them
personal data, while also examining compliance with the obligations laid down in the Regulation
and the law. If it finds that the rights of the data subject have been infringed or that there have been no processing obligations
personal data, by decision, if justified and expedient, impose on the controller or
the intermediary to take measures to remedy the deficiencies and causes within a specified period
or, depending in particular on the gravity of the infringement found, impose a fine.
Otherwise, it will stop the personal data protection proceedings.
The privacy proceedings are under way
• at the request of the applicant,
• or on the Office's own initiative.
The Office shall initiate proceedings on its own initiative
• on the basis of an initiative,
• on the basis of the results of an inspection which identified deficiencies or
• on the basis of the Office's own-activity finding of a suspected infringement
in the field of personal data protection, such as proceedings brought without a proposal.

30

In the monitored period, the Office initiated a total of 71 administrative proceedings, of which
• 43 were launched at the request of the data subject,
• 13 started on the initiative,
• 8 started based on the results of the inspection, which identified deficiencies a
• 7 proceedings were conducted by the Office on its own initiative on the basis of a suspected breach of the law
regulations in the field of personal data protection.

Decision of the Office, as the administrative body at first instance in personal data protection proceedings,
it is based on a reliably ascertained state of affairs. For this purpose, the Office is in proceedings for the protection of personal data
authorized to request the co-operation of anyone, and the Office requested it during the period under review
for cooperation a total of 381 times. In personal data protection proceedings, there have been two cases where
the entity from which the co-operation was requested did not respond to it and the Office even after being called upon to comply
did not cooperate (in these cases proceedings were initiated against the entities
on a fine or a disciplinary fine).
In connection with raising awareness of personal data protection among the public, the cases, resp.
the results of the proceedings were often also of interest to the media. The Institute of Legal Representation was evaluated
used in a significant number of cases, with the exception of cases where all
the parties were represented by lawyers.
The most common subject of personal data protection proceedings was examination or processing
personal data of the data subjects were violated by cameras
regulations in the field of personal data protection.
One of the most common violations was the processing of personal data in breach of the principle of non-discrimination
legality when personal data was processed without a legal basis, resp.
contrary to the legal basis and processing contrary to the principles of integrity and confidentiality, which
related to the failure to take appropriate security measures.
In the proceedings on personal data protection, several pieces of evidence were used in the evaluated period
the means by which the true state of affairs can be ascertained and, for that purpose,
in more complicated matters, the inspection was used directly by the operator or
intermediary. Inspection has proven to be an effective means of establishing the true
and complete condition, especially when inspecting the cameras at a location where it has made it possible to reliably determine the method
and individual aspects of monitoring and, on that basis, to assess the invasion of privacy accordingly
monitored persons. In order to find out the real state of affairs, there is also a relatively high number
requests for co-operation, through which they were provided in the file materials in particular
documentary evidence. The persons concerned submitted mostly precise proposals containing all of them
required, with only a minimal need to call for removal
deficiencies in administration.
Personal data protection proceedings, as a type of administrative procedure, are characterized by sensitivity
the issue of respect for and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms
in the field of personal data.
31

The personal data protection procedure is a non-public procedure, which involves several
peculiarities that complement, resp. extend the legal regulation of Act no. 71/1967 Coll., Or where
it is necessary to exclude the application of Act no. 71/1967 Coll. These specifics are important in terms of
correct application of personal data protection, the Office in the first instance proceedings
take them into account where appropriate and necessary. Such a special institute in the proceedings
on personal data protection is e.g. secrecy of the identity of the petitioner in cases where
his rights and legally protected interests (as a person concerned) may have been violated, or
negative action by the operator. The secrecy of the petitioner's identity has found its way
justification and the persons concerned used it in the period under review in the interest of their protection
in proposals seeking the protection of their rights and the interests protected by law
with the exercise of their profession.
During the period under review, operators often in the course of personal protection proceedings
data before attempting a substantive decision, they tried to dispose of the findings voluntarily
shortcomings in the processing of personal data and to adopt effective safeguards
lawful processing of personal data. Remedial action taken and implemented
As a rule, the participants in the proceedings informed the Office of the identified deficiencies within the imposed deadlines.

COOPERATION AND CONSISTENCY MECHANISM

The functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not impeded
restricted or prohibited, not even for reasons related to the protection of individuals during processing
personal data, which is also reflected in the provisions of Art. 1 par. 3 Regulations. To that Regulation
responds by establishing cooperation and consistency mechanisms to ensure consistency
and a similarly high level of personal data protection in each Member State, regardless of
place of residence of the person concerned.

9.1 Cooperation mechanism
The Regulation regulates cooperation between supervisory authorities, whether the need for mutual
cooperation will arise in the framework of the investigation of a specific breach of personal data protection
data or other activities of the supervisory authority (eg addressing legal issues,
providing consultations). Given that the rules of cooperation are regulated directly
Regulation, no further specific agreements are required between Member States
for this purpose.
9.1.1 Cross-border processing
Pursuant to Art. 55 of the Regulation, each supervisory authority performs the tasks and exercises the powers published
By regulation in the territory of its State. However, the regulation also specifically regulates the procedure and jurisdiction
in proceedings for the cross-border processing of personal data. Cross-border processing makes sense
Art. 4 pt. 23 of the Regulation (a) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in context
activities of the operator's or intermediary's premises in more than one Member State
where the operator or intermediary is established in more than one Member State
state; or (b) the processing of personal data which takes place in the Union in the context of a single activity
the establishment of an operator or intermediary in the Union but which significantly affects it
or likely to significantly affect the persons concerned in more than one Member State.
The regulation governs cooperation between supervisory authorities, in particular in relation to
with the mechanism of a single contact point (so-called one-stop-shop) regulated in Art. 56 par. 1
Regulations under which the supervisory authority is the main establishment or the sole establishment
operator or intermediary authorized to act as lead supervisory authority for
cross-border processing carried out by that operator or intermediary.
According to Art. 56 par. 2 of the Regulation, each supervisory authority is competent to deal with it
complaint or possible infringement of the Regulation, if the facts concern only
establishment in its Member State or significantly affects the persons concerned only in its own Member State
Member State. In accordance with Art. 4 point 22 of the Regulation other supervisory authorities will be for this
processing in the positions of the supervisory authorities concerned, if (a) the controller; or
the intermediary is established in the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority; (b) the persons concerned
resident in the Member State of that supervisory authority are significantly affected or will be significantly affected
likely to be significantly affected by processing; or (c) the complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority
authority.
The designation of the lead supervisor and the authorities concerned is done in IMI
(Internal Market Informational System), within which
the exchange of information on specific processing takes place between the different supervisory authorities
and a specific suspicion of a breach of personal data protection, resp. if the investigation
started on the basis of a complaint from the person concerned as well as the content of that particular complaint. Exchange
information is in English.
33

During the period under review, 450 identification notifications were received by the Office in IMI
the head and the supervisory authority concerned. The Office shall, on the basis of a careful assessment of each one
assessed that it was the supervisory authority concerned in 94 cases; most often for reasons that
the processing of personal data in question significantly affects or is likely to significantly affect
will affect the affected persons residing in the territory of the Slovak Republic. It went most often
on social network operators, operators providing accommodation services, air
companies, various e-shops and online gaming rooms. In some cases, the Office was also affected because
that the operator or intermediary is established in the territory of the Slovak Republic, ie. on the
the territory of the Slovak Republic has one or more establishments. If the Office has assessed that it is
the supervisory authority concerned, identified this in IMI and followed up the case. In accordance
with Art. 60 of the Regulation, the Office had the opportunity to comment on the requests of the head, if necessary
the supervisory authority, its procedure and the results of the investigation, as well as to comment on the proposal
decisions. If the Office were the supervisory authority concerned because it was delivered to it
complaint, the Office would act as a contact point for the person concerned and would inform him or her
decision of the head of the supervisory authority.
A total of 21 submissions containing elements were received by the Office during the period under review
cross-border processing (of which 9 proposals from data subjects, 8 complaints and 4 notifications
on breaches of personal data protection, the so-called data breach). These submissions were received either from
foreign persons or directed at foreign operators, such as
also to operators established in the USA, the Netherlands or Ireland. Office within each
first examined (so-called preliminary examination of the complaint) whether the subject of the submission
meets the conditions for cross-border processing according to Art. 4 point 23 of the Regulation, resp. whether it has been met
definition according to Art. 56 par. 2 Regulations. If the subject of the application gave rise to a reasonable suspicion
from a breach of personal data protection, the Office also verified the allegations in cooperation
with the supervisory authority of the Member State in whose territory the operator had its principal or
single establishment. In two cases, the Office entered the received submissions into IMI and beyond
addressed in cooperation with the supervisory authorities, who were the chief supervisor for the given processing
authorities. These were the supervisory authorities of Ireland and the Czech Republic. The Office was designated in the period under review
the Slovenian supervisory authority as the lead supervisory authority, based on the place of its head office
operator, as the complaint from a Slovenian citizen was directed against the operator
established in the Slovak Republic.
9.1.2 Mutual assistance
The Office also cooperates with other supervisory bodies outside the one-stop-shop mechanism. This
cooperation also takes place in IMI, which allows specific requests to be sent
selected supervisory authority. However, the Office also continuously handles email or written requests
other supervisory authorities.
During the reporting period, the Office received 18 requests for cooperation from other supervisory authorities in IMI
within the meaning of Art. 61 Regulations. Three requests were received identically from the Polish and Italian supervisory authorities,
Luxembourg and Ireland submitted two requests for cooperation, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Norway submitted one application to the Authority during the period under review.
In the requests in question, the supervisory authorities sought the Office's legal opinion in particular
interpretation of the provisions of the Regulation. The requests concerned e.g. automated decision-making
including profiling in connection with the evaluation of the absence of employees in the workplace,
use of biometric signature, retention period of personal data on the basis of the authorized
interest, credit registers, legal opinion on the interpretation of Art. 77 Regulations, tasks and responsibilities
responsible person, the coherence of the Regulation and national protection rules
personal data, a representative of a controller not established in the European Union, position
34

responsible person for consultations during the preparation of the draft legislative measure, interpretation
Art. 55 par. 3 Regulations. In this way, some supervisory authorities informed the Office of the receipt
notification of a personal data breach or use this method for consultation
case before launching the one-stop-shop mechanism.
During the period under review, the Office sent 4 requests for cooperation in IMI pursuant to Art. 61
Regulations. The requests concerned information on specific cross-border cases, consultations
individual cases or the legal opinion of other supervisory authorities on interpretation
Regulations. For example, the Office asked other supervisory authorities whether they considered net processing
record from the criminal record for processing according to Art. 10 Regulations when there are records
from the criminal record necessary for the purpose of recruitment. The Office also requested other supervisory authorities
authorities on cooperation in relation to the issue of compensation between the operator
and a responsible person who has not fulfilled his tasks under the Regulation. Office on mutual
in cooperation with other supervisory authorities, it also used other forms of communication such as IMI
written and telephone communication) in which he used contacts acquired during his
activities, including contacts gained through membership of the Committee's expert groups.
9.1.3 Joint supervisory operations
Under the cooperation mechanism, pursuant to Art. 62 Regulations may also carry out joint operations
supervisory authorities in the field of joint investigations and joint actions in the field
enforcement. During the period under review, the Office did not initiate or accept a request for the implementation of such
joint operations of supervisory authorities.

9.2 Consistency mechanism
An important attribute of the Regulation is its consistent application. In order to achieve this objective,
The Regulation provides for a consistency mechanism, which can be understood as cooperation between
EEA supervisory authorities and, where appropriate, the EC.
9.2.1 EDPB opinion
The purpose of Article 64 of the Regulation is for the EDPB to issue an opinion in cases where the competent supervisory authority
the authority plans to take specific measures. To that end, the supervisory authority should notify the EDPB of its
draft decision. The Regulation regulates cases where the supervisory authority is obliged to apply to the EDPB
for an opinion (Article 64 (1) of the Regulation) and when it has the opportunity to request an opinion (Article 64 (2) of the Regulation)
Regulations). The Authority did not request an opinion from EDPB during the period under review.
9.2.2 EDPB Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution The EDPB allows for binding decisions to ensure consistency
application of the Regulation in the following cases:
• The relevant reasoned objection was raised by the supervisory authority concerned or
rejected by the lead supervisory authority (Article 60 of the Regulation);
• Disagreement with the appointment of the head of the supervisory body (Article 56 of the Regulation);
• Absence of consultation of the EDPB (Article 64 of the Regulation);
• The Authority did not follow the opinion of the EDPB (Article 64 of the Regulation).
EDPB did not resolve any dispute during the period under review.

35

9.2.3 Emergency procedure
Article 66 of the Regulation provides for an urgency procedure. In exceptional
in cases where the supervisory authority concerned considers it urgent to protect rights and freedoms
concerned, it may take interim measures having legal effect in its territory. Validity
these measures may not exceed three months. In this case, the supervisory authority concerned is concerned
obliged to inform the other supervisory authorities, the EDPB and the EC.
If the Authority considers that definitive action is needed urgently, it may request it
EDPB for an urgent opinion or an urgent binding decision. Each supervisory authority may
request an urgent opinion or a binding decision from the EDPB in cases where the competent authority
the supervisory authority has not taken appropriate action and there is an urgent need for action. In the evaluated
period, the Office did not apply this article.

36

10 SANCTATION
Sanctions for violations of the Regulation and the law are fines and disciplinary fines. Sanctions are in place
optional legal standards, ie. that not every detected violation has to be done automatically
result in the imposition of a sanction. The Office imposes fines and disciplinary fines depending on the circumstances
each individual case. When deciding on the imposition of a fine and determining its amount
taking into account, in particular, the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the number of persons concerned, the extent of the damage,
if any, the possible breach of personal data protection and the measures taken
to mitigate the damage suffered by the persons concerned. The Office also takes into account the previous ones
breaches of personal data protection, the degree of co-operation with the Office in rectifying breaches and mitigating them
possible adverse consequences of the breach, the category of personal data to be breached
and the way in which the Office learned of the personal data breach.

10.1 Fine
In the monitored period, the Office for violations of legal regulations in the field of personal data protection
imposed nine fines in the aggregate amount of EUR 75,300. In the monitored period, he selected the office
on fines in total EUR 94,238. The average fine was EUR 8,367. The lowest fine
in the amount of EUR 500, the Office ordered the operator for failure to cooperate. The highest fine
the Office legally imposed an amount of EUR 50,000 on the operator for breach of security
processing of personal data.

The fine, as a type of sanction, served a repressive as well as a preventive function in the period under review. At
its imposition by the Office took into account, inter alia, the status of the entity and its activities, as well as possible
the impact of the amount of the fine on its continued existence. In connection with the imposition of fines during the assessment
period1 for breaches of personal data protection legislation can be stated,
that the fines imposed did not have liquidating effects.

10.2 Ordinary fine
The disciplinary fine serves to ensure a dignified and undisturbed course of supervisory activity
office. The Office may impose a disciplinary fine on the operator or intermediary,
where appropriate, to the operator's or intermediary's representative if he obstructs the inspection or if
does not provide adequate conditions for its performance. The Office may also impose a disciplinary fine
to a person who is not an operator or intermediary for failing to provide the requested
cooperation of the Office in the performance of supervision. In the period under review, the Office imposed four disciplinary fines
in the total amount of EUR 4,000, of which one in the amount of EUR 500 for non-cooperation and the other
in the amount of EUR 3,500 in connection with the obstruction of the inspection.

The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic set the Office a binding indicator for the collection of fines for 2019 in the amount of EUR 81,778, while for the whole of 2019 the Office collected a total of EUR 119,114 in fines, ie it met the set indicator beyond.

10.3 Selected cases from the supervisory activity of the Office
10.3.1 Postponements
10.3.1.1 Ambiguity of the data subject's request
The Office assessed the petitioner's proposal that the operator had infringed his right of access
to personal data according to Art. 15 of the Regulation by notifying him at his request
did not provide the information on the processing of the personal data he requested. The Office examined the application
the petitioner and the notification from the operator to whom he handled it, on the basis of which he stated that
the request was so vague that if the information provided did not fully meet the intention
the petitioner with whom he turned to the operator, it cannot be fairly concluded that
the operator has thereby infringed certain rights of the data subject provided for in Art. 15 Regulations. Office
for the above reasons, the proposal was postponed according to § 100 par. 5 letter a) instructed the law and the petitioner,
as he has rights under Art. 15 Apply the regulations properly.
10.3.1.2 Processing a telephone number in order to contact the data subject
The Office received submissions from natural persons requesting, for example, telephone checks
numbers from which they have been contacted in order to offer or request various goods and services
check the progress of an unidentified company that contacted them by telephone without having to
knowledge of where such a company obtained their telephone number.
The Office does not have a database of telephone numbers in which the telephone user can be identified
numbers. The Office may initiate proceedings against the operator or intermediary on the basis of
duly filed application by the person concerned who i. it must also indicate the person against whom
the proposal is directed; name and surname, registered office or permanent residence and identification number, if
has been allocated. In such submissions, the Office invited the person concerned to file a petition
to initiate proceedings on personal data protection in a lawful manner with the prescribed law
essentials. The person concerned if he suspects his phone number of any company
obtained without her knowledge and uses it further, she has the right to access her personal data when
it may also request any available information upon request to the operator
about the source of obtaining his personal data and may also exercise other rights of the data subject
processing of personal data.
10.3.1.3 Disclosure of arrest data in the United States
During the period under review, the Office received a submission from the applicant stating that
a US-based operator repeatedly publishes its personal data on its website
data on his arrest in the US in 2011 along with his photograph. The applicant further stated that
in the past, he asked the operator to delete the said data, while he was also responsible for this
to pay, but information about his arrest should have been made public again.
In order to ensure that individuals are not denied the protection to which they are entitled under
Regulation claim, the Regulation should apply to the processing of personal data concerned
persons located in the Union by an operator or intermediary who:
is not established in the Union if the processing activities involve the supply of goods or services thereby
concerned, whether or not it is linked to a payment. In order to determine whether such
the operator or intermediary offers the goods or services to the persons concerned
located in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is clear that the operator or intermediary
plans to offer services to the persons concerned in one or more Member States of the Union.
While the mere availability of the website of the operator, intermediary or
38

information society service provider in the Union, email address or other contact details
data or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is located
established are not sufficient to confirm such an intention, based on factors such as use
language or currency commonly used in one or more Member States
with the possibility of ordering goods and services in a given second language or mentioning customers
or users located in the Union, it may be apparent that the operator intends
to offer goods or services to the persons concerned in the Union.
The content and nature of the operator's website showed that the data on the arrested
persons were generated from publicly available databases within the United States, by neither intention nor intent
the operator of the site in question did not offer goods or services (whether free of charge or for
money) to the persons concerned within the European Union. Office after reviewing the filing and Internet
The site operator stated that the very availability of the website in the European Union
neither the use of the language commonly used in the United States (English) was sufficient to determine
the intention to offer services to the persons concerned in the European Union, and thus the activity itself
the operator of the website, which was the collection and subsequent publication of data from the public
available US databases was not sufficient to determine the territorial scope of the Regulation.
The Office subsequently informed the applicant that in accordance with Art. 3 of the Regulation on the subject of his
submission does not apply. The Office also informed the applicant that this did not affect his right
contact the appropriate U.S. privacy authorities.
10.3.1.4 Sending harassing leaflets to the homeowners' association
During the period under review, the Office dealt with the filing of the President of the Association of Homeowners against
companies established in another Member State. The subject of her complaint was her complaint against
unsolicited letter mail from the company that sent the quotations via leaflets
for cleaning services in the mailboxes of homeowners' associations and administrators. According to the submission,
that the company contacted by e-mail not to send unsolicited to the homeowners' association
mail, while the company should have received a response to ignore their offers.
The evidence annexed to the submission showed that the company had confirmed that the tenders had been sent
to the addresses of the associations of apartment owners and housing cooperatives and subsequently the chairwoman
assured the community of owners that it would indicate in the system that the omission of its address would be next
delivery of offers and if he is not interested in their offer, he can ignore it.
The controller 's conduct showed signs of cross - border processing of personal data according to
Art. 4 pt. 23 of the Regulation, since in the present case it was an operator established in another
Member State of the European Union. The Office first examined the application (so - called preliminary examination
complaint) whether the subject of the application meets the conditions for cross-border processing according to Art. 4 pt. 23
Regulations, resp. whether the definition according to Art. 56 par. 2 of the Regulation under which it is
any supervisory authority competent to deal with a complaint or breach lodged with it
Regulations if the facts concern only an establishment in its Member State or substantially
affects the persons concerned only in its Member State. The Office shall bear the cost of the preliminary assessment
subsequently determined whether there is a reason for cross-border cooperation in the present case.
In this case, the president of the community of owners represented the community of owners
housing - a legal person, while the processing of personal data concerning legal persons,
in particular companies set up as legal persons, including name, form and contact details
legal person does not fall within the material scope of the Regulation.

39

In its preliminary assessment of the case, the Office found that there was no material scope in the present case
authority or the powers of the supervisory authority of another Member State, since the Regulation
Art. 1 par. 2 of the Regulation applies to the protection of the rights of natural persons, not to the protection of legal rights
persons - in this case the community of apartment owners, therefore the Office evaluated the complaint as obvious
unfounded, which does not constitute a ground for initiating proceedings and a complaint in accordance
with § 100 par. 5 letter a) of the Act postponed.
10.3.2 Procedures
10.3.2.1 Determining the prognosis of incapacity for work
The Office conducted personal data protection proceedings on the basis of a proposal according to which the controller
unjustifiably processed the applicant 's personal health data in that regard as his
the employer asked the attending physician for a prognosis when he expects to end the petitioner's
incapacity for work. The operator objected that it did not intend to obtain data
about the petitioner's health, but only information about his return to work due to the organization
work process. The Office stated that objectively the operator requested a professional forecast
development of the patient's state of health, which is a health claim that falls into a special category
personal data according to Art. 9 par. 1 Considered the regulations and the operator's procedure as processing
the applicant 's health data which does not meet any of the conditions for lawful processing under
Art. 6 par. 1 of the Regulation and does not fall under any exception to the prohibition on processing special categories
personal data according to Art. 9 par. 2 of the Regulation, whereby the operator violated the principle of legality
according to Art. 5 par. 1 letter (a) Regulations and prohibitions on the processing of specific categories of personal data
according to Art. 9 par. 1 of the Regulation. The Office given the circumstances of the specific case of the operator
according to Art. 58 par. 2 letter (b) of the Regulation reprimanded that the said operation of obtaining personal
infringed the provisions of Art. 5 par. 1 letter a) and Art. 9 par. 1 of the Regulation.
10.3.2.2 Publication of portraits of proposers
The Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data on the basis of a proposal, the subject of which was
unlawful disclosure of portraits of claimants by an operator on
for business purposes, it published on its website photographs of the interior in which
pictorial images of the petitioners were exhibited. The operator objected when taking pictures
The interior was also attended by one of the designers who did not take any action to make them
the images were not part of the photograph taken; office with reference to Art. 5 par. 2 and Art. 24 par. 1
The regulations stated that it is the operator's responsibility to ensure that processing
personal data in accordance with the Regulation and may not transfer its responsibility to
draftsmen. The operator also objected to the nature of the published portraits as personal
data due to their reduced quality, for which, according to the claimants, the
published photo identifiable. After examining the published portraits, the Office stated that
that these are photographs of faces that show distinct anatomical elements specific to physical identity
the individual person on the basis of which the petitioners are identifiable and their images as they were
published by the operator meet the defining characteristics of personal data according to Art. 4 par. 1
Regulations. The Office assessed the given publication of the portraits of the petitioners as a personal processing
data which does not meet any of the conditions of lawful processing under Art. 6 par. 1 of the Regulation,
whereby the operator violated the principle of legality under Art. 5 par. 1 letter a) Regulations, for which
imposed a fine on the operator due to the circumstances of the particular case.

40

14 ASSESSMENT OF THE PROTECTION STATUS
IN THE MONITORED PERIOD

PERSONAL

DATA

However, the period for which this Privacy Report is presented is
relatively short, it was very rich in the activities of the Office in all directions, so in the number of proceedings,
controls and also in the work of specific staff of the Office who participated in the preparation of methodologies
The EDPB and the active participation and representation of the Authority were directly involved in their text.
These methodologies - guidelines are very important for the correct application of the Regulation and its
sometimes they translate relatively brief text into concrete recommendations and examples as needed
look at specific articles and their practical application in practice. With regard to the guidelines
issued and in preparation by the EDPB, the Office slightly weakened its own methodological activity as it did not
it is expedient for a certain area of processing to be methodically adjusted by the Committee and the Office at the same time, which could
lead to their incompatibility.
Again, in the period under review, the Office's legislative activities admit that many
the submitted legislative materials within the MPK do not have the necessary quality in terms of
on the provision of the processing of personal data are vague and the wording needs to be clarified
in particular as regards personal data processing operations. Despite that in the monitored
period, the Office submitted comments on 19 materials, as well as the number of submitted fundamental comments
shows that when drafting legal standards in the context of personal data protection and their
the role of the Office is irreplaceable and the submitters of legislative materials still have
shortcomings in this area. However, it should be noted that year after year, the situation is gradually improving
and the Office is sometimes approached by the submitters of legislative materials to be with it
some issues and nuances of the future draft legislative material were discussed. Within
In the legislative activity of the Office, it is necessary to conclude that this is the quality of the submitted material
very important, but many times the explanatory memorandum to the material is very important, as
clarifies the intention of the submitter, which is not always obvious from the material itself.
The protection of personal data is one of the fundamental human rights and freedoms and is guaranteed by the Constitution
Of the Slovak Republic, this is not an area that should be on the fringes of the interest of both
as well as the state that is to guarantee it. There is personal data for both the private and public sectors
gradually valuable and sometimes the only source of detection and research on the basis of which
They "set the processes" of the economic and social direction of the state, but also of concrete ones
operators. Personal data is thus not only what identifies people as persons, but they are
source of forecasts for the future, it is therefore necessary that their processing and understanding is not
degraded only to the level of the source "for setting economic goals for the future", but they were
still understood as unique identifiers associated with a particular person, which is not possible without
the rules laid down for the activities for which they are needed. Their processing
and in some ways exploitation must have its own rules, it must respect their individuality
and must not slip into the "source" plane, because they are not primarily. This role in all directions
is becoming more and more noticeable to the Office, as it is also due to the increasing use of smart
technologies, personal data are only becoming part of them and their uniqueness is gradually disappearing, this one
the wrong trend needs to be stopped, as with the right cooperation of all involved
It is possible for technologies to advance and personal data be protected within them
and processed in accordance with the Regulation and the law. However, this symbiosis arises gradually, and only after
cooperation of all parties involved.
