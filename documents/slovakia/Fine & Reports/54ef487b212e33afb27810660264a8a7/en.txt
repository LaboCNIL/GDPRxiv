3 LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION
3.1 Interdepartmental comment procedures of generally binding legal regulations
The Office is a body with nationwide competence supervising the protection of personal data
data protection and involved in the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data
data of natural persons. The Office partially fulfills its role in the field of processing supervision
personal data also by supervising and commenting on the texts of draft laws and texts
other generally binding legislation governing processing
personal data of natural persons. It formulates its comments on draft legislation
through the Portal within the MPK. The purpose of the Office's comments on the legislative
The proposal is to ensure the quality of legislation regarding the processing of personal data
was high so that the legislation was precise, unambiguous, and so in the relationship
to the controller as well as in relation to the data subject whose personal data will be the subject of
processing.
During the reporting period, the Office submitted a total of 80 comments on 29
legislative proposal; of the comments submitted, 62 were substantial. Among the frequently mentioned
the Office 's comments included those by which the Office requested an amendment to the list; or
the extent of the personal data processed in relation to the purpose of the processing, the Office also frequently
demanded that the responsibilities for processing be clarified in the legislation
to the information system or register, for reasons of legal certainty as to the position
the controller and thus his responsibility for the processing and protection of personal data.
In relation to the comment proceedings from previous periods, it can be stated that
that the work of the Office makes sense in this area, as the number of
the number of key comments is reduced and the number of key comments also decreases,
which indicates a positive development in terms of the processing of personal data
national legislation. Law enforcement pay more attention to the provisions
processing of personal data, this positive trend the Office observed especially with the upcoming
the date of application of the Regulation in practice, which was 25 May 2018.

3.2 European legislative package on personal data protection
In the last report, the Office briefly stated that it had been adopted at European level
the so-called "European data protection package", which includes three legal acts:
Regulation, Directive 2016/680 and Directive (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2016/681
of 27 April 2017 on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data and records for prevention purposes,
detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offenses and serious crime.
From this package, the activities of the Office and its scope were directly affected by the Regulation and the Directive
2016/680. As the Office is not a central body of state administration, it is the body responsible for harmonization

of the Republic and co-manager of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic; the office was in the legislative
process of the prepared bill by its submitter.

The first works within the legislative process on the bill were started in July 2016 with the establishment
internal working group to ensure the fulfillment of the Office's tasks in aligning the Regulation
14

with the legal order of the Slovak Republic. The purpose of the internal working group was detailed
study of the Regulation in order to determine the final content of the draft law
and also to determine whether the draft law will follow the amendment of the law or not
prepare a new law on personal data protection. Based on the internal negotiations of individual
departments of the Office and also on the basis of guidelines on the scope of the Regulation from the Office of the Government
Of the Slovak Republic and also on the basis of the fact that the law was supposed to be in addition to the harmonization law
of the Act with the Regulation, as well as the Transposition Act for Directive 2016/680 was adopted
decision that a new bill will be prepared in the legislative process, that is, that
the law will not amend.
Subsequently, an external inter-ministerial working group was set up to prepare a bill,
the establishment of which the Office initiated with the intention of harmonizing the legal order with the Regulation
at the same time across all laws that may be affected by the regulation. With this
The invitation was sent in October 2016 to all central state bodies
reports to comment by January 2017 on whether the legislation they have in
have identified the provisions that need to be amended following the Regulation
and thus to be listed as amending articles in the draft law within its legislative process.
The results of the meeting of the members of the external working group led to the fact that of all
most of the institutions contacted stated that legislation was not needed under their responsibility
with the Regulation to amend, or that the amendment will be carried out separately within the already
approved plan of legislative tasks for 2017. Entities that were interested in amending
legislation within the time limit set by the Office, the text of their amending articles
subsequently incorporated into the bill.
According to § 9 of Act no. 400/2015 Coll. on the creation of legal regulations and on the Collection of Laws
Of the Slovak Republic and on the amendment of certain laws was on the Portal on 10 January
Preliminary information published, PI / 2017/3, on the draft law, when

COMMUNICATION OF THE OFFICE WITH THE PUBLIC
4.1 Opinions of the Office on the issues of natural and legal persons
The issue of personal data protection is not limited to operators or
intermediaries who are obliged to apply personal data protection legislation
in practice, of course, this issue also affects people affected by those who have questions
resulting from everyday life situations related to their personal data. Operators
and intermediaries asked the Office of a professional nature related to their duties
resulting from the Regulation, how its specific provisions are to be applied in practice, or
whether the described and performed processing will fall within the scope of the Regulation or the law at all
no. 18/2018 Coll.
The Office also continued to contact the public through telephone consultations.
The public very much welcomed the possibility of such a consultation, and the Office was in favor
evaluated by callers as one of the few who communicates directly and in writing with the public
and helps address the agenda it has.
In the period under review, the most common issue was the incoming Regulation
and how to apply it in practice, what changes with its onset, and how operators in particular
and intermediaries should set up personal data processing and protection processes so that
they were in tune with him. Also resonating with the bill was the interest in its current state
within the legislative process and also when it will be published in the Collection of Laws of Slovakia
of the Republic.
Especially at the turn of 2017 and 2018, it had a number of questions, both written and
emails significantly rising in nature. Public interest in personality has also increased
consultation on the premises of the Office, to the extent that the Office had to undertake some
requests for personal consultations were rejected on time and staffing grounds as they were not
to be able to physically secure their equipment at the required time.

state that also the level and number of questions in one document or e-mail request
increased significantly, on average the inquiring office was addressed via a single e-mail
or a sheet of 3 to 5 questions, but with the approaching date of application of the Regulation sometimes
there were ten or more in one document or e-mail request.
The Office also conducted personal consultations, in 2017 there were a total of 103 of them, until 24 May 2018
40 were made.

4.2 Communication of the Office with the media
Since April 2016, when the text of the Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
it has also increased media interest in the protection and processing of personal data. Increased interest
Of course, it persisted in 2017 and escalated until the end of the period under review, ie
until 24 May 2018. In view of the advancing time when Regulation and Act no. 18/2018 Coll.
should have begun to exert interest in both print and electronic media initially
to the questions which called for a description of the fundamental changes and differences between the "old" and
"New" legislation. Gradually, the interest became more and more focused and concretized on the concrete
areas in which personal data are processed and how the new legislation will affect
which specific sector.
In 2017, the office answered and responded to 40 questions, a set of questions from the journalistic community.
By 24 May 2018, 31 questions had been addressed and answered by the Office.
However, media interest was no longer focused only on specific issues, but the media, newsrooms,
in some respects directly by the actors and organizers of some of the events involved
personal data processing, organized conferences in which they actively participated as well
office staff. Mention may be made of the conference organized by the weekly Trend on 25 April
2017 devoted to the issue of the Regulation, at which the Office was also represented in the panel discussion
also among presenters.
Over the period under review, media interest has also changed in part with the output from the office
demanded by the media, it was no longer just short questions on current topics, but interest also increased
media on the Office's replies in the form of complete information, which was subsequently published
in one article, sometimes confronted with a private sector expert. In particular
The print media paid wider attention to the area of personal data protection and legislation
they often devoted an extensive article to the change, or even the entire issue, or a substantial part of the issue
one or more issues of the periodical.
The interest of the media also remained focused on specific ad hoc issues that currently resonated
in society, such as how the Regulation and the new legislation will affect them in general
the field of education, especially children and their parents. Fines and theirs were a similarly resonant topic
granting to the authorities, their amount and the resulting fear of Regulation and Act no. 18/2018 Z.
from.

4.3 Privacy Day
The Day of Personal Data Protection, January 28, is the date of the signing of Convention 108, which was
signed in Strasbourg in 1981. This day was announced by the committee with the support of the EC
Council of Europe Ministers for Personal Data Protection Day.
In this context, the Office strives every year to contribute to the popularization of personal data on this day
data within the general public. The years 2017 and 2018 were no exception to this plan.
In both years, the Office followed up on the successful format of organizing an open day
doors when it is possible for the public, both lay and professional, to come to the premises of the office
and consult experts on the protection and processing of personal data,
where appropriate, so that the general public can find out how to proceed in cases which
concern the protection of personal data.

20

Both open days, both in 2017 and in 2018, were in the spirit
the incoming Regulation. The public interest, which was enormous and was, also corresponded to this
almost entirely focused on how to harmonize operators
with the forthcoming Regulation, or what all and how will change from May 2018.
In both years, the office was visited by an average of about 50 people. Due to the great interest and number
The initial consultation time had to be extended to each applicant
he was consulted and his questions were answered. Despite that both days
open doors were mentally and physically demanding, the public interest pleased us and also thanks
direct contact with the public, the Office could subsequently respond more flexibly to requests
the general public and to include in the FAQ section those that have been in the center of attention during
open days.

4.4 Office website and its traffic
The Office's website, as an electronic means of presentation, has undergone a strong graphic
adjustment on the occasion of the implementation of the Regulation into national legislation. Next
expansion of functionalities and subsequent redesign focused on easy availability of required
information for state administration and public administration bodies, but also for the general public. On the web
The registered office does not lack mandatory disclosure, but has expanded with regard to the Regulation
not only the legislative range of published materials, but also the range of questions and answers for
public.
The Office's website meets the conditions and technical criteria in accordance with the Ministry's Decree

administrative burdens and burdens on operators and intermediaries.

6.2 Special IS registration
The special registration of IS is regulated by the provisions of Sections 37 to 41 of the Act, which are also exhaustive
define the conditions under which the IS is subject to special registration. These are the cases when
the processing of the personal data of the persons concerned is more sensitive in terms of invasions of their privacy
and it is necessary to examine individually the degree of risk of infringement of the rights and freedoms of those concerned
persons. In a special registration procedure to which the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Code apply
the Office evaluates the documents necessary to assess whether the processing of personal data creates
the risk of the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned being infringed; such as scope
personal data processed, the nature of their sensitivity, the purpose of their processing, the method of their processing
the means by which personal data are to be processed,
the diversity of processing operations to be carried out on personal data,
the nature of the premises in which the personal data will be processed, the extent of the data received
security measures, location and description of technical means, by means of
24

whose personal data will be processed, the internal regulations of the controller and the documents received
(eg standard contractual clauses for cross-border transfers that have been accepted without reservations),
on the basis of which personal data will be processed. Special registration
is subject to a fee obligation under Act no. 145/1995 Coll. on administrative fees
as amended. Special registration is one of the tools for compliance
laws in the processing of personal data from the point of view of preserving human rights guaranteed
Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
The Operator is entitled to start processing personal data in the IS registered for the special
registration only after receipt of the certificate of special registration from the Office.

6.3 Cross - border transfer of personal data
Cross-border transfer of personal data is an important part of personal data processing
in the conditions of increasingly frequent cross-border cooperation associated with the necessary exchange
information, including personal data.
Within the cross-border transfer of personal data, a distinction is made between cross-border transfers
within the EU Member States or the Contracting Parties to the Agreement on the European Economic
(hereinafter referred to as "Member States") and transfers to third countries. Transfer of personal data
within the Member States is not subject to any additional criteria and is governed by
provisions of Section 32 of the Act.
6.3.1. Transfer to a country guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection
When transferring personal data to third countries, a distinction is made between the transfer of personal data
to a third country guaranteeing or not guaranteeing an adequate level of personal data protection.
The status of the country that guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection is determined by the EC
25

decision. In assessing such adequacy of personal data protection, the level is examined
local legislation, the existence of relevant legal acts, the enforceability of the law concerned
obligations of the controller as well as the principles of personal data processing. In area
institutional, the independence of the national supervisory authority, its powers and competences are examined.
As regards the status of the country, which guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection,
the adequacy of the level of protection was not approved by the EC during the evaluated period
personal data for any third country.
6.3.2. Transfer to a country that does not guarantee an adequate level of personal data protection
The cross-border transfer of personal data is a sensitive processing operation with personal data
data in which personal data are transferred outside the territory of the Slovak Republic. The law
defines a flexible cross-border transmission system, especially for transfers to third countries
allows operators to make greater use of standardized safeguards
privacy and personal data in the form of standard contractual and binding clauses
internal rules.
Standard contractual clauses can be found in the relevant EC decisions. In case of
the controller uses in the contract on the transfer of personal data to a third country without reasonable
levels of personal data protection clauses that are different from the standard
contractual clauses intended for transmission by the operator or intermediary, or
they show a clear discrepancy with them, or if he does not use any contractual clauses, he is obliged
ask the Office for consent to the transfer before starting the transfer. There was no office in the period under review
requested to give such consent to the cross-border transfer of personal data.
A very important legal institute in the transfer of personal data are the so-called binding
internal rules; their importance is growing, as for large multinational companies
represent an attractive possibility for cross-border transfers of personal data, which
removes a lot of administrative burden.
Binding internal company rules can be applied only within one company, resp. her
organizational units. A company that decides to introduce a binding in-house
the rules must commit themselves to the adoption of the rules on personal data protection
throughout the company (by all organizational units) and at the same time that it will be ensured
compliance through established supervisory mechanisms. Introduction of binding
in-house rules should create comprehensive privacy protection within
multinational company, even in connection with cross-border exchange or personal transfer
data within the company. Procedure for approving binding internal rules
supervisory authorities is set out in the opinion and recommendation WP29. In the evaluated period
In no case was the Office the main supervisory body in assessing the binding
internal rules.

7 PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING CONTROL
During the period under review, the Office checked the processing of personal data by
the supervisory authority empowered to act if at least two members were present at the same time
inspection body (including the inspector).
The Office carried out regular inspections on the basis of the inspection plan for 2017 and 2018, exceptionally
inspections were carried out by the Office in the framework of personal data protection proceedings or on the basis of
suspected breaches of personal data processing obligations laid down by law.
Regular and extraordinary inspections carried out by a written inspection body have always been carried out
focused on a specific operator or intermediary and their results were
formulated in the inspection report (if no breach of obligations has been identified
in the processing of personal data) or in the inspection report (if discrepancies have been identified
with the requirements of generally binding legislation). Results of inspections formulated
in the control protocol they initiated the initiation of personal data protection proceedings or were used
as a basis for issuing a decision in ongoing proceedings.
The focus of the inspections was on the real state of personal data processing with an emphasis
on the adequacy and practical application of the security measures taken, which has become apparent
on the time and professional complexity of the implementation of the inspections themselves.
In the area of proper controls, the Office placed particular emphasis on the basic principles of personal processing
data and information security risk management, including the possible effects of processing
personal data on the rights and legally protected interests of the persons concerned, as the setting
appropriate security measures (technical and organizational) and ensuring them
Continuous updating under the conditions of the operator or intermediary are essential
preconditions for successful minimization of security risks, resp. prevention
unwanted processing operations with personal data (for example, unauthorized disclosure
or disclosure of personal data). The security of personal data processing has resonated
also in carrying out extraordinary checks, which were generally initiated by the persons concerned
indicating insufficient security measures or processing operations
raising suspicion of a breach of the law.
The number of regular (planned) inspections performed in the evaluated period was affected
the number of exceptional checks that the Office is required to carry out ex lege as well as the number
pending checks carried over from the previous reporting period (2015-2016).
In the period under review, the Office completed 18 inspections initiated in 2016, of which 14 inspections
inspection report and 4 inspections by inspection record, and at the same time performed 20 regular
inspections, of which 12 inspection protocols and 5 records were completed by 24.05.2018
on control. In the evaluated period, the Office performed 33 extraordinary inspections, of which there were
by 24.05.2018 terminated by 6 inspection protocol and 17 inspection record.

7.1.2 Foreign bank branch
Control of a branch of a foreign bank operating in the territory of the Slovak Republic
(operator) was based on the inspection plan focused on the principles of personal processing
the existence and application of an appropriate legal basis for processing, the manner in which

according to which (each) operator was obliged to give a contractual relationship with the intermediary

30

in accordance with this Act within two years from the date of entry into force of this Act. In relationship

on its marketing activities, an error in the manner of obtaining the consent of the persons concerned
with the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes (the data subject did not have the
freely express their consent or disagreement with the processing of her personal data), as well as
error relating to the content of the contracts concluded by the operator with its
intermediaries (contracts did not contain all the requirements laid down by the Protection Act
personal data). No findings were found in relation to the other parts of the inspection
shortcomings.
7.1.5 Telecommunications Service Provider
Control of the television broadcaster, access to the Internet and public telephone
service operating in the territory of the Slovak Republic (operator) was on the basis of the plan
controls focused on the principles of personal data processing, existence and application

31

identification of the state of compliance with selected provisions of the Act on Client Clients
providing telecommunications services.
The inspection in question found an error consisting in the incompleteness and incorrectness of the data
listed in the records of the information system focused on the records of clients, error
consisting in the absence of registration of the camera system, the mistake consisting in omission
the obligation to instruct authorized persons, errors in the field of security measures,
their documentation, updates and applications, as well as errors in obtaining consent
data subjects with the processing of their personal data for marketing purposes (data subject
did not have the opportunity to freely express her consent or disagreement with the processing of her personal
data). The operator's mistake was also found in relation to the storage of personal
data after the purpose of their processing and in relation to the scope and designation of the space
accessible to the public monitored by a camera system.
7.1.6 Cities and municipalities
On the basis of a plan of inspections and random selection taking into account the nationwide scope of the Office
eight checks on the processing of personal data by the authorities were carried out during the period under review
local government (operators), of which five inspections focused on municipalities and three inspections
focused on cities.
The inspections focused on the principles of personal data processing, existence and application
appropriate legal basis for the processing of personal data, the controller's procedure
in the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject and in obtaining the consent of the data subject
persons, fulfillment of information obligation, liquidation of personal data, relations between
operators and intermediaries, the adoption of appropriate technical and organizational
measures, instructions of the authorized person, appointment of the responsible person, related obligations
exercising the rights of the data subject, as well as the obligation to register, notify or
register personal data information systems.
The purpose of these inspections was to identify the state of compliance with the law during processing
personal data by operators.
They resonated among the operators' errors identified by these inspections
especially mistakes
 in the area of adopted security measures (a total of 6 cases of violation of § 19 par. 1
Act),
 associated with the conditions of delegation of the responsible person and related obligations
operator (a total of 5 cases of violation of the provisions of Sections 23 to 25 of the Act),
 related to the conditions for monitoring premises accessible to the public (a total of 4
cases of violation of § 15 par. 7 of the Act),
 associated with the obligation to register IS that are not subject to special registration or
notification obligation (a total of 4 cases of violation of § 43 paragraph 1 of the Act),
 associated with the obligation to instruct authorized persons before carrying out the first processing
operations with personal data (a total of 4 cases of violation of § 21 paragraph 2 of the Act).
Of the results of those inspections, none of which were concluded by a finding of compliance
with the requirements of the law, there is a justified obligation of the supervisory body to focus its
attention to local authorities in the position of IS operators, by all
available methods (ie not just control activities). From the performed inspections at the same time
concludes that cities comply with legal requirements to a much greater extent,
which is undoubtedly related to the human and financial resources which (unlike municipalities)

32

have. The Office finds the situation to be alarming, but not because of the cities and towns
process the personal data of residents (data subjects) for different purposes, but because cities
and municipalities in the position of local self-government bodies (except for specific exceptions) process
personal data on the entire population of the Slovak Republic.

7.2 Extraordinary inspections
In the period under review, extraordinary inspections were carried out to a decisive extent on the basis of
at the request of the persons concerned, possibly on the basis of suggestions other than those
the persons concerned. A significant part of extraordinary inspections was (traditionally) focused
for camera systems.
7.2.1 Resocialization center
Control of the processing of personal data by a non-profit organization that as accredited
the entity provides services in the field of social protection of children and social guardianship
(resocialization center - operator), was motivated by an initiative other than the one concerned
persons, the content of which suspected a violation of several provisions of the law
when processing the personal data of the Centre's clients.
The control focused on the principles of personal data processing, existence and application
adequate legal basis for the processing of personal data, the controller's procedure
in the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject and in obtaining the consent of the data subject
persons, fulfillment of information obligations and liquidation of personal data, fulfillment of obligations
resulting from the relationship between the operator and the intermediary, the adoption of
technical and organizational measures corresponding to the way personal data are processed,
instruction of the authorized person, fulfillment of the operator's obligations related to supervision
on the protection of personal data (responsible person), as well as to verify compliance with the notification
obligations, special registration and the obligation to keep records of the information system.
In addition to the personal data of employees, the operator also processes the personal data of the data subjects
persons as clients of the Center. The clients of the resocialization center are understood as drugs
a dependent or otherwise dependent natural person or child to whom assistance is provided
usually associated with their long-term stay (eight months or more) in this center.
The client's stay in the resocialization center is based on a court decision
(interim measure or substantive decision) or in agreement with the client or his client
authorized representative (child), the conclusion of which is subject to the recommendation of an addictologist or
psychiatrist. Costs associated with the client 's stay in the resocialization center on the basis of
court decisions are borne by the state (through the Center for Labor, Social Affairs and the Family
Of the Slovak Republic), the client 's stay in the resocialization center on the basis of the agreement is
financed from contributions from the Higher Territorial Unit, as well as the client himself.
In relation to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data of the clients of the resocialization center was
found that the operator processes personal data on the basis of Act no. 305/2005 Coll., Which
sets out the purpose of the processing of personal data, the circle of data subjects and the scope of personal data
data, as a result of which it acquires the nature of a special law in the sense of § 10 par. 2 of the Act.
The inspection did not confirm any of the suspicions formulated in the complaint and was not
found or any other error of the operator. The Office (among other things) found personal data
clients processed in a magazine issued by the operator are published
in an anonymised form, as a result of which no personal data is processed

33

by publishing them. Photos of clients on the notice board in the main building of the resocialization
resorts, videos posted through YouTube, and accounts set up in
Facebook social networks are not part of any information system of the inspected person.
At the same time, the Office stated that the inspected person's procedures for acquisition and further processing
personal data correspond to the requirements of § 6 par. 2 of the Act (principles of processing
personal data) as well as that in relation to the security of personal data processing
in the information systems of the inspected person did not find a conflict with the requirements of § 19 par. 1
of the law. The inspection in question was completed by signing the inspection record.
7.2.2 Foreign bank branch
Control of a branch of a foreign bank operating in the territory of the Slovak Republic
(operator), which took place at the initiative of the data subject, was aimed at
the controller 's procedure for processing the personal data of the data subject through
contracts under which several financial services have been provided to the data subject. Touched
the person exercised his rights against the operator in writing, but was not satisfied
with content, resp. the extent of the operator's response. The person concerned in the complaint
addressed to the Office in particular that it had not provided its information to the operator
the address to which the operator has sent several documents or the telephone number
to work.
The operator processes the personal data of clients to the extent of the data specified in the contract
documentation for the purpose of establishing pre-contractual relations, the provision of consumer credit
and credit relationship management, reporting and archiving of unusual operations reports, identification
and client verifications in accordance with the Act on Protection against Money Laundering
and protection against terrorist financing, reception, handling and archiving of complaints,
protection and enforcement of the operator's rights against clients. Provided personal data of clients
are not published.
The performance of the inspection was focused on compliance with selected provisions of the law during processing
personal data of clients of a foreign bank branch with emphasis on communication between
the controller and the data subject, as well as the processing procedure of the controller
personal data of the data subject in relation to the contracts concluded with the controller since
2010, on the basis of which the person concerned was granted loans, a credit card,
installment sales, and the like. The Office requested complete documentation from the operator
concerning all the contractual relations of the person concerned with the operator and subsequently
entered the personal data information systems in which the controller processed
personal data of clients. The Office focused on credibly proving the source of obtaining personal
data (correspondence address other than permanent residence address, employment telephone number
and the name of the employer) and the lawfulness of their processing.
The inspection did not confirm any of the suspicions formulated in the complaint and was not
found or any other error of the operator. By looking at the client folder
the person concerned was found to have the person concerned in the questionnaire which was part of the contract
on consumer credit, itself provided details concerning the employer (including the telephone number)
employment numbers). By verifying the stored communication records of the call center employee
with the data subject, it was found at the same time that the data subject could prove himself / herself by telephone
asked the operator to change the correspondence address, while the address of permanent residence
remained unchanged. The inspection in question was completed by signing the inspection record.

7.2.3 Camera systems
Monitoring of areas accessible to the public by camera systems is generally
considered a highly effective way of protecting health, property and crime prevention.
Related proposals and incentives for monitoring system operators
they also have a significant effect on the focus of the Office's control activities. In the evaluated
During this period, the Office checked the compliance of the processing of personal data with the principles of personal processing
data with an emphasis on compliance with the basic obligations of the controller and the existence
appropriate legal basis, the adoption of adequate security (technical
and organizational) measures corresponding to the way personal data are processed, compliance
the obligation to instruct the entitled person, the fulfillment of the obligation to entrust the responsible person, as well as
fulfillment of the obligation to notify, the obligation of special registration and the obligation to keep records
IS.
In the evaluated period, the Office performed and completed 16 extraordinary inspections focused on
for processing personal data through a camera system. Of the total number
6 inspections were carried out on operators who are legal entities or
self-employed persons and 10 checks on operators who are natural
persons.
In carrying out these inspections, the Office placed emphasis on the adequacy of the scope monitored
space, resp. the risk of undue interference with the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, as well as
on the legal basis and security of personal data processing. Of the total number performed
In the evaluated period, there were 11 inspections completed by the inspection record (of which 8
control records were based on the fact that monitoring is not subject to the regime
of the Act) and 5 inspections were completed by the inspection protocol.
Operators whose inspection was completed by the inspection record duly complied with
notification or registration obligation and have duly informed authorized persons.
The monitoring itself was approached by all operators in accordance with the principle
proportionality, as they monitored the area only to the extent necessary to
achieving the purpose of processing. The monitored area was in all cases marked as
to inform the persons concerned of the monitoring before entering the monitored area.
The Office found a breach of the operator's obligations under the law in five cases.
The breach of the operator 's legal obligations consisted in particular in the fact that
operators monitored an area inaccessible to the public without a legal basis,
monitor the area accessible to the public to the extent that it was not necessary to achieve
for the purpose of processing, records made by monitoring the area accessible to the public
kept for more than 15 days, did not clearly mark the monitored area, did not have properly instructed
authorized persons and did not fulfill the obligation to register the IS. In relation to security processing office
in two cases, found that the operator had not adopted adequate technical and organizational
measures, and in two other cases found that the operators in their
conditions, they have taken security measures in accordance with the requirements of the law, but
the documentation proceeded in violation of the provisions of Decree no. 164/2013 Coll., In particular
in the information system security analysis section.
Based on the identified violations of the law, it is necessary to continue to pay increased attention
operators who process personal data by monitoring the accessible area
public, including with regard to the fulfillment of the information obligation.

35

7.3 Conclusions arising from the Office's control activities
In general, from the results of regular and extraordinary inspections performed in the evaluated
period, the obvious efforts of operators to ensure compliance with the provisions of the law, at the same time are
however, some categories of operators also need to be addressed
increased attention in the coming period. The control activity of the Office, the basic
the mission is to act preventively on the protection of personal data processed
IS operators, it is therefore desirable to support the Office's other activities at this time,
mainly due to a fundamental change in the legal regulation of the conditions of processing represented
Regulation and Act no. 18/2018 Coll., Which apply in the territory of the Slovak Republic
from 25.05.2018. The basic precondition for compliance with the requirements of the Regulation
and Act no. 18/2018 Coll. is a general identification with the intent of this legislation
formalize.

8 PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION PROCEDURE
The purpose of personal data protection proceedings is to determine whether the conduct of the controller or
the rights of natural persons in the processing of their personal data have been violated by the intermediary
and, if deficiencies are identified, impose remedial action. For personal protection proceedings
data, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Code shall apply. Substantive decision in protection proceedings
personal data is usually the basis for fine proceedings, which is a separate administrative
proceedings.
If there is no competence of the Office to act and decide the case, most often because
the case in question does not fall within the scope of the law, the Office is obliged to forward the application
competent administrative authority. In 2017, the Office forwarded 8 submissions to the relevant court
administrative authority for action and decision. In 2018, a total of 3 submissions were submitted.
The Office may, in the exhaustively determined cases referred to in the third chapter of Part Three of the Act
postpone the proposal or initiative. The most common case of postponement is its unfoundedness when
it is already clear from the evidence provided, in particular by the person concerned, that there has been no breach of the law.
In 2017, the Office postponed 213 submissions and in 2018 141 submissions were postponed.
The Office, in the framework of supervisory activities, conducts proceedings on the protection of personal data with the aim of protection
the rights of natural persons against unauthorized interference with their private life during processing
their personal data, while also examining compliance with legal obligations.
If it finds a violation of the rights of the data subject or a breach of personal processing obligations
by a decision, if justified and expedient, impose on the controller or
the intermediary to take remedial action within a specified period
and the causes of their occurrence. Otherwise, it will stop the personal data protection proceedings. Proceedings
on the protection of personal data begins on the proposal of the petitioner or on the Office's own initiative.
Proceedings on the Office's own initiative are initiated on the basis of an initiative pursuant to § 63 para. 5 of the Act,
on the basis of the results of the inspection according to § 60 par. 2 in connection with § 63 par. 7 of the law, which they were
identified deficiencies or on the basis of the Office's own finding of a suspected infringement
of the law, as proceedings instituted without a petition.
In the monitored period of 2017 and 2018, the Office initiated 230 administrative proceedings, of which 96 were
initiated at the request of the person concerned, 50 initiated on the basis of an initiative, 26 initiated on the basis of
the results of the inspection, which identified deficiencies and 58 proceedings were conducted by the Office on its own initiative
on suspicion of a breach of the law.
In 2017, the Office initiated administrative proceedings on the basis of a proposal in 59 cases, on the basis of a complaint
in 42 cases, based on the results of inspections in 10 cases and on its own initiative in 20
cases.
In 2018, the Office initiated administrative proceedings on the basis of a motion in 37 cases, on the basis of an initiative

Decision of the Office as the administrative body at first instance in personal protection proceedings
data is based on a reliable state of affairs. For this purpose, the Office is in proceedings for protection
personal data is entitled to request the cooperation of anyone, while in the evaluated
Between 2017 and 2018, the Office requested cooperation a total of 1,055 times. In protection proceedings
personal data, there were five cases where the entity from which the co - operation was requested
did not react to it and the Office even after the call to fulfill its obligations under § 74 par. 1 of the Act
co - operation was not provided (in the given cases proceedings were initiated against the subjects
on fines).
The Institute of Legal Representation was used in a significant number of cases during the period under review,
except that all parties to the proceedings were represented by legal persons
representatives. The most common subject of personal data protection proceedings was the review
or by processing the personal data of the data subjects in the IS, which included the cameras,
there was a violation of the provisions of the law. One of the most common violations of the law was
processing of personal data without a legal basis, resp. contrary to law
unauthorized disclosure of a universally applicable identifier (birth number)
provided for by a special law, insufficient security of personal data processing.

8.1 Knowledge of personal data protection based on personal data protection proceedings
In the proceedings on personal data protection, several pieces of evidence were used in the evaluated period
the means by which the true state of affairs can be ascertained and, for that purpose,
more complicated matters, in addition to the consideration, used the possibility of performing extraordinary
controls directly at the operator or intermediary. The inspection proved to be
an effective means of ascertaining the true situation, in particular when checking camera IS on
where it has made it possible to determine reliably the method and individual aspects of monitoring and on the basis of
assess the intrusion of the monitored persons. In order to find out the real state of affairs
there is also a relatively high number of requests for cooperation through which they were made
secured in the file materials, especially documentary evidence. The persons concerned served
mostly precise proposals containing all the requisites required by law, while only
to a minimum, they had to be called upon to remedy the shortcomings of the administration. Len
sporadically, the petitioner did not complete his motion to initiate proceedings after the summons.
Personal data protection proceedings, as a type of administrative procedure, are characterized by sensitivity
the issue under consideration, which concerns the observance and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms
in the field of personal data processing. The personal data protection proceedings are not public
proceedings, which includes several peculiarities that complement, resp. extend the legislation
Act no. 71/1967 Coll., Or where necessary exclude the application of Act no. 71/1967
Zb. These specificities are important for the correct application of personal data protection,
the Office in the first instance proceedings where appropriate and necessary,
taken into account. Such a special institute in personal data protection proceedings is e.g.

38

secrecy of the petitioner's identity in cases where his rights could be violated
and legally protected interests (as the person concerned), or negative action by
operator. The secrecy of the petitioner's identity found its justification and the persons concerned
in the interest of their protection, they used it in the evaluated period, for example, in proposals by which
sought the protection of their rights and the interests protected by law in the exercise of their rights
jobs.
During the period under review, operators often in the course of personal protection proceedings
data before attempting a substantive decision, they tried to dispose of the findings voluntarily
shortcomings in the processing of personal data, as well as to adopt effective safeguards
lawful processing of the personal data of the persons concerned. About received and executed
measures to remedy the deficiencies found by the parties to the Office within the prescribed time limits
as a general rule, there was no reason to initiate proceedings for a disciplinary fine on the grounds of
negligence.

39

9 PENALTIES FOR BREACH OF THE LAW
Sanctions for violations of the law are fines and disciplinary fines. Sanctions are adjusted in the fourth
the title of Part Three of the Act.

9.1 Penalties
The procedure for imposing a fine, as a separate administrative procedure, is conducted by the Office on the basis of a finding

9.3 Selected cases from the supervisory activities of the Office
9.3.1 Postponements
9.3.1.1 Disposal of personal data of the data subject
In 2017, the Office received a proposal from the person concerned against the operator,
who was to violate the provisions of the law by processing the personal data of the data subject
in connection with the conclusion of the injunction, did not liquidate without undue delay, but imposed
to the archive.
According to the provisions of § 17 par. 1 of the Act, the operator is obliged to fulfill the purpose of processing
ensure the destruction of personal data without undue delay. Paragraph 1 according to § 17 par. 2
law does not apply if personal data are part of the registration record. In that case
the operator ensures the liquidation of the registration record according to a special regulation.
After examining the documents and evidence gathered in the examination of the case in question, the Office found that
that the operator has entered into an injunction with the person concerned pursuant to Section 724 et seq. of the law
no. 40/1964 Coll. The Civil Code, as amended, the subject of which was
taking the necessary steps to enforce the data subject's claims for compensation
damage resulting from the loss event. The operator thus disposes of personal data
the person concerned processed for that purpose in accordance with a special regulation. Office at
postponed the motion to initiate proceedings on the basis of the findings.
9.3.1.2 Disclosure of personal data in the notice of the place where the document is filed
In the first half of 2018, the Office received the submission of the person concerned, who found out through
Google's Internet search engine that gives her personal information in the range of first name, last name, year
birth, permanent residence are publicly available on the Internet in the published city name
about the place where the document is stored, where he can pick up the addressed document in person.
By monitoring the internet links found, the office found that the document in question
The notice of the place of storage of the document was published by the city on its official website
page in the official notice board section and it was a notice to be posted for the 15th
days. The data published in the notification were assessed as personal physical data
persons in accordance with the provisions of § 4 par. 1 of the Act. The Office evaluated the submission of a natural person as
proposal to initiate proceedings on personal data protection against the city as an operator.

41

In relation to the subject matter of the proposal, the city was obliged to have a legal basis
disclosure of personal data, respect the principles of personal data processing,
especially after the end of the purpose of disclosure of personal data to destroy them.
In order to assess the matter in question, the Office called on the city to cooperate. From the city's answer
it was established and it was also proved that the city was requested by the bailiff to provide it
cooperation in accordance with a special law, which is Act no. 233/1995 Coll. on bailiffs
and Execution Activities (Execution Rules) and on Amendments to Certain Acts (hereinafter referred to as the Execution Rules)
"Enforcement Act"), which regulates the obligation of third parties to cooperate with the courts
to the executor to the extent necessary. The bailiff asked the city to serve the document
to the liable person - natural person, as he did not stay in his place of permanent residence.
The document addressed to the natural person was placed in an envelope delivered to his own hands. The city
on the basis of the above and the obligation to cooperate with the bailiff
notified the natural person of the deposit of the bailiff's document by posting the notice on his
online official whiteboard. For the purposes of notification of the deposit and delivery of the official consignment,
city authorized to process, ie. disclose personal data of a natural person within the scope of identification
the consignee of the official consignment to be delivered. After the end of the purpose of personal processing
data, the city was obliged to stop publishing personal data in the posted notice.
The Office checked whether the notice was posted from the online official board and thus terminated
disclosure of personal data of a natural person for that purpose.
Based on the evaluation of the collected documents and the assessment of the matter in relation to
to the law, the Office assessed the person concerned's proposal as manifestly unfounded, as the city
was entitled to disclose the personal data of the data subject to the extent necessary,
surname, year of birth, address of permanent residence for the purposes of notification of place of storage
official postal item due to its delivery to the obligor in the enforcement proceedings. Office
therefore suspended the application.
9.3.1.3 Information obligation in the exercise of the right of petition
In 2018, the Office assessed the complaint according to which the organizer of the petition obtained personal information
data of the persons supporting the petition did not fulfill the obligation to communicate the information to the persons concerned
according to § 15 par. 1 of the Act. The Office found that the personal data of the petitioners were
processed according to § 10 par. 2 of the Act, ie on the basis of a special law, which was in the given
in the case of Act no. 85/1990 Coll. on the right of petition, as amended, to the extent
and in the manner provided for by the Law on the Law of Petitions. Since according to § 15 par. 3 of the Act
the obligation to notify the data subject of information pursuant to § 15 par. 1 of the Act does not apply to
processing of personal data according to § 10 par. 2 of the Act, the Office assessed the complaint as obvious
unfounded and put it aside.
9.3.1.4 Sending marketing offers
In 2018, the data subject made an oral motion to initiate proceedings on the protection of personal data,
which contained a suspicion that the operator who is the provider of cash
loans, processes the petitioner's personal data for marketing purposes without a legal basis.
The petitioner stated that he had been a client of the operator in the past and that he was already one
several years, the operator sends him a repeat offer to his postal address
to grant a loan. The petitioner further claimed to have applied to the operator several times
by telephone and e-mail with a request to terminate the processing of his personal data
for marketing purposes, but to no avail.

42

The Office, by examining the documents and evidence gathered in the examination of the present case, found that
that the operator processed the applicant 's personal data for marketing purposes on the basis of
consent of the petitioner, who provided in the Statement on instructions on personal data protection
of 2012, which was part of the Consumer Credit Agreement concluded by the petitioner
with the operator in 2012. The submitted copy of the statement in question showed that
that the operator has obtained a separate, separate, from the agreement to the consumer credit agreement
separate consent of the petitioner with the processing of his personal data for a predetermined purpose.
The proposer has given the controller consent to the processing of his personal data for the purposes of
information about the products and services provided by the addresses for a period of 10 years from
fulfillment of obligations towards the operator. Due to the date of conclusion of the Contract
on consumer credit, it was clear that the consent granted could expire at the earliest
in 2022. The operator therefore processed the personal data of the petitioner for the purpose of sending
offers for the provision of a loan in accordance with § 9 par. 1 of the Act, with the legal basis of this
processing of personal data was the consent of the petitioner according to § 11 par. 1 of the Act.
Pursuant to § 28 par. 6 and § 29 par. 3 of the Act, the petitioner was obliged to request his blocking,
resp. liquidation of personal data after revocation of consent, resp. termination of the purpose of processing
addressed to the operator in a certain form - in writing or orally in the minutes, whereby
he was obliged to complete the request made by electronic means within three days. Draftsman
addressed his request to terminate the processing of personal data to the controller
by phone and e-mail. The operator was not obliged by law to comply with the request
in such a form. Therefore, the operator when processing the applicant's request for termination
sending marketing offers proceeded in accordance with the law. The operator stated that
that it registers the petitioner's request to delete and revoke the consent to the processing of his / her
personal data, on the basis of which he has already canceled the sending of advertising offers to the applicant, namely
despite the fact that the application was not submitted in the form prescribed by law. The office did not find out
violation of the law, the submitted proposal as manifestly unfounded therefore postponed.
9.3.2 Procedures
9.3.2.1 Breach of personal data protection when donating a discarded computer to another person
In the first half of 2017, the Office received a petition from the petitioner, who learned that she was a schoolgirl
discovered documents concerning pedagogical staff in a donated computer from the municipality,
in particular, the appellant's salary assessment. The petitioner suspected that she had obtained
information about her salary and her personal data were processed unjustifiably, and so it was
damaged her reputation. Relevant evidence that he had been discarded was also attached to the application
and the donated computer to the schoolchild contains her personal data in the salary assessment. The submission was
evaluated as content as a proposal to initiate proceedings on personal data protection. Office for
reasonable violation of the law initiated proceedings on a motion against the municipality and the school. Office in the beginning
proceedings issued a preliminary measure pursuant to § 43 par. 1 letter (b) the administrative procedure by which he has imposed
the municipality's obligation to keep the data contained in the computer donated by the municipality to the schoolchild,
who was already in the school's computer room at the time. Evidence needed for
examination of the subject matter of the proceedings were, inter alia, the data contained in the record
computer devices. The Office considered that the purpose of the conduct should not be undermined
for the necessary recording equipment of the computer in question, in particular to avoid
to liquidation, loss or other impairment of its contents. To find out the real situation
The Office requested the cooperation of the municipality and the school.

43

The controller is responsible for the security of personal data. The operator is obliged
protect processed personal data from damage, destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorized access and disclosure, provision or disclosure, as well as prior
any other impermissible processing methods. To this end, it shall take appropriate
technical, organizational and personnel measures corresponding to the way personal data are processed
data, taking into account in particular the technical means available, confidentiality and relevance
personal data processed, as well as the range of possible risks that they are capable of
security or IS functionality.
From the collected documents, the office had found and proved that the municipality provided the school to the pupil
computer for the purpose of practicing computer skills. It was supposed to be an old unnecessary one
the computer in the archive has already been scrapped, and the municipality should have checked it
discarded computers and in good faith that all data is deleted from the computer, this computer was
handed over to the student. The Office had proved from documentary evidence that the recording equipment
discarded computer contained working documents of the school with personal data.
On the basis of the documents collected in the proceedings, the Office stated that the municipality had violated § 19 par. 1
by failing to comply with the obligation to protect the petitioner's personal data processed
in the school documents located in the discarded computer of the municipality handed over to the pupil
schools, prior to their unauthorized access and disclosure to third parties by non-acceptance
appropriate security measures appropriate to the way these personal data are processed
data. In view of the mistake found, the Office imposed protection measures on the municipality
personal data of natural persons found in the discarded computer until their disposal.
The proceedings against the school were stopped by the office, as it was proved that the computer with documents,
the content of which was also personal data, owned, used, excluded from the register of the municipality, which
at the same time, it has not taken adequate measures to ensure the protection of the personal data of the data subjects
persons.
9.3.2.2 Processing of personal data after withdrawal of consent
In 2017, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data at the proposal of the petitioner, who
argued that the controller did not stop processing his personal data despite
that the applicant has withdrawn his consent to the processing. The Office found that in the present case
processing of personal data necessary for the performance of the contract in which the claimant acts
as one of the contracting parties, therefore the operator could not meet the request of the proposer
due to the fact that he processed the objected personal data on the basis of § 10 par. 3 letter b) of the Act without
consent of the person concerned and, in this sense, the petitioner's rights have not been infringed. Office at the same time
found that the controller determined the conditions for the processing of personal data by default
obtained consent to the processing of personal data also in relation to such processing, which
carried out on a different legal basis than the consent of the person concerned, as was the case
also in the case of a proposer who has given the operator consent to personal work
data for which the law did not require consent and for which the controller could not provide
the exercise of the rights which the law confers on the data subject in relation to the processing of personal data
data on the basis of consent.
The Office found that the operator had misled the persons concerned in this way
and restricted their right to transparent processing of personal data, thus violating § 6 para. 2
letter b) of the Act. By decision, the Authority imposed remedial measures on the operator
identified shortcomings.

44

9.3.2.3 Delivery of documents containing a special category of personal data
In 2017, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data on the basis of a proposal from the data subject
persons suspected of a personal data breach
by sending a letter containing a specific category of personal data to the data subject
persons by ordinary letter. In order to find out the complete and real objective
state of affairs, the operator underwent an extraordinary inspection of personal processing
data.
The operator assumed that each letter item was from its moment
handover at the collection point is protected by postal secrecy in accordance with § 32 par. 2 letter g)
Act no. 324/2011 Coll. on Postal Services and on Amendments to Certain Acts
as amended (hereinafter referred to as the "Postal Services Act") and at the same time postal
secret in terms of its definition in § 10 of the Postal Services Act, Art. 22 of the Act
no. 460/1992 Coll. The Constitution of the Slovak Republic, as amended, and Section 196 of the Act
no. 300/2005 Coll. Criminal Code as amended.
Postal conditions of the entity providing postal services according to the Postal Postal Act
provide that the entity is not responsible for the leakage of information and data on consignments
and the contents of the consignments, if they can be read, reproduced or otherwise directly
unprotected acquisition before they are submitted by the sender or after they have been delivered to the addressee.
It follows that it is up to the sender to assess the confidentiality of the content
transported consignment and chose the appropriate type of postal item accordingly,
i.e. the corresponding service provided by the postal service provider under the law
on postal services.
When processing personal data, the controller is obliged to proceed in such a way as to protect
personal data processed and, inter alia, prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or
provision of personal data. For this purpose, he is obliged to adopt adequate security
measures covering all areas which have or may have an impact on the processed
personal data and their security. Security measures must take specific account
the conditions under which the controller processes personal data, including in this case
secure delivery of consignments containing a specific category of personal data, and which
delivery is related to the activity of the operator.
In the proceedings, it was found that the operator had not taken adequate safety measures
in connection with the processing of a special category of personal data of the persons concerned (clients)
when delivered by letter, and thus when taking appropriate security measures
proceeded in violation of the provisions of § 19 par. 1 of the Act because it was mandatory for protection purposes
personal data processed before their damage, destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorized access and disclosure, provision or disclosure
technical, organizational and personnel measures corresponding to the way personal data are processed
data, taking into account the technical means available, the confidentiality and the importance of the data processed
personal data as well as the extent of possible risks.
The Office imposed measures on the operator to remedy the identified deficiencies and the causes of their occurrence
and ordered the operator to take appropriate technical, organizational and personnel measures
corresponding to the way personal data are processed in connection with the processing of the special
categories of personal data of the persons concerned upon delivery, document the measures taken
and inform the entitled persons about the measures taken.

9.3.2.4 Making e-shop purchasing conditional on marketing approval
In 2017, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data on the basis of a complaint in the case
suspicions of violating the provisions of the law in the operation of the e-shop. The content of the complaint was
a statement that the operator makes the purchase conditional on registration on its website,
whereas in order to successfully complete this registration, the buyer must give consent to processing
your personal data for marketing purposes.
On the basis of information, documents and evidence gathered during the protection proceedings
The personal data office found that if the buyer registered on the website
the operator fills in all the required information, but does not tick the box
gives the controller consent to the processing of personal data within the scope of registration
for marketing purposes, clicking on the "Register" button will clear the verification that the buyer
"Is not a robot" and the buyer remains on the registration form page. Registration that is
condition of purchase on the operator's website is so successful only if
the buyer indicates consent to the processing of his personal data for marketing purposes.
At the request of the Authority, the operator stated that registration should have been possible without consent
with the processing of personal data for the purposes of further marketing processing, whereby
the wrong registration system should have been set due to an incorrect setting
services (technical error).
According to § 11 par. 3 of the Act, the operator may not enforce the consent of the person concerned, nor
conditional on the threat of denial of the contractual relationship, service, goods or obligation
established by the operator by a legally binding act of the European Union, international
the treaty by which the Slovak Republic is bound or by law. The operator violated
provision of § 11 par. 3 of the Act, when in order to successfully complete the registration required from
buyers indicate consent to the processing of personal data for marketing purposes, thereby
there was the enforcement or conditional of the consent of the persons concerned by the threat
rejection of the contractual relationship, as the inability to register on the website
the operator ultimately made the purchase impossible
at the operator. It does not matter whether it was an intentional act or a technical error.
The operator during the personal data protection procedure registration settings system
therefore, the Office imposed on him a measure to correct the identified deficiencies and the causes of their occurrence
and ordered him to ensure that registration on his website was possible
even without indicating consent to the processing of personal data for marketing purposes.
9.3.2.5 Disclosure of personal data in draft employment contracts in bulk
sent by e-mail
The Office accepted the submission of the data subject in the matter of unauthorized disclosure of personal data
in the draft employment contracts to be circulated by the operator's staff
in bulk to their work email addresses. The proposal stated that they had been sent out en masse
draft contracts by e-mail contained personal data of the operator's employees
including salary data. The submission was assessed as a motion to initiate protection proceedings
personal data. The petitioner requested the Office pursuant to § 63 para. 4 of the Act on the Secrecy of Its
identity.
To find out the real state of affairs, the office called on the operator to cooperate. Operator
processed personal data of employees for the purposes of personnel and payroll and personal data
the persons concerned were processed through natural persons who had, in accordance with the law

46

status of beneficiaries. In this particular case, they had access to personal data
processed for the given purposes by two authorized persons of the operator, which were demonstrably
instructed in the rights, obligations and responsibilities under the law in execution
processing operations with the personal data of the data subjects processed for the purposes of
personnel and payroll.
The Office had proved that one of the authorized persons had sent it electronically from his e-mail
through the WORD annex to the employment contract document of the 53 persons concerned, including their
personal data name, surname, residence, birth number, basic salary valid at the time of signing
unauthorized disclosure of the personal data of the persons concerned, including
a special category of personal data (birth number) for a larger group of employees
operator.
The Office found that the rights of the persons concerned whose employment contracts were sent
in e-mail communication have not been violated by the systematic procedure of the operator at
processing of their personal data or as a result of breach or negligence of
obligations of the operator in the field of personnel security. The procedure that occurred
to unauthorized disclosure of personal data of the persons (employees) concerned, was
limited to the individual processing operation carried out by the authorized person in breach
with instructions on its rights and obligations in the processing of personal data and in conflict with it
with the operator's internal regulations. The Office also found that the operator
evaluated the case, registered it as a security incident and investigated. The fact that
the employee of the operator in the given case acted contrary to the instructions of the authorized person
does not relieve the operator of the strict responsibility to guarantee the safety of those processed
personal data according to § 19 par. 1 of the Act. Responsible for the security of personal data
operator.
On the basis of the collected documents, the Office found a violation of the provisions of Section 19
para. 1 of the Act by sending its employee - the authorized person, electronically to the group
employees of the operator as part of the e-mail attachment on employment contracts and employment
contracts of the 53 data subjects with their personal data, thereby breaching the obligation
protect the processed personal data from unauthorized disclosure. Based on the findings
imposed an action on the operator to remedy the identified deficiencies and causes
as well as the obligation to inform the Office in writing of their fulfillment. Following on from the stated
violation of the provisions of § 19 par. 1 of the Act, the Office initiated proceedings in the second half of 2017
on the imposition of a fine in which the operator was fined for the detected error.
9.3.2.6 Publication of a universally applicable identifier
In 2017, based on the received complaint, the Office conducted proceedings on the protection of personal data
in the matter of suspicion of violation of the provisions of the law in the publication of compulsorily published
orders on the website of the operator - the municipality. The complaint contained an allegation that
that the operator, in the context of the data on the four mandatory published orders, as well as
within the text of the orders themselves in the .pdf format, he published the birth number of the person concerned as the ID number
natural person who acted as a supplier.
On the basis of information, documents and evidence gathered during the protection proceedings
personal data, the office found that the birth number of the person concerned was published by the operator as an ID number
on the grounds that in the information system used by the operator for publication
orders, it was necessary to enter the ID number or birth certificate when entering a new supplier into the database

47

number. Without entering this information, the system did not allow the registration to complete. The operator therefore
asked persons who did not have an assigned ID number to provide consent to processing and publication
their personal data (including birth number) on the website. Operator
after notifying the authorities checked the capabilities of the information system and found that the system administrator
did not instruct the operator's staff to use a slash when entering their personal identification number,
birth number would not be published.
The operator, the municipality, was based on § 5b of Act no. 211/2000 Coll. obliged to publish
exhaustively defined data on completed orders, including name, surname,
the permanent residence address of the supplier - natural person and the identification number of the supplier, if any
assigned. Act no. 211/2000 Coll. however, no other regulation provided for an obligation
publish the operator within the data on completed orders and suppliers
also the birth numbers of the supplier. The legal basis for the publication of the person 's birth number
in accordance with the provisions of § 9 par. 1 of the Act, the consent of the person concerned could not be
that the operator even had the consent of the person concerned to the disclosure of his birth
numbers. According to § 13 par. 2 second sentence of the law to publish a generally applicable identifier, t. j.
birth number is prohibited. This ban is absolute and cannot be broken even by granting
consent of the person concerned to the publication of his or her birth number. The law does not provide for such an exception.
The operator violated the provision of § 13 par. 2 of the Act when on its website
published the birth number of the person concerned. Operator during personal protection proceedings
data published birth number deleted. The Authority therefore imposed a measure on the operator
to remedy the identified shortcomings and their causes only in the part concerning others
shortcomings identified during the personal data protection proceedings which constituted the breach
obligations to instruct the entitled persons who published data on mandatory disclosures
orders on the operator's website, the obligation to anonymize the birth number
before the publication of the relevant documents.
9.3.2.7 Disclosure of personal data in copies of documents by sending an incorrect one
address
In the first half of 2018, the Office accepted the filing of the affected person against the bank, resp. her
branch, which he evaluated according to the content as a proposal to initiate proceedings on the protection of personal data
data. The petitioner requested a written warrant for her son
an application at a bank branch for changes in the disposition of her son's account, and shall be attached to the application
were copies of documents containing her personal data and the personal data of her son. Draftswoman
subsequently found that her application, including the documents with personal data attached to the application
were sent unjustifiably to another company, which therefore contacted it by telephone for the purpose of
ascertaining the reason for their delivery. A company employee had it during a phone call
announce that the company's documents do not belong and subsequently to the petitioner at her address
returned.
The Office initiated proceedings against the bank regarding the verification of its branch's processing process
personal data of the petitioner and her son. In the present proceedings, the Office called on the bank as well as
the company to which the petitioner's documents were to have been wrongly sent by the bank's branch,
for synergy. The bank processed the personal data of the petitioner and her son as clients in its own
ISOU for the purpose of providing banking services in accordance with a special law. Personal information
the persons concerned were processed at the bank's branch through the bank's employees,
and thus the entitled persons who the bank, as the operator, has demonstrably instructed about the rights
and obligations in the processing of personal data. The authorized persons also confirmed with their signature

48

that they have been informed of the obligation to protect personal data against misuse or disclosure
unauthorized persons. However, the Office found that when sending a copy of the appellant 's application, including
annexes, there was an error by the authorized person of the bank's branch, which in the internal list
contacts bank incorrectly traced the delivery address and copies of documents with personal data
the appellant and her son were subsequently mistakenly sent to another subsidiary
company of the bank, but did not process the personal data of the bank's clients. In connection with the mistake
the beneficiary was found in the proceedings that the operator had breached the obligation to protect
the personal data of the data subjects processed prior to their unauthorized disclosure
in § 19 par. 1 of the Act. Following the findings and proven facts, the Office imposed
measures to eliminate the identified deficiencies and the causes of their occurrence.

if it has exercised its right to rectification or liquidation of its incorrect, incomplete or
outdated personal data that are being processed and their right to liquidation
personal data whose purpose of processing has ended. Limitation of these rights concerned

banking institutions most often requested the deletion of personal data on the grounds that
clients have duly paid receivables from the bank as an IS operator as well as cancellations
all contracts. The persons concerned also request non-contacting the bank,
which banks consider as a revocation of the granted consent to the processing of personal data for the purposes of

12 EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE
PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
12.1 European level
Following the adoption of Regulation and Directive 2016/680, the European Commission submitted on 10 January 2017
draft of two legislative acts - draft regulation 45/2001 and decision no. 1247/2002 / EC
(hereinafter "the Regulation for the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies") and the draft Regulation
e - privacy in order to ensure compliance with a uniform approach to personal data protection
throughout the European Union. These regulations will be lex in relation to the Regulation
special.
The Regulation directly contains a provision requiring Regulation 45/2001 to be amended
adapted to the principles and rules laid down in the Regulation. On May 23, 2018, representatives
The Council and Parliament have agreed on the text of a regulation for the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies
and will apply from autumn 2018.
As in the Regulation, the Regulation provides for Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies
several principles to be followed in data processing and several rights guaranteed
individuals whose data are collected. In accordance with the Regulation, institutions and others must
authorities to ensure that they provide transparent and easily accessible information on how
use personal data, and to envisage clear mechanisms for individuals to apply
their rights. The new legal instrument also reaffirms, clarifies and strengthens the role
responsible persons within each EU institution and the Supervisor. The goal is also an effort
to simplify procedures in this area. For the processing of personal data by EU agencies
in the field of law enforcement and judicial cooperation (eg Eurojust), the Regulation applies
through a separate chapter. The rules in this chapter are in line with Directive 2016/680
on law enforcement. More specific provisions may be laid down in the founding acts of these agencies
rules that take into account their specific circumstances. Europol and the European Public Prosecutor's Office are still
excluded from this Regulation. By 30 April 2022 at the latest and every five years thereafter
The EC shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Regulation
appropriate legislative proposals are attached if necessary.
The forthcoming e-privacy regulation will cover electronic data processing
communications and information related to end-user end-devices.
Electronic communications data means their content, such as the content of private messages,
but also metadata, which include e.g. numbers called, websites visited,
geographical location, time of the call or message.
The aim of the draft e-privacy regulation is to ensure strict privacy rules for
users of electronic communications services and a level playing field
market participants. At the same time, an effective e-privacy directive does not reflect changes in the digital environment
and is therefore no longer a sufficient tool for regulation in this area. This is, for example, the Internet
over-the-top communication services not covered by the e-privacy directive. Current
the e-privacy directive also does not apply to electronic communications services offered
providers operating over the Internet, even though they offer functionally equivalent
service. However, these providers will fall within the scope of the proposed
e-privacy regulations. Providers of these services will be able to adopt the e-privacy regulation
process data from electronic communications only for exhaustively defined reasons, and only if
this will be necessary for the purpose of fulfilling the services they provide, maintaining the quality of services,
fulfillment of legal obligations or the protection of vital interests. Otherwise they will be able to
53

service providers to process electronic communications data only with the consent of the terminal
user. The legislative process for the e-privacy regulation is still ongoing.

ASSESSMENT OF THE PROTECTION STATUS OF PERSONAL PROTECTION
IN THE PERIOD FROM 1 JANUARY 2017 TO MAY 24, 2018

DATA

In the period under review, the interest in the protection of personal data can be assessed as more than positive,
mainly due to the approaching deadline for the application of the Regulation and the law
no. 18/2018 Coll. For this reason, both operators, intermediaries and the general public
and the professional public were much more interested in this issue.
Regarding information and awareness of the general public about personal data and their protection
to see a drastic shift towards informing the general public; people are interested in their
personal data, protect them and operators ask how and why their personal data
process. This trend is also confirmed by the operators, who also in various common forums
and platforms inform participants on behalf of the Office that they are increasingly confronted with people's questions
and that they must be able to justify on the basis of which they process the person's personal data.
