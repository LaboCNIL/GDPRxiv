THE CONCEPTS OF "Fundamental RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS" VERSUS "RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS"
– AND HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM
Articles of the Regulation related to the rights and freedoms of natural persons:
Art. 1 paragraph Regulations "This regulation protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons,
especially their right to the protection of personal data."
Article 6 par. 1 letter f) Regulation "(...) processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests,
which is monitored by the operator or a third party, except when above such
interests prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that they require
protection of personal data, especially if the person concerned is a child."
Article 24 par. 1 Regulations "With regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as to
risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons
the operator will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able
demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with this regulation. The mentioned measures according to
needs will be reviewed and updated."
Article 32 of the Regulations "The operator and intermediary shall adopt, taking into account the latest
knowledge, the costs of carrying out the measures and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as
to risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure an adequate level of security
this risk, while the mentioned measures possibly also include..."
Within the entire text of the Regulation, rights and freedoms are mentioned through two
different expressions:
- Basic rights and freedoms
- Rights and freedoms.
Question 1:
Are all the fundamental rights and freedoms required and listed in the Regulations the same as in the Charter
fundamental rights and freedoms of the European Union?
List of all identified rights and freedoms, mentioned (directly or indirectly) in the articles
The charters are listed in Annex 1.
Question 2:
In the text of the Regulation, only the term "rights and freedoms" is mentioned somewhere and not the term "fundamental rights
and freedom". What is the reason for such a lexical difference in the text of the Regulation?
We see this difference very clearly, especially:
- An assessment of risks of varying probability and severity for rights and freedoms is required
natural persons.
- First we need to identify all rights and freedoms.
- We then select a subset of identified rights and freedoms that are relevant
for processing and a natural person.
- Only then can we make an assessment.
Question 3:

1

If we do a risk assessment only for all relevant fundamental rights and freedoms, but not for all
rights and freedoms, let's proceed in accordance with the Regulations (especially in the case of a possible lawsuit)?
Annex 2 contains an example for impact assessment.

Annex 1 – list of rights and freedoms in the Charter
Note: We understand the prohibitions expressly stated in the text of the charter as an implicitly stated right to protect against the object of the prohibition
(for example, the "prohibition of torture" establishes the "right to be protected from torture").

Annex 2 – example for impact assessment for the national eHealth system
The impact assessment for the rights and freedoms listed in the Charter is very important for the level assessment
risk in the national electronic health system, in which data is collected regarding
are healthy for the entire population.
The impact assessment covers scenarios such as massive data loss or a massive breach
confidentiality, integrity, availability of genetic data, biometric data and data relating to
are healthy - these data are in the national system of electronic healthcare. Evaluation
performed against the entire population. Any violation of a fundamental right or freedom has a major impact
to the individual concerned.
The risk to the right to freedom is a combination of the impact and the probability of the threat being realized. In below
the above table shows the impact assessment. The probability of occurrence of threats depends
from the level of security countermeasures. If we have strong pseudonymization in the system (it is not
no option for the administrator to combine identification and health data about a person),
the likelihood of a massive breach of confidentiality is very low.
VIP data
Personal data related to health with a serious impact in case of loss of integrity or confidentiality of some diagnosis and related documentation; classification according to ICD-10.
Examples:
A00-B99
Some infectious and parasitic diseases
Example: A51.1 - Primary anal syphilis
Suppose that due to the violation of integrity, the diagnosis A41.1 "Sepsis caused by another
by specified staphylococci" changed to A51.1 and then this information is related to some
VIP published in some tabloids. The whole life of the person concerned can be completely destroyed.
F00-F99
Mental disorders and behavioral disorders
Example: F23.0 - Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia
Let's assume that this information is after the general release of the data in the bulletin.
The entire life of the affected person can be significantly disrupted.

Other examples of the importance of the integrity of personal data in health care
Right to live
A pregnant woman is obliged to undergo genetic tests of the fetus. If any is indicated
serious genetic disease, there is a high probability that this woman will decide to have an abortion.
Now we assume the scenario that the integrity of the test results is violated (when marking serious
genetic diseases) and that she decided to have an abortion. Later, however, she received information that in
there was an error in the results, so there was no serious genetic disease of the fetus and miscarriage
was not needed.
This situation shows a huge impact on the right to protect the life of the nascitura, private life
women, family life, mental integrity, etc.
The right to respect the physical integrity of a person - threats by the use of personal data that change
integrity
 Hacking a pacemaker or other life support device is real
a threat to the physical integrity of a person.
 Change of consent to undisturbed procedures in case of cancer.
 Change of consent not to donate organs for transplantation (including death).

A set of human rights based on limited legal capacity
The restriction of human rights is based on the restriction of the legal capacity of a natural person.
A psychiatric assessment of this natural person is also part of the judicial decision-making process.
If the relevant documents have changed their integrity or have been falsified or broken, the person may
lose many legal rights, including the right to vote, the right to own legally acquired property,
the right to use legally acquired property, the right to dispose of legally acquired property,
etc.
