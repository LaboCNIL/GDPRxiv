 The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman’s telephone guidance service will be closed on Fridays. The guidance service’s opening hours will otherwise remain the same. The new opening hours for the guidance service took effect on 12 January 2021. The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman’s telephone guidance service provides members of the public, data controllers, and data protection officers with general guidance and advice on the processing of personal data. The guidance service only provides general advice, as we cannot give detailed or binding statements over the phone. Answers to frequently asked questions are available on our website.
