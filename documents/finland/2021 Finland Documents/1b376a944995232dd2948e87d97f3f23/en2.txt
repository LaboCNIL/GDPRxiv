The Office of the Data 
Protection Ombudsman 
safeguards the rights 
and freedoms of 
individuals with regard 
to the processing of 
personal data 

Reijo Aarnio was the Data Protection Ombudsman 
until the end of October 2020. Anu Talus was 
appointed as the Data Protection Ombudsman 
as of the beginning of November when Aarnio 
retired after a long service in the office. Before 
her appointment as Data Protection Ombudsman, 
Talus  acted  as  the  Deputy  Data  Protection 
Ombudsman. Jari Råman is the second Deputy 
Data Protection Ombudsman. The Data Protection 
Ombudsman  and  Deputy  Ombudsmen  are 
appointed by the government for terms of five 
years.

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
is an autonomous and independent authority 
that supervises compliance with data protection 
legislation  and  other  laws  governing  the 
processing of personal data. 

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
promotes awareness of the rights and obligations 
related  to  the  processing  of  personal  data, 
imposes administrative sanctions for violations 
of the General Data Protection Regulation of 
the EU, if necessary, carries out investigations 
and audits and issues statements on legislative 
and administrative reforms. The Data Protection 
Ombudsman cooperates with the data protection 
authorities of other countries and represents 
Finland on the European Data Protection Board 
(EDPB).

Data Protection Ombudsman Anu Talus:  
2020, a year of reforms

Data Protection Day was celebrated for the first 
time in January 2020, in an event co-hosted by 
Alma Talent. The event proved to be a success, 
and the goal is to establish the Data Protection 
Day as an annual event. 

The Data Protection Day later proved to be one 
of the last opportunities to meet international 
colleagues. The year was marked by the COVID-19 
pandemic both in Finland and internationally. 
The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
provided guidance on several questions related to 
COVID-19 on its homepage. The office relocated 
to new facilities during the spring of the first 
year of the pandemic in 2020, which came with 
its challenges. 

Although the pandemic has tested the society 
in many ways, it has been delightful to perceive 
how data protection questions were kept a priority 
in Finland’s measures against COVID-19. It has 
been said that the Finnish COVID-19 debate has 
been dominated by judicialisation, but from the 
data protection perspective, this is only positive. 
The Koronavilkku application, intended to monitor 
exposure to the virus, was also developed in the 
framework of data protection policy.

The number of matters instituted with the Office 
of the Data Protection Ombudsman continued 
to increase. With the entry into force of the EU 

General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, the 
number of matters instituted multiplied, and the 
processing became congested. In early 2020, 
the Office started a systematic clearance of 
this backlog. This project has progressed as 
scheduled, but at the same time, the number 
of instituted matters continued to increase. In 
2020, a total of 937 more matters were instituted 
than in the previous year. Notifications of data 
breaches accounted for more than one third of all 
instituted cases in 2020. An initiative to increase 
and boost the efficiency of the processing of data 
breach notifications was also launched in 2020.

The  European  Commission  submitted  an 
evaluation  and  review  of  the  General  Data 
Protection Regulation in May 2020, two years 
after its entry into force. The Commission report 
was drafted during Finland’s Presidency of the 
Council of the European Union. The report states 
that most of the goals of the legal reform have 
been achieved, and that new legislation has 
improved citizens’ rights. However, the report 
suggests that the need to make the harmonisation 
of the application of legislation more efficient 
continues to exist.

Last year was also a time for major decisions. 
The  Sanctions  Board  of  the  Office  of  the 
Data  Protection  Ombudsman  imposed  its 
first administrative fines for breaches of data 

6

protection legislation. A total of five rulings on 
administrative fines were issued. Four of these 
were appealed in the Administrative Court. The 
largest fine imposed by the Sanctions Board 
was 100,000 euros. 

The Court of Justice of the European Union 
issued some significant rulings on personal data 
protection during the year. In July, the Court of 
Justice of the European Union gave a decision 
in the case known as Schrems II (C-311/18). 
The judgment invalidated the Privacy Shield 
system and remodified the framework of data 
transfer into third countries. The European Data 
Protection Board gave its first conclusive dispute 
resolution decision in a case against Twitter. The 
Irish data protection authority announced its 
decision based on the dispute resolution decision 
in December and imposed a fine of 450,000 euros 
on the company. 

The surge of activity in the field of data protection 
continued in the autumn. The Office of the Data 
Protection Ombudsman and TIEKE, the Finnish 
Information Society Development Centre, received 
Commission funding for the development of a 
tool for SMEs to reach a data protection standard 
set by the GDPR. The project was launched in the 
latter part of the year and will last approximately 
two years. 

The retirement of Reijo Aarnio, who served in the 
post of Data Protection Ombudsman for a long 
time, was celebrated in the autumn. 

At the time of Reijo Aarnio’s retirement, the most 
extensive breach of data protection of all time was 
revealed in Finland. The Psychotherapy Centre 

Vastaamo filed a notification of a data breach with 
the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman on 
21 October 2020. In this context, other questions 
relevant to the protection of personal data, such 
as the preconditions of processing the personal 
identity code, were highlighted in discussion.

When looking at the most important events of 
last year, I cannot help but conclude that the year 
was full of major changes, great achievements 
in development, data protection actions, and 
even surprises. This will also be true for the year 
to follow.

Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman  
Jari Råman:   
Audits in the time of 
COVID-19 and questions 
of facial recognition 
technology in the field 
of internal security

In  2020,  data  processing  by  the  authorities 
competent by virtue of the Act on the Processing 
of Personal Data in Criminal Matters was, for 
the first time, supervised in accordance with a 
new audit plan. The supervision measures were 
particularly characterized by the extended use 
of facial recognition technology. In addition to 
the Finnish Defence Forces and the police, which 
are the government controllers with the largest 
number of personnel, this area of responsibility 
of internal security also includes the Finnish 
Customs,  the  Finnish  Border  Guard,  rescue 
services, activities of the Emergency Response 
Centres, immigration administration as well as 
courts of law, the National Prosecution Authority 
as well as the Criminal Sanctions Agency. 

Audits are one means of completing the Office 
of the Data Protection Ombudsman’s supervisory 
tasks. With the implementation of the first audit 
plan of the new form, it was detected that the 

audits clearly provide added value, even though 
the measures take up a lot of resources from 
other tasks of the Office of the Data Protection 
Ombudsman and effort by the subject of the audit 
is also required. Great observations were made 
during the audits on how to develop the guidelines 
and training on the processing of personal data 
as a part of the accountability principle and in 
order to promote internal supervision of legality. 

The audits did not indicate any need for the use 
of specific powers. The observations made in the 
audit reports have been taken seriously and the 
completion of corrective actions indicates that 
the competent authorities have understood the 
impact of developing data protection activities 
in  contributing  to  both  the  legality  of  their 
actions and their effectiveness. The audits were 
particularly effective in developing the processing 
of personal data in connection to threat scenarios 
produced by the authorities.

8

Questions relating to the use of facial recognition 
technology  remained  a  topical  theme  in  the 
activities of security authorities. The police has 
extended its use of facial recognition technology 
to image materials captured in crime prevention, 
and during a prior consultation, the Office of the 
Data Protection Ombudsman helped to steer the 
activities of the police to ensure the methods 
used are legal. Valid legislation does not offer the 
opportunity of real-time online facial recognition 
in a flow of images. 

The  use  of  Clearview  AI  facial  recognition 
technology was an additional cause of concern 
in Europe and quite legitimately so. In Finland, 
the  issues  related  to  said  technology  in  the 
work of security authorities did not emerge until 
2021, despite several supervisory measures, and 
the processing of this topic is ongoing while I 
am writing this. A relevant decision in Sweden 
is important in many respects. The controller 
remains responsible even if technology is used 
without consent – being aware of appropriate 
practices is the responsibility of the controller. A 
particularly conscientious approach is required to 
ensure and demonstrate the legality of measures 
when biometric data is involved.

In the development of legislation in the sector, 
automated decision-making continued to create 
controversy.  The  Act  on  processing  personal 
data in immigration administration was adopted 
without provisions on automated decision-making 
primarily due to the lack of general administrative 
legislation in the field. The principles of personal 
data processing and the legislation concerning 
automated single decisions in particular can be 
similarly applied to the technology of automated 
decision-making in administration. The Ministry of 
Justice has drafted a memorandum and founded 
a committee to investigate legislative drafting of 
general legislation on automated decision-making 
in administrative matters. Hopefully, this work will 
proceed swiftly, and the development of automated 
decision-making in administration will proceed in 
a controlled manner.

”In 2020, the Office of 
the Data Protection 
Ombudsman 
conducted 11 audits of 
organisations of internal 
security.”

Despite  the  challenges  presented  due  to  the 
COVID-19  pandemic,  most  of  the  scheduled 
audits were completed, even though some special 
arrangements  were  needed.  The  experiences 
gained from virtual audits were mostly positive and 
it is likely that they will continued after the special 
circumstances due to the pandemic have passed. 

With positive experiences obtained, the Office of 
the Data Protection Ombudsman will continue to 
carry out audits of the internal security authorities 
in line with the new model.

Focus areas of data 
protection activities

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
imposed administrative fines for the first time

In May 2020, the Sanctions Board of the Office 
of the Data Protection Ombudsman imposed 
first administrative fines for breaches of data 
protection legislation. The task of the Sanctions 
Board is to impose administrative fines in line 
with the GDPR to the controller or processor of 
personal data. The Sanctions Board is made 
up of the Data Protection Ombudsman and two 
Deputy Data Protection Ombudsmen. The Data 
Protection Ombudsman is the Chair of the Board. 

Imposing  administrative  fines  is  one  of  the 
corrective  powers  of  the  Office  of  the  Data 
Protection Ombudsman. Administrative fines 
can be imposed in addition to or in place of other 
corrective actions. A corrective action used must 
be efficient and proportionate. The maximum 
amount of the administrative fine is 4 per cent of 
the turnover of the company or 20 million euros. 
Administrative fines cannot be imposed on public 
organisations, such as the government or state-
owned companies, municipalities and parishes.

In 2020, the Office of 
the Data Protection 
Ombudsman issued
 ▪ 40 orders to notify data 
subjects of a personal data 
breach
 ▪ 33 orders to ensure the 
compliance of personal data 
processing measures with 
the GDPR
 ▪ 36 reprimands for 
processing measures that 
violate the GDPR

10

In 2020, the Sanctions Board imposed administrative 
fines on a total of five companies for breaches of data 
protection laws 

 ▪ An administrative fine of 100,000 euros was imposed on the Posti Group 

due to shortcomings in informing persons who had submitted notices of 
change of address. The company should have informed their customers 
in an explicit manner that when submitting a notice of change of address, 
they are entitled to not to consent to the processing of their personal data 
and disclosing it for direct marketing purposes. The breach concerned 
161,000 people in 2019 alone.

 ▪ An administrative fine of 16,000 euros was imposed on Kymen Vesi Ltd 

for the failure to complete an impact assessment on the processing of 
their employees’ location data. The impact assessment should have been 
completed prior to the company’s processing of location data which was 
collected by geographic location of the vehicles using vehicle on-board 
systems. 

 ▪ An administrative fine of 12,500 euros was imposed on a company that 

collected employees’ data in an excessive manner. The company had 
requested for employment information that was not required for the 
employment contract, including information on their health and family 
relationships. 

 ▪ An administrative fine of 72,000 euros was imposed on Taksi Helsinki for 

several shortcomings in its processing of personal data. The company had 
not, inter alia, assessed the legality of personal data processing regarding 
its camera surveillance system or informed customers of voice recording in 
a manner set forth by the GDPR. 

 ▪ An administrative fee of 7,000 euros was imposed on ACC Consulting 

Varsinais-Suomi for sending electronic direct marketing messages without 
prior consent and for non-compliance of the rights of a data subject. The 
company had not responded to or implemented the requests concerning 
the rights of data subjects, and it was not able to prove that it had 
processed personal data legally.

 ▪ Deputy member of the Chair:  

Riikka Koulu, Assistant Professor

For  the  first  time,  the  Finnish  Government 
appointed an Expert Board by virtue of the Data 
Protection Act. The Expert Board, operating in 
connection with the Office of the Data Protection 
Ombudsman, is tasked with issuing statements 
on significant questions related to the application 
of legislation pertaining to processing of personal 
data  at  the  request  of  the  Data  Protection 
Ombudsman. The  term  of  the  Expert  Board 
began on 1 October 2020 and will end on 30 
September 2023.

Protection Ombudsman. The Board may also 
consult other experts if necessary.

The Expert Board will convene as and if needed 
when summoned by the Chair. The Board has 
no formal decision-making authority.

Measures to clear the backlog

In  January  2020,  the  Office  of  the  Data 
Protection Ombudsman launched a project to 
clear the backlog of unresolved cases instituted 
in 2014–2018. In early 2020, the number of 
these old, unresolved matters from 2014–2018 
totalled 2,327. 

In the end of 2020, the number of unresolved 
matters stood at a little over 400. Of these, 188 
were cases that are processed in an international 
procedure and their processing depends on the 
actions of a supervisory authority of another 
country. 

In addition to clearing the old cases, there were 
resolutions given for matters instituted in 2019 
and 2020. In the end of 2020, the number of 
unresolved matters instituted from 2016 to 
2019 totalled 1,550. The number of unresolved 
matters had been decreased by almost 800 
from January 2020. The project of clearing the 
backlog continues at the Office of the Data 
Protection Ombudsman in 2021. 

13

Processing cross-border matters

Cross-border processing means either 

 ▪ processing of personal data which takes 

place in establishments in more than one 
EU Member State where the controller 
or processor is established in more than 
one Member State; or

 ▪ processing of personal data which 

takes place in a single establishment of 
a controller or processor in the EU but 
which substantially affects data subjects 
in more than one Member State.

When the processing of personal data crosses 
borders, the European data protection authorities 
monitor  the  processing  of  personal  data  in 
cooperation. For cases that are processed in a 
cooperation procedure, a lead supervisory authority 
is appointed. Their task is to cooperate with the 
supervisory authorities that are cooperating in 
the processing. The goal of the consistency and 
cooperative  mechanism  is  to  ensure  that  the 
application of GDPR is harmonised across the 
EU member states.

The number started to increase for cross-border 
matters that were processed in a consistency and 
cooperative mechanism of supervisory authorities 
in 2020. In June, the European Data Protection 
Board (EDPB) published a register of decisions by 
supervisory authorities in a cross-border processing 
of matters. 

In November 2020, the EDPB adopted its first final 
dispute resolution decision in a matter that was 
processed in a cross-border cooperation. The 
dispute resolution decision concerned a matter 
in which the Irish supervisory authority was acting 
as the lead supervisory authority and had issued 
a draft decision in a matter concerning Twitter 
International Company. The matter in question 
included a breach of data protection that affected 

14

Of the cross-border matters 
that were instituted during 
2020, the Office of the Data 
Protection Ombudsman 
was named as the lead 
supervisory authority 
in two matters and as 
a supervisory authority 
concerned in approximately 
230 matters.

approximately  88,700  data  subjects.  Several 
concerned  supervisory  authorities  gave  their 
objections on the proposal for a decision by the 
Irish supervisory authority, after which the Irish 
supervisory authority transferred the matter to the 
dispute resolution mechanism of the EDPB. The 
Irish supervisory authority gave its final decision 
based on the decision of the Board. 

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, 
in  cooperation  with  the  Estonian  supervisory 
authority, processed a matter in which a company 
organising dog trips in Estonia had updated a list 
on its homepage of people who owed money to 
the company. The company did not react when the 
Estonian supervisory authority first contacted it, 
but did remove the list after they were contacted 
again. The Estonian supervisory authority issued 
a notification to the company for a breach of data 
protection legislation.

Various actions of personal data processing by 
authorities have also been audited, for example, 
the application of the Security Clearance Act 
and measures connected to risk assessments 
produced by authorities. Controllers have received 
many types of guidance as a result of the audits.  

Auditing activities

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
increased the effectiveness of systematic auditing 
activities of authorities of internal security during 
2020. The Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman 
conducted a total of 11 audits of authorities 
of internal security during the year. Subjects of 
these audits included National Police Board, 
Finnish Security and Intelligence Service, Criminal 
Sanctions Agency and The Finnish Border Guard, 
Legal Register Centre and the Finnish Defence 
Forces. 

The subjects of audits and the audited measures 
were prioritized on a basis of risk analysis and 
impacts. The objects reviewed have included 
instructions  and  training  of  personal  data 
processing as a part of accountability and the 
practical realisation of internal legality control. 

15

The number of personal data breaches 
continued to increase

Notifications of personal data breaches formed 
the largest individual group of matters instituted 
by the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman. 
In 2020, a total of 4,276 notifications of personal 
data breaches were filed, with an increase of 437 
from the previous year. If a personal data breach 
can cause risk to the rights and freedoms of 
natural persons, the Office of the Data Protection 
Ombudsman must be notified. The notification 
obligation started in May 2018.

The great majority of data breaches is due to 
working on several tasks at the same time and 
in a hurry. When personal data is processed, it 
is not a good idea to take up several things at 
the same time, because it increases the number 
of mistakes due to negligence. Data breaches 
can also be prevented by securing databases 
following the generally accepted practices, testing 
systems and by ensuring proper instructions.

The  single  most  significant  data  protection 
incident in 2020 was the security breach of 
Psychotherapy Centre Vastaamo, which became 
public in October. In this case, the personal and 
patient information of tens of thousands of people 
was stolen and leaked to the web. The Office of 
the Data Protection Ombudsman ordered that 
the company must inform all the clients affected 
by the breach personally. 

The Office of the Data 
Protection Ombudsman 
was notified of 4,276 
personal data breaches 
in 2020.

The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman 
also initiated an investigation on the legality of the 
actions of Vastaamo. In the investigation, items 
reviewed will include the security of personal data 
processing activities by Vastaamo, informing 
of  the  data  breach  and  the  obligations  of 
controller’s accountability and whether following 
measures have been appropriate. The Office of 
the Data Protection Ombudsman coordinates 
the investigative measures in cooperation with 
the National Bureau of Investigation and other 
authorities. The intention is to complete the 
review even though the company was declared 
bankrupt in 2021.

Staff and finances 

– new organizational structure established, changes in the assembly 
of ombudsmen

During 2020, the number of personnel in the Office 
of the Data Protection Ombudsman increased to 48 
people. The recruitment process of a second Deputy 
Data Protection Ombudsman began in the autumn 
of 2020, after Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman 
Anu Talus was appointed the new Data Protection 
Ombudsman. Heljä-Tuulia Pihamaa, Master of 
Laws, was appointed to the post of Deputy Data 
Protection Ombudsman and started in the post 
in March 2021. 

Three customer service teams are established in 
the Office; as a rule, one of them focuses on private 
sector and cross-border matters, the second on 
public sector and nationally processed matters and 
the third on matters related to the Data Protection 
Law Enforcement Directive and the Act on the 
Processing of Personal Data in Criminal Matters and 
in Connection with Maintaining National Security. 
Administration,  advisory  and  registry  services 
are centralised in the Administrative Unit of the 
office. The Joint Functions team includes the IT 

senior specialists, communications and the Data 
Protection Officer. The separate process groups 
also coordinate practices and projects on certain 
themes, such as data protection breaches, rights 
of data subjects and impact assessment. 

In April 2020, the Office of the Data Protection 
Ombudsman relocated to new facilities in Lintulahti 
in Helsinki. Due to the orders and recommendations 
of virtual work as a consequence of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the office introduced new kinds of digital 
working methods. In the new circumstances, the 
well-being of employees and occupational safety 
gained particular importance. 

The project of clearing the backlog, which started 
at the beginning of the year, was apparent in the 
composition of the staff as new staff members 
were recruited. Four senior inspectors and two 
legal experts were working in the project to clear 
the congested situation

Matters instituted 
and processed from 
2018 to 2020

The table below presents how many cases have 
been instituted and how many cases have been 
resolved by the Office of the Data Protection 
Ombudsman in 2018–2020. The statistics have 
been retrieved from the document management 
system of the office for each year in question.

The  prior  consultation  (high  risk)  group  of 
cases includes prior consultations due to the 
high residual risk, notifications required by the 
national legislation (Data Protection Act, section 
31(3)) as well as issues related to lists of high 
or low risk processing measures. 

The case management groups of the Office of 
the Data Protection Ombudsman changed in 
May 2018 with the reform of the data protection 
legislation. Most of the cases have been recorded 
under tasks in accordance with the EU GDPR and 
the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive 
starting from 25 May 2018 (groups 80–210).
