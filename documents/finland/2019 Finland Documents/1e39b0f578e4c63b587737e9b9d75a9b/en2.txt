Having  regard  to  Article  4  and  Recitals  145  to  149  of  the  Commission  Implementing  Decision  (EU) 
2016/1250  of  12  July  2016  pursuant  to  Directive  95/46/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (“EU - U.S. Privacy 
Shield), 

 HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING REPORT:

Introduction 

1.1 
According to the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield adequacy decision (“Privacy Shield”)1 adopted on 12 July 2016, 
eight representatives of the EDPB participated in the third joint review conducted by the European 
Commission, on September 12 and 13 of 2019 in Washington to assess the robustness of its adequacy 
decision and its practical implementation. 

Based on the concerns elaborated in the previous opinions of the WP29 and of the EDPB, in particular 
opinion 1/2016, and the reports following the first and second joint review, the EDPB focused on the 
assessment of both the commercial aspects of the Privacy Shield and on the government access to 
personal data transferred from the EU for the purposes of Law Enforcement and National Security, 
including  the  legal  remedies  available  to  EU  individuals.2  The  EDPB  assessed  once  again  whether 
these  concerns  have  been  addressed  and  also  whether  the  safeguards  provided  under the EU-U.S. 
Privacy Shield are workable and effective. 

The European Commission published its report of the third joint review on October 23, 2019. 

The  EDPB’s  main  findings  concerning  this  third  joint  annual  review,  stemming  both  from  written 
submissions and from oral contributions are hereby presented in this report. 

1.2  On the commercial aspects of the Privacy Shield 
The third annual review showed that the U.S. authorities have continued their efforts to implement 
the Privacy Shield.  

The  DoC  as  well  as  the  FTC  also  undertook  new  ex  officio  oversight  and  enforcement  actions  as 
regards  the compliance  of  Privacy  Shield  certified  organizations  with  the  requirements  under  the 
Privacy Shield. The EDPB particularly welcomes that the DoC has increased the number of “random 
spot checks” to 30 organizations per month. 

However, one of the main concerns already expressed by the WP29 and the EDPB remains a certain 
lack of oversight in substance. Indeed, the checks performed by the DoC are principally focused on 
formal aspects. The enforcement actions by the FTC focused on procedural violations of the framework 
                                                           
1  Commission  Implementing  Decision  (EU)  2016/1250  of  12  July  2016  pursuant  to  Directive  95/46/EC  of  the 
European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  the  adequacy  of  the  protection  provided  by  the  EU-U.S.  Privacy 
Shield, OJ L 207, 1.8.2016, p.1. 
2 Any reference to the “EU” shall be understood as a reference to the “EEA”, in accordance with Decision of the 
EEA Joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018 and Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 144/2017 of 7 
July 2017.

Adopted  

rather than on the substance. This lack of substantial checks thus remains a concern of the EDPB as, 
even  taking  into  account  discretionary  and  limited  investigations  by  the  FTC,  a  majority  of 
companies’  compliance  with  the  substance  of  the  Privacy  Shield’s  principles  remains  unchecked, 
although  many  of  them  were  introduced  or  further  detailed  compared  to  the  Safe  Harbor.  In 
addition, the increase of complaints, in general, although resolved successfully, does not entirely 
compensate for this lack of proactive checks on substance. Indeed, these complaints do not seem to 
concern  the  issues  of  concerns  underlined  by  the  EDPB  so  far  as  they  seem  to  mainly  focus  on 
procedural aspects. 

One example for which the EDPB sees the need for more substantive checks are onward transfers. 
Since  onward  transfers  possibly  lead to  transfers  of data  outside  of  the  jurisdiction of  U.S.  and  EU 
authorities  with  possibly  no  data  protection  provided  by  law  it  is  of  utmost  importance  that  the 
competent  US  Authorities  closely  monitor  the  practical  implementation  of  the  Privacy  Shield’s 
“Accountability for the Onward Transfers Principle”. As a first step, for example the DoC could make 
use of its right to ask organizations to produce the contracts they have put in place with third countries’ 
partners  in order  to  assess  whether those  provide  the  necessary  safeguards  and  to  discover  if  any 
further guidance or other action by the DoC or the FTC is needed.  

Another area that requires further attention is the application of the Privacy Shield requirements 
regarding HR Data. While the EU Supervisory authorities remain available to exchange with the US 
Authorities, the discussions on this issue will have to continue between the European Commission and 
the US Authorities given the different possible readings of the wording of the Privacy Shield. In parallel, 
the  Commission  is  still  called  upon  to  address  this  issue  and  clarify  the  text  in  order  to  avoid  that 
possible different interpretations lead to gaps in the protection of EU data subjects. 

8. 

9. 

10.  Also, the re-certification process needs to be further refined. The situation of outdated listings leads 
to  avoidable  confusion  that  should  be  addressed  also  in  the  interest  of  concerned  Privacy  Shield 
certified organizations. 

11. 

Last  but  not  least,  the  EDPB  recalls  the  remaining  issues  with  respect  to  certain  elements  of  the 
commercial  part  of  the  Privacy  Shield  adequacy  decision  as  already  raised  in  the  WP  29’s  Opinion 
01/2016 in particular regarding the absence or the limitation to the rights of the data subjects (i.e. 
right to object, right to access, right to be informed for HR processing), the absence of key definitions, 
the application of the principles when it comes to “processors”, the lack of guarantees on transfers for 
regulatory purpose in the field of medical context, the lack of specific rules on automated decision 
making and the overly broad exemption for publicly available information. Those remain valid. 

1.3  On the access by public authorities to data transferred to the U.S. under the 

Privacy Shield 

12. 

The EDPB welcomes the appointments of the last missing members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties 
Oversight Board (PCLOB), enabling it to be fully functioning and operational, as well as its increased 
transparency concerning its work plan. 

13. 

The EDPB also welcomes the appointment of Mr Keith Krach, as “permanent” Ombudsperson on 18 
January 2019. 

14.  Despite these developments, some of the main points of concern, already expressed by the WP29 

and the EDPB in this area in their previous reports, still have to be fully resolved. 

Adopted  

5 

15.  More  specifically, the  collection and access of personal data for national security purposes  under 

both Section 702 of FISA3 and Executive Order 12 3334 still remains an important issue for the EDPB. 

16. 

17. 

In this respect, the EDPB recalls that it continues to consider that within the surveillance programs, 
more  specific  safeguards  would  be  needed,  e.g.  for  precise  targeting  to  determine  whether  an 
individual or a group can be a target of surveillance and for stricter scrutiny of individual targets by an 
independent authority ex-ante. 

In addition, although it acknowledges the efforts that the PCLOB has undertaken to follow-up on its 
past  recommendations  concerning  section  702  FISA,  as  well  as  to  issue  a  new  report  on  the  FBI’s 
querying of data under Section 702, the EDPB deeply regrets that the PCLOB will not issue further 
reports on PPD-285 to follow up on the first report in order to provide additional elements as to how 
the  safeguards  of  PPD-28  are  applied,  as  well  as  a  general  updated  report  on  Section  702  FISA, 
especially since it was reauthorized with few adjustments since the last Joint Review. The EDPB indeed 
recalls, as the WP29 did before, that reports of the PCLOB were very useful to feed the assessment led 
by the WP29 and by the EDPB and would in particular be useful to assess whether the collection of 
data under Section 702 is not indiscriminate and access is not conducted on a generalized basis under 
the  UPSTREAM  program,  and  for  assessing  the  necessity  and  proportionality  of  the  definition  of 
“targets”,  the  tasking  of  selectors  under  Section  702  (including  in  the  context  of  the  UPSTREAM 
program6), as well as the concrete process of application of selectors in the context of the UPSTREAM 
program to clarify whether massive access to data occurs in this context. Concerning the application 
of Executive Order 12 333 to EU data transferred to the U.S., the EDPB will welcome the finalization 
by PCLOB of its awaited reports on EO 12 333. However, as the EDPB understands that these reports 
will most  likely remain classified, they may not be used as a relevant source of information on the 
concrete operation of this Executive Order and on its necessity and proportionality. 

18.  Access  to  such  reports  would  allow  the  EDPB  to  provide  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  these 
aspects. It consequently stresses that, in order to perform more meaningful reviews, it could benefit 
from accessing to additional documents and discussing additional classified elements, following the 
examples of PNR or TFTP reviews.  

                                                           
3 See the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.) (FISA) – its section 702 allows for data to 
be collected from non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States in order to obtain foreign 
intelligence information (50 U.S. Code §1881a (D)(1)) 
4 See footnote 59 of the Privacy Shield Adequacy Decision: “E.O.  12333:  United  States Intelligence Activities, 
Federal Register Vol. 40, No 235 (8 December 1981). To the extent that the Executive Order is publicly accessible, 
it defines the goals, directions, duties and responsibilities of U.S. intelligence efforts (including the role of the 
various Intelligence Community elements) and sets out the general parameters for the conduct of intelligence 
activities (in particular the need to promulgate specific procedural rules). According to Sec. 3.2 of E.O. 12333, the 
President,  supported  by  the  National  Security  Council,  and  the  DNI  shall  issue  such  appropriate  directives, 
procedures and guidance as are necessary to implement the order.“ 
5 “PPD-28 is a directive of the President of the United States laying down consistency principles with which signals 
intelligence collection shall be authorised and conducted but PPD-28 is not a  legal basis for collection“  – See 
Opinion 01/2016 on the EU – U.S. Privacy Shield draft adequacy decision of the WP 29 as well as annex VI of the 
Privacy Shield Decision 
6 See WP29 report on the Privacy Shield of 28 November 2017 (page 15): “Two programs are confirmed to be 
operating  under  Section  702  of  FISA:  PRISM  and  UPSTREAM.  (…)Under  PRISM,  the  relevant  U.S.  authorities 
require internet service providers to provide them with the data of their users corresponding to “selectors”, once 
“tasked” by the competent authority.  
Under the UPSTREAM program, the providers of the telecommunication backbone are required to assist the NSA 
by identifying and collecting transiting data “to” and “from” a chosen “selector” in the flow of communications 
between communication service providers.”

Adopted  

19.  Due in particular to the problematic admissibility threshold of the “standing requirement”, the redress 
by EU citizens before U.S. courts is still to be effectively guaranteed. Therefore, the EDPB will continue 
to follow closely the evolution of the case law.  

20.  Hence, the independence of the Ombudsperson remains a key element, as this institution is designed 

to compensate the uncertainty in seeking effective redress before the court, if not the lack thereof.  

21.  During the third annual review, it was clarified that any violation of the targeting and minimisation 
procedures under Section 702 FISA would be reported to the FISC by the Ombudsperson, in which case 
the FISC may decide to issue a deficiency order. Despite further discussions on the procedural aspects 
of the (inadmissible) first case referred to the Ombudsperson by the EU Centralized Body earlier this 
year,  as  well  as  on  hypothetical  cases  which  brought  some  clarifications,  the  exact  powers  of  the 
Ombudsperson  still  need  to  be  clarified,  through  the  declassification  of  internal  procedures 
concerning the interactions between the Ombudsperson and the other elements of the intelligence 
community or oversight bodies. Based on the information provided so far, the EDPB is of the view that 
the  Ombudsperson’s  access  to  information,  which  appears  to  remain  indirect,  and  its  powers  to 
remedy  non-compliance  vis-à-vis  the  intelligence  authorities,  are  still  not  sufficient  in  the  light  of 
Article 47  EU  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights.  It  also  underlines  that  the  Ombudsperson  is  not  in  a 
position to bring a matter before the court other than to bring a violation of Section 702 FISA to the 
attention of the FISC. 

22. 

Finally, regarding the access to data for law enforcement purposes, the EDPB underlines its remaining 
concerns  on  the  available  effective  remedies  for  individuals  in  cases  where  the  personal  data 
processed by companies are accessed by law enforcement authorities.  

23. 

1.4  Conclusion 
The EDPB welcomes the efforts made by the U.S. authorities and the Commission to implement the 
Privacy Shield, especially ex officio oversight and enforcement actions, as well as the appointments 
of the last missing members of the PCLOB and of a permanent Ombudsperson. 

24.  However, the EDPB still has a number of significant concerns that need to be addressed by both the 

Commission and the U.S. authorities. 

25.  As regards the commercial aspects, the absence of substantial checks remains a concern of the EDPB. 
Other  areas that  require further attention are the application of the Privacy Shield requirements 
regarding  onward  transfers,  HR  data  and  the  application  of  the  principles  when  it  comes  to 
processors, as well as the recertification process. More generally, the members of the Review Team 
would benefit from a broader access to non-public information, concerning commercial aspects and 
ongoing  investigations.  In  addition,  the  EDPB  recalls  the  remaining  issues  with  respect  to  certain 
elements of the commercial part of the Privacy Shield adequacy decision as already raised in the WP 
29’s Opinion 01/2016. 

26.  As regards the collection of data by public authorities, the EDPB can only encourage the PCLOB to 
issue  and  publish  further  reports.  It  regrets  that  on  Section  702  FISA  no  general  report  is 
contemplated, to provide an assessment of the changes brought since the last reauthorization in 2018. 
The EDPB would be very interested on an additional report on PPD-28 to follow up on the first report 
including an assessment of how the safeguards of PPD-28 are applied Finally, the EDPB underlines the 
importance of reports on Executive Order 12 333, and regrets that those reports will most likely remain 
classified. In this regard, the EDPB stresses that the members of the review team only have access to 
the same documents as the general public. The EDPB recalls that the security cleared experts of the 

Adopted  

7 

EDPB remain ready to review additional documents and discuss additional classified elements, in 
order to have more meaningful reviews, following the example of PNRs or TFTP reviews. 

27.  On the Ombudsperson mechanism, despite some new elements provided during this year’s review, 
especially on the procedural aspects in relation to the first case submitted to the Ombudsperson but 
declared inadmissible, as well as on hypothetical cases, the EDPB is still not in a position to conclude 
that the Ombudsperson is vested with sufficient powers to access information and to remedy non-
compliance.  Thus,  it  still  cannot  state  that  the  Ombudsperson  can  be  considered  an  “effective 
remedy before a tribunal” in the meaning of Art. 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. 

28. 

Finally,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  the  same  concerns  will  be  addressed  by  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the 
European Union in cases that are still pending before it.

INTRODUCTION 

29.  On 6 October 20157, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Safe Harbor adequacy decision after 
having  recalled  the  important  role  played  by  the  protection  of  personal  data  in  the  light  of  the 
fundamental right to respect for private life and the large number of persons whose fundamental rights 
are  liable  to  be  infringed  where  personal  data  is  transferred  to  a  third  country  not  ensuring  an 
adequate level of protection. Soon after, the Commission started negotiations for a new  adequacy 
decision and presented a draft adequacy decision with its annexes. 

30.  On the 13 April 2016, the Working Party 29 issued an opinion8 on the draft new adequacy decision 
aiming at  replacing the  invalidated Safe  Harbor. On the  same day, the WP29 also issued a working 
document9  on  the  justification  of  interferences  with  the  fundamental  rights  to  privacy  and  data 
protection  through  surveillance  measures  when  transferring  personal  data  (European  Essential 
Guarantees). 

31.  On  30  May  2016,  the  European  Data  Protection  Supervisor  also  issued  an  Opinion  on  the  draft 

adequacy decision10.  

32.  On 12 July 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield adequacy decision11 
(“Privacy  Shield”),  which  has  also  been  incorporated  into  the  EEA  Agreement12.  The  Privacy  Shield 
entrusts the Commission with the task to assess the findings of the adequacy decision, including on 
the basis of the factual information collected in the context of an Annual Joint Review13. Important 
concerns on both the commercial aspects and aspects relating to government access to personal data 
transferred under the Privacy Shield for the purposes of Law Enforcement and National Security had 
then to be addressed and further assessed in the context of the Joint Review. 

33. 

34. 

35. 

In addition, it is also foreseen in recital 147 of this adequacy decision that the Commission will meet a 
number of US authorities, and that the “participation in this meeting will be open for EU DPAs and 
representatives of the Article 29 Working Party”.   

The WP 29 also issued a report following the first Joint Review of the Privacy Shield in November 201714 
as well as a second report following the second Joint Review in January 201915. 

The third Joint Review of the Privacy Shield took place on the 12 and 13 September 2019 in Washington 
D.C.  Eight  representatives  of  the  EDPB,  a  Commissioner  as  well  as  experts  at  staff  level,  were

Adopted  

designated to be part of the Review Team (“the Review Team”) that accompanied the Commission 
during  this  two-day  meeting  with  U.S.  authorities,  companies’  representatives,  NGOs  and  a 
representative from the binding arbitration mechanism. 

36. 

In  advance  to  the  Joint  Review,  the  Commission  sent  questionnaires  to  US  trade  associations 
representing Privacy Shield certified organizations and NGOs, as well as a detailed agenda to organize 
the discussions with the US authorities and stakeholders during the Joint Review itself. The EDPB sent 
contributions to take part to the elaboration of these documents.  

37.  Right before the Joint Review, the Commission and the Review Team met with some of the NGOs to 

further discuss their input on the Privacy Shield. 

38.  Also, briefly before the actual Joint Review took place in Washington, the EU-Supervisory Authorities 
representatives  were  contacted  by  the  DoC  to  informally  discuss  the  existing  divergences  on  the 
interpretation of the notion of HR Data (see I. 7.) 

39. 

The new factual elements presented by the US authorities  companies’ representatives, NGOs and by 
a representative from the binding arbitration mechanism participating in the Joint Review, stemming 
both from written submissions, as well as from oral contributions during the Joint Review itself, are 
presented in annex to this document. They were presented at the EDPB Plenary on 8 October 2019.  

3  ON THE COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF THE PRIVACY SHIELD 

40. 

41. 

3.1  Guidance for the companies adhering to the Privacy Shield 
The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is an adequacy decision that was designed to frame transfers of personal 
data outside the protections provided under GDPR to ensure the level of protection of natural persons 
guaranteed by GDPR  is not  undermined in the absence of a general law  in the US providing for an 
essentially equivalent level of protection of personal data. It is of utmost importance that there is a 
common understanding of the text to ensure the application in the receiving State will correspond to 
the requirements for such transfers as set out under EU data protection law. It has to be ensured that 
this text is interpreted correctly and that organizations and individuals on both sides of the Atlantic are 
“on the same page” as regards their duties and rights under the Privacy Shield. 

Thus, in the report of the first annual review the WP 29 emphasized the need for clear guidance on the 
application  of  the  Privacy  Shield  principles.  In  the  second  year  of  operation  of  the  framework  and 
following informal consultation of members of the ITS at working level, the DoC has issued guidance 
in  the  form  of  FAQs  on  the  Accountability  for  Onward  Transfer  Principle16  and  the  notion  of 
Processor17 and published it on its website. In the third year of operation of the framework the DoC 
issued one more guiding document also in the form of FAQs on the Privacy Shield and the UK aiming 
at issues related to Brexit. The EDPB has not been involved in any way in the drafting of these new 
FAQs. 

42. 

Since the last joint review, not much additional guidance was published by the US authorities. In this 
regard,  the  EDPB  recalls  in  particular  that  guidance  concerning  processors  may  further  specify  the

application  of  the  principles  when  it  comes  to  processors  (“agents”).18.  Also,  the  use  of  Standard 
Contractual Clauses as a tool for onward transfers remains to be examined. 

The EDPB still regards the issuance of guidance as a good start and expects that in the future there will 
be more guidance as to other key elements. In previous reports, the EDPB already suggested to further 
work  for  example  the  Choice  Principle  (on  when  and  how  a  data  subject  can  opt  out  from  the 
processing of his/her data for a new purpose), or on the  application of the Notice Principle (more 
specifically on the timing for certified organizations to give notice to individuals). In addition, it recalls 
that a clarification of the scope of the right of access could be helpful to prevent misunderstandings. 
In its last report, worries regarding the possibly very narrowly interpreted duty to grant the right of 
access only to data that is “stored” by an organization voiced by the WP 29 still remains valid.  

3.2  Clear and easily available information for EU individuals 
The WP 29 had found that to complement the specific information provided in concrete cases by the 
companies themselves, the US authorities should strive to offer more information in an accessible and 
easily  understandable  form  to  the  individuals  regarding  their  rights  and  available  recourses  and 
remedies.  

The Privacy Shield website already had a specific section named “EU and Swiss individuals” containing 
subsections “My rights under Privacy Shield” and “Privacy Shield participants list”19 where individuals 
were informed about their rights. The various possibilities to lodge complaints were also explained and 
partly  supported  by  direct  links.  After  the  first  annual  review  and  as  a  response  to  the  WP  29s 
suggestions the DoC added a one-page document to their website that gives individuals an overview20 
of the program with a strong focus on the individual’s rights and how they can be exercised. The EDPB 
acknowledges  the  efforts  made  by  the  DoC  to  provide  further  guidance  for  EU  individuals  on  the 
Privacy Shield website. Although the number of complaints slightly increased since the last report, it 
remains  difficult  to  determine  whether  this  is  directly  linked  to  this  guidance.  The  EDPB  will  thus 
remain watchful. 

3.3  Self-(Re)Certification Process and Cooperation between U.S. authorities in the 

Privacy Shield mechanism 

46.  After having noted improvements in the certification process in the report of the second Joint Review, 

the EDPB did not identify any relevant change of the procedures in the third Joint Review: 

47. 

The  DoC  still  reviews  all  self-certifications  (both  for  first  time  applicants  and  for  recertification 
submissions) and checks: 

1.  Registration with an Independent recourse mechanism (IRM) company 

2.  Payment of Annex I Arbitral Fund Contribution 

                                                           
18  that  the  guidance  could  for example  further  elaborate  on  the  following  details:  Notice  to  be  provided  by 
processors needs to be in line with the contract in place between the processor and the controller; that access 
to data and a Choice mechanism could be provided to the individual directly by the processor provided however 
that the controller has in the first place authorized the processor to do so;  and that for a processor compliance 
with the Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation principle requires it to process the data only in accordance with 
the instructions from the controller and on the other hand to implement the appropriate measures as instructed 
by the controller to assist the later in complying with the data integrity principle.

Adopted  

3.  Compliance with Privacy Shield supplemental principle 6 (on access to personal information) 

4.  Completion and consistency of certification information 

5.  Privacy notices (the existence of all 13 elements required by the Privacy Shield is checked also 

in the organizations Privacy Policy) 

48.  Also, the DoC still asks the organizations for more precise links provided for the Privacy Shield listing 
so individuals can more easily exercise their rights and for more than one point of contact within the 
organization to make sure messages from the DoC are received. The DoC also checks the applications 
for inconsistencies between the privacy policy and the certification (For example HR/NON HR). 

49.  When  the  DoC  refused  to  list  an  organisation  on  the  Privacy  Shield  list,  either  for  first-time 
certifications or re-certifications, it underlined that it was  because the requirements set out by the 
Privacy Shield were not fulfilled. This indicates that the decision made by the DoC whether or not to 
list  an organization on the Privacy Shield website is  –  as far as the checks go  -  not a rubber stamp 
exercise. 

50.  However, on the basis of the information given by the US authorities during the joint reviews, those 
checks still do not go into the substance of the principles. This absence of substantial checks remains 
a concern for the EDPB on the general question of sufficient oversight regarding the substance of 
the Privacy Shield principles. 

51. 

Following  the  criticism  expressed  by  the  WP  29,  the  DoC  still  prohibits  a  first-time  applicant  from 
making  public  representations  about  participation  until  the  Privacy  Shield  Team  approves  its 
certification and instead requires an applicant to submit a draft privacy policy for review. It also directs 
an applicant to remove any premature references of their participation in the Privacy Shield program 
from their website. 

52.  Regarding  the  re-certification  process,  already  the  second  annual  review  revealed  that  due  to  the 
procedures established by the DoC there are cases where the due date displayed on the Privacy Shield 
List is already passed while the organization still is listed as an active participant. This occurs when an 
organization has submitted their recertification but the process is not finalized before the due date. In 
the third review this was further explored and it was discovered that the process of recertification 
could  take  up  to  105  days  starting  at  the  actual  due  date.  During  this  whole  period  of  time  the 
organizations will stay on the “active” list. 

53.  As long as the organizations still publicly commit to apply the Privacy Shield Principles this might not 
lead to a gap in the protection of individuals. However the EDPB reiterates that it is the reasonable 
expectation of individuals who consult the Privacy Shield list that all organizations listed as “active” 
have current and valid certification checked by the DoC. The EDPB is of the opinion that the change 
of practice to already set a new due date on the Privacy Shield list as soon as the recertification 
documents are submitted to the DoC does not lead to the result that only fully checked certifications 
are displayed as “active” on the List. The EDPB still asks the DoC to explore what can be done to 
avoid this situation (especially what can be done to guarantee that there is no gap in the protection 
of individuals) and in the meantime to add some explanation for concerned individuals and EU based 
organizations  using  the  Privacy  Shield  as  a  transfer  tool  so  the  situation  is  sufficiently  clear  to 
individuals and also organizations within the EU that would like to transfer personal data to a Privacy 
Shield certified organization and therefore check the validity of the certification on the Privacy Shield 
List.  

Adopted  

12 

54.  During the course of the third Joint review it was also discovered that on the Privacy Shield list there 
were  29  Organizations  listed  as  “active”  that  had  a  due  date  in  2018.  The  EDPB  asks  the  DoC  to 
implement procedures that make sure that the “active” list of participants is always up to date and 
to implement checks that avoid such outdated listings. 

3.4  Oversight and supervision of compliance with the Principles – Activities of the 

DoC 

55. 

In the first Joint Review report the WP 29 criticized that the oversight of the commercial aspects of 
the  Privacy  shield  mainly  relied  on  the  third  party  companies  providing  Independent  Recourse 
Mechanisms (IRMs) and that the implementation of the Privacy Shield framework lacked sufficient 
oversight and supervision of compliance in practice. Because the Privacy Shield is a program based 
on self-certification, it is of utmost importance that U.S. authorities involved in the administration of 
the  Privacy  Shield  devote  sufficient  resources  at  oversight  and  enforcement  activities.  The  WP  29 
considered that the performance of compliance reviews of organizations having self-certified to the 
Privacy  Shield  is  a  key  element  for  the  effective  functioning  of  the  framework  and  that  ex-officio 
investigations have to be conducted both by the DoC and the FTC/DoT to ensure that self-certified 
organizations concretely implement the requirements of the Privacy Shield. 

56. 

The second review showed that the U.S. authorities (namely DoC and FTC) had made significant efforts 
to address this concern: 

  On a quarterly basis the DoC conducts “false claims reviews” in order to identify organizations 
that  have  started  but  not  finished  an  initial  or  re-certification  or  that  did  not  submit  their 
annual re-certification at all. 

The identified organizations receive a certified letter from the DoC, warning them of potential 
referrals to the FTC or DoT if they do not fulfil outstanding requirements or withdraw properly 
from  the  program.  The  DoC  informs  the  FTC/DoT  of  its  intent  to  send  those  letters.  The 
organizations  have  30  days  to  respond  to  the  letter.  The  DoC  compiles  a  list  of  those 
organizations that fail to take action and respond to the letter. This procedure has led to 100 
referrals from the DoC to the FTC, 56 of those referral were made in the second year of the 
Privacy  Shield  program.  DoC  and  FTC/DoT  cooperate  throughout  the  whole  process. 
Simultaneously with the referral an organization is (at least temporarily) removed from the 
“active” Privacy Shield List.  

  As foreseen in the Privacy Shield text, the DoC also performs random web searches for false 
claims of participation in the program. Those web-searches have only led to few cases that 
were referred to the FTC. 

  The DoC has performed a sweep of 100 randomly chosen organizations. The focus of the sweep 
was  the  accessibility  of  the  Privacy  Policy,  the  responsiveness  of  the  organization  and  the 
availability  of  the  IRM.  The  DoC  sent  more  in-depth  compliance  questionnaires  to  21 
organizations that showed minor or more significant peculiarities (for example: No response 
from  the  designated  point  of  contact;  the  Privacy  policy  was  no  longer  accessible  online; 
Missing references to one or more elements of the notice principle). The organizations must 
respond within 30 days. If the response is not satisfactory, the organizations – similar to the 
procedure described above – receive a certified warning letter requiring the organization to 
indicate within a 30-day period how it has addressed the concerns. If those are not resolved 
within  the  30  days,  the  organization  is  moved  to  the  “inactive”  list  and  the  case  is  being 
referred to the FTC or DoT.  

Adopted  

13 

  The DoC  has  also  designated  1  person  to  follow  the media  and to  do  keyword searches  to 

identify possible breaches of the Privacy Shield commitments. 

  The  DoC  also  performs  regular  checks  for  broken  links  to the  privacy  policy on  the  Privacy 

Shield list. 

57. 

This year, the DoC indicated that it issued more than 670 warning letters, most of them regarding false 
claim participation. 

58.  Aside from the fact that the DoC has increased the amount of random spot checks to 30 randomly 
chosen organizations per month, the third Joint Review did not reveal any further developments in this 
direction.  

59. 

60. 

Therefore,  while  the  EDPB  still  welcomes  all  these  steps  taken  by  the  DoC  to  ensure  formal 
compliance with the Principles of the Privacy Shield because they remain a good starting point; the 
EDPB is deeply concerned that these checks still remain focused on the formalities to be complied 
with rather than on the substance. The EDPB urges the DoC to extend the oversight activities also to 
substantial elements, such as the purpose limitation principle for instance. 

Further to monitoring concrete compliance with all principles of the framework, one of the areas that 
would need particular attention in this context remains the area of onward transfers. The DoC has 
still  not  made  use  of  its  right  to  request  a  copy of  the  relevant  privacy  provisions  of  organizations 
contracts with their agents. Since onward transfers possibly lead to transfers of data outside of the 
jurisdiction of U.S. and EU authorities with possibly no data protection provided by law it is of utmost 
importance to closely monitor the practical implementation of the Accountability for the Onward 
Transfers Principle.  

3.5  Oversight and supervision of compliance with the Principles – Activities of the 

FTC 

61. 

In last year’s review the EDPB noted an increase in the FTC´s activities regarding the enforcement of 
the  Privacy  Shield.  This  year  however,  the  FTC  recognized  that  due  to  its  lack  of  budget,  it  had  to 
prioritize its actions with regards to the enforcement of Privacy rules. 

62.  While last year the FTC has brought 5 new Privacy Shield cases: 2 against organizations that did not 
complete their certification and 3 cases where the certification has lapsed. In most of those cases, the 
organization  failed  to  verify  the  deletion,  return  or  continued  application  of  the  Privacy  Shield 
Principles  to  personal  data  transferred  under  the  Privacy  Shield.  The  FTC  indicated  that  some 
investigations into potential Privacy Shield violations remain ongoing, without further clarifying their 
scope  and  the  exact  number  of  cases.  This  year  the  FTC  has  brought  7  new  cases  regarding  the 
enforcement  of  the  Privacy  Shield,  still  on  administrative  failures  and  not  on  the  substance  of  the 
Privacy Shield’s principles. The EDPB stresses that further controls concerning onward transfers could 
be led, given that the solutions put in place by the certified companies are not checked by the DoC 
either.  

63. 

64. 

In the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, Bureau of Consumer Protection there are 40 lawyers 
almost exclusively working only on privacy. They are supported by for example technical experts. 

The FTC investigates Privacy Shield-related referrals (143 discovered “false claim cases” in the third 
year)  but  in most  cases  by  the  time  these  referrals arrive  to the  FTC  they  have  been  solved  in the 
meantime so many cases fall out. 

Adopted  

14 

65.  Concerning the Facebook settlement reached since last year’s joint review, the FTC clarified that the 
scope of it remains outside the scope of the Privacy Shield as none of the products covered by the 
settlement were certified under the Safe Harbor or the Privacy Shield21.  

66. 

67. 

68. 

The EDPB still welcomes any ex officio activity to proactively monitor compliance with the Privacy 
Shield Principles undertaken by the FTC. It nevertheless regrets the low number of cases concerning 
the enforcement of the Privacy Shield and that the FTC still was unable to share any more detail on 
its approach as this leaves the EDPB unable to have a clear insight on the concrete activities and 
cases, and therefore to be in a position to assess how and to what extent the FTC ensures compliance 
monitoring with the substance of the Privacy Shield’s principles.  

Independent Recourse Mechanisms 

3.6 
The independent dispute resolution providers reported an overall increase in both the number and 
complexity  of  the  complaints  received  under  the  Privacy  Shield  framework  since  the  second  joint 
review. The EDPB acknowledges that the number of complaints slightly raised and were resolved in a 
timely manner. However, the increase of complaints in general do not entirely compensate for the lack 
of proactive checks from the competent US authorities. Indeed, from the feedback collected during 
the Joint  Review, the complaints  do not  seem to concern the issues of concerns underlined by the 
EDPB so far as they seem to mainly focus on procedural aspects. 

In the report of the second annual joint review, the EDPB expressed its expectation to see improved 
and  comparable  reports  provided  by  the  IRM  services  that  also  explain  how  possible  conflicts  of 
interests are precluded. The DoC reported that it has developed guidance to the IRMs in order to avoid 
possible conflicts  of  interests,  and  updated  its  guidance  on  Annual  IRM  report  to  include  potential 
conflicts of  interest  and  the  description  of  how  they avoid  such  situations.  However,  the  guidance 
developed and standardized forms issued do not cover all aspects of the reports. In particular, the 
EDPB found that no standardised template format for the reports have been introduced yet on this 
aspect. In order to ensure full comparability, the EDPB therefore recommends the DoC to introduce a 
standardized  template  format  for  the  Annual  IRM  report,  which  also  contains  explanation  on  how 
possible conflicts of interests are precluded.   

3.7  HR Data 

69.  As already stated in the previous reports, the notion of HR data in the context of the Privacy Shield is 
interpreted  differently  within  the  EU  and  by  the  US  authorities.  Although  the  DoC  initiated  the 
producing of guidance regarding the processing of HR data, including through informal consultation of 
members of the WP 29 and of the EDPB later on, on working level in this regard, the work on this 
guidance was not successful yet due to the absence of convergence on the definition of the notion of 
HR  data.  Last  year’s  review  thus  focused  less  on  the  definition  of  HR  data  but  rather  on  the 
consequences, the different definitions within the EU and by US authorities may lead to. On the EU 
side,  the concern  is that  additional protections granted by the Privacy Shield for employment data 
(opt-in to marketing purposes rather than opt out) would not and could not be enforced by any U.S or 
EU authority. The EDPB recalls that in its understanding, HR data should be protected in the same way 
whether they are processed by the employer or by a processor, including concerning the choice and 

                                                           
21 The effects of the immunity of the settlement  reached however remained unclear. Indeed, this immunity 
would not prevent individuals to bring actions against facebook for other products, or for practices which were 
unknown at the time of the settlement. However, should facebook adhere to the Privacy Shield in the future for 
the products covered by the settlement, without changing anything from its commitments, it is still to be clarified 
whether the immunity derived from the settlement would cover corresponding violations of the Privacy Shield 
in this context for the practices covered by the settlement.

Adopted  

purpose limitation principles. While the EU Supervisory authorities remain available to exchange with 
the US Authorities, the discussions on this issue will have to continue between the Commission and 
the  US  Authorities  given  the  different  possible  readings  of  the  wording  of  the  Privacy  Shield.    In 
parallel, the Commission is still called upon to address this issue and clarify the text in order to avoid 
that possible different interpretations lead to gaps in the protection of employees in the European 
Union. 

70. 

3.8  Automated-decision making/Profiling 
In the report of the first annual review,  the WP29 called upon the Commission to contemplate the 
possibility  to  provide  for  specific  rules  concerning  automated  decision making  to  provide  sufficient 
safeguards including the right to know the logic involved and to request reconsideration on a non-
automated basis, especially after having explored the extent of the practical relevance of automated 
decision making processes by Privacy Shield certified companies if the analysis generates an actual 
need for additional safeguards. 

71.  As part of the second review the Commission presented the main elements of a study22 commissioned 
to an independent contractor regarding the existence of automated decision-making on the basis of 
personal data that has been transferred from the EU to Privacy Shield certified companies in the US. 
While  the  authors  of  the  study  highlight  a  series  of  challenges  for  conducting  this  work  (limited 
availability of experts on the  topic and reservations to take part in interviews, limited relevance of 
answers in certain cases, opacity characterizing the data industry on such practices notably), the main 
conclusion  that  can  be  drawn  from  the  study  is  that  automated  decisions  (in  the  narrow  GDPR 
definition of decisions having legal effects on individuals or similarly significantly affecting them) are 
not taken on the basis of data transferred from the EU. According to the study, such decisions are more 
likely to take place in “EU customer facing” situations (i.e. where the US company directly targets EU 
customers).  

72.  However, the study at the same time underlined that this is a fast developing area which still has to be 
closely monitored in the future, therefore this issue was also discussed at the third annual joint review. 

73. 

In their reply to the questionnaire sent by the Commission in preparation to the third joint review, one 
trade association reported that member companies that employ automated decision-making included 
information  about  this  in  their  policies  and  maintain  mechanisms  to  allow  consumers  to  exercise 
control, such as the ability to contest an automated decision and seek human review. 

74.  During the third joint review, the FTC confirmed that the U.S. adheres to the OECD Recommendation 

on AI [adopted on 22 May 2019].  

75. 

The FTC specified that companies are not required to provide the right to know the logic involved and 
to  request  reconsideration  on  a  non-automated  basis  under  the  Privacy  Shield  (and  therefore,  to 
include a reference in this regard in the privacy policy submitted pursuant to the Privacy Shield). If 
companies do commit themselves to provide these rights, but then, contrary to this commitment, they 
do  not  provide  them,  this  will  constitute  a  misrepresentation,  against  which  the  FTC  can  take 
enforcement action. In the area of consumer credit, the FTC referred to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
(FCRA). 

76.  Based on the findings of the third joint review, the EDPB is on the opinion that it is important that 
the Commission continues monitoring cases related to automated decision making and profiling and

4  ON THE DEROGATIONS TO THE PRIVACY SHIELD TO ALLOW ACCESS 

TO DATA FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
PURPOSES 

Introduction 

4.1 
Since the second Joint Review, the US legal framework has not substantially changed. 

77. 

78.  Consequently, some of the main points of concern that the WP29 and the EDPB expressed in their 
previous  opinions,  in  the  area  of  access  to  data  transferred  under  the  Privacy  Shield  for  national 
security or law enforcement purposes, have not been fully resolved. These main concerns are related 
to  the  collection  of  data,  to  oversight,  to  judicial  redress  and  finally,  to  the  Ombudsperson 
mechanism. This calls for a reminder of the EDPB’s analysis.   

79. 

In addition, this year’s joint review took place at the time the “Schrems II” case, also concerning the 
Privacy Shield, is pending before the CJEU (the Court held the hearings on this case on 9 July 2019). 

80.  Also  taking  this  background  into  account,  specific  points  were  discussed  with  the  U.S.  authorities 
during the Privacy Shield Review (See infra, in particular concerning PPD28, when data are collected 
outside the US). 

4.2  Collection of data (under section 702 and under EO 12333)  

81.  As recalled in the previous reports, the CJEU underlined in its Schrems judgment23 that the “protection 
of the fundamental right to respect for private life at EU level requires derogations and limitations in 
relation to the protection of personal data to apply only in so far as is strictly necessary”24 and ruled 
that “legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content 
of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right 
to respect for private life, as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter”25. 

82. 

83. 

The  previous  concerns  expressed  therefore  remain  relevant,  as  the  legal  framework  has  not 
significantly changed on any of the aspects concerning the collection of data from the perspective of 
EU individuals (and non-US persons). Therefore, the EDPB recalls the concerns expressed in this respect 
in the two previous reports. 

4.2.1  Collection of data for national security purposes under Section 702 
The  EDPB  stresses  once  again  the  need  for  independent  assessment  on  the  necessity  and 
proportionality of the definition of “targets” and of the concept of “foreign intelligence” under section 
702  FISA  (including  in  the  context  of  the  UPSTREAM  program),  and  maintains  its  call  for  further 
independent  assessment  of  the  process  of  application  of  selectors  in  specific  cases  (“tasking  of 
selectors”). It also maintains its call for further clarification in the context of the UPSTREAM program 
to exclude that massive and indiscriminate access to personal data of non-U.S. persons takes place.  

                                                           
23 Case C-362/14, 5 October 2015 
24 See recital 92, See also cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger, recital 52. 
25 See recital 94. 

Adopted  

17 

84.  With regard to 702 FISA, it was clarified during the discussions of this year’s Review that a “person” to 
be identified as a target could refer to several individuals using the same identifier, provided that all 
these individuals would be non-U.S. persons and fulfill the applicable criteria for being targeted26.  

85. 

The EDPB welcomes that the now fully functional Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), 
as an independent oversight agency, has decided “to review the FBI’s querying (searching) of data 
obtained pursuant to Section 702” as well as the fact that the PCLOB indicated it would follow-up 
how the previous recommendations expressed in their report concerning section 702 were taken 
into  account.  However,  it  regrets  that  PCLOB  does  not  intend  to  prepare  and  issue  an  updated 
general report on Section 702, building on the report issued in 2014, especially given that since then 
section 702 was reauthorized. A general updated report would help provide an assessment of the 
new provisions inserted in Section 702 in the context of its reauthorization, as well as on the practice 
of other agencies than the FBI, in particular intelligence agencies. 

86. 

4.2.2  Collection of data for national security purposes under Executive Order 12333 
In the context  of the third Joint  Review,  given the disagreements between the EDPB and the US 
authorities as to the relevance of Executive Order 12333 for the adequacy decision, the application 
of Executive Order 12333 was still not further discussed. 

87.  As underlined in the previous reports, the EDPB maintains the WP29 long-standing position that the 
analysis of the laws of the third-country for which adequacy is considered, should not be limited to the 
law  and  practice  allowing  for  surveillance  within  that  country’s  physical  borders,  but  should  also 
include an analysis of the legal grounds in that third country’s law which allow it to conduct surveillance 
outside its territory as far as EU data are concerned. Necessary limitations to governmental access to 
data should extend to personal data “on its way” to the country, for which adequacy is recognized. 
The  EDPB  recalled  this  position  before  the  CJEU27.  During  the  previous  Joint  Reviews,  the  U.S. 
authorities underlined that Executive Order 12333 could not be used as a basis for collection of data 
inside the U.S. territory and that they consider that collection of data under this Executive Order falls 
outside the scope of the Privacy Shield. 

88.  Once again, given the uncertainty and unforeseeability of how EO 12333 is applied, the EDPB stresses 
the importance of the awaited PCLOB’s reports on this text. However it understands that they are likely 
to remain classified, so that no further information on the concrete operation of this Executive Order 
and  on  its  necessity  and  proportionality  would  become  available  neither  to  the  public,  nor  to  the 
Review team of the EDPB. 

89. 

4.2.3  Safeguards provided in Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28) 
The  U.S.  authorities  confirmed  once  again  their  commitment  to  comply  with  the  rules  set  in  the 
Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28). The EDPB welcomes this commitment. At the same time, the 
EDPB stresses that the PPD-28 provides for the only safeguards and limits to the collection and use of 
data collected outside the U.S., as the limitations of FISA or other more specific U.S. law do not apply. 
These limitations mainly concern the collection of data, as the signal intelligence activities have to be 
as “tailored as feasible”. 

90.  No new substantial discussion took place in the context of the  third joint Review, concerning the 
interpretation  and  application  of  the  six  purposes  allowing  for  the  use  of  data  foreseen  in  this 
Directive, or relating to the amount of personal data collected by the U.S., that would allow a validation 

                                                           
26 For instance, this could cover for a couple using the same email address or the members of an organization 
using the same communication app account.

Adopted  

of the commitments and the assurances provided by U.S. authorities. In the context of this year’s Joint 
Review,  discussions  mainly  focused  on  the  interpretation  and  application  of  the  additional  ground 
(situation/scenario) for bulk collection foreseen by the first sentence of footnote 5 of Section 2 PPD-
2828, which provides that “The limitations contained in this section do not apply to signals intelligence 
data that is temporarily acquired to facilitate targeted collection.” The U.S. authorities explained the 
meaning of “signals intelligence data that is temporarily acquired to facilitate targeted collection”. The 
EDPB understood from these discussions that this footnote means that data may be collected in bulk 
-  and regardless  of the six purposes  foreseen in Section 2  -  if collected temporarily,  with a view  to 
establishing an identifier for a defined target. This would thus be an additional ground to collect data 
in bulk, and in this case general principles of Section 1 of PPD-28 would still apply. The EDPB regrets 
that  the  notion  of  “temporarily”  could  not  be  further  specified,  as  in  the  EDPB’s  understanding,  it 
appeared to mean that as long as the target has not been identified, bulk collection could continue. 

91. 

92. 

The EDPB also recalls that a more detailed follow-up report on how the key terms of the PPD-28 are 
practically understood and applied in the different surveillance programs would be welcome, since it 
could provide additional information clarifying these aspects. 

In  addition,  although  the  U.S.  authorities  claimed  that  Executive  Orders  and  Presidential  Policy 
Directives have “the force of law”, the EDPB recalls that in the context of the previous Joint Reviews, 
it was also clarified that these violations of the instruments can never be - in themselves - relied upon 
for an action by an individual before a Court. Therefore, it would not be possible for an EU individual 
to directly invoke the violation of PPD-28 safeguards to bring an action before a U.S. Court.  

93. 

4.3  Oversight 
The EDPB recalls that comprehensive oversight of all surveillance programs is crucial, which the CJEU 
and the ECtHR have also emphasized in the respective jurisprudence. 

94.  Already during the two previous annual Joint Reviews, the oversight activities of several entities were 
presented. The EDPB considered that a comprehensive oversight structure is in place, composed of 
different  elements  that  are  in  part,  independent  from  the  Intelligence  Community,  including  the 
Privacy and Civil Liberty officers, the Inspector Generals, the PCLOB, the FISC and Congress, amongst 
others. 

95. 

The EDPB welcomes the appointment of the last missing members of the PCLOB. The PCLOB is now 
fully functioning and operational. The PCLOB also presented, for the first time, its work program, 
and the EDPB welcomes this step in terms of transparency from this oversight body. As emphasized 
before, the EDPB considers the PCLOB, whose recommendations have been an important contribution 
to reforms in the U.S. and whose reports have been particularly helpful to understand the functioning 
of the various programs, as an independent body, an essential element of the oversight structure. The 
EDPB calls again for public reports to be published, including on crucial aspects of the U.S. legislation 
such as the three reports (one of which only is already finalized) on EO 12333, especially since the 
functioning of this piece of legislation could never be discussed during the joint reviews. In this context, 
the  EDPB  also  regrets  that,  although  the  PCLOB  indicated  it  would  follow-up  how  the  previous 
recommendations expressed in their report concerning section 702 were taken into account (see supra 
as well), no general updates of previous reports will be prepared, be it on Section 702 FISA or on PPD-
28.  Furthermore,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  in  the  context  of  joint  reviews  organized  for  other  EU 
instruments such as for PNR agreements or for the TFTP agreement, members of the Review Team are 

                                                           
28  Which  applies  only  to  Executive  Order  12 333  and  not  to  Section  702  FISA,  which  does  not  allow  bulk 
collection. 

19 

Adopted  

given access to more information than the general public. However, in the case of the Privacy Shield 
joint reviews, the members of the review team only have access to the same documents as the general 
public.  They  recall  that  they  remain  ready  to  review  additional  documents  and  discuss  additional 
elements under security clearance, in order to have more meaningful reviews. 

4.4  Redress for EU individuals 

96.  As already highlighted in the previous reports, the EDPB underlines that in its Schrems ruling, the CJEU 
stressed the importance to have a right to an effective remedy before a tribunal29. A third-country can 
only be considered as providing an adequate level of protection in accordance with the GDPR, where 
EU  individuals  have  access  to  an  independent  and  impartial  redress  body,  including  in  surveillance 
matters. 

97.  As  the  U.S.  government  informed  during  this  year’s  Joint  Review  that  the  legal  framework  is 
unchanged and no significant new case law concerning these matters needed to be considered, the 
EDPB recalls its position and the relevant criteria to take into account when assessing the level of 
adequacy are still those stemming from the jurisprudence of the CJEU and ECtHR.  

98.  As  repeatedly  stressed  in  the  previous  reports,  while  the  APA  and  FISA  appear  to  provide  limited 
grounds for an EU individual to challenge surveillance in U.S. courts, the principal problem appears to 
concern the “standing requirement”. 

99.  Under the procedural requirements as currently interpreted by the U.S. courts, it appears to be difficult 
and uncertain that an EU individual could satisfy the procedural requirement of standing when bringing 
a suit concerning a surveillance measure on the basis of section 702 FISA or EO 12333. The EDPB will 
therefore  continue  to  follow  closely  the  evolution  of  these  cases  as  they  could  trigger  the 
establishment of new additional guarantees having a positive impact on the effectiveness of judicial 
redress  offered  to  EU  individuals  before  U.S.  courts.  However,  as  was  confirmed  during  the  Joint 
Reviews, the interpretation of the notion of “standing” in surveillance matters is evolving with cases 
still pending30.   

4.5  Ombudsperson mechanism 

100.  In the context of the third Joint Review, the EDPB welcomed the nomination of Mr Keith Krach, on 

18 January 2019, as “permanent” Ombudsperson 

101.  The Ombudsperson mechanism aims at complementing the possibilities of redress. More critically, it 
might be argued that it is meant to compensate for the uncertainty or unlikeliness to seek effective 
redress before a U.S. court in surveillance matters. The WP29 therefore welcomed the establishment 
of the Ombudsperson, as this could constitute a significant improvement in terms of protection of the 
rights and freedoms of EU individuals with regards to U.S. intelligence activities. In addition, it was 
confirmed  that  the  PPD-28  does  not  create  enforceable  rights  for  the  individuals  (see  supra).  The 
Ombudsperson mechanism provides the only way for EU individuals to ask for a verification that the 
relevant  authorities  have  complied  with  the  requirements  of  this  instrument  by  asking  the 
Ombudsperson to refer the matter to the competent authorities, which include the Inspector General, 
to check the internal policies of these authorities.  

102.  Having regard to Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the threshold 
for independence and impartiality required in a redress mechanism such as the Ombudsperson is high. 

                                                           
29 See paragraph 95 
30 See in particular cases ACLU v. Clapper, and Wikimedia v. NSA. 

Adopted  

20 

Having analysed the jurisprudence of the ECtHR in particular, the WP29, in its Opinion of 13 April 2016, 
and the EDPB assessed the Ombudsperson mechanism in their opinions and in previous reports, and 
suggested  that  the  appointment  of  a  high-ranking  official  in  the  Department  of  State  as  the 
Ombudsperson, who can be  dismissed  at  any  time without  notice,  is  problematic  having regard  to 
aforesaid  requirements  of  independence  and  impartiality31.This  concern  is  also  raised  by  the 
designation, as Ombudsperson, of Mr Keith Krach, given the fact that he is the Under Secretary of State 
for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment. 

103.  In addition, the EDPB recalls that during the first and the second Joint Reviews, as well as before the 
EDPB Plenary in July 2018, the previous Ombudsperson and the U.S. government explained in some 
detail  the  important  work  done  in  order  to  ensure  that  requests  would  be  handled  lawfully  and 
efficiently.  The  previous  Ombudspersons  also  stressed  that  they  needed  to  be  convinced  of  the 
findings before responding to the request and underlined that they could escalate the issue should 
they be unconvinced by the outcome presented to them following the assessment of a request. These 
aspects were confirmed by the new Ombudsperson, who also underlined his personal commitment to 
only sign letters to close cases when convinced that they had been dealt with in a proper way. While 
the EDPB still has no reason to doubt the integrity of the new Ombudsperson, it recalls its expectation 
to learn more about  the powers of the Ombudsperson vis-à-vis the Intelligence Community. This 
information still remains partial. The procedures governing the access to relevant information by the 
Ombudsperson and governing the interactions of the Ombudsperson with the other members of the 
Intelligence Community, including the oversight bodies, remain partially classified. 

104.  As  the  first  case  referred  to  the  Ombudsperson  mechanism  since  the  second  Joint  review  was 
eventually  declared  inadmissible  because  it  concerned  data  transferred  outside  the  scope  of  the 
Privacy Shield, the case has not allowed to further discuss in detail how cases are handled under the 
procedures in place after the preliminary assessment of the admissibility of a case.  

105.  Nevertheless, the staff of the Office of the Ombudsperson explained in abstract how an admissible 
case would be handled. In this context, it was explained that violations of Section 702 FISA would also 
be reported to the FISC, which may decide to issue deficiency order to have it remedied within 30 days. 

106.  Questioned about his role in the Ombudsperson mechanism, the Inspector General for the Intelligence 
Community (“IG”) confirmed that the first complaint sent to the Ombudsperson was shared with him, 
and that more generally in the context of requests sent by the Ombudsperson, he would, depending 
on the circumstances of the case, refer it to the competent intelligence agency, and that a remedy 
could be proposed to the ODNI. It was recalled that in case of an acknowledged incident, collection 
stops, the underlying information has to be purged, and, if any reports were based on that information, 
these reports must be recalled (this is a standard procedure for reports in this domain). He added that 
Congress  would  also  be 
informed  about  recommendations  and  about  cases  where  the 
recommendation is not  followed through. Further, the  IG explained that the  Ombudsperson would 
also be informed of the findings and recommendations to the ODNI necessary for the Ombudsperson 
to perform his duties. Nevertheless, the IG confirmed that in his report to the Ombudsperson, he could 
remove  information  from  the  report  to  the  ODNI  in  order  to  protect  sources  and  other  sensitive 
information. As a consequence, the information shared with the Ombudsperson may not necessarily 
be identical to the information shared with the ODNI. 

107.  With regard to the first case under the Ombudsperson mechanism, the EDPB is committed to  assess 

its internal processes in light of the experiences made and to adapt them, if need be. 

                                                           
31 See WP29 Opinion ‘European Essential Guarantees’, Guarantee C, referring among others to ECtHR, Zakharov. 

21 

Adopted  

108.  In  conclusion,  based  on  the  available  information,  the  EDPB  still  doubts  that  the  powers  of  the 
Ombudsperson to remedy non-compliance vis-a-vis the intelligence authorities are sufficient, as his 
“power”  seems  to  be  limited  to  decide  not  to  confirm  compliance  towards  the  petitioner.  In  the 
understanding  of  the  EDPB,  the  Ombudsperson  is  not  vested  with  powers,  which  courts  or  other 
similarly independent bodies would usually be granted to fulfill their role. Therefore, the EDPB remains 
unable to hold that the Ombudsperson is vested with adequate powers to effectively exercise its duty. 
In addition, the EDPB recalls that the decisions of the Ombudsperson cannot be brought to court for 
judicial  review.Therefore,  the  lack  of  judicial  review  of  the  decisions  of  the  Ombudsperson,  and 
consequently  the  impossibility  to  obtain  remedies  where  the  Ombudsperson  will  not  provide  any 
answer (failure to act) or provides an unsatisfactory reply to the complainant, still remains a concern. 
As a conclusion, the EDPB is not in a position to conclude that the Ombudsperson is vested with 
sufficient  independence,  and  with  sufficient  powers  to  access  information  and  to  remedy  non-
compliance. Thus, it cannot state that the Ombudsperson can be considered an “effective remedy 
before a tribunal” in the meaning of Art. 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights32.   

4.6  Access to data for law enforcement purposes 

109.  As  regards  access  to  data  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  the  EDPB  continues  to  note  that  the 
procedural safeguards inherent to the criminal procedure (notably, due process) imply that data are 
accessed by the competent public authorities for a specific purpose and that the individual concerned 
is notified if her or his  data have been accessed within the framework of a criminal proceeding, in the 
context of which they can raise objections to the collection and use of such data and have access to 
judicial redress. 

110.  However,  the  EDPB  recalls  the  concerns  -  already  expressed  in  the  previous  opinion  issued  by  the 
WP2933- regarding the availability of effective remedies to the individuals concerned in cases where 
the data processed by companies is accessed by law enforcement authorities34. 

5  CONCLUSION 

111.  The EDPB welcomes the efforts made by the U.S. authorities and the Commission to implement the 
Privacy Shield, especially ex officio oversight and enforcement actions, as well as the appointments 
of the last missing members of the PCLOB and of a permanent Ombudsperson. 

112.  However, the EDPB still has a number of significant concerns that need to be addressed by both the 

Commission and the U.S. authorities. 

113.  As regards the commercial aspects, the absence of substantial checks remains a concern of the EDPB. 
Other  areas that  require further attention are the application of the Privacy Shield requirements 
regarding  onward  transfers,  HR  data  and  the  application  of  the  principles  when  it  comes  to 
processors, as well as the recertification process. More generally, the members of the Review Team 
would benefit from a broader access to non-public information, concerning commercial aspects and 
ongoing  investigations.  In  addition,  the  EDPB  recalls  the  remaining  issues  with  respect  to  certain 

                                                           
32 A first request from an EU individual was received under the Ombudsperson mechanism at the end of 2018. 
33 See WP 238.  
34 Concerning access to data for law enforcement purposes, we also pointed out, supra, at Section 2.1 of this 
Report/Conclusions, to the possible access (querying) by law enforcement authorities to data acquired under 
Section 702 FISA. 

22 

Adopted  

elements of the commercial part of the Privacy Shield adequacy decision as already raised in the WP 
29’s Opinion 01/2016. 

114.  As regards the collection of data by public authorities, the EDPB can only encourage the PCLOB to 
issue  and  publish  further  reports.  It  regrets  that  on  Section  702  FISA  no  general  report  is 
contemplated, to provide an assessment of the changes brought since the last reauthorization in 2018. 
The EDPB would be very interested on an additional report on PPD-28 to follow up on the first report 
including an assessment of how the safeguards of PPD-28 are applied Finally, the EDPB underlines the 
importance of reports on Executive Order 12 333, and regrets that those reports will most likely remain 
classified. In this regard, the EDPB stresses that the members of the review team only have access to 
the same documents as the general public. The EDPB recalls that the security cleared experts of the 
EDPB remain ready to review additional documents and discuss additional classified elements, in 
order to have more meaningful reviews, following the example of PNRs or TFTP reviews. 

115.  On the Ombudsperson mechanism, despite some new elements provided during this year’s review, 
especially on the procedural aspects in relation to the first case submitted to the Ombudsperson but 
declared inadmissible, as well as on hypothetical cases, the EDPB is still not in a position to conclude 
that the Ombudsperson is vested with sufficient powers to access information and to remedy non-
compliance.  Thus,  it  still  cannot  state  that  the  Ombudsperson  can  be  considered  an  “effective 
remedy before a tribunal” in the meaning of Art. 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. 

116.  Finally,  the  EDPB  recalls  that  the  same  concerns  will  be  addressed  by  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the 

European Union in cases that are still pending before it.

ANNEX TO THE EDPB REPORT ON THE SECOND EU-US PRIVACY SHIELD ANNUAL JOINT REVIEW 

Factual findings of the third annual joint review of the EU-US Privacy Shield 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The U.S. Delegation was composed of high level representatives. 

As of now, the Privacy Shield List contains around 498435 organizations, 50936 are on the “Inactive” List 
either because they have voluntarily withdrawn from the program (39 in the last year), not submitted 
their  recertification  in  a  timely  manner  or  because  their  recertification  has  been  initiated  but  not 
completed in a timely manner. There was no case where an organization was removed from the List 
because it persistently failed to comply. 

Of the participating Organizations 70 - 75% are small and medium size organizations with less than 250 
employees.  96%  of  the  participating  organizations  certified  for  non-HR  data  transfers,  33%  for  HR 
transfers. The main businesses certifying are: Information and Communications Technology, Business 
and Professional Services, Media and Entertainment, and Education. 

1  ON COMMERCIAL ASPECTS 

1.1  Self-Certification Process and Cooperation between U.S. authorities in the 

Privacy Shield Program 

4. 

The DoCs method and scope of checks in the initial review of a certification and the recertification has 
not  changed  substantially  since  the  last  review.  The  DoC  reviews  all  self-certifications  (first  time 
applicants as well as recertification submissions) for: 

1.  Registration with IRM 

2.  Payment of Annex I Arbitral Fund Contribution 

3.  Compliance with supplemental principle 6 

4.  Completion and consistency of certification information 

5.  Privacy notices 

5. 

6. 

DoC has rejected 9 first time certifications in the last year because the applicants were not eligible to 
participate in the Privacy Shield because they were not under the jurisdiction of FTC or DoT (5 non-
U.S., 4 non-profit organizations). 

Also, there were no significant changes reported as regards the depth of the analysis the DoC performs: 
the DoC checks the applications for inconsistencies between the privacy policy and the certification 
(For example HR/NON HR). It does not check if the data transferred is necessary and proportionate to 
the purpose for instance because they consider that the Privacy Shield does not go into this level of 
detail, nor do they check in substance the compliance with other principles.

36 See https://www.privacyshield.gov/inactive on 24 September 2019 

Adopted  

24 

7. 

In  order  to  address  the  concern  expressed  by  the  WP29  regarding  the  duty  of  the  certifying 
organization to publish their privacy policy referring to the Privacy Shield certification before the DoC 
has  completed  the  exercise  of  checking  and  listing  the  organization,  the  DoC  has  changed  the 
procedure.  

8. 

The DoC:  

- 

Prohibits a first-time applicant from making public representations about participation until 
the PS Team approves its certification 

-  Requires an applicant to submit a draft privacy policy for review 

-  Directs an applicant to remove any premature references 

9. 

10. 

11. 

12. 

13. 

As  the  practical  experience  with  the  certification  process  increases,  the  DoC  still  uses  the  same 
guidance for the review of applications regarding the identification of foreign entities; they ask the 
companies for more precise links to their privacy policies so individuals could more easily exercise their 
rights, they ask for more than one point of contact within the organization to make sure messages 
from the DoC are received. 

In addition to the 2-weeks-notice of the upcoming deadline to recertify organizations already sent out 
before the second annual review, the DoC now also sends a reminder one month and one week before 
the recertification is due.  

The organizations that want to stay in the Privacy Shield program are obliged to communicate their re-
certification by the due date. The DoC stated in the third annual review that organizations that fail to 
do so within 30 days after the due date are “automatically” moved to the “inactive” list. 

Since August 2019 the DoC has changed their practice and changes the “Next Certification Due Date” 
on the Privacy Shield list as soon as any documents for recertification arrive at the DoC.  

In the course of the 3rd annual review the participating representatives of the EDPB submitted a list of 
organizations whose recertification due date lay in the past. For 29 of those organizations the due date 
dated back to 2018. Checks of that list performed on September 25, 2019 led to the result that the 
DoC moved 87 of those organizations to the “inactive” list. Two organizations disappeared from the 
whole list. 213 remained on the “active” list. 

14.  As  regards  guidance,  the  DoC  has  published  new  guidance  material  for  organizations  to  address 
questions around Brexit. The review team is not aware that this guidance was created in cooperation 
with EU SAs or the EDPB. 

1.2  Oversight and supervision of compliance with the principles - Activities by the 

DoC 

15. 

16. 

The DoC still identifies on a quarterly basis organizations that have started but not finished an initial 
or re-certification or that did not submit their annual re-certification at all. 

If organizations do submit the paperwork necessary for recertification, the DoC foresees a timeslot of 
45 days in which the recertification should be finished. If this is not the case and at least further action 
to complete the process is not taken by the organization, the DoC sends it a warning letter explaining 
that if the required action is not taken within a period of another 30 days, the organization will be 
removed to the “inactive” list and referred to the FTC or DoC.  

Adopted  

25 

17.  As foreseen in the Privacy Shield text, the DoC still performs random web searches for false claims of 

participation in the program.  

18. 

In the last year the DoC referred 143 discovered false claims cases to the FTC. 

19.  After the DoC has performed a sweep of 100 randomly chosen organizations in the second year of the 
Privacy Shield, it has now started in April 2019 to perform 30 of those checks each month. The focus 
of the sweep is the accessibility of the Privacy Policy, the responsiveness of the organization and the 
availability  of  the  IRM.  In  case  those  checks  result  in  conspicuities  (about  20%  of  the  cases)  the 
organizations receive more in-depth compliance questionnaires from the DoC. Through this procedure 
minor or more significant peculiarities may appear (for example: no response from designated point 
of contact; privacy policy was no longer accessible online; missing references to one or more elements 
of  the  notice  principle).  The  organizations  must  respond  within  30  days.  If  the  response  is  not 
satisfactory, the organizations – similar to the procedure described above – receive a certified warning 
letter (3 in this year) requiring the organization to indicate within a 30 day period how it has addressed 
the concerns. If those are not resolved within the 30 days the organization is moved to the “inactive” 
list and the case is being referred to the FTC or DoT. It was confirmed that even if the case was resolved 
within the 30 days the DoC could refer it to the FTC. 

20. 

21. 

22. 

23. 

In total the DoC has sent out 669 warning letters to participants of the Privacy Shield since October, 
and 1 100 were sent in total since the beginning of the programme.  

The DoC still follows the media and does keyword searches to identify possible breaches of the Privacy 
Shield commitments. 

The DoC also still performs regular checks for broken links to the privacy policy on the Privacy Shield 
list. 

The DoC has still not made use of its right to request a copy of the relevant privacy provisions of an 
organizations contract with an agent.  

24.  Besides the Privacy Shield News and Events section on the website of the DoC that covers several kinds 
of news and also FTC decisions related to privacy in general but there is no dedicated link to Privacy 
Shield cases of the FTC as described in the text of the Privacy Shield.

28. 

In relation to the DoC’s work in order to ensure that all organizations recertify and finish their work on 
time  but  also  for  the  web  searches  for  false  claims  and  any  other  aspects  of  their  work  the  DoC 
mentioned that it works on improving their technical possibilities. 

The  DoC  has  in  various  contexts  throughout  the  review  also  uttered  its  wish  to  establish  a  closer 
cooperation between the DoC and the EDSA/ representatives of European Supervisory Authorities (for 
example on outreach and education, possibilities of more substantial checks). 

The US CIB announced that they would stop managing the fund set up (to cover the costs of the EU 
informal panel responsible to take care of complaints submitted mostly from employees whose data 
have been transferred under the Shield) in accordance with the Privacy Shield in 2020. EU Commission 
and DPAs were approached to help finding a solution but declined any responsibility in managing it.  

European  Commission  and  EDPB  representatives’  presentations  The  European  Commission,  EDPB 
Chair  and  representatives  gave  a  short  presentation  on  the  updates  about  the  work  done  on  the 
European Union side.

Independent Recourse Mechanism (IRM) 

1.3 
The DoC reported that it has developed guidance to the IRMs in order to avoid possible conflicts of 
interests.  

30.  One  IRM  explained once  again  that  such  a  conflict  of  interest  would  be  avoided  by  separating  the 
teams  providing  IRM  services  and  those  verifying  ex  officio  compliance  with  the  Privacy  Shield 
framework, both in terms of tasks and staff. Regarding the management of such potential conflicts 
between the two teams, it reported on having its own department that monitors these conflicts and 
has not had identified any so far. 

31.  Potential  conflicts  of  interest  must  be  included  in  the  annual  reports  of  the  IRMs,  but  neither  this 
aspect of the report was standardized nor any standardised template format for the reports have not 
been introduced yet. 

32. 

In total, the IRMs received 48 complaints under the Privacy Shield framework and reported an overall 
increase in both the number and complexity of the complaints.  

33.  However, the IRMs reported that only one-third of the received complaints were eligible under the 
Privacy  Shield.  The  other  complaints  were  primarily  regarding  U.S.  companies  that  were  not  self-
certified under the Privacy Shield framework. 

34. 

The majority of the complaints received were related to requests from individuals regarding a change 
or removal of their personal data, an unsubscription from the organizations services, the disabling of 
accounts and the contact with a representative from the applicable organization. 

35.  Another IRM reported that three complaints were successfully resolved, which related to the access 

principle as well as the improper handling of the notice principle. 

36. 

1.4  Arbitral Panel 
The fee that according to the Privacy Shield text is collected from the certified organizations annually 
is still being collected only once at the initial certification. The collected amount (under Safe Harbor 
and the Privacy Shield) totals to more than 5 million $. 

37.  Regarding the arbitral panel procedure, two requests were submitted since the second annual review. 
Both requests were dismissed as one failed to comply with the steps needed to invoke such an arbitral 
panel procedure and the other one did not relate to a company that was a Privacy Shield participant. 

1.5  Oversight and supervision of compliance with the principles - Activities by the 

FTC 

38. 

The FTC representative answered the questions of the Commission and the EDPB along the following 
3 main categories: 

39. 

40. 

1.5.1  Concerning the status of the Privacy Shield enforcement in general 
7 Privacy Shield cases were handled since the last review, to look more into substantive violations of 
the framework.  

Two cases concerned the supplemental principle 6 (on the obligation to continue to apply the Privacy 
Shield  to  the  data  collected  after  withdrawal  from  the  programme).  The  FTC  also  focused  on 
supplemental principle 7 (obligation to verify or certify that the company has assessed its compliance 
with the Privacy Shield). 

Adopted  

27 

41. 

The FTC also performed ex officio reviews: 1 case this year, where the company did not comply with 
this principle 7 (and thus probably with others). The representative of the FTC announced more cases 
on the Privacy Shield to come. 

42. 

Following a question from the Commission, the FTC answered that it did not focus only on the formal 
respect of the Privacy Shield, but also on the substance. 

1.5.2  On the Facebook case which led to the recent settlement with the FTC (follow-up of 

the discussions in the second Joint Review and update on this case) 

43.  Although  the  representative  of  the  FTC  underlined  that  they  could  not  share  much  details  as  the 
findings  have  not  been  made  public,  it  was  indicated  that  eventually  the  investigation  focused  on 
products for which Facebook did not certify under the Privacy Shield (Facebook only certified for two 
new  products,  Workplace  premium  and  Ads Measurement).   Thus,  contrary  to  what was  expected 
during the second review of the Privacy Shield, the settlement reached does not have a direct link with 
the Privacy Shield. 

44. 

The FTC clarified that as an effect of the settlement and of the immunity deriving from it, in the future 
it could only take action against Facebook concerning violations which were unknown at the time of 
the settlement (for instance, a new complaint on a new subject or concerning a different service). This 
means that if Facebook adhered to the Shield for these products without any further change, the FTC 
would probably not be in a position to act and that existing complaints on the aspects covered by the 
settlement will not be handled further. 

45.  Concerning the possibility for the FTC to contemplate a repetitive practice, for instance in terms of the 
exercise  of  rights  of  data  subjects,  as  a  persistent  failure  to  comply,  the  DoC  indicated  that  it  is  a 
possibility if an organization regularly fails to comply and it is no longer possible to assume that it is 
limited to an individual case. 

46.  Questioned about the settlements in general, the FTC indicated that it had to offer the company the 
opportunity to settle in all privacy cases, when the FTC is ready to open a case before the court. The 
FTC  could  refuse  to  settle,  for  instance  when  they  have  civil  penalty.  However  the  FTC  would  not 
impose a fine that would make the company go bankrupt. When calculating the amount of money for 
the  settlement,  the  FTC  would  have  to  take  into  account  how  much  the  company  earned  from  its 
practice and add the amount of the fine, according to the principle that a company shall not profit 
from its misconduct. 

47. 

For each civil penalty, the FTC underlined that it was required to look at multipliers: degree of guilt, 
the ability to pay, deterrence and harm to consumers. 

48.  Concerning the interactions of the FTC with the DOJ in the context of settlements, the FTC stressed 
that it does not have the power to impose a civil penalty on its own and that in such situation they 
would have to refer the case to the DOJ, which then has 45 days to either take the case or let the FTC 
take it back. In case the DOJ takes the case on behalf of the State, the FTC underlined that they usually 
follow the recommendations made by the FTC. 

1.5.3  On the general developments in US privacy law that may affect the Privacy Shield and 

on the resources of the FTC 

49. 

The  representative  of  the  FTC  underlined  that  the  Federal  Trade  Commission’s  policy  is  to  be 
aggressive towards companies within the boundaries of the powers they have (i.e., in cases for which 
the FTC is able to impose civil penalties). 

50. 

Several cases were initiated or finalized this year. 

Adopted  

28 

51. 

The FTC is also continuing its hearing process to improve their orders. This process already resulted in 
the  additional  requirement  to  companies  to  have  their  assessor  for  outside  compliance  reviews 
approved.  These  assessors  are  also  required  to  provide  the  FTC  with  all  the  documents  in  their 
possession. 

52.  Nevertheless, the FTC stressed its lack of effective means to perform its duties and missions (lack of 
resources, restricted competence and powers, e.g. with respect to non-profit organisations, etc). In 
this regard, it was underlined that without further resources, the FTC would not be in a position to 
process more than 7/8 cases regarding the enforcement of the Privacy Shield per year (although the 
duration of investigations vary from one case to another). The FTC is continuously advocating for a 
stronger law on first-time violations, the ability to reach non-profit entities, and for more resources. 

53.  Questioned on its investigatory powers, the FTC confirmed that they could have access to source codes 
with the issuance of subpoenas. Regarding the criteria used to prioritize their investigations, the FTC 
indicated that they try to maximize the yield of their resources. They do not plan “fishing expeditions” 
in advance, but prefer to collect information from open sources that may make a case. It sets it priority 
on  cases  regarding  sensitive  information  (credit,  finance,  health,  children  information).  The  FTC 
stressed that, in principle, they are not an examination agency. Consequently, they could but do not 
usually investigate on-site but rather use documentation and interrogatories. 

1.6  Oversight and supervision of compliance with the principles - Activities by the 

DoT 

54. 

The DoT is in charge of the supervision of data processing related to air transportation, which includes 
two main entities: airline companies, and ticket agents. To date, no airline company is participating in 
the Privacy Shield, and only very few ticket agents. 

55.  Because the situation of DoT is very similar to that of the FTC, it looks closely at FTC’s practice and case 

law. The DoT has not received any Privacy Shield related complaints so far. 

56. 

1.7  Onward Transfers 
The representatives of DoC underlined that FAQs on how to comply with the Accountability for Onward 
Transfers Principle, published before the second review, are available on the Privacy Shield website. 
They  contacted  law  firms,  consultancy  agencies  and  other  stakeholders  to  seek  more  information 
about their experiences and expectations regarding this issue. These organizations indicated that the 
negotiation of the clauses on onward transfers are usually part of a wider, general negotiation, in which 
not only the Privacy Shield principles, but US states law also has to be considered (eg. existing state 
law requirements on data breach). According to the information gathered as a result of this outreach, 
the organizations found the FAQs helpful. 

57. 

The DoC does not get specific questions from organization on onward transfers during the certification 
and re-certification process, applicants usually have more general questions on the interpretation of 
the Privacy Shield Principles. 

58.  Questioned about DoC’s possibility to request a summary or copy of the contract used by an applicant 
to comply with the principle on onward transfers, the representatives indicated that they did not make 
use of this possibility so far. The DoC also indicated that it is not part of the compliance questionnaire 
and the sweep checks to verify specifically these contracts, and the compliance with the Accountability 
for Onward Transfers Principle.

1.8  Automated decision-making/Profiling 
The  FTC  confirmed  that  the  US  adheres  to  the  OECD  Recommendation  on  AI  [adopted  on  22  May 
2019]. 

In their reply to the questionnaire from the review team, one trade association reported that member 
companies  that  employ  automated  decision-making  included  information  about  their  policies  and 
maintain  mechanisms  to  allow  consumers  to  exercise  control,  such  as  the  ability  to  contest  an 
automated decision and seek human review. 

The FTC specified that companies are not required to provide such rights under the Privacy Shield (and 
therefore, to include a reference in this regard in the privacy policy submitted pursuant to the Privacy 
shield).  If  companies  commit  themselves  to  provide  these  rights  but  then,  contrary  to  this 
commitment, they do not provide them, this will constitute a misrepresentation, against which the 
FTC can take enforcement action. 

62. 

In the area of consumer credit, the FTC referred to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). 

63. 

64. 

1.9  HR Data 
In the course of the review the EDPB review team was approached by the DoC to further discuss this 
issue. The main topic was the possible loss of European oversight for European employees and their 
expectation in terms of rights (notice and choice). On the other hand for certain service providers, the 
DoC underlined that it might be difficult to even know if they are processing employee data. Arguments 
and possible solutions were exchanged. The DoC took note of those and will contemplate on possible 
ways forward. There is no concrete outcome of the discussions yet. 

1.10  US domestic privacy update: NIST Framework 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presented the last version of its “Privacy 
Framework”  (preliminary  draft,  6  September  2019).  The  Privacy  Framework,  customizable  by 
companies, aims at providing guidance to companies on how to reach a certain level of data protection 
(the process), without pre-setting the level to be reached (“desired privacy outcomes”). 

2  ON GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA: RELEVANT 

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND TRENDS 

65. 

Legal framework has not changed substantially.  

2.1  Ombudsperson mechanism 

66.  During the review, Keith Krach presented himself as the new Under Secretary for Economic Growth, 
Energy, and the Environment of the U.S. Department of State, and the Privacy Shield Ombudsperson. 
He stressed that the Ombudsperson mechanism needs to provide an effective, empowered channel of 
review for EU individuals. 

67.  He  also  confirmed  to  be  independent  from  the  Intelligence  Community  (IC),  and  stressed,  as  his 
predecessors did during the first and second reviews, that he will not sign his name to a letter if he 
would have any remaining doubts on the completion of appropriate redress. 

68. 

The  Ombudsperson’s  staff  then  reported  that  the  only  request  received  under  the  Ombudsperson 
mechanism was in agreement with the EU Centralized Body found to be deficient.  

Adopted  

30 

69.  Referring to a hypothetical case, the staff then presented in general terms the procedures and powers 
of the Ombudsperson, stressing that the Ombudsperson would have access to all information he needs 
to perform its duties and that all incidents of non-compliance would have to be remedied, including 
the purging of data. It was also provided that violations of section 702 FISA would be reported to the 
FISA Court.  

70.  No  further  specific  information  about  how  the  Ombudsperson  would  cooperate  with  the  IC  were 

shared, as the Ombudsperson reported that those procedures continue to be classified.  

71. 

72. 

73. 

Inspector General (IG) 

2.2 
The Inspector General of the IC gave an overview of how IGs are set up and operate within the U.S. 
government and the U.S. legal system. He stressed that IG’s are independent from the  bodies they 
oversee, and that they are empowered by law to review and investigate any abuse of power.  

The IG reported that the request which was made under the Ombudsperson mechanism (and found 
to be deficient) was also examined by the office of the IG.  

The IG confirmed that the office could take up any hint of an abuse of power, also on its own initiative. 
However, the IG only investigates concrete cases and does not review policy.  

74.  During the last year, the IG office has not investigated any matter related to the Privacy Shield.  

75.  Questioned about how the office of the IG would handle an Ombudsperson request, the IG explained 
that it would depend on the  case,  but  that he may refer to an agency, and that a remedy may  be 
proposed to the ODNI. He added that Congress would also be informed about recommendations and 
about cases where the recommendation is not followed through.  

76. 

Further,  the  IG  explained  that  the  Ombudsperson  would  also  be  informed  of  the  findings  and 
recommendations to the ODNI necessary  for the  Ombudsperson to  perform his duties. In order to 
protect  sources  and  other  sensitive  information,  in  the  report  to  the  Ombudsperson,  the  IG  may 
remove information from the report to the ODNI. As a consequence, the information shared with the 
Ombudsperson may not necessarily be identical to the information shared with the ODNI.  

77. 

Finally, the IG clarified that his resources are not decided upon by the Government, but by Congress.  

78.

80. 

2.3  PCLOB 
The summer before the third annual review, the Senate confirmed the last two members of the PCLOB. 
The Chair of the PCLOB underlined that the PCLOB is thus now fully staffed for the first time since 2016. 

The staff has also doubled since the last review, and 7 new projects have been launched. Overall, the 
PCLOB is now working on 10 projects and also strengthened its knowledge in terms of technology. 

For the first time, the PCLOB released an agenda of their current projects, which it will update every 
six months. The PCLOB also published strategic goals for the next three years, among them technology 
is identified to be the key factor for privacy. 

81. 

The PCLOB representatives recalled the history of the agency and its functioning. 

82.  Regarding  the  current  projects,  the  Chair  underlined  that  the  Board  is  currently  working  on  the 

following issues: 

  Regarding NSA’s collection of detailed call records under the USA Freedom Act. The report is 

expected to be finalized later this year. 

Adopted  

31 

  Regarding facial recognition in airports, work has started recently. 

  Regarding the terrorist watchlist, a project is ongoing as well, yet without any forecast date. It 

was however underlined that the mere fact of working on a subject already sends a signal. 

  Regarding EO 12 333, work is still ongoing: 

a.  3 deep-dive reviews were organized on this subject, 2 of those related to the CIA (1 of 

them is finalized and transmitted to the Congress), 1 to the NSA (on XKeyscore). 

b.  The PCLOB is also providing advice on a range of guidelines on EO 12 333 for internal 

use. 

c.  The PCLOB  Chair indicated that they hope some work  will be completed and made 

available in a relative near future. 

83.  Regarding the calendar of work concerning EO 12 333, the Chair indicated that each deep-dive review 
can be finalized independently from the others, and be declassified separately. However, the Chair of 
the PCLOB underlined that in spite of their strong policy towards the broadest dissemination of their 
works, it was unlikely that these reports would ever be (fully) declassified. 

84.  Regarding Section 215 and whether their report will be issued by the end this year, the Chair of the 
PCLOB  confirmed  that  they  hope  to  deliver  it  in  sufficient  time,  so  that  it  will  be  available  to  the 
Congress in the context of the possible re-authorization of this section. 

85.  When questioned on whether the PCLOB’s report on Section 702 could and would be updated, the 
Chair of the PCLOB indicated that FBI’s access and use of the data would partially be reviewed, but that 
the PCLOB did not intend to update the whole report. 

86.  Regarding the mandates the PCLOB gives itself and its work program, the Chair of the PCLOB indicated 
that the PCLOB has a holistic approach and that its reports focus on collection, but also look at storage, 
use of data, compliance mechanisms, as well as sharing and dissemination. It was also underlined that 
the PCLOB’s focus evolves where the practice goes, and needs to migrate to those, even when they 
are not yet known to the public. 

2.4  ODNI and Department of Justice presentation and Q/A on government access to 

personal data: relevant developments in the U.S. legal framework and trends  

87. 

The Chief Privacy Officer of the ODNI confirmed again that the function of his office was to advise on 
the policies regarding civil liberties and privacy, according to the statues, and that the officers also 
have  the  power  to  conduct  investigations,  which  includes  to  have  access  to  all  the  materials  and 
records needed. 

88.  When performing their missions, they are bound by statutes which govern their actions, by Executive 
orders,  Attorney  general’s  guidelines,  Presidential  Directives,  and  orders  of  courts.  This  office  also 
provides the public with new interpretations issued by the FISC (either along with the decision or with 
a summary if the decision itself cannot be provided). 

89. 

90. 

The Chief Privacy Officer of the ODNI reported that no major changes took place since the last review. 
He confirmed that PPD 28 remains in full force and effect.  

In  this  regard,  he  underlined  that  PPD 28  demonstrates  a  strong  preference  to  conduct  targeted 
surveillance  (as  tailored  as  feasible)  rather  than  bulk,  which  is,  in  principle,  allowed  only  for  six 
purposes. 

Adopted  

32 

91.  He reaffirmed that bulk collection is neither generalised, nor mass collection, and that “bulk collection” 

is usually a choice, for instance to identify a target. 

92. 

In view of a question raised by the CJEU during the hearing on the Schrems II case, in particular on 
footnote 5 of PPD 28, after extensive and detailed exchanges, the following elements were clarified: 

- 

- 

- 

This footnote is not applicable to Section 702 as it is not a bulk collection program (since it is 
based on the use of selectors). Nevertheless, sections 1, 3 and 4 of PPD 28 apply. 

This footnote applies to EO 12 333, for instance. 

This footnote would mean that in addition to the six purposes foreseen under PPD 28 for bulk 
collection, PPD 28 allows (through this footnote) an additional situation where bulk collection 
can take place: when bulk collection is temporary, in order to identify a target. In this case, it 
appears  to  be  possible  to  derogate  from  the  six  other  purposes  foreseen  under  PPD 28  to 
undertake a bulk collection of data, but only temporarily, for another authorized purpose of 
collection, and in this case, Section 1 of PPD 28 would still apply. 

-  Questioned on what “temporary” would mean, the answer was not very clear. It seems that, 
as soon as the collected data has been processed to help identify the target, useless data is no 
longer useful is deleted. 

93.  Concerning targets and selectors under Section 702, the Chief Privacy Officer of the ODNI recalled that 
the distinction between a selector and a target is important: the target should be a “person”, while a 
“selector” is any communication identifier (e.g., email address, phone number, etc.) allowing to isolate 
the person’s communication data from the bulk. However, questioned on whether a person should 
necessarily be only one  single individual, he  acknowledged that in some  cases a person could be a 
group comprising more than one individual (e.g., the users of an email account), provided the size of 
the group remains limited and that any member of the group needs to have a link with the foreign 
intelligence at stake and to be a non-US person. 

94. 

95. 

The  way  a  person  is  selected  is  through  the  tasking  of  a  selector,  which  is  documented  both  for 
approval and oversight. 

It was stressed that each selector has to be an account used by a person and that it cannot be the 
name of a person. It has to be a communication account identifier, thus communication always has to 
be  from  or  to  the  selector.  It  was  also  confirmed  that  these  safeguards  related  to  the  tasking  of 
selectors only apply within the framework of Section 702. 

96.  Questioned on the time limit for which a selector is tasked, it was underlined that a selector is tasked 
“for as long as it brings back foreign intelligence”. Regular checks would thus be performed to confirm 
that is still useful and necessary. 

97.  As  regards  to  PRISM  and  UPSTREAM  collection  and  the  filtering  of  communications,  no  additional 

information was presented during this review. 

98.  At the time of targeting, the NSA shall provide a written explanation to allow for an ex ante review in 
the IC before tasking the selector, as well as a post review by the DoJ. It was recalled that in case of an 
acknowledged  incident,  collection  stops,  the  underlying  information  has  to  be  purged,  and,  if  any 
reports were based on that information, these reports must be recalled (this is a standard procedure 
for reports in this domain). 

Adopted  

33 

99. 

In case of an incident, the office of the Privacy Officer would also have to look at the context in which 
it occurred and to report non-compliance to the FISC (in the context of section 702), with a description 
of the scope of the incident and of reasons why it happened. The Court then would follow-up on these 
reports, for instance by determining, in the annual certification process, whether those compliance 
incidents effectively rendered certification inadequate. It could also issue a deficiency order to have it 
remedied within 30 days. In addition, quarterly reports on incidents are also sent to the FISC. 

100.  In  addition,  the  Chief  Privacy  Officer  of  the  ODNI  stressed  that  semi-annual  reports  of  compliance 
incidents  for  the  Congress  are  declassified  to  the  extent  allowed  and  made  available  on  IC  on  the 
record,  by  the  DoJ.  These  reports  also  show  the  trends  of  non-compliance  and  comments,  which 
provide more useful information than the statistics (see the last one of March 2019). 

101.  Brief updates were also provided on cases introduced or ruled since the last review concerning FISA 
§1806  (two  cases  of  the  9th  Circuit  -  Jewel  and  Fazaga),  as  well  as  FOIA  (ACLU  v.  NSA  before  the 
appellate court  and the following cases, as well as Food marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media 
from the Supreme Court). 

102.  Concerning  the  Wikimedia  case,  the  DoJ  stressed  that  the  first  instance  considered  that  the 
complainants lacked standing, but this judgement was overturned by the appellate court. The case is 
still pending, while another case was ruled and dismissed on substance, but is being appealed too. 

103.  Concerning Section 501, for which the Administration is seeking reauthorization of this authority, it 
was recalled that the NSA is not using it any longer, because the information were too narrow and thus 
not sufficiently useful. 

104.  Questioned on how the additional safeguards afforded to the data of EU residents transferred to the 
US through the Privacy Shield would be reflected in executive agreements concluded between the US 
and another third country in the context of the Cloud Act, the DOJ indicated that it could not answer 
this question yet.
