The European Data Protection Board

Having regard to Article 70(1)(n) and Articles 40 and 41 of the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC
(hereinafter “GDPR”),

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018,

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure of 25 May 2018,

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION:

1 INTRODUCTION

1. Regulation 2016/6791 (“the GDPR”) came into effect on 25 May 2018. One of the main objectives of the
GDPR is to provide a consistent level of data protection throughout the European Union and to prevent
divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market.2 The GDPR also
introduces the principle of accountability, which places the onus on data controllers to be responsible
for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation.3 The provisions under Articles 40 and
41 of the GDPR in respect of codes of conduct (“codes”) represent a practical, potentially cost effective
and meaningful method to achieve greater levels of consistency of protection for data protection rights.
Codes can act as a mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR.4 Notably, they can help to
bridge  the  harmonisation  gaps  that  may  exist  between  Member  States  in  their  application  of  data
protection law.5 They also provide an opportunity for specific sectors to reflect upon common data
processing activities and to agree to bespoke and practical data protection rules, which will meet the
needs of the sector as well as the requirements of the GDPR.

2. Member States, Supervisory Authorities, the European Data Protection Board (“the Board”) and the
European  Commission  (“the Commission”)  are  obliged  to  encourage  the  drawing  up  of  codes  to
contribute to the proper application of the Regulation.6 These guidelines will support and facilitate
“code owners” in drafting, amending or extending codes for their particular processing sector.

1.1

Scope of these guidelines

1 The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.
2 See Recital 13 of the GDPR.
3 See Article 5(2) of the GDPR.
4 See for example Articles 24(3) and 28(5) and 32(3). A code of conduct may also be used by data processors to
demonstrate sufficient guarantees that their processing is compliant with the GDPR (See Article 28(5)).
5 See Recitals 77, 81, 98, 99, 148, 168 and Articles 24, 28, 35, 40, 41, 46, 57, 64, 70 of the GDPR. This is particularly
the case where a code relates to processing activities in several Member States.
6 Article 40(1) of the GDPR.

3. The aim  of  these  guidelines  is  to  provide  practical  guidance  and  interpretative  assistance  in
relation to the application of Articles 40 and 41 of the GDPR. They are intended to help clarify the
procedures and the rules involved in the submission, approval and publication of codes at both a
National and European level. They intend to set out the minimum criteria required by a Competent
Supervisory Authority (“CompSA”) before accepting to carry out an in depth review and evaluation
of a code.7 Further, they intend to set out the factors relating to the content to be taken into
account when evaluating whether a particular code provides and contributes to the proper and
effective application8 of the GDPR. Finally, they intend to set out the requirements for the effective
monitoring of compliance with a code.9

4. These  guidelines  should  also  act  as  a  clear  framework  for  all  CompSAs,  the  Board  and  the
Commission to evaluate codes in a consistent manner and to streamline the procedures involved
in the assessment process. This framework should also provide greater transparency, ensuring that
code owners who intend to seek approval for a code are fully conversant with the process and
understand the formal requirements and the appropriate thresholds required for approval.

5. Guidance on codes of conduct as a tool for transfers of data as per Article 40(3) of the GDPR will

be considered in separate guidelines to be issued by the EDPB.

6. All codes  previously  approved10 will  need  to  be  reviewed  and  re-evaluated  in  line  with  the
requirements of the GDPR and then resubmitted for approval as per the requirements of Articles
40 and 41 and as per the procedures outlined in this document.

2 DEFINITIONS

‘Accreditation’ refers  to  the  ascertainment  that  the  proposed  monitoring  body  meets  the
requirements set out in Article 41 of the GDPR to carry out the monitoring of compliance with a
code  of  conduct.  This  check  is  undertaken  by  the  supervisory  authority  where  the  code  is
submitted for approval (Article 41(1)). The accreditation of a monitoring body applies only for a
specific code.11
‘Code Owners’ refers to associations or other bodies who draw up and submit their code12 and
they will have an appropriate legal status as required by the code and in line with national law.
‘CompSA’ refers to the Supervisory Authority which is competent as per Article 55 of the GDPR.
‘Monitoring body’ refers to a body/committee or a number of bodies/committees (internal or
external to the code owners13) who carry out a monitoring function to ascertain and assure that
the code is complied with as per Article 41.

7 See Article 40(5), Article  55(1) and Recital 122 of the GDPR.
8 See Article 40(1) and Recital 98 of the GDPR.
9 See for example Article 41(2) and 41(3) of the GDPR.
10 By either National Data Supervisory authorities or the Article 29 Working Party.
11 However, a monitoring body may be accredited for more than one code provided it satisfies the

requirements for accreditation.
12 As per Recital 98 of the GDPR.
13 See also Paragraphs 64– 67 below.

‘Concerned SAs’ shall have the same meaning as per Article 4(22) of the GDPR
‘National code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities contained in one Member State.
‘Transnational code’ refers to a code which covers processing activities in more than one Member
State.

3 WHAT ARE CODES ?

7. GDPR codes are voluntary accountability tools which set out specific data protection rules for categories
of controllers and processors. They can be a useful and effective accountability tool, providing a detailed
description of what is the most appropriate, legal and ethical set of behaviours of a sector. From a data
protection viewpoint, codes can therefore operate as a rulebook for controllers and processors who
design and implement GDPR compliant data processing activities which give operational meaning to the
principles of data protection set out in European and National law.

8. Trade associations or bodies representing a sector can create codes to help their sector comply with the
GDPR in an efficient and potentially cost effective way. As provided by the non-exhaustive list contained
in Article 40(2) of the GDPR, codes of conduct may notably cover topics such as:













fair and transparent processing;
legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts;
the collection of personal data; the pseudonymisation of personal data;
the information provided to individuals and the exercise of individuals’ rights;
the information provided to and the protection of children (including mechanisms for obtaining
parental consent);
technical and organisational measures, including data protection by design and by default and
security measures;
breach notification;
data transfers outside the EU; or
dispute resolution procedures.

9. The GDPR in repealing the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) provides more specific and detailed
provisions  around  codes,  the  requirements  which  need  to  be  met  and  the  procedures  involved  in
attaining  approval,  as  well  as  their  registration,  publication  and  promotion  once  approved.    Those
provisions, in conjunction with these guidelines, will help encourage code owners to have a direct input
into the establishment of data protection standards and rules for their specific processing sectors.

10. It is important to note that codes are one of a number of voluntary tools that can be used from a suite
of  data  protection  accountability  tools  which  the  GDPR  offers,  such  as  Data  Protection  Impact

Assessments  (DPIAs)14 and  Certification.15 They  are  a  mechanism  which  can  be  used  to  assist
organisations in demonstrating their compliance with the GDPR.16

4 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF CODES?

11. Codes represent an opportunity to establish a set of rules which contribute to the proper application of
the  GDPR  in  a  practical,  transparent  and  potentially cost  effective manner  that  takes on  board the
nuances for a particular sector and/or their processing activities. In this regard codes can be drawn up
for controllers and processors taking account of the specific characteristics of processing carried out in
certain sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises.17 They have the potential
to be an especially important and beneficial tool for both SMEs and micro enterprise businesses18 by
providing  a  mechanism  which  allows  them  to  achieve  data  protection  compliance  in  a  more  cost
effective way.

For  example,  micro  enterprises  involved  in  similar  health  research  activities  could  come  together  via  their
relevant associations and collectively develop a code in respect of their collection and processing of health data
rather than attempting to carry out such comprehensive data protection analysis on their own. Codes will also
benefit  supervisory  authorities  by  allowing  them  to  gain  a  better  understanding  and  insight  of  the  data
processing activities of a specific profession, industry or other sector.

12. Codes can help controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR by governing areas such as fair and
transparent  processing,  legitimate  interests,  security  and  data  protection  by  design  and  default
measures and controller obligations. Codes are accessible to all processing sectors and can be drafted
in as narrow or as wide-ranging a manner as is befitting that particular sector, provided that the code
contributes to the proper and effective application of the GDPR.19

14 Codes of Conduct and Certification are voluntary accountability tools, whereas a DPIA will be mandatory in
certain circumstances. For further information on other accountability tools please see the general guidance
webpage of the EDPB (www.edpb.europa.eu).
15 See Article 42 of the GDPR and note the EDPB Guidelines 1/2018 on certification and identifying certification
criteria in accordance with Articles 42 and 43 of the GDPR.
16 Adherence  to  a  code  does  not,  of  itself,  guarantee  compliance  with  the  GDPR  or  immunity  for
controllers/processors from sanctions or liabilities provided under the GDPR.
17 See Recital 98 of the GDPR in respect of Article 40(1). For example, a code could be appropriately scaled to
meet the requirement of micro organisations in addition to small and medium enterprises.
18 Article 40(1) of the GDPR in particular identifies codes as a solution to address the needs of such enterprises.
19 A narrowly focused code must make it sufficiently clear to data subjects (and to the satisfaction of a CompSA)
that  controllers/processors  adhering  to  the  code  does  not  necessarily  ensure  compliance  with  all  of  the
legislation. An appropriate safeguard in this instance could be to ensure adequate transparency regarding the
limited scope of the code to those signed up to the code and data subjects.

For example, approval could be sought for a set of rules in respect of how a specific charitable sector would
ensure their processing arrangements were fair and transparent. Alternatively, the specific charitable sector
could decide to draft a code, which incorporates and properly applies a multitude of different provisions under
the GDPR to cover all their processing activities, from the lawful basis for the collection of personal data to the
notification of personal data breaches.

13. Codes  can  provide  a  degree  of  co-regulation  and  they  could  decrease  the  level  of  reliance  that
controllers  and  processors  may  sometimes  place  upon  data  protection  supervisory  authorities  to
provide more granular guidance for their specific processing activities.

14. Codes can provide a degree of autonomy and control for controllers and processors to formulate and
agree best practice rules for their given sectors. They can provide an opportunity to consolidate best
practice processing operations in specific fields. They can also become a vital resource that businesses
can  rely  upon  to  address  critical  issues  in  their  processing  procedures  and  to  achieve  better  data
protection compliance.

15. Codes  can  provide  much  needed  confidence  and  legal  certainty  by  providing  practical  solutions  to
problems identified by particular sectors in relation to common processing activities. They encourage
the development of a collective and consistent approach to the data processing needs of a particular
sector.

16. Codes can be an effective tool to earn the trust and confidence of data subjects. They can address a
variety  of  issues,  many  of  which  may  arise  from  concerns  of  the  general  public  or  even  perceived
concerns from within the sector itself, and as such constitute a tool for enhancing transparency towards
individuals regarding the processing of their personal data.

For example, in the context of processing health data for research purposes, concerns over the appropriate
measures  to  be  adopted  in  order  to  promote  compliance  with  the  rules  applying  to  the  processing  of
sensitive health information could be allayed by the existence of an approved and detailed code. Such a
code could outline in a fair and transparent manner the following:















the relevant safeguards to be applied regarding the information to be provided to data subjects;
relevant safeguards to be applied in respect of the data collected from third parties;
communication or dissemination of the data;
the criteria to be implemented to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation;
the specific security measures;
appropriate retention schedules; and
the mechanisms to manage the data as a result of the exercise of data subjects' rights (As per
Articles 32 and 89 of the GDPR).

17. Codes may also prove to be a significant and useful mechanism in the area of international transfers.
New provisions in the GDPR allow third parties to agree to adhere to approved codes in order to satisfy
legal requirements to provide appropriate safeguards in relation to international transfers of personal
data to third countries.20 Additionally, approved codes of this nature may result in the promotion and
cultivation of the level of protection which the GDPR provides to the wider international community
while also permitting sustainable legally compliant international transfers of personal data. They may
also serve as a mechanism which further develops and fosters data subject trust and confidence in the
processing of data outside of the European Economic Area.21

18. Approved  codes  have  the  potential  to  act  as  effective  accountability  tools  for  both  processors  and
controllers. As outlined in Recital 77 and Article 24(3) of the GDPR, adherence to an approved code of
conduct is envisaged, amongst others, as an appropriate method for a data controller or processor to
demonstrate compliance with regard to specific parts or principles of the Regulation or the Regulation
as a whole.22 Adherence to an approved code of conduct will also be a factor taken into consideration
by supervisory authorities when evaluating specific features of data processing such as the security
aspects23 , assessing the impact of processing under a DPIA24 or when imposing an administrative fine.25
In case of a breach of one of the provisions of the Regulation, adherence to an approved code of conduct
might be indicative of how comprehensive the need is to intervene with an effective, proportionate,
dissuasive administrative fine or other corrective measure from the supervisory authority.26

20 See Article 40(2)(j) and Article 40(3) of the GDPR.
21 The  Board will  provide  separate  guidelines in  relation  to  the  use  of  codes  as  a  mechanism  to  facilitate
international transfers.
22 See also Article 24(3) and 28(5) of the GDPR.
23 Article 32(3) of the GDPR.
24 Article 35(8) of the GDPR.
25 Article 83(2) (j) of the GDPR. Also note the application of codes in respect of WP 253/17 Guidelines on the
application and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of the Regulation 2016/679 which was adopted
by the EDPB.

5 ADMISSIBILITY OF A DRAFT CODE27

19. There are a number of conditions to be met before a CompSA would be in a position to undertake to
fully assess and review a code for the purposes of Article 40(5) of the GDPR.  They aim to facilitate an
efficient evaluation of any draft code. The following criteria apply:

5.1

Explanatory statement and supporting documentation

20. Every  draft  code  which  is submitted  for  approval  must  contain  a  clear  and  concise  explanatory
statement, which provides details as to the purpose of the code, the scope of the code28 and how it will
facilitate the effective application of this Regulation.29 This will assist in expediting the process and in
providing the requisite clarity to accompany a submission. The submission must also include supporting
documentation, where relevant, to underpin the draft code and explanatory statement.30

5.2

Representative

21. A code must be submitted by an association/consortium of associations or other bodies representing
categories of controllers or processors (code owners) in accordance with Article 40(2). Code owners
would include, for example, trade and representative associations, sectoral organisations and interest
groups.

22. The code owners must demonstrate to the CompSA that they are an effective representative body and
that they are capable of understanding the needs of their members and clearly defining the processing
activity or sector to which the code is intended to apply. Depending on the definition and parameters of
the sector concerned, representativeness can be derived from the following elements:

 Number  or percentage of members from the relevant controllers or processors in that sector

that have subscribed to comply with the code;
Experience  of  the  representative  body  with  regard  to  the  sector  and  processing  activities
concerning the code.



5.3

Processing Scope

23. The  draft  code  must  have  a  defined  scope  that  clearly  and  precisely  determines  the  processing
operations (or characteristics of the processing) of personal data covered by it, as well as the categories

27 This also applies for all codes (national and transnational) as well as amended or extended codes.
28 The  following  non-exhaustive  categories  may  apply:  identification  of  members,  processing  activity,  data
subjects, types of data, jurisdictions, concerned SAs (Article 4(22) of the GDPR).
29 This document provides an opportunity for code owners to demonstrate the rationale and basis for approval
of their code. It provides a platform for code owners to outline the appropriateness of safeguards proposed and
to demonstrate that proposed mechanisms are fit for purpose.
30 Examples could include a consultation summary, membership information or research that demonstrates a
need for the code.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

10

of controllers or processors it governs. This will include the processing issues that the code seeks to
address and provide practical solutions.

5.4

Territorial scope

24. The draft code must specify whether it is a national or transnational code and provide details in relation
to  territorial  scope,  identifying  all  relevant  jurisdictions  to  which  it  intends  to  apply.  For  any
transnational codes (as well as amended or extended transnational codes), a list of concerned SAs must
be included. Appendix 1 outlines the distinction between national and transnational codes.

5.5

Submission to a CompSA

25. The code owners must ensure that the supervisory authority chosen to review a draft code is competent
in accordance with Article 55 of the GDPR.31 Appendix 2 provides further information which may assist
code owners in choosing a CompSA for a transnational code.

5.6

Oversight of mechanisms

26. The draft code must propose mechanisms that allow for the monitoring of compliance with its provisions

by stakeholders who undertake to apply it.32 This applies to both public and non-public sector codes.

5.7 Monitoring body

27. A draft code which involves processing activities of private, non-public authorities or bodies must also
identify a monitoring body and contain mechanisms which enable that body to carry out its functions as
per  Article  41  of  the  GDPR.33 The  identified  monitoring  body  or  bodies  must  have  the  appropriate
standing to meet the requirements of being fully accountable in their role.34 To this end, the monitoring
body or bodies have to be accredited by the CompSA according to Article 41(1) of the GDPR.35

5.8

Consultation

28. A draft code must contain information as to the extent of consultation carried out. Recital 99 of the
GDPR indicates when drafting a code (or amending/extending) a consultation should take place with the
relevant stakeholders including data subjects, where feasible. As such, the code owners should confirm
and  demonstrate  that  an  appropriate  level  of  consultation  has  taken  place  with  the  relevant
stakeholders when submitting the code for approval. This should also outline the level and nature of
consultation  which  took  place  with  their  members,  other  stakeholders  and  data  subjects  or
associations/bodies representing them.36 In practice, a consultation is highly recommended with the

31 Article 55 of the GDPR states that each supervisory authority is competent for the performance of the tasks
assigned to and the exercise of the powers conferred on it in accordance with the Regulation on the territory of
its own Member State. Also see Recital 122 of the GDPR.
32 See Article 40(4) of the GDPR.
33 A code involving the public sector will still need to contain suitable mechanisms to monitor the code.
34 As per Article 83(4) (c) of the GDPR infringements in relation to the obligations of a monitoring body shall be
subject to an administrative fine.
35 See section below entitled ‘Accreditation Requirements for Monitoring Bodies’ on page 24.
36 For instance, codes owners could outline how they assessed the submissions received following consultation.
11

Adopted - Version for public consultation

members forming part of the organisation or body acting as the code owner and also taking into account
the processing activity with the clients of such members. Where no consultation has been carried out
with regard to relevant and specific stakeholders due to the lack of feasibility, it will be a matter for the
code owner to explain this position.

5.9

National legislation

29. Code owners must provide confirmation that the draft code is in compliance with applicable national
legislation, in particular, where the code involves a sector which is governed by specific provisions set
out in national law or it concerns processing operations that have to be assessed, taking into account
specific requirements and relevant legal obligations under national law.

5.10 Language

30. Code owners should comply with the language requirements of the CompSA to whom they will submit
their code. In general, a code should be submitted in the language of the CompSA of that Member
State.37 For transnational codes, the code should be submitted in the language of the CompSA and also
in English.38

5.11 Checklist

31. Ultimately, it will be a matter for the chosen CompSA to determine whether the draft code goes to the
next stage of evaluation i.e. a CompSA undertakes to carry out a full assessment of the content in line
with  Articles  40  and  41  of  the  GDPR  and  the  procedures  detailed  below.  The  Checklist  outlined  in
Appendix 3 should be used to reference documentation submitted to a CompSA and to help frame the
submission of the draft code.

6 CRITERIA FOR APPROVING CODES

32. Code  owners  will  need  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  how  their  code  will  contribute  to  the  proper
application of the GDPR, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors as well
as the specific requirements and obligations of the controllers or processors to whom it relates. There
are a number of aspects to this overarching requirement. Code authors  should be able to demonstrate
that their draft code:

 meets a particular need of that sector or processing activity,




facilitates the application of the GDPR,
specifies the application of the GPDR,
provides sufficient safeguards39, and

37 Some  Member  States  may  have  national  legislation which  requires  a  draft  code  to  be  submitted  in  their
national language, and it is recommended that code owners explore this issue with the relevant CompSA in
advance of formally submitting their draft code for approval.
38 English is the working language of the EDPB as per Section 23 Rules of Procedure of the EDPB.
39 For example, ‘high risk’ sectors, such as processing children’s or health data would be expected to contain
more robust and stringent safeguards, given the sensitivity of the personal data in question.



provides effective mechanisms for monitoring compliance with a code.

6.1 Meets a particular need

33. Code owners are required to demonstrate a need for the establishment of a code.  As such a code must

address data protection issues which arise for a particular sector or processing activity.

For example, the sector of information systems for the detection of consumer credit risks may identify a need
to formulate a code which provides sufficient safeguards and mechanisms to ensure that the data collected
are relevant, accurate and are used exclusively for the specific and legitimate purpose of protecting credit.
Similarly, the health research sector may identify a need to formulate a code which provides consistency in
approach  by  setting  out  standards  to  adequately  meet  explicit  consent  and  accompanying  accountability
requirements under the GDPR.

34. Code  authors  should  be  able  to  explain  and  set  out  the  problems  the  code  seeks  to  address  and
substantiate how the solutions the code offers will be effective and beneficial not only for their members
but also for data subjects.

6.2

Facilitates the effective application of the GDPR

35. As per recital 98 of the GDPR, a code, in order to attain approval, will require code owners to be able
demonstrate that their code facilitates the effective application of the GDPR. In this regard, a code will
need to clearly stipulate its sector-specific application of the GDPR and identify and address such specific
needs of a sector.40

For example, providing a list of definitions that are specific to the sector as well as an adequate focus on
topics that are particularly relevant to the sector are ways to facilitate the effective application of the
GDPR. Using sector-specific terminology to detail the implementation of the requirements of the GDPR in
the sector may also improve the clear understanding of the rules by the industry and thus facilitate the
effective application of the GDPR. A code should fully take into account the likely risks involved with a
particular sector processing activity and appropriately calibrate the related obligations of controllers or
processors to whom it applies in light of those risks in that specific sector i.e. providing  examples of
acceptable terms and conditions in relation to the use of personal data in direct marketing. In terms of
format,  the  content  of  the  code  should also  be  presented  in  a  way  that  facilitates  its  understanding,
practical use and effective application of the GDPR.

6.3 Specifies the application of the GDPR

40 See Article 40(1) of the GDPR.

36. Codes will need to specify the practical application of the GDPR and accurately reflect the nature of the
processing activity or sector. They should be able to provide clear industry specific improvements in
terms of compliance with data protection law. They will need to set out realistic and attainable standards
for all their members, and they will need to be of a necessary quality and internal consistency to provide
sufficient added value.41 In other words, a draft code will need to be adequately focused on particular
data protection areas42 and issues in the specific sector to which it applies and it will need to provide
sufficiently clear and effective solutions to address those areas and issues.43

37. A code should not just re-state the GDPR.44 Instead, it should aim to codify how the GDPR shall apply in
a specific, practical and precise manner. The agreed standards and rules will need to be unambiguous,
concrete, attainable and enforceable (testable). Setting out distinct rules in the particular field is an
acceptable method by which a code can add value.  Using terminology that is unique and relevant to the
industry and providing concrete case scenarios or specific examples of ‘best practice’45 may help to meet
this requirement.46

38. Promoting the code so individuals are informed of its existence and contents may also assist in reaching
the  standard  of  “specifying  the  application  of  the  GDPR”.  It  is  vital  that  codes  are  able  to  provide
operational meaning to the principles of data protection as articulated in Article 5 of the GDPR. It is also
vital that codes properly take into account relevant opinions and positions published or endorsed by the
Board to that particular sector or processing activity.47For example, codes containing specifications with
regard to processing activities, might also facilitate the identification of adequate legal grounds for these
processing activities in the Member States to which they intend to apply.

39. A code should also meet the requirements of Article 40(5). Approval will only be forthcoming when it is
determined  that  a  draft  code  provides  sufficient  appropriate  safeguards.48 Codes  will  need  to
appropriately  identify  and  satisfy  a  CompSA  that  they  contain  suitable  and  effective  safeguards  to
mitigate the risk around data processing and the rights and freedoms of individuals.49 It will be a matter
for the code owners to provide clear evidence showing that their code will meet these requirements.

41 This standard was first applied in WP 13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
42 Such as those listed in Article 40(2) of the GDPR.
43 This requirement reflects the previous position of the WP 29 as outlined in Working Document on Codes WP
13 DG XV D/5004/98 adopted on 10th September 1998.
44 Providing restatements of data protection law was a regular feature of unsuccessful draft codes which were
submitted for approval to WP 29.
45 And ‘unacceptable practices’.
46 A code should avoid, where possible, being overly legalistic.
47 They will also need to fully take on board relevant National and European jurisprudence.
48 See Recital 98 of the GDPR.
49 Safeguards may also apply to monitoring bodies and their capabilities in carrying out their role in an effective
manner.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

14

For example, in ‘high risk’ processing activities such as the large scale processing of children’s or health data,
profiling  or  systematic  monitoring,  it  would  be  expected  that  the  code  would  contain  more  demanding
requirements upon controllers and processors to reflect an adequate level of protection. Additionally, code
owners  may  benefit  from  carrying  out  a  more  extensive  consultation  as  per  Recital  99  of  the  GDPR  to
underpin a code involving the processing of such high risk areas.

6.4 Provides mechanisms which will allow for effective oversight

40. As per Article 40(4) of the GDPR, a code requires the implementation of suitable mechanisms to ensure
that those rules are appropriately monitored and that efficient and meaningful enforcement measures
are put in place to ensure full compliance. A code specifically needs to identify and propose structures
and procedures which provide for effective monitoring and enforcement of infringements. A draft code
will also need to identify an appropriate body which has at its disposal mechanisms to enable that body
to provide for the effective monitoring of compliance with the code. Mechanisms may include regular
audit  and  reporting  requirements,  clear  and  transparent  complaint  handling  and  dispute  resolution
procedures, concrete sanctions and remedies in cases of violations of the code, as well as policies for
reporting breaches of its provisions.

41. A draft code will be required to have a monitoring body where it involves processing carried out by non-
public authorities and bodies. In essence, a code must not only consider the contents of rules applicable
to that particular sector processing activity, but it must also implement monitoring mechanisms will
ensure the effective application of those rules. A draft code could successfully propose a number of
different monitoring mechanisms where there are multiple monitoring bodies to carry out effective
oversight.  However,  all  proposed  monitoring  mechanisms  as  to  how  to  give  effect  to  adequate
monitoring of a code will need to be clear, suitable, attainable, efficient and enforceable (testable). Code
owners  will  need  to  set out  the  rationale  and  demonstrate  why  their  proposals  for monitoring  are
appropriate and operationally feasible.50

7.1

Submission

50 The Article 29 Working Party document “Judging industry self-regulation: when does it make a meaningful
contribution  to  the level  of  data  protection  in  a  third  country?”  WP7  adopted  14  January  1998  is  also  an
informative  document  providing  further  insight  into  assessing  the  value  of  a  code  and  the  general  grounds
required for it to be effective. It is recommended that this document is also considered (where relevant) when
formulating a code.
51 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.

42. Code owners should formally submit their draft Code in either an electronic or written format to the
CompSA.52 The CompSA will revert to the code owners acknowledging receipt of the submission, and
proceed to carry out a review as to whether the draft code meets the criteria as set out above53 before
proceeding to carry out a full evaluation of its contents.

7.2

Acceptance of a Code

43. If the draft Code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the criteria for admissibility54 the CompSA
will respond to the code owners in writing outlining the basis for their decision. The process would come
to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the code owners.55

44. If the draft code meets the criteria set out above, the CompSA should write to the code owners with
confirmation that they will proceed to the next stage of the process and assess the draft code’s content
in accordance with the relevant procedures provided under national law.

7.3

Approval

45. Unless a specific timeline is prescribed under national law, the CompSA should draft an opinion within
a reasonable period of time and they should keep the draft owners regularly updated on the process
and indicative timelines. The opinion should outline the basis for their decision in line with the criteria
for approval as outlined above.56

46. If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse approval, then the process will be completed and it will
be a matter for the code owners to assess the findings of the opinion and reconsider the draft code on
that basis. It would also be necessary for the code owners to formally re-submit an updated draft code
at a later stage, if they choose to do so.

47. If the CompSA approves a draft code, it will be necessary for them to register and publish the code (via
their website and/or other appropriate methods of communication).57 Article 40(11) also requires the
Board to make publicly available all approved codes.

52 Obviously such an authority will be the National SA for the members to whom the code applies. It is also
important that code authors clearly stipulate to the CompSA that they are formally submitting a draft Code for
approval and that they clearly indicate that the jurisdictional scope of the code . Also please note Appendix 1 in

8 SUBMISSION, ACCEPTANCE AND APPROVAL58 (TRANSNATIONAL

CODE)

8.1

Submission

48. Code owners should formally submit their draft code in either an electronic or written format to a
CompSA which will act as the principal authority for the approval of the code.59 The CompSA will revert
to the code owners acknowledging receipt of the documentation and proceed to carry out a review as
to whether the draft code meets the requirements as set out above60 before proceeding to carry out a
full evaluation of its contents. The CompSA will immediately notify all other supervisory authorities of
the submission of a code and provide the salient details which will allow for ease of identification and
reference. All supervisory authorities should confirm by return whether they are concerned SAs as per
Article 4(22) (a) and (b) of the GDPR.61

8.2

Acceptance of a Code

49. If the draft code is not accepted on the basis of failing to meet the admissibility criteria set out above,
the CompSA will write to the code owners outlining the basis for their decision. The process will come
to an end on this basis and a new submission would be required to be made by the code owners.62 The
CompSA will also issue a notification updating all concerned SAs of the position.

50. If  the  draft  code  is  accepted  by  the  CompSA  on  the  basis  of  meeting  the  admissibility  criteria,  the
CompSA should write to the code owners with confirmation that they will proceed to the next stage of
the process and assess the draft code’s content.  This will trigger the following informal cooperation
procedure in respect of assessing the code for approval.

8.3

Cooperation

51. The CompSA will issue a notification updating all SAs63 of the position, identifying concerned SAs and
they will make a request seeking, on a voluntary basis, a maximum of two co-reviewers to assist with
the substantive assessment of the draft code.  The appointment of co-reviewers will be made on a first
come basis.64 The role of co-reviewers will be to assist the CompSA in assessing the draft code. Once the

58 Including amending and extending codes previously approved.
59 This should be read in the context of the procedure outlined below.
60 See also Appendix 3 checklist.
61 This is important as it is envisaged that co-reviewers of the draft code would be supervisory authorities which
are  concerned  by  the  processing  of  personal  data  because  the  controller  or  processor  is  established  on  the
territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority or because “data subjects residing in the Member
State  of  that  supervisory  authority  are  substantially  affected  or  likely  to  be  substantially  affected  by the
processing”.
62 It is worth noting that refusal at this stage of the approval process will most likely be based on general or
procedural preliminary requirements rather than substantive or core issues associated with the provision of the
draft  code.
63 Concerned SAs should be identifiable from the scope of the draft code.
64 This request will remain open for ten working days. While co-reviewers are being identified, the CompSA will
proceed with the assessment. As a rule, the CompSA will consult two co-reviewers whenever 14 Member States
17

Adopted - Version for public consultation

co-reviewers are confirmed, comments from them on the content of the code should be provided within
thirty days from their confirmation as co-reviewers.  These comments will then be considered by the
CompSA when carrying out their assessment for approval. As per Article 40(7) of the GDPR, the CompSA
will make the final determination as to whether the draft decision should be submitted to the Board as
per Articles 63 and 64 of the GDPR.65

52. The CompSA should aim to arrive at a decision within a reasonable period of time, and they should keep
the code owners regularly updated on the progress and indicative timelines. They should outline the
basis for their decision (to refuse or to approve a code) in line with the general grounds for approval and
communicate that decision in a timely manner to the code owners.

8.4

Refusal

53. If the decision made by the CompSA is to refuse referring a draft code to the Board the process will come
to  an  end  and  it  will  be  a  matter  for  the  code  owners  to  analyse  the  findings  of  the  decision  and
reconsider revising their draft code. It would also be necessary for the code owners to resubmit the code
for an approval at a later stage, if they choose to do so. The CompSA should also notify all concerned
SAs of their position and reasons for refusing to approve a code.

8.5

Preparation for submission to the Board

54. If the CompSA aim to approve the draft code, before submission to the EDPB, the CompSA will circulate
their  draft  approval  to  all  concerned  SAs.  All  concerned  SAs  will  have  30  days  to  respond  and  any
significant issues could be brought to the relevant EDPB subgroup for discussion. If the concerned SAs
do not respond, the code will proceed to the next stage of the process.

8.6

The Board

55. If the decision is to refer the matter to the Board as per Article 40(7) of the GDPR. The CompSA will
communicate  that  decision  to  all  supervisory  authorities  as  per  the  consistency mechanisms
procedure.66The CompSA will also refer the matter to the Board in line with their rules of procedure and
Article 40(7) of the GDPR.

56. Under Article 64 the Board shall issue an opinion pertaining to matters outlined in Article 40(7) of the
GDPR.67 The Rules of Procedure of the Board together with the provisions of Article 64 will apply to the
Board and the CompSA when conducting an assessment and communicating a decision on the approval
of transnational codes.

Approval

or more are concerned by the code. Under this threshold it is possible to have one or two co-reviewers depending
on the specific case.
65 This can only occur where the CompSA aims to approve the draft code. See Article 40(7) and Article 64(1).
66 See Article 64(4) of the GDPR according to which the views of other supervisory authorities concerned should
be presented along with the draft CompSA decision.
67 See task of Board as per Article 70 (1)(x) of the GDPR.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

57. The opinion of the Board will be communicated to the CompSA as per Article 64(5) of the GDPR and it
will be a matter for the CompSA as to whether it will maintain or amend its draft decision as per Article
40(5).68 An Opinion of the Board may also be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Article 40(8) and
the Board, under Article 40(11), will collate all approved transnational codes and make them publicly
available.

9 ENGAGEMENT

58. It is important to note that the assessment process should not serve as an opportunity to further consult
on the provisions of the submitted code with the CompSA. The CompSA is tasked, under Article 40(5),
to provide an opinion on whether the draft code complies with the GDPR.69 As such, the communication
envisaged between the CompSA and the code owners during this stage of the process will be primarily
for the purposes of clarification and to assist in carrying out an evaluation under Article 40 and 41. It is
anticipated  that  code  owners  will  liaise,  as  appropriate,  with  supervisory  authorities  in  advance  of
submitting their draft code for approval.  In principle, the approval stage of the process should not invite
further consultation by the code owners on particular provisions in the draft code nor should it allow for
an extended assessment whereby amendments are continually submitted to the CompSA. It is also
imperative that code owners are available to provide answers on points of clarification in respect of their
draft code and  that they are capable of doing so within a reasonable period of time. It is important that
the code owners are prepared and organised to address queries in an efficient and able manner. It is
recommended that a single or dedicated point of contact is provided to the CompSA. It will be at the
discretion of the CompSA as to whether they need further information before making their decision on
the  draft  code  and  they  will  also  have  discretion  to  determine  the  manner  of  any  communication
between the parties.  For the purposes of continuity, the CompSA will also remain as the principal point
of contact during the entire approval process for transnational codes.

10 THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION

59. The Commission may decide by way of an implementing Act that an approved transnational code will

have general validity within the Union and shall ensure appropriate publicity if they were to do so.70

11 MONITORING OF A CODE

60. In order for a code (national or transnational) to be approved, a monitoring body (or bodies), must be
identified as part of the code and accredited by the CompSA as being capable of effectively monitoring

68 See Article 64(7) and note the procedures invoked if a CompSA disagrees with the Board’s opinion as per Article
64(8) of the GDPR.
69 The CompSA may also advise and, where relevant, make recommendations to code owners in relation to the
content and format of their draft code.
70 See Article 40(9) and Article 40(10). Such a decision would also permit controllers and processors that are not
subject to the GPDR to make binding and enforceable  commitments regarding a  validated code (See Article
40(3)).  This  would  allow  data  transfers  to  third  countries  or  international  organisations  on  the  basis that
appropriate safeguards are in place and rights and effective legal remedies are available for data subjects (See
also Article 46(1) and 46(2)(e)).

the code.71 The CompSA will submit their draft requirements for accreditation of a monitoring body to
the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 of the GDPR.  Once approved
by the Board the requirements can then be applied by the CompSA to accredit a monitoring body.

61. The GDPR does not define the term ‘accreditation’. However, Article 41 (2) of the GDPR outlines general
requirements for the accreditation of the monitoring body. There are a number of requirements which
should be met in order to satisfy the CompSA to accredit a monitoring body. Code owners will need to
explain and demonstrate how their proposed monitoring body meets the requirements set out in Article
41(2) to obtain accreditation.

62. The GDPR provides flexibility around the type and structure of a monitoring body to be accredited under
Article 41. Code owners may decide to use external or internal monitoring bodies provided that in both
cases the relevant body meets the accreditation requirements of Article 41 (2) as outlined in the eight
requirements listed below.

12 ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MONITORING BODIES

12.1 Independence

63. The code owners will need to demonstrate that the body concerned is appropriately independent in
relation to its impartiality of function from the code members and the profession, industry or sector to
which  the  code  applies.  Independence  could  be  evidenced  through  a  number  of  areas  such  as  the
monitoring body’s funding, appointment of members/staff, decision making process and more generally
in terms of its organisational structure. These are considered in more detail below.

64. There  are  two  main  models  of  monitoring  which  could  be  used  by  code  owners  for  fulfilling  the
monitoring body requirements: external and internal monitoring body. There is some flexibility within
these  two  types  of  monitoring  approaches  and  different  versions  could  be  proposed  which  are
appropriate given the context for the code. Examples of internal monitoring bodies could include an ad
hoc internal committee or a separate, independent department within the code owner. It will be for the
code owners to explain the risk management approach with regard to its impartiality and independence.

65. For  instance,  where  an  internal  monitoring  body  is  proposed,  there  should  be  separate  staff  and
management, accountability and function from other areas of the organisation. This may be achieved in
a number of ways, for example, the use of effective organisational and information barriers and separate
reporting management structures for the association and monitoring body. Similar to a data protection
officer, the monitoring body should be able to act free from instructions and shall be protected from
any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or indirect) as a consequence of the fulfilment of
its task.

66. Independence could require, that an external counsel or other party having participated in the drafting
of the code of conduct, would need to demonstrate that there were appropriate safeguards in place to
sufficiently mitigate a risk of independence or a conflict of interest. The monitoring body would need to

71 GDPR Article 41 (1). Also note that Article 41 does not apply to public authorities or bodies.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

20

provide evidence as to the appropriateness of the mechanisms which would satisfactorily identify and
mitigate such risks.72 A monitoring body will need to identify risks to its impartiality on an ongoing basis,
such as its activities or from its relationships. If a risk to impartiality is identified, the monitoring body
should demonstrate how it removes or minimises such risk and uses an appropriate mechanism for
safeguarding impartiality.

67. Independence could also be demonstrated by showing full autonomy for the management of the budget
and other resources, in particular in cases where the monitoring body is internal. A monitoring body
would also need to be able to act independently in its choice and application of sanctions against a
controller or processor adhering to the code. In essence, the body - either internal or external - will need
to act independently from code owners and members within the scope of the code in performing its
tasks and exercising its powers.

12.2 Conflict of interest73

68. It will need to be demonstrated that the exercise of the monitoring body’s tasks and duties do not result
in  a  conflict  of  interests.  As  such,  the  code  owners  will  need  to  demonstrate  that  the  proposed
monitoring body will refrain from any action that is incompatible with their tasks and duties and that
safeguards are put in place to ensure that will not engage with an incompatible occupation. Similarly,
the monitoring body must remain free from external influence, whether direct or indirect, and shall
neither seek nor take instructions from any person, organisation or association. The body should have
its own staff which are chosen by them or some other body independent of the code and they should
be subject to the exclusive direction of those bodies only. In the case of an internal monitoring body, it
shall be protected from any sort of sanctions or interference (whether direct or indirect) by the code
owner, other relevant bodies,74 or members of the code as a consequence of the fulfilment of its tasks.

12.3 Expertise

69. The code owners will need to be able to demonstrate that the monitoring body has the requisite level
of expertise to carry out its role in an effective manner. As such, the submission will need to include
details as to the knowledge and experience of the body in respect of data protection law as well as of
the particular sector or processing activity. For example, being able to point to previous experience of
acting  in  a  monitoring  capacity  for  a  particular  sector  may  assist  in  meeting  this  requirement.
Furthermore, an in-depth understanding of data protection issues and expert knowledge of the specific
processing  activities  which  are  the  subject  matter  of  the  code  will  be  welcomed.  The  staff  of  the
proposed  monitoring  body  should  also  have  appropriate  operational  experience  and  training  for
carrying  out  the  monitoring  of  compliance  such  as  in  the  field  of  auditing,  monitoring,  or  quality
assurance activities.

12.4 Established procedures and structures

72 The context for the code will determine the approach to take. For example, a proposal where there is an
adequate separation of duties, whereby the monitoring body personnel did not write, pilot or test the code may
suffice.
73 Impartiality of function, i.e. the ability to act autonomously.
74 Bodies who represent categories of controllers or processors.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

21

70. A monitoring body will also need to have appropriate governance structures and procedures which allow

it to adequately:





assess for eligibility of controllers and processors to apply the code;
to monitor their compliance with its provisions; and
to carry out reviews of the code’s operation.

71. Comprehensive  vetting  procedures  should  be  drafted  which  adequately  assess  the  eligibility  of
controllers and processors to sign up to and comply with the code. They should also ensure that the
provisions of the code are capable of being met by the controllers and processors.

72. Procedures and structures to actively and effectively monitor compliance by members of the code will
be required. These could include random or unannounced audits, annual inspections, regular reporting
and the use of questionnaires.75 The monitoring procedures can be designed in different ways as long
as they take into account factors such as the risks raised by the data processing in scope of the code,
complaints received or specific incidents and the number of members of the code etc.. Consideration
could be given to the publication of audit reports as well as to the findings of periodic reporting from
controllers and processors within the scope of the code.

73. Code  owners  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  that  the  proposed  monitoring  body  have  adequate
resources  and  staffing  to  carry  out  its  tasks  in  an  appropriate  manner.    Resources  should  be
proportionate to the expected number and size of code members, as well as the complexity or degree
of risk of the relevant data processing.

12.5 Transparent complaints handling

74. A  monitoring  body  will  need  to  establish  effective procedures  and  structures  which  can  deal  with
complaints  handling  in  an  impartial  and  transparent  manner.  As  such,  it  needs  to  have  a  publicly
accessible complaints handling process which is sufficiently resourced to manage complaints and to
ensure that decisions of the body are made publicly available.

For example, evidence of a complaints handling procedure could be a described process to receive, evaluate,
track, record and resolve complaints. This could be outlined in publicly available guidance for the code so that
a complainant can understand and follow the complaints process. Furthermore, the independence of such
processes could be assisted by separate operational staff and management functions in the monitoring body.

75. Monitoring  bodies  should  also  have  effective  procedures  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  code  by
controllers or processors. An example would be to give the monitoring body powers to suspend or
exclude  a  controller  or  processor  from  the  code  when  they  act outside the  terms  of the  code  (i.e.
corrective measures).

75 This could also help prevent a situation whereby members are monitored repeatedly while others are not.

Adopted - Version for public consultation

22

76. If a code member breaks the rules of the code, the monitoring body is obliged to take immediate suitable
measures. The aim of suitable corrective measures will be to stop the infringement and to avoid future
recurrence. Such remedial actions and sanctions could include such measures ranging from training to
issuing a warning, report to the Board of the member, a formal notice requiring the implementation of
specific actions within a specified deadline, temporary suspension of the member from the code until
remedial action is taken to the definitive exclusion of such member from the code. These measures
could be publicised by the monitoring body, especially where there are serious infringements of the
code.

77. Where required, the monitoring body should be able to inform the code member, the code owner, the
CompSA and all concerned SAs about the measures taken and its justification without undue delay.76
Moreover, in the case where a Lead Supervisory Authority (LSA)77 for a transnational code member is
identifiable, the monitoring body should also appropriately inform the LSA as to their actions.

12.6 Communication with the competent supervisory authority

78. A proposed monitoring body framework needs to allow for the effective communication of any actions
carried out by a monitoring body to the CompSA and other supervisory authorities in respect of the code
is required. This could include decisions concerning the actions taken in cases of infringement of the
code by a code member, providing periodic reports on the code, or providing review or audit findings of
the code.78

79. In addition, it will need to ensure that the supervisory authority is not prejudiced or impeded in its role.
For example, a code which proposes that their members can unilaterally approve, withdraw or suspend
a monitoring body without any notification and agreement with the CompSA would be in contravention
of Article 41(5) of the GDPR.

12.7 Review Mechanisms

80. A code will need to set out appropriate review mechanisms to ensure that the code remains relevant
and continues to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR. Review mechanisms should also be
put in place to adapt to any changes in the application and interpretation of the law or where there are
new technological developments which may have an impact upon the data processing carried out by
their members or the provisions of the code.

12.8 Legal status

81. The proposed monitoring body (whether internal or external) and related governance structures will
need to be formulated in such a manner whereby  the code owners can demonstrate that the monitoring
body has the appropriate standing to carry out its role under Article 41(4) and is capable of being fined
as per Article 83(4)(c) of the GDPR.

76 If the monitoring is carried out by a body outside the association/body that submits the code of conduct, the
code owner should also be informed.
77 Pursuant to Art. 56 of the GDPR.
78 See Article 41(4).

13 APPROVED CODES

82. Clearly the nature and content of the code will determine the roles of the relevant stakeholders in terms
of ensuring compliance with the code and the GDPR. However, the CompSA will continue to have a role
in ensuring the code remains fit for purpose.

83. The  CompSA  will  therefore  work  closely  with  the  monitoring  body  in  terms  of  the  reporting
requirements arising from the code.  The monitoring body will act as the lead contact and coordinator
in terms of any issues which may arise in relation to the code.

84. The CompSA would also approve any further amendments or extensions to the code and accredit any
new monitoring bodies. As per Article 40(5) of the GDPR, any amendment or extension of an existing
code will also have to be submitted a CompSA in line with the procedures outlined in this document.

14 REVOCATION OF A MONITORING BODY

85. When a monitoring body does not comply with applicable provisions of the GDPR, a CompSA will also

have the powers to revoke the accreditation of a monitoring body under Article 41(5).79

86. However, the consequences of revoking the accreditation of the sole monitoring body for a code may
result  in  the  suspension,  or  permanent  withdrawal,  of  that  code  due  to  the  loss  of  the  required
compliance monitoring. This may adversely affect the reputation or business interests of code members,
and may result in a reduction of trust by their data subjects or other stakeholders.

87. Where  circumstances permit,  revocation  should  only  take  place  after  the  CompSA  has  given  the
monitoring  body  the  opportunity  to  urgently  address  issues  or  make  improvements  as  appropriate
within an agreed timescale. In cases which involve transnational codes, the CompSA should, before
agreeing  to  setting  parameters  with  the  monitoring  body  to  address  the  issues  raised,  liaise  with
concerned SAs on the matter. The decision to revoke a monitoring body should also be communicated
to all concerned SAs and the Board (for the purposes of Article 40(11).

15 PUBLIC SECTOR CODES

88. Article 41(6) of the GDPR provides that the monitoring of approved codes of conduct will not apply to
processing  carried  out  by  public  authorities  or  bodies.80 In  essence,  this  provision  removes  the
requirement for an accredited body to monitor a code. This exemption does not in any way dilute the
requirement for the implementation of effective mechanisms to monitor a code. This could be achieved
by adapting existing audit requirements to include monitoring of the code.

79 For transnational codes, it is also essential that the CompSA should ensure that all concerned SAs will be aware
of taking such an action. Similarly, for such codes, a concerned SA should also inform the CompSA in cases where
a data controller (who is supposed to adopt the code) is found to be non-compliant with it, since this finding may
raise concerns on the effectiveness of the monitoring body and the code.
80 The classification of public sector authorities or bodies is a matter for each member state to determine.

APPENDIX 1 - DISTINCTION BETWEEN NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL
CODES

A transnational code refers to a code which relates to processing activities in more than one Member
State. As such, a transnational code may relate to processing activities carried out by a multiplicity of
controllers or processors in several Member States without necessarily amounting to ‘cross-border
processing’ as defined in Article 4(23) of the GDPR.

Therefore, where a code of conduct adopted by a national association in one Member State covers
processing activities by its members in several Member States, it will qualify as a transnational code.

Whereas if an association with a code approved at national level is joined by an international member
that conducts cross-border processing, that member could only claim the benefit of the approved code
for processing activities in the Member State which approved the code.81 Mechanisms would need to
be put in place to ensure that there is adequate transparency as regards the effective territorial scope
of the code.

81 However, using the same example, it would also be open to the code owners to consider extending the scope
of the code and to seek approval for a transnational code.

APPENDIX 2 - CHOOSING A COMPSA

Code owners may have a choice regarding the identification of a CompSA for the purposes of seeking
approval of their transnational draft code.82 The GDPR does not set out specific rules for identifying
the CompSA who is most appropriate to carry out an assessment of a draft code. Nevertheless, to assist
code owners in identifying the most appropriate CompSA, to evaluate their code, some of the factors
which could be taken into account may include the following83:











The location of the largest density of the processing activity or sector;
The location of the largest density of data subjects affected by the processing activity or sector;
The location of the code owner’s headquarters;
The location of the proposed monitoring body’s headquarters; or
The initiatives developed by a supervisory authority in a specific field84;

Whilst these factors are not prescriptive criteria, the decision of choosing a CompSA is important and
should be prudently considered. 85 The CompSA role includes, inter alia, acting as a single point of
contact with the code owners  during the approval process, managing the application procedure in its
cooperation phase, accrediting the monitoring body (if relevant) and acting as the supervisory lead in
ensuring that an approved code is being monitored effectively.

82 See Article 55 in conjunction with Recital 122 of the GDPR.
83 This list is non-exhaustive and non-hierarchical.
84 For example, a Supervisory Authority may have published a detailed and significant policy paper which directly
relates to the processing activity which is the subject matter of the code.
85 A submission for approval of a draft code cannot be refused by a CompSA on the basis that none (or only some)
of the non-exhaustive list of criteria outlined in Appendix 2 are met. It can only be refused on the basis of not
meeting the criteria outlined in the Section entitled ‘Admissibility of a Draft Code’.

APPENDIX 3 - CHECKLIST FOR SUBMISSION

Before submitting a draft code to the competent supervisory authority it is important that you ensure
the following (where relevant) have been submitted/set out and are appropriately signposted within
the documentation:

1. Have  you  provided  an  explanatory  statement  and  all  relevant  supporting  documentation?

(Paragraph 20)

2. Are you an association or other body representing categories of controllers or processors?

(Paragraph 21)

3. Have  you  provided  details  in  your  submission  to  substantiate  that  you  are  an  effective
representative body that is capable of understanding the needs of your members? (Paragraph
22)

4. Have you clearly defined the processing activity or sector and the processing problems to

which the code is intended to address? (Paragraph 23)

5. Have you identified the territorial scope of your code and included a list of all concerned SAs

(where relevant)? (Paragraph 24)

6. Have you provided details to justify the identification of the CompSA? (Paragraph 25)
7. Have you included mechanisms that allow for the effective monitoring of compliance of the

code? (Paragraph 26)

8. Have you identified a monitoring body and explained how it will fulfil the code monitoring

requirements? (Paragraph 27)

9. Have you included information as to the extent of consultation carried out in developing the

code? (Paragraph 28)

10. Have you provided confirmation that the draft code is compliant with Member State law(s)

(where relevant)? (Paragraph 29)

11. Have you met the language requirements? (Paragraph 30)

Does your submission include sufficient details to demonstrate the proper application of the GDPR?
