Statement 3/2019 on an ePrivacy regulation

Adopted on 13 March 2019

The European Data Protection Board has adopted the following statement:

The  EDPB  calls  on  the  EU  legislators  to intensify  efforts  towards  the  adoption  of  an ePrivacy
Regulation, which is necessary to complete the EUâ€™s framework for data protection and confidentiality
of communications. The EDPB wishes to reiterate the positions previously adopted by data protection
authorities in the EU, including the Opinion 1/2017 of the Article 29 Working Party and the Statement
adopted on 25 May 2018. The ePrivacy Regulation must under no circumstances lower the level of
protection offered by the current ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC and must complement the GDPR by
providing additional strong guarantees for all types of electronic communications. Far from being an
obstacle to the development of new technologies and services, the ePrivacy Regulation is necessary
to ensure a level playing field and legal certainty for market operators. The EDPB invites Member
States, under the leadership of the Presidency of the Council, to ensure a high level of protection and
to proceed to the finalisation of their negotiating position without further delay, so that negotiations
with the European Parliament can begin as soon as possible.
