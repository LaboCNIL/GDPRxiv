Sending secure email: instructions for clients 

If you want to send confidential or sensitive documents to the Ministry of Justice or agencies in its administra-

tive branch, it is advisable to do it by using the Ministry's secure email system (https://turvaviesti.om.fi). The 

service is easy and safe to use and free of charge. 

If you want to send a secure email message to an official address of the Ministry or one of its agencies, insert 

the necessary identification information to the subject, content and attachments of your message so that it 

can be directed to the right person and that the subject area and sender of the message are known. 

These instructions explain how to send a secure email message to the Ministry of Justice and its agencies. 

1.  Go to address https://turvaviesti.om.fi/. Write your email address in the From box and click on Con-

5.  Add the email addresses of the recipient(s). Write down the subject and content of the message and, 

if needed, add attachments to it. Click on Send. The maximum size of an attachment is 400 MB. You 

can also send zipped attachments. 

PLEASE NOTE! You may improve the security of an email message by using SMS verification. 

By using the verification, you can ensure that your message is not accidentally sent to a wrong recipi-

ent for example due to a typing error. When you use SMS verification, the recipient will receive a text 

message including a PIN code that is required to open the secure email message. 

If you wish to use SMS verification, write ‘.recipient's phone number.sec’ (without spaces) at the end 

of the recipient's email address (for example, john.smith@om.fi.0501234567.sec)
