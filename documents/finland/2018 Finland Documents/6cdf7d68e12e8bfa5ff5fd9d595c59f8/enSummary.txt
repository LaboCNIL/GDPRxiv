 The aim of the website reform was to take account of various users and their needs. The new website is clearer than the previous one. The website of the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman includes information for both private individuals and organisations. We provide advice for private persons on how to exercise their rights related to personal data. In the section for organisations, we inform about the issues that must be taken into account when processing personal data. New forms will be added to the website. The web forms make it easier to use our services. Website content has been updated to comply with the new data protection legislation. The European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal data from 25 May 2018. Website development continues New content is produced and updated on the website on a continuous basis. The Swedish and English pages in particular will be completed in the coming weeks. Feedback on the website is welcome to viestinta.tietosuoja(at)om.fi.
