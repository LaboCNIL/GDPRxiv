The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has adopted 2 important guidelines on key topics regarding Data Protection, namely the targeting of social media users and the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR.
Prior to the final version, the Board organises public consultations to gather the views and concerns of all interested stakeholders and citizens.
Since these topics might directly affect you, the IDPC encourages all concerned parties to contribute and participate in this public consultation, of which deadline is 19th October 2020.
Targeting of social media users
Kindly find here the Guidelines 08/2020 on the targeting of social media users, adopted on the 2nd of September 2020.
According to the Board, as part of a business model, many social media providers offer targeting services. Targeting services make it possible for natural or legal persons, called the targeters, to communicate specific messagesto the users of social media in order to advance commercial, political, or other interests.

Concepts of controller and processor
Furthermore, here is the link to Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR, also adopted on the 2nd of September 2020.
In a nutshell, the concepts of controller, joint controller, and processor are functional concepts in that they aim to allocate responsibilities according to the actual roles of the parties and autonomous concepts in the sense that they should be interpreted mainly according to EU data protection law.
