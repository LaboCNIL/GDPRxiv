Data protection awareness campaignThis Office embarked on an awareness campaign designed to increase public awareness on the data protection rights deriving from the General Data Protection Regulation.
The IDPC’s objective is to instill a culture where citizens of different age groups understand the importance of safeguarding their personal data and be well-informed of how to exercise their rights under the GDPR.
A series of publicity material has been produced and published on different communication media.
This project is co-financed by the European Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020.
The following two videos were produced as part of this campaign.
The first one is intended to raise awareness on the steps that a social media user needs to take to ensure that a photograph which identifies, or leads to the identification of a natural person, including a car number plate, is blurred or pixilated before being uploaded online and made available to other users.The second video was specifically produced to deliver the message to home owners that the installation of a CCTV camera. on a private dwelling should not capture public spaces or neighbouring houses but its angle of vision should be adjusted to only capture the perimeter of one’s own property.
