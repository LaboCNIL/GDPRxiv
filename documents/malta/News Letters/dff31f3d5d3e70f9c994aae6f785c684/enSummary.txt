EDPB Launches Data Protection Guide for small business
27th April 2023
The EDPB has launched a Data Protection Guide to help small business owners on their way to become more data protection compliant. The Guide aims to raise awareness about the GDPR and to provide practical information to SMEs about GDPR compliance in an accessible and easily understandable format.
Andrea Jelinek said, “In this guide, SMEs will find various tools and practical tips to help them comply with the GDPR. It includes concrete examples gathered during our 5 years of experience with the GDPR.”
The Guide covers various aspects of the GDPR, from data protection basics, to data subject rights, data breaches, and more. It contains videos, infographics, interactive flowcharts, and other practical materials to help SMEs put data protection into practice. In addition, the Guide contains an overview of handy materials developed for SMEs by the national Data Protection Authorities.
The Guide is currently available in English and will be made available in other EU languages over time.
The Guide is one of the EDPB’s awareness raising actions for 2023 and was included as a key initiative in the EDPB’s 2021-2023 Strategy.
