Bulgarian Data Protection Authority launches “GDPR in your Pocket” mobile app
 Adapted version. Original by CPDP
The GDPR gives prominence to the promotion of awareness on data protection rights and obligations. It is of utmost importance that stakeholders understand the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to processing of personal data in order to reach and maintain a high level of data protection across the European Union.
Raising awareness amongst controllers and processors and providing information to data subjects concerning the exercise of their rights under the GDPR are indeed specific tasks formally assigned to supervisory authorities in order to meet this objective.
Within this context, our office endorses the initiatives of its European counterparts, such as the “GDPR in Your Pocket” mobile app recently launched by the Bulgarian Data Protection Authority.
The app aims at introducing the GDPR to citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in an easy-to-use and understandable way by providing practical knowledge on data protection rights and obligations. 
By collecting relevant legislation, CJEU and national case-law and guidelines in one single resource centre, the app represents a valuable tool for a holistic view over the European data protection legal framework. 
The app is multi-lingual (Bulgarian, English, German, French and Italian) and it is available for free download for Android, Apple and Microsoft environments using the links provided below.
