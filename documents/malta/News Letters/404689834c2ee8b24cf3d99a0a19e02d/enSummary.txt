During 2019, this Office managed to secured EU funding under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020 with the project entitled GDPR awareness campaign and support to business organisations, in particular, SMEs â€“ GDPRights.
This project seeks to achieve the following two objectives:
1. increase awareness amongst the Maltese general public and business stakeholders on data protection; and
2. assist SMEs, in particular, to facilitate compliance with their obligations under the GDPR with the development of an online tool.
In the weeks to come, the activities under this project will start to be effectively implemented, the first of which, being the publication of a number of data protection awareness clips targeted to two age groups on different communication platforms.
