pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 

on the adequate protection of personal data by the United Kingdom

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal 
data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data 
Protection Regulation)1 , and in particular Article 45(3) thereof,

INTRODUCTION  

Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  sets  out  the  rules  for  the  transfer  of  personal  data  from 
controllers  or  processors  in  the  European  Union  to  third  countries  and  international 
organisations to the extent that such transfers fall within its scope of application. The 
rules on international data transfers are laid down in Chapter V of that Regulation, that 
is in Articles 44 to 50. While the flow of personal data to and from countries outside 
the  European  Union  is  essential  for  the  expansion  of  international  cooperation  and 
cross-border  trade,  the  level  of  protection  afforded  to  personal  data  in  the  European 
Union must not be undermined by transfers to third countries2. 

Pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the Commission may decide, 
by  means  of  an  implementing  act,  that  a  third  country,  a  territory  or  one  or  more 
specified  sectors  within  a  third  country,  or  an  international  organisation  ensure(s)  an 
adequate level of protection. Under this condition, transfers of personal data to a third 
country  may  take  place  without  the  need  to  obtain  any  further  authorisation,  as 
provided for in Article 45(1) and recital 103 of that Regulation. 

As  specified  in  Article  45(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  adoption  of  an 
adequacy decision has to be based on a comprehensive analysis of the third country's 
legal order, covering both the rules applicable to the data importers and the limitations 
and  safeguards  as  regards  access  to  personal  data  by  public  authorities.  In  its 
assessment,  the  Commission  has  to  determine  whether  the  third  country  in  question 
guarantees  a  level  of  protection  “essentially  equivalent”  to  that  ensured  within  the 
European  Union  (recital  104  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679).  The  standard  against 
which  the  “essential  equivalence”  is  assessed  is  that  set  by  European  Union 
legislation, notably Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as the case law of the Court of

Justice  of  the  European  Union3.  The  European  Data  Protection  Board’s  (EDPB) 
adequacy referential is also of significance in this regard4.  

As  clarified  by  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union,  this  does  not  require 
finding  an  identical  level  of  protection5.  In  particular,  the  means  to  which  the  third 
country in question has recourse for protecting personal data may differ from the ones 
employed  in  the  European  Union,  as  long  as  they  prove,  in  practice,  effective  for 
ensuring  an  adequate  level  of  protection6.  The  adequacy  standard  therefore  does  not 
require  a  point-to-point  replication  of  Union  rules.  Rather,  the  test  lies  in  whether, 
through  the  substance  of  data  protection  rights  and  their  effective  implementation, 
supervision and enforcement, the foreign system as a whole delivers the required level 
of protection7. 

The Commission has carefully analysed the law and practice of the United Kingdom. 
Based  on  the  findings  developed  in  recitals  (8)  to  (270),  the  Commission  concludes 
that  the  United  Kingdom  ensures  an  adequate  level  of  protection  for  personal  data 
transferred within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 from the European Union to 
the United Kingdom.  

This  conclusion  does  not  concern  personal  data  transferred  for  United  Kingdom 
immigration  control  purposes  or  which  otherwise  falls  within  the  scope  of  the 
exemption from certain data subject rights for purposes of the maintenance of effective 
immigration  control  (the  “immigration  exemption”)  pursuant  to  paragraph  4(1)  of 
Schedule  2  to  the  UK  Data  Protection  Act.  The  validity  and  interpretation  of  the 
immigration  exemption  under  UK  law  is  not  settled  following  a  decision  of  the 
England  and  Wales  Court  of  Appeal  of  26  May  2021.  While  recognising  that  data 
subject  rights  can, in principle, be restricted  for immigration  control purposes as “an 
important  aspect  of  the  public  interest”,  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  found  that  the 
immigration  exemption  is,  in  its  current  form,  incompatible  with  UK  law,  as  the 
legislative measure lacks specific provisions setting out the safeguards listed in Article 
23(2)  of  the  United  Kingdom  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (UK  GDPR)8.  In 
these conditions, transfers of personal data from the Union to the United Kingdom to 
which the immigration exemption  can be applied should be excluded from  the scope

of this Decision9. Once the incompatibility with UK law is remedied, the immigration 
exemption should be reassessed, as well as the need to maintain the limitation of the 
scope of this Decision.  

(7) 

This Decision should not affect the direct application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to 
organisations  established  in  the  United  Kingdom  where  the  conditions  regarding  the 
territorial scope of that Regulation, laid down in its Article 3, are fulfilled. 

2.  

RULES APPLYING TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA 

2.1.  The constitutional framework 

(8) 

(9) 

The  United  Kingdom  is  a  Parliamentary  democracy  which  has  a  constitutional 
sovereign  as  Head  of  State.  It  has  a  sovereign  Parliament,  which  is  supreme  to  all 
other government institutions, an Executive drawn from and accountable to Parliament 
and  an  independent  judiciary.  The  Executive  draws  its  authority  from  its  ability  to 
command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is accountable to both 
Houses  of  Parliament  which  are  responsible  for  scrutinising  the  Government  and 
debating and passing laws.  

The  United  Kingdom  Parliament  has  devolved  responsibility  to  the  Scottish 
Parliament,  the  Welsh  Parliament  (Senedd  Cymru),  and  the  Northern  Ireland 
Assembly for legislating on domestic matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 
which the United Kingdom Parliament has not reserved to itself. While data protection 
is a reserved matter, i.e. the same legislation applies across the country, other areas of 
policy  relevant  to  this  Decision  are  devolved.  For  instance,  the  criminal  justice 
systems,  including  policing,  of  Scotland  and  Northern  Ireland  are  devolved  to  the 
Scottish  Parliament  and  Northern  Ireland  Assembly,  respectively.  The  United 
Kingdom  does  not  have  a  codified  constitution  in  the  sense  of  an  entrenched 
constitutive document. Constitutional principles have emerged over time, drawn from 
case law and convention in particular. The constitutional value of certain statutes, such 
as  Magna  Carta,  the  Bill  of  Rights  1689  and  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  has  been 
recognised by  courts. The fundamental  rights  of individuals have been  developed, as 
part of the constitution, through common law, those statutes, and international treaties, 
in  particular  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  which  the  United  Kingdom 
ratified in 1951. The United Kingdom also ratified the Council of Europe Convention 
for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 
(Convention 108) in 198710. 

(10)  The  Human  Rights  Act  1998  incorporates  the  rights  contained  in  the  European 
Convention on Human Rights into the law of the United Kingdom. The Human Rights 
Act grants any individual the fundamental rights and freedoms provided in Articles 2 
to 12 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Articles 1, 2 and 3 of its 
First  Protocol  and  Article  1  of  its  Thirteenth  Protocol,  as  read  in  conjunction  with 
Articles 16, 17 and 18 of that Convention. This includes the right to respect for private

Provided that the applicable conditions are fulfilled, transfers for UK immigration control purposes may 
be carried out on the basis of the transfer mechanisms provided by Articles 46 to 49 of Regulation (EU) 
2016/679. 
The  principles  of  Convention  108  were  originally  implemented  into  the  law  of  the  United  Kingdom 
through the Data Protection Act of 1984, which was replaced by the DPA 1998, and then in turn by the 
DPA 2018 (as read with the UK GDPR). The United Kingdom has also signed the Protocol amending 
the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data 
(known as Convention 108+) in 2018 and is currently working on the ratification of the convention.

and family life (and the right to data protection as part of that right) and the right to a 
fair  trial11.  In  particular,  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  that  Convention,  a  public  authority 
may  only  interfere  with  the  right  to  privacy  in  accordance  with  the  law,  where 
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or 
the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the 
protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of 
others. 

(11) 

In accordance with the Human Rights Act 1998, any action of public authorities must 
be  compatible  with  a  Convention  Right12.  In  addition,  primary  and  subordinate 
legislation  must  be  read  and  given  effect  in  a  way  that  is  compatible  with  the 
Convention rights13. 

2.2.  The data protection framework of the United Kingdom 

(12)  The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020. On the 
basis of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern  Ireland  from  the  European  Union  and  the  European  Atomic  Energy 
Community14,  Union  law  continued  to  apply  in  the  United  Kingdom  during  the 
transition  period  until  31  December  2020.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal  and  during  the 
transition  period,  the  legislative  framework  on  the  protection  of  personal  data  in  the 
United  Kingdom  consisted  of  the  relevant  EU  legislation  (in  particular  Regulation 
(EU)  2016/679  and  Directive  (EU)  2016/680  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the 
Council15)  and  national  legislation,  in  particular  the  Data  Protection  Act  2018  (DPA 
2018)16 which provided national  rules, where  allowed by Regulation  (EU) 2016/679, 
specifying and restricting the application of the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 
transposed Directive (EU) 2016/680. 

(13)  To  prepare  for  withdrawal  from  the  European  Union,  the  United  Kingdom 
the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  201817,  which 
Government  enacted 
incorporates  directly  applicable  Union  legislation  into  the  law  of  the  United 
Kingdom18.  This  so-called  “retained  EU  law”  includes  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  in

The  intention  and  effect  of  the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018  is  that  all  direct  Union

its  entirety  (including  its  recitals)19.  In  accordance  with  that  act,  the  unmodified 
retained  EU  law  must  be  interpreted  by  the  courts  of  the  United  Kingdom  in 
accordance  with  the  relevant  case  law  of  the  European  Court  of  Justice  and  general 
principles  of  Union  law  as  they  have  effect  immediately  before  the  end  of  the 
transition period (called “retained EU case law” and “retained general principles of EU 
law” respectively)20.  

(14)  Under  the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018,  the  ministers  of  the  United 
Kingdom have the power to introduce secondary legislation, via statutory instruments, 
to make the necessary modifications to retained European Union law consequential to 
the  United  Kingdom’s  withdrawal  from  the  European  Union.  They  exercised  that 
power  by  adopting  the  Data  Protection,  Privacy  and  Electronic  Communications 
(Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (DPPEC Regulations)21. The DPPEC 
Regulations  amend  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  as  brought  into  United  Kingdom  law 
through  the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018,  the  DPA  2018,  and  other  data 
protection legislation to fit the domestic context22. 

(15)  Consequently,  the  legal  framework  on  the  protection  of  personal  data  in  the  United 

Kingdom after the end of the transition period consists of: 

–  The UK GDPR, as incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom under the 
European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018  and  amended  by 
the  DPPEC 
Regulations23, and 
–  the DPA 201824, as amended by the DPPEC Regulations. 

(16)  As the UK GDPR is  based on EU legislation, the data protection rules in the United 
Kingdom in many aspects closely mirror the corresponding rules applicable within the 
European Union.

The Explanatory Notes to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 specifies that: “Where legislation 
is converted  under this Section, it is the text of the legislation itself  which  will  form part of domestic 
legislation.  This  will  include  the  full  text  of  any  EU  instrument  (including  its  recitals)”.  (Explanatory 
Notes  to  the  European  Union  (Withdrawal)  Act  2018,  paragraph  83,  available  at  the  following  link:

to 
information provided by the UK authorities, as the recitals do not have the status of binding legal rules, 
it was not necessary to amend them in the same way as the Articles of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 have 
been amended by the DPPEC Regulations.

(17) 

In  addition  to  the  powers  afforded  to  the  Secretary  of  State  by  the  European  Union 
(Withdrawal)  Act  2018,  several  provisions  of  the  DPA  2018  give  powers  to  the 
Secretary  of  State  to  adopt  secondary  legislation  to  amend  certain  provisions  of  the 
Act or provide supplementary and additional rules25. The Secretary of State has so far 
only  exercised  the  power  under  Section  137  of  the  DPA  2018  to  adopt  the  Data 
Protection  (Charges  and  Information)  (Amendment)  Regulations  2019,  which  set  out 
the circumstances in which data controllers are required to pay an annual charge to the 
UK’s independent data protection authority, the Information Commissioner.  

(18)  Finally, further  guidance on the data protection legislation of the United  Kingdom  is 
provided  in  the  codes  of  practice  and  other  guidance  adopted  by  the  Information 
Commissioner.  Although  not  formally 
this  guidance  carries 
interpretative weight and demonstrates how the data protection legislation applies and 
is enforced by the Commissioner in practice. In particular, Sections 121 to 125 of the 
DPA  2018  require  the  Commissioner  to  prepare  codes  of  practice  on  data-sharing, 
direct marketing, age-appropriate design and data protection and journalism.  

legally  binding, 

(19) 

In  its  structure  and  main  components,  the  UK  legal  framework  applying  to  data 
transferred under this Decision is thus very similar to the one applying in the European 
Union.  This  includes  the  fact  that  such  framework  does  not  only  rely  on  obligations 
laid down in domestic law, that have been shaped by EU law, but also on obligations 
enshrined in international law, in particular through the United Kingdom’s adherence 
to the ECHR and Convention 108, as well as its submission to the jurisdiction of the 
European  Court  of  Human  Rights.  These  obligations  arising  from  legally  binding 
international  instruments,  concerning  notably  the  protection  of  personal  data,  are 
therefore  a  particular  important  element  of  the  legal  framework  assessed  in  this 
Decision. 

2.3.  Material and territorial scope 

(20)  Similarly  to  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  UK  GDPR  applies  to  the  processing  of 
personal  data  wholly  or  partly  by  automated  means,  or  to  other  processing,  if  the 
personal  data  forms  part  of  a  filing  system26.  The  definitions  of  “personal  data”,  of 
“data  subject”  and  of  “processing”  of  the  UK  GDPR  are  identical  to  those  of 
Regulation  (EU) 2016/67927.  In  addition,  the UK  GDPR applies to  the processing of 
manual  unstructured  personal  data28  held  by  certain  United  Kingdom  public 
authorities29,  although  UK  GDPR  principles  and  rights  that  are  not  relevant  to  such 
personal data are disapplied by Sections 24 and 25 of the DPA 2018. Similarly to what 
is  provided  under  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  UK  GDPR  does  not  apply  to  the

Such  powers  are  contained  for  example  in  Section  16  (power  to  make,  in  specific,  narrowly 
circumscribed  situations,  further  exemptions  to  specific  provisions  of  the  UK  GDPR),  17A  (power  to 
adopt  adequacy  regulations),  212  and  213  (powers  to  commence  legislation  and  make  transitional 
provision), and 211 (power to make minor and consequential amendments) of the DPA 2018. 
Article 2(1) and (5) of the UK GDPR. 

Article 4(1) and 2 of the UK GDPR. 

The manual unstructured processing of personal data is defined in Article 2(5)(b) as the processing of 
personal data which is not the automated or structured processing of personal data. 
Article  2(1A)  of  the  UK  GDPR  provides  that  the  Regulation  also  applies  to  the  manual  unstructured

processing  of  personal  data  by  an  individual  in  the  course  of  a  purely  personal  or 
household activity30. 

(21)  The  UK  GDPR  extends  its  scope  also  to  the  processing  in  the  course  of  an  activity 
which,  immediately  before  the  end  of  the  transition  period,  fell  outside  the  scope  of 
European Union law (e.g. national security)31, or was within the scope of Chapter 2 of 
Title  5  of  the  Treaty  on  European  Union  (Common  Foreign  and  Security  Policy 
activities)32.  As  in  the  European  Union  system,  the  UK  GDPR  does  not  apply  to  the 
processing  of  personal  data  by  a  competent  authority  for  purposes  of  the  prevention, 
investigation,  detection  or  prosecution  of  criminal  offences  or  the  execution  of 
criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to 
public  security  (so  called  “law  enforcement  purposes”)  –  such  processing  is  instead 
governed  by  Part  3  of  the  DPA  2018,  as  it  is  the  case  for  Directive  (EU)  2016/680 
under  European  Union  law  –  or  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  intelligence 
services  (the  Security  Service,  the  Secret  Intelligence  Service  and  the  Government 
Communications Headquarters) which is covered by Part 4 of the DPA 201833. 

(22)  The territorial scope of the UK GDPR is described in Article 3 of the UK GDPR34 and 
includes  the  processing  of  personal  data  (regardless  of  where  it  takes  place)  in  the 
context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the United 
Kingdom as well as to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the 
United Kingdom, where the processing activities are related to the offering of goods or 
services to such data subjects or the monitoring of their behaviour35. This reflects the 
approach taken in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

2.4.  Definitions of personal data and concepts of controller and processor 

(23)  The  definitions  of  personal  data,  processing,  controller,  processor,  as  well  as  the 
definition  of  pseudonymisation,  laid  down  in  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  have  been 
retained  without  material  modifications  in  the  UK  GDPR36.  Moreover,  special 
categories  of  data  are  defined  in  Article  9(1)  of  the  UK  GDPR  in  the  same  way  as 
under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, 
religious  or  philosophical  beliefs,  or  trade  union  membership,  and  the  processing  of

Article 2(2)(a) of the UK GDPR. 
National security activities are only covered by the scope of the UK GDPR as far as they are not carried 
out  by  a  competent  authority  for  law  enforcement  purposes,  in  which  case  Part  3  of  the  DPA  2018 
applies, or by or on behalf of an intelligence service, whose activities are carved out from the scope of 
the UK GDPR and subject to Part 4 of the DPA 2018 pursuant to Article 2(2)(c) of the UK GDPR. For 
example, a police force may conduct security checks against an employee to ensure he can be trusted to 
access  national  security  material.  Despite  the  police  being  a  competent  authority  for  law  enforcement 
purposes,  the  processing  in  question  is  not  for  a  law  enforcement  purpose  and  the  UK  GDPR  would 
apply.  See  UK  Explanatory  Framework  for  Adequacy  Discussions,  section  H:  National  Security  Data 
Protection  and  Investigatory  Powers  Framework,  page  8,  available  at

the  following 

Article 2(2)(b)&(c) of the UK GDPR.  

The same territorial scope applies to the processing of personal data under Part 2 of the DPA 2018 that 
supplements the UK GDPR (Section 207(1A)).  
This  notably  means  that  the  DPA  2018  and  therefore  this  decision  do  not  apply  to  UK  Crown 
dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man) and United Kingdom Overseas Territories, such as 
for example the Falkland Islands and the territory of Gibraltar.

data  concerning  health  or  data  concerning  a  natural  person's  sex  life  or  sexual 
orientation”).  Section  205  of  the  DPA  2018  provides  the  definition  of  “biometric 
data”37, “data concerning health”38 and “genetic data”39.  

2.5. 

Safeguards, rights and obligations 

2.5.1.  Lawfulness and fairness of processing 

(24)  Personal data should be processed lawfully and fairly.  

(25)  The  principles  of  lawfulness,  fairness  and  transparency  and  the  grounds  for  lawful 
processing are guaranteed in the law of the United Kingdom through Articles 5(1)(a) 
and  6(1)  of  the  UK  GDPR,  which  are  identical  to  the  respective  provisions  in 
Regulation (EU) 2016/67940. Section 8 of the DPA 2018 complements Article 6(1)(e) 
by  providing  that  the  processing  of  personal  data  under  Article  6(1)(e)  of  the  UK 
GDPR (necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in 
the exercise of the controller’s official authority), includes processing of personal data 
that is  necessary for the  administration of justice, the exercise of a function of either 
House of Parliament, the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment 
or rule of law, the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown or a 
government  department,  or  an  activity  that  supports  or  promotes  democratic 
engagement. 

(26)  With respect to consent (one of the grounds for lawful processing), the UK GDPR also 
retains  the  conditions  provided  for  in  the  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679 
unmodified,  that  is  to  say  the  controller  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  data 
subject has consented, a written request for consent must be presented using clear and 
plain language, the data subject must have the right to withdraw consent at any time, 
and  when  assessing  whether  consent  is  freely  given,  it  should  be  taken  into  account 
whether  the  performance  of  a  contract  is  conditional  on  consent  to  the  processing  of 
personal  data  that  is  not  necessary  for  the  performance  of  that  contract.  Moreover, 
pursuant to Article 8 of the UK GDPR, in the context of the provision of information 
society services a child’s consent is lawful only when the child is at least 13 years old. 
This falls within the age bracket set in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

“Biometric  data”  means  personal  data  resulting  from  specific  technical  processing  relating  to  the 
physical,  physiological  or  behavioural  characteristics  of  an  individual,  which  allows  or  confirms  the 
unique identification of that individual, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data. 
“Data concerning health” means personal data relating to the physical or mental health of an individual, 
including the provision of health care services, which reveals information about his or her health status.  
“Genetic  data”  means  personal  data  relating  to  the  inherited  or  acquired  genetic  characteristics  of  an 
individual  which  gives  unique  information  about  the  physiology  or  the  health  of  that  individual  and 
which results, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the individual in question. 
Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the UK GDPR, processing is lawful only if and to the extent that: (a) the data 
subject  has  given  consent  to  the  processing  of  his  or  her  personal  data  for  one  or  more  specific 
purposes; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party 
or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; (c) processing 
is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d) processing is 
necessary  in  order  to  protect  the  vital  interests  of  the  data  subject  or  of  another  natural  person;  (e) 
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise 
of  official  authority  vested  in  the  controller;  or  (f)  processing  is  necessary  for  the  purposes  of  the 
legitimate  interests  pursued  by  the  controller  or  by  a  third  party,  except  where  such  interests  are 
overridden  by  the  interests  or  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subject  which  require 
protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

2.5.2.  Processing of special categories of personal data 

(27)  Specific  safeguards  should  exist  where  “special  categories”  of  data  are  being 

processed. 

(28)  The UK GDPR and the DPA 2018 contain specific rules as regards the processing of 
special categories of personal data, which are defined in Article 9(1) of the UK GDPR 
in  the  same  way  as  under  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  (see  recital  (23)  above). 
According to Article 9 of the UK GDPR, the processing of special categories of data is 
in principle prohibited, unless a specific exception applies.  

(29)  These  exceptions  (listed  in  Article  9(2)  and  (3)  of  the  UK  GDPR)  do  not  make  any 
changes  of  substance  to  those  in  Article  9(2)  and  (3)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679. 
Unless  the  data  subject  has  given  its  explicit  consent  to  the  processing  of  those 
personal data, the processing of special categories of personal data is only permitted in 
specific  and  limited  circumstances.  In  most  instances,  processing  of  sensitive  data 
must be necessary for a specific purpose defined in the relevant provision (see Article 
9(2)(b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j)).  

(30)  Moreover,  where  an  exception  under  Article  9(2)  of  the  UK  GDPR  requires  an 
authorisation  by  law  or  refers  to  the  public  interest,  Section  10  of  the  DPA  2018 
together with Schedule 1 to the DPA 2018 further specify the conditions that must be 
met  for  the  exceptions  to  be  relied  upon.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  processing  of 
sensitive  data  for  protecting  “public  health”  (Article  9(2)(i)  of  the  UK  GDPR), 
paragraph 3(b) of Part 1 of Schedule 1 requires that, in addition to the necessity test, 
such processing is carried out “by or under the responsibility of a health professional” 
or “by another person who owes a duty of confidentiality under an enactment or rule 
of law”, including under the well-established common law duty of confidentiality. 

(31)  Where  sensitive  data  is  processed  for  reasons  of  substantial  public  interest  (Article 
9(2)(g)  of  the  UK  GDPR),  Part  2  of  Schedule  1  to  the  DPA  2018  provides  an 
exhaustive list of purposes that can be considered as of substantial public interest, and, 
for  each  of  these  purposes,  sets  out  specific  additional  conditions.  For  instance, 
promoting racial and ethnic diversity at senior levels of organisations is recognised as 
a  substantial  public  interest.  Processing  of  sensitive  data  for  this  specific  purpose  is 
subject to detailed requirements, including that the processing is carried out as part of 
a  process  of  identifying  suitable  individuals  to  hold  senior  positions,  is  necessary  to 
promote  racial  and  ethnic  diversity  and  is  not  likely  to  cause  substantial  damage  or 
substantial distress to the data subject.  

(32)  Section 11(1) of the DPA 2018 sets out conditions for personal data to be processed in 
the circumstances described in Article 9(3) of the UK GDPR relating to the obligation 
of  secrecy.  This  includes  circumstances  in  which  it  is  carried  out  by  or  under  the 
responsibility  of  a  health  professional  or  a  social  work  professional,  or  by  another 
person who in the circumstances owes a duty of confidentiality under an enactment or 
rule of law. 

(33) 

In  addition,  many  of  the  exceptions  listed  in  Article  9(2)  of  the  UK  GDPR  require 
suitable  and  specific  safeguards  in  order  to  be  used.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the 
processing  and  the  level  of  risk  for  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  data  subjects,  the 
conditions  for  processing  provided  for  in  Schedule  1  to  the  DPA  2018  establish 
different safeguards. Schedule 1 sets out the conditions for each processing situation in 
turn.  

EN

  EN 

(34) 

(35) 

(36) 

(37) 

In some cases, the DPA 2018 regulates and limits the type of sensitive data that may 
be processed for a particular legal basis to be complied with. For example, paragraph 8 
of  Schedule  1  authorises  the  processing  of  sensitive  data  for  the  purpose  of  the 
promotion of equality of opportunity or treatment. This processing condition can only 
be  used  if  the  data  reveals  racial  or  ethnic  origin,  religious  or  philosophical  beliefs, 
sexual orientation, or if it is health data.  

In some cases, the DPA 2018 limits the type of controller that may use the processing 
condition.  For  example,  paragraph  23  of  Schedule  1  provides  for  processing  of 
sensitive  data  in  relation  to  elected  representatives’  responses  to  the  public.  This 
processing condition can only be used if the controller is the elected representative or 
is acting under their authority. 

In some other cases, the DPA 2018 sets limits on the categories of data subject for the 
processing  condition  to  be  used.  For  example,  paragraph  21  of  Schedule  1  regulates 
the processing of sensitive data for occupational pension schemes. This condition can 
only be used if the data subject in question is a sibling, parent, grandparent, or great-
grandparent of the scheme member.  

In addition, when relying on the exceptions in Article 9(2) of the UK GDPR that are 
further specified in Section 10 of the DPA 2018 together with Schedule 1 to the DPA 
2018,  the  controller  in  most  instances  is  required  to  draft  an  “Appropriate  Policy 
Document”.  It  must  outline  the  controller’s  procedures  for  securing  compliance  with 
the principles in Article 5 of the UK GDPR. It must also set out policies for retention 
and  erasure,  with  an  indication  of  the  likely  storage  period.  Controllers  must  review 
and  update  this  document  as  appropriate.  The  controller  must  keep  the  policy 
document for six months after processing is finished and must make it available to the 
Information Commissioner on request41. 

(38)  Pursuant to paragraph 41 of Schedule 1 to the DPA 2018, the Policy Document must 
always be accompanied by an augmented record of processing. This record must track 
the commitments included in the Policy Document, i.e. whether data is being erased or 
retained in accordance with the policies. If the policies have not been followed, the log 
must  record  the  reasons.  The  record  must  also  describe  how  the  processing  satisfies 
Article  6  of  the  UK  GDPR  (lawfulness  of  processing)  and  the  specific  condition  in 
Schedule 1 to the DPA 2018 relied on. 

(39)  Finally,  like  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  UK  GDPR  also  provides  general 
safeguards for certain processing operations of special categories of data. Article 35 of 
the  UK  GDPR  requires  a  data  protection  impact  assessment  if  special  categories  of 
data  are  processed  on  a  large  scale.  Pursuant  to  Article  37  of  the  UK  GDPR,  a 
controller or processor must designate a data protection officer where its core activities 
consist of processing special categories of data on a large scale.  

(40)  With respect to personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, Article 10 
of the UK GDPR is identical to Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It allows the 
processing  of  personal  data  relating  to  criminal  convictions  and  offences  only  under 
the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by domestic law 
providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

to 

the  specific  requirements 

(41)  Where  the  processing  of  data  relating  to  criminal  convictions  and  offences  is  not 
carried  out  under  the  control  of  official  authority,  Section  10(5)  of  the  DPA  2018 
provides  that  such  processing  can  take  place  only  for  the  specific  purposes/  in  the 
specific  situations  set  out  in  Parts  1,  2  and  3  of  Schedule  1  to  the  DPA  2018  and  is 
subject 
these 
purposes/situations. For  example, criminal  convictions data can be processed by  not-
for-profit  bodies  if  the  processing  is  carried  out  (a)  in  the  course  of  its  legitimate 
activities  with  appropriate  safeguards  by  a  foundation,  association  or  other  not-for-
profit  body  with  a  political,  philosophical,  religious  or  trade  union  aim,  and  (b)  on 
condition that (i) the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of 
the  body  or  to  persons  who  have  regular  contact  with  it  in  connection  with  its 
purposes,  and  (ii)  the  personal  data  is  not  disclosed  outside  that  body  without  the 
consent of the data subjects.  

that  are  set  out  for  each  of 

(42)  Moreover,  Part  3  of  Schedule  1  to  the  DPA  2018  sets  out  further  circumstances  in 
which  criminal  convictions  data  may  be  used  which  correspond  to  the  legal  grounds 
for  processing  of  sensitive  data  in  Article  9(2)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  and  the 
UK GDPR (e.g. consent of the data subject, vital interests of an individual if the data 
subject  is  legally  or physically unable to  give  consent, if data has already  manifestly 
been made public by the data subject, if processing is necessary for the establishment, 
exercise or defence of a legal claim etc.). 

2.5.3  Purpose limitation, accuracy, data minimisation, storage limitation and data security 

(43)  Personal  data should be processed for a specific purpose and subsequently  used only 

insofar as this is not incompatible with the purpose of processing. 

(44)  This  principle  is  provided  in  Article  5(1)(b)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  and  has 
been retained without changes in Article 5(1)(b) of the UK GDPR. The conditions on 
further  compatible  processing  pursuant  to  Article  6(4)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679 
have also been retained with no material modifications in Article 6(4)(a)  - (e) of UK 
GDPR.  

(45)  Moreover,  data  should  be  accurate  and,  where  necessary,  kept  up  to  date.  It  should 
also be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is 
processed, and in principle be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for 
which the personal data is processed.  

(46)  These  principles  of  data  minimisation,  accuracy  and  storage  limitation  are  set  out  in 
Article  5(1)(c)  to  (e)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  and  are  retained  without 
modifications in Article 5(1)(c) to (e) in the UK GDPR.  

(47)  Personal  data  should  also  be  processed  in  a  manner  that  ensures  their  security, 
including  protection  against  unauthorized  or  unlawful  processing  and  against 
accidental  loss,  destruction  or  damage.  To  that  end,  business  operators  should  take 
appropriate technical or organisational measures to protect personal data from possible 
threats.  These  measures  should  be  assessed  taking  into  consideration  the  state  of  the 
art and related costs. 

(48)  Data security is enshrined in the law of the United Kingdom through the principle of 
integrity  and  confidentiality  in  Article  5(1)(f)  of  the  UK  GDPR  and  in  Article  32  of 
the  UK  GDPR  on  security  of  processing.  Those  provisions  are  identical  to  the 
respective  provisions  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679.  Moreover,  under  the  same 
conditions as those set out in Articles 33 and 34 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the UK 
GDPR requires the notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority 

EN 

11 

  EN 

(Article 33 of the UK GDPR) and the communication of a personal data breach to the 
data subject (Article 34 of the UK GDPR).  

2.5.4  Transparency 

(49)  Data  subjects  should  be  informed  of  the  main  features  of  the  processing  of  their 

personal data. 

(50)  This is ensured by Articles 13 and 14 of the UK GDPR, which, in addition to a general 
principle of transparency, provide rules on the information to be provided to the data 
subject42. The UK GDPR introduces no material modifications to these rules compared 
to  the  corresponding  articles  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679.  However,  like  under 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the transparency requirements of those articles are subject 
to several exceptions laid down in the DPA 2018 (see recitals (55) to (72)). 

2.5.5 

Individual rights 

(51)  Data subjects should have certain rights which can be enforced against the controller 
or  processor,  in  particular  the  right  of  access  to  data,  the  right  to  object  to  the 
processing  and  the  right  to  have  data  rectified  and  erased.  At  the  same  time,  such 
rights  may  be  subject  to  restrictions,  as  far  as  these  restrictions  are  necessary  and 
proportionate  to  safeguard  public  security  or  other  important  objectives  of  general 
public interest. 

2.5.5.1 The substantive rights  

(52)  The  UK  GDPR  grants  individuals  the  same  enforceable  rights  as  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679. The provisions providing the rights of the individuals have been maintained 
in the UK GDPR without material changes.  

(53)  The  rights  include  the  right  of  access  by  the  data  subject  (Article  15  of  the  UK 
GDPR),  the  right  to  rectification  (Article  16  of  the  UK  GDPR),  the  right  to  erasure 
(Article 17 of the UK GDPR), the right to restriction of processing (Article 18 of the 
UK GDPR), a notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data 
or restriction of processing (Article 19 of the UK GDPR), the right to data portability 
(Article 20 of the UK GDPR), and the right to object (Article 21 of the UK GDPR)43. 
The  latter  also  includes  the  right  of  a  data  subject  to  object  to  the  processing  of 
personal  data  for  the  purpose  of  direct  marketing  provided  in  paragraphs  2  and  3  of 
Article  21  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679.  Moreover,  under  Section  122  of  the  DPA

In  Articles  13(1)(f)  and  14(1)(f)  the  references  to  adequacy  decisions  by  the  Commission  have  been 
replaced with references to equivalent United Kingdom instrument i.e. adequacy regulations under the 
DPA  2018.  In  addition,  in  Articles  14(5)(c)-(d)  the  references  to  EU  or  Member  State  law  have  been 
replaced with a reference to domestic law (as examples of such domestic law that may fall under Article 
14(5)(c),  the  United  Kingdom  has  mentioned  Section  7  of  the  Scrap  Metal  Dealers  Act  2013  that 
provides rules for register of scrap metal licences or Part 35 of the Companies Act 2006 providing the 
rules  for  the  registrar  of  companies.  Similarly,  an  example  of  domestic  law  that  may  fall  under  Art 
14(5)(d)  could  include  legislation  laying  down  rules  on  professional  confidentiality,  or  obligations 
reflected in contracts of employment or the common law duty of confidentiality (such as personal data 
processed by health professionals, human resources, social workers etc.). 
In Articles 17(1)(e) and 17(3)(b) the references to EU or Member State law have been replaced with a 
reference  to  domestic  law  (as  examples  of  such  domestic  law  under  Article  17(1)(e),  the  United 
Kingdom  has  mentioned  the  Education  (Pupil  Information)  (England)  Regulations  2006  that  requires 
the names of the pupils to be erased from the school registries after they have left the school or Medical 
Act 1983, Section 34F, which set outs the rules on the removal of names from the General Practitioner 
Register and the Specialist Register.

(54)  The  data  subject’s  right  not  to  be  subject  to  a  decision  based  solely  on  automated 
processing  that  produces  legal  effects  concerning  them,  or  similarly  affects  them 
significantly,  as  provided  in  Article  22  GDPR,  has  also  been  retained  in  UK  GDPR 
without  substantial  changes.  However,  a  new  paragraph  3A  has  been  added  to 
reference that Section 14 of the DPA 2018 sets out safeguards for data subjects’ rights, 
freedoms  and  legitimate  interests  when  the  processing  is  carried  out  under  Article 
22(2)(b) of the UK GDPR. This only applies when the basis for such a decision is an 
authorisation or requirement under United Kingdom law, and does not apply where the 
decision is necessary under a contract or made with the data subject’s explicit consent. 
Where Section 14 of the DPA 2018 applies, the controller must, as soon as reasonably 
practicable,  notify  the  data  subject  in  writing  that  a  decision  has  been  taken  based 
solely  on  automated  processing.  The  data  subject  has  a  right  to  request  that  the 
controller - within one  month of receipt of the  notice  - reconsider the decision, or to 
take a new decision that is not based solely on automated processing. The Secretary of 
State is empowered to adopt further safeguards as regards automated decision-making. 
This power has not yet been exercised.  

2.5.5.2 Restrictions to individual rights and other provisions  

(55)  The  DPA  2018  sets  out  several  restrictions  to  individual  rights,  fitting  within  the 
framework of Article 23 of the UK GDPR. No restrictions are introduced within this 
framework  concerning  the  right  to  object  to  direct  marketing  as  provided  in  Article 
21(2) and (3) of the UK GDPR or to the right not to be subject to automated decision 
making as provided in Article 22 of the UK GDPR.  

(56)  The restrictions are detailed in Schedules 2-4 to the DPA 2018. The United Kingdom 
authorities  have  explained  that  they  are  guided  by  two  principles:  the  principle  of 
specificity (taking a granular approach, splitting broad restrictions into multiple, more 
specific  provisions)  and 
is 
complemented  by  safeguards  in  the  form  of  limitations  or  conditions  to  prevent 
abuse)45.  

the  principle  of  conditionality  (each  provision 

(57)  The  restrictions  described  in  Article  23(1)  of  the  UK  GDPR  are  designed  to  ensure 
they  only  apply  in  specified  circumstances  where  necessary  in  a  democratic  society 
and proportionate to the legitimate aim they pursue. Furthermore, in accordance with 
established case law on  the interpretation of restrictions, an exemption  from  the data 
protection  regime  can  only  be  applied  in  any  particular  case  if  it  is  necessary  and

proportionate  to  do  so46.  The  test  of  necessity  has  been  required  to  be  “a  strict  one, 
requiring any interference with the subject’s rights to be proportionate to the gravity of 
the  threat  to  the  public  interest.  The  exercise  therefore  involves  a  classic 
proportionality analysis47.”  

(58)  The  aims  pursued  by  these  restrictions  correspond  to  the  ones  listed  in  Article  23  of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, except for the restrictions for national security and defence 
that are instead regulated by Section 26 of the DPA 2018, but are subject to the same 
requirements of necessity and proportionality (see recitals (63) to (66)). 

(59)  Some  of  the  restrictions,  for  example  those  related  to  the  prevention  or  detection  of 
crime,  to  the  apprehension  or  prosecution  of  offenders,  and  to  the  assessment  or 
collection  of  tax  or  duty48  permit  restrictions  to  all  the  individual  rights  and 
transparency  obligations  (excluding  rights  under  Article  21(2)  and  Article  22).  The 
scope of other restrictions is limited to transparency obligations and access rights, such 
as the restrictions relating to legal professional privilege49, to the right to freedom from 
a  requirement  to  provide  information  that  would  lead  to  self-incrimination50,  and  to 
corporate  finance,  notably  the  prevention  of  insider  trading51.  Few  of  the  restrictions 
permit  a  restriction  to  the  controller’s  obligation  to  communicate  a  data  breach  to  a 
data  subject  and  the  principles  of  purpose  limitation,  and  lawfulness,  fairness  and 
transparency of the processing52.  

(60)  Some of the restrictions apply automatically “in full” to a certain type of processing of 
personal data (for example, the application of transparency obligations and individual 
rights  is  excluded  when  personal  data  is  processed  for  the  purposes  of  assessing  a 
person’s suitability for judicial office or personal data is processed by a court, tribunal, 
or individual, acting in a judicial capacity).  

(61)  However,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  the  relevant  paragraph  in  Schedule  2  to  the  DPA 
2018  specifies  that  the  restriction  applies  only  when  (and  to  the  extent)  that  the 
application of the provisions “would be likely to prejudice” the legitimate aim pursued 
by that restriction: for example, the listed provisions of the UK GDPR do not apply to 
personal data processed for the prevention or detection  of crime, the apprehension or 
prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of a tax or duty “to the extent 
that  the  application  of  those  provisions  would  be  likely  to  prejudice”  any  of  these 
matters53.

(62)  The “would be likely to  prejudice” standard has been consistently interpreted by UK 
courts  to  mean  “a  very  significant  and  weighty  chance  of  prejudice  to  the  identified 
public  interests”54.  A  restriction  subject  to  the  prejudice  test  can  therefore  only  be 
invoked if and to the extent that there is a very significant and weighty chance that the 
granting of a certain right would prejudice the public interest at stake. The controller is 
responsible  for  assessing  on  case-by-case  basis  whether  these  conditions  are 
fulfilled55.  

(63) 

In addition to the restrictions contained in Schedule 2 to the DPA 2018, Section 26 of 
the DPA 2018 provides  an exemption  which may  be  applied to  certain  provisions of 
the UK GDPR and of the DPA 2018  if that exemption is required for the purpose of 
safeguarding national security or for defence purposes. This exemption applies to the 
data  protection  principles  (except  the  principle  of  lawfulness),  the  transparency 
obligations, the rights of the data subject, the obligation to notify a data breach, rules 
on  international  transfers,  some  of  the  duties  and  powers  of  the  Information 
Commissioner,  and  the  rules  on  remedies,  liabilities  and  penalties,  except  for  the 
provision on the general conditions for imposing administrative fines set out in Article 
83  of  the  UK  GDPR  and  the  provision  on  penalties  in  Article  84  of  the  UK  GDPR. 
Moreover  Section  28  of  the  DPA  2018  modifies  the  application  of  Article  9(1)  to 
enable the processing of special categories of data in Article 9(1) of the UK GDPR to 
the  extent  that  the  processing  is  carried  out  for  safeguarding  national  security  or  for 
defence purposes, and with appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data 
subjects56. 

(64)  The  exemption  can  only  be  applied  to  the  extent  that  it  is  required  to  safeguard 
national  security or defence. As it is  also  the  case for the other  exemptions provided 
for by the DPA 2018, it must be considered and invoked by the controller on a case-
by-case basis. Moreover, any application of the exemption must be in compliance with 
human  right  standards  (underpinned  by  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998),  according  to 
which any interference with privacy rights should be necessary and proportionate in a 
democratic society57. 

(65)  This interpretation of the exemption is confirmed by the ICO that has issued  detailed 
guidance  on  the  application  of  the  national  security  and  defence  exemption,  making 
clear that it must be considered and applied by the controller on a case by case basis58.

Open Rights Group & Anor, R (On the Application Of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & 
Anor, paragraph 31. 
According  to  the  information  provided  by  the  UK  authorities,  where  processing  is  in  the  national 
security context, controllers will typically be applying enhanced safeguards and security measures to the 
processing,  reflecting  the  sensitive  nature  of  the  processing.  Which  safeguards  are  appropriate  will 
depend on the risks posed by the processing being undertaken. This could include restrictions on access 
to the data so it can only be  accessed by authorised persons  with appropriate security clearance, strict 
restrictions  on  sharing  the  data,  and  the  high  standard  of  security  applied  to  the  storage  and  handling 
procedures.  
See  also  Guriev  v  Community  Safety  Development  (United  Kingdom)  Ltd  [2016]  EWHC  643  (QB),

In particular, the guidance stresses that “[t]his is not a blanket exemption” and that, in 
order  to  invoke  it,  “it  is  not  enough  that  the  data  is  processed  for  national  security 
purposes”.  By  contrast,  the  controller  relying  on  it  must  “show  that  there  is  a  real 
possibility  of  an  adverse  effect  on  national  security”  and,  when  necessary,  the 
controller  is  expected  to  “provide  [the  ICO]  with  evidence  about  why  [it]  used  this 
exemption”.  The  guidance  contains  a  checklist  and  a  series  of  examples  to  further 
clarify the conditions under which this exemption can be invoked. 

(66)  The  fact  that  the  data  is  processed  for  national  security  or  defence  purposes  is 
therefore not on its own sufficient for the exemption to be applied. A controller must 
consider  the  actual  consequences  to  national  security  if  it  had  to  comply  with  the 
particular  data  protection  provision.  The  exemption  can  only  be  applied  to  those 
specific provisions which have been identified as posing the risk and must be applied 
as restrictively as possible59. 

(67)  This approach has been confirmed by the Information Tribunal60. In the case of Baker 
v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (“Baker  v  Secretary  of  State”),  it 
determined that it was unlawful to apply the national security exemption as a blanket 
exemption  to  access  requests  received  by  the  intelligence  services.  Instead,  the 
exemption had to be applied on a case-by-case basis, by looking at each request on its 
merit and in view of the right of individuals to respect for their private lives61. 

2.5.6  Restrictions  for  personal  data  processed  for  journalistic,  artistic,  academic  and 
literary purposes as well as archiving and research  

(68)  Article  85(2)  of  the  UK  GDPR  allows  for  provision  to  be  made  for  personal  data 
processed  for journalistic, artistic, academic  and literary purposes to  be  exempt from 
several provisions of the UK GDPR. Part 5 of Schedule 2 to the DPA 2018 sets out the 
exemptions for processing for these purposes. It provides for exemptions from the data 
protection  principles  (except  the  principle  of  integrity  and  confidentiality),  the  legal 
grounds  for  processing  (incl.  special  categories  of  data  and  criminal  convictions  etc. 
data),  the  conditions  for  consent,  the  transparency  obligations,  the  rights  of  the  data 
subjects,  the  obligation  to  notify  data  breaches,  and  the  requirement  to  consult  the 
Information Commissioner prior to high risk processing, and the rules on international 
transfers62. In this regard, the UK GDPR does not depart in a substantive manner from 

                                                 
59 

According  to  an  example  provided  by  the  UK  authorities,  if  a  suspected  terrorist  under  active 
investigation by MI5 made an access request to the Home Office (for instance, because he is engaged in 
a  dispute  with  the  Home  Office  over  immigration  matters),  it  would  be  necessary  to  protect  from 
disclosure  to  the  data  subject  any  data  that  MI5  may  have  shared  with  the  Home  Office  relating  to 
ongoing investigations that could prejudice sensitive sources,  methods or techniques and/or lead to an 
increase  in  the  threat  posed  by  the  individual.  In  such  circumstances  it  is  likely  that  the  threshold  to 
apply the Section 26 exemption would have been met and an exemption from disclosing the information 
would  be  required  in  order  to  safeguard  national  security.  However,  if  the  Home  Office  also  held 
personal  data  about  the  individual  which  did  not  relate  to  the  MI5  investigation  and  that  information 
could  be  provided  without  risk  of  damage  to  national  security,  then  the  national  security  exemption 
would  not  be  applicable  when  considering  disclosure  of  information  to  the  individual.  The  ICO  is 
currently  preparing  guidance  on  how  controllers  should  approach  the  use  of  the  exemption  at  Section 
26. The guidance is expected to be published by the end of March 2021.  
The Information Tribunal was established to hear data protection appeals under the Data Protection Act 
1984.  In  2010  the  Information  Tribunal  became  part  of  the  General  Regulatory  Chamber  of  the  First 
Tier Tribunal, as part of the reform of the structure of the UK system of tribunals.

State”).

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which in its Article 85 also provides for the possibility to 
exempt  processing  carried  out  for  journalistic  purposes  or  the  purposes  of  academic, 
artistic  or  literary  expression  from  a  number  of  requirements  of  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679. The provisions of the DPA 2018, notably Schedule 2, Part 5, are compatible 
with the UK GDPR.  

(69)  The core balancing exercise to be carried out under Article 85 of the UK GDPR relates 
to  whether  an  exemption  to  the  data  protection  rules  mentioned  in  recital  (68)  is 
“necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the freedom of 
expression and information”63. According to  Schedule 2, paragraphs 26(2)  and (3) to 
the DPA 2018, the United Kingdom applies a “reasonable belief” test in order for this 
balance to be struck. For an exemption to be justified, the controller must reasonably 
believe (i) that publication is in the public interest; and (ii) that the application of the 
relevant  GDPR  provision  would  be  incompatible  with  journalistic,  academic,  artistic 
or literary purposes. As confirmed by case law64, the “reasonable belief” test has both 
a  subjective  and  an  objective  component:  it  is  insufficient  for  the  controller  to 
demonstrate that he himself believed compliance was incompatible. His belief must be 
reasonable, i.e. it could be believed by a reasonable person, knowing the relevant facts. 
The controller must therefore exercise due diligence when forming his belief in order 
to  be able to  demonstrate reasonableness.  According to  the explanations provided by 
the United Kingdom authorities, the “reasonable belief” test must be carried out on an 
exemption-by-exemption  basis65.  If  the  conditions  are  met,  the  exemption  is 
considered necessary and proportionate under United Kingdom law. 

(70)  According to Section 124 of the DPA 2018, the ICO is to prepare a Code of Practice 
on  Data  Protection  and  Journalism.  Work  on  this  Code  is  ongoing.  Guidance  on  the 
matter under the Data Protection Act 1998 has been issued which notably stresses that, 
to rely on this exemption, it is insufficient to merely state that compliance would be an 
inconvenience  for  journalist  activities,  but  there  must  be  a  clear  argument  that  the

In accordance with Schedule 2, Part 5, paragraph 26(2) to the DPA 2018, the exception applies to the 
processing  of  personal  data  carried  out  for  special  purposes  (the  purposes  of  journalism,  academic 
purposes, artistic purposes and literary purposes), if the processing is being carried out with a view to 
the  publication  by  a  person  of  journalistic,  academic,  artistic  or  literary  material,  and  the  controller 
reasonably believes that the publication of that material would be in the public interest. In determining 
whether a publication would be in the public interest, the controller must take into account the special 
importance of the public interest in the freedom of expression and information. Moreover, the controller 
must  have  regard  to  codes  of  practice  or  guidelines  relevant  to  the  publication  in  question  (the  BBC 
Editorial  Guidelines,  Ofcom  Broadcasting  Code,  and  Editors’  Code  of  Practice).  Furthermore,  for  an 
exemption to apply, the controller must reasonably believe that compliance with the relevant provision 
would be incompatible with the special purposes (paragraph 26(3) of Schedule 2 to the DPA 2018). 
The  judgment  in  NT1  v.  Google  [2018]  EWHC  799  (QB),  paragraph  102  addressed  a  discussion  of 
whether the data controller held a reasonable belief that publication was in the public interest, and that 
compliance  with  the  relevant  provisions  was  incompatible  with  the  special  purposes.  The  court  stated 
that Sections 32(1) (b) and (c) of Data Protection Act 1998 had a subjective and an objective element: 
the data controller must establish that it held a belief that publication would be in the public interest, and 
that this belief was objectively reasonable; it must establish a subjective belief that compliance with the 
provision from which it seeks exemption would be incompatible with the special purpose in question. 
An example of how the “reasonable belief” test is applied is included in the ICO’s decision to fine True 
Visions Productions, which was made under the Data Protection Act 1998. The ICO accepted that the 
media controller had a subjective belief that compliance with the first data protection principle (fairness 
and  lawfulness)  was  incompatible  with  journalistic  purposes.  However,  the  ICO  did  not  accept  this 
belief  was  objectively  reasonable.  The  ICO  decision

provision in question presents an obstacle to responsible journalism66. Guidance on the 
application  of  the  public  interest  test  and  the  balancing  of  public  interest  against  an 
individual’s  interest  in  privacy  has  also  been  published  by  the  United  Kingdom’s 
telecommunications regulator OFCOM and the BBC in its editorial guidelines67. The 
guidelines  notably  provide  examples  of  information  that  can  be  considered  in  the 
public interest, and explain the need to be able to demonstrate that the public interest 
outweighs privacy rights in the particular circumstances of the case. 

(71)  Similarly  to  what  is  provided  in  Article  89  GDPR,  personal  data  processed  for 
archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest,  scientific  or  historical  research  purposes  or 
statistical purposes can also be exempted from a number of listed provisions of the UK 
GDPR68. As regards research and statistics, exemptions are possible to the provisions 
of  the  UK  GDPR  related  to  confirmation  of  processing  and  access  to  data  and 
safeguards  for  third  country  transfers;  right  to  rectification;  restriction  of  processing 
and objection to processing. As regards archiving in the public interest, exemptions are 
also  possible  to  the  notification  obligation  regarding  rectification  or  erasure  of 
personal data or restriction of processing and to the right to data portability.  

(72)  According  to  paragraphs  27(1)  and  28(1)  of  Schedule  2  to  the  DPA  2018,  the 
exemptions  to  the  listed  provisions  of  the  UK  GDPR  are  possible  where  the 
application of the provisions would “prevent or seriously impair the achievement” of 
the purposes in question69.  

(73)  Given  their  relevance  for  an  effective  exercise  of  individual  rights,  any  relevant 
development  regarding  the  interpretation  and  application  in  practice  of  the  above-
mentioned exemptions (in addition to the one relating to the maintenance of effective 
immigration control, as explained in recital (6)), including any further development of 
the  case  law  and  of  ICO  guidance  and  enforcement  actions,  will  be  duly  taken  into 
account in the context of the continuous monitoring of this Decision70.

Pursuant  to  the  guidance,  organisations  must  be  able  to  explain  why  complying  with  the  relevant 
provision of the Data Protection Act 1998 is incompatible with the purposes of journalism. In particular, 
controllers  must  balance  the  detrimental  effect  compliance  would  have  on  journalism  against  the 
detrimental  effect  non-compliance  would  have  on  the  rights  of  the  data  subject.  If  a  journalist  can 
reasonably achieve their editorial aims in a way that complies with the standard provisions of the DPA, 
they must. Organisations must be able to justify their use of the restriction in respect of every provision 
they have not complied with. “Data protection and journalism: a guide for the media”, available at the

further transfer of such data to recipients in a third country. Such “onward transfers”, 
which from  the perspective of the United Kingdom  controller or processor constitute 
international transfers from the United Kingdom, should be permitted only where the 
further  recipient  outside  the  United  Kingdom  is  itself  subject  to  rules  ensuring  a 
similar level of protection to that guaranteed within the United Kingdom legal order. 
For  this  reason,  the  application  of  the  rules  of  the  UK  GDPR  and  the  DPA  2018  on 
international transfers of personal data is an important factor to ensure the continuity 
of protection in the case of personal data transferred from the European Union to  the 
United Kingdom under this Decision. 

(75)  The regime on international transfers of personal data from the United Kingdom is set 
out  in  Articles  44-49  of  the  UK  GDPR,  supplemented  by  the  DPA  2018,  and  is  in 
substance  identical  to  the  rules  set  out  in  Chapter  V  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/67971. 
Transfers of personal data to a third country or international organisation can only take 
place on the basis of adequacy regulations (the UK equivalent to an adequacy decision 
under  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679),  or  in  the  absence  of  adequacy  regulations,  where 
the  controller  or  processor  has  provided  appropriate  safeguards  in  accordance  with 
Article  46  of  the  UK  GDPR.  In  the  absence  of  adequacy  regulations  or  appropriate 
safeguards, a transfer can only take place based on derogations set out in Article 49 of 
the UK GDPR. 

(76)  The  adequacy  regulations  made  by  the  Secretary  of  State  can  stipulate  that  a  third 
country (or a territory or a sector within a third country), an international organisation, 
or  a  description72  of  such  a  country,  territory,  sector,  or  organisation  ensures  an 
adequate  level  of  protection  of  personal  data.  When  assessing  the  adequacy  of  the 
level  of  protection,  the  Secretary  of  State  must  take  into  account  the  exact  same 
elements  that  the  Commission  is  required  to  assess  under  Article  45(2)(a)-(c)  of 

                                                 
71 

With the exception of Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that the United Kingdom has chosen not 
to  include  in  the  UK  GDPR.  In  that  respect,  it  should,  first  of  all,  be  recalled  that  the  standard  to  be 
considered as providing an adequate level of protection is a standard of “essential equivalence” rather 
than  identity,  as  clarified  by  the  CJEU  (Schrems  I,  paragraphs  73-74)  and  recognized  by  the  EDPB 
(Adequacy Referential, page 3). Therefore, as explained by the EDPB in its Adequacy Referential, “the 
objective  is  not  to  mirror  point  by  point  the  European  legislation,  but  to  establish  the  essential  –  core 
requirements of that legislation”. In this respect, it is important to  note that,  while  the UK legal order 
does  not  formally  contain  an  identical  provision  to  Article  48,  the  same  effect  is  guaranteed  by  other 
legal  provisions  and  principles,  i.e.  that  in  response  to  a  request  for  personal  data  by  a  court  or 
administrative authority in a third country, personal data can only be transferred to that third country if 
there is an international agreement in place – on the basis of which the third country’s court judgment or 
administrative decision in question is recognized or enforced in the United Kingdom – or if it is based 
on one of the transfer mechanisms provided by Chapter V of the UK GDPR. More specifically, in order 
to enforce a foreign judgment, courts in the UK need to be able to point to common law or to a statute 
that allows its enforceability. However, neither common law (see Adams and Others v Cape Industries 
Plc., [1990] 2 W.L.R. 657) nor statutes provide for the enforcement of foreign judgments requiring the 
transfer  of  data  without  an  international  agreement  in  place.  As  a  consequence,  requests  for  data  are 
unenforceable  under  United  Kingdom  law,  absent  such  an  international  agreement.  Furthermore,  any 
transfer  of  personal  data  to  third  countries  –  including  upon  request  from  a  foreign  court  or 
administrative  authority  –  remains  subject  to  the  restrictions  set  out  in  Chapter  V  of  the  UK  GDPR 
which are identical to the corresponding provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and therefore require 
to  rely  on  one  of  the  grounds  for  transfer  available  under  Chapter  V  in  accordance  with  the  specific 
conditions to which it is subject under that Chapter. 
The UK authorities have explained that the description of a country or international organisation refers 
to a situation where it would be necessary to do a specific and partial determination of adequacy with 
focused  restrictions  (for  example  adequacy  regulations  in  relation  to  only  certain  types  of  data 
transfers).

Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  interpreted  together  with  recital  104  of  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679 and the retained EU case law. This means that, when assessing the adequate 
level of protection of a third country, the relevant standard will be whether that third 
country  in  question  ensures  a  level  of  protection  “essentially  equivalent”  to  that 
guaranteed within the United Kingdom.  

(77)  As  for  the  procedure,  adequacy  regulations  are  subject  to  the  “general”  procedural 
requirements provided for in Section 182 of the DPA 2018. Under this procedure, the 
Secretary  of  State  must  consult  the  Information  Commissioner  when  proposing  to 
adopt  UK  adequacy  regulations73.  Once  adopted  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  those 
regulations  are  laid  before  Parliament  and  subject  to  the  “negative  resolution” 
procedure  under  which  both  Houses  of  Parliament  can  scrutinise  the  regulations  and 
have the ability to pass a motion annulling the regulations within a 40 day period74

.  

(78)  According  to  Section  17B(1)  of  the  DPA  2018,  the  adequacy  regulations  must  be 
reviewed at intervals of not more than four years and the Secretary of State must, on 
an  ongoing  basis,  monitor  developments  in  third  countries  and  international 
organisations that could affect decisions to make adequacy regulations, or to amend or 
revoke such regulations. Where the Secretary of State becomes aware that a country or 
organisation  specified  no  longer  ensures  an  adequate  level  of  protection  of  personal 
data, he must, to the extent necessary, amend or revoke the regulations and enter into 
consultations with the third country or international organisation concerned to remedy 
the  lack  of  an  adequate  level  of  protection.  These  procedural  aspects  also  mirror  the 
corresponding requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

(79) 

In the absence of adequacy regulations, international transfers can take place where the 
controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards in accordance with Article 
46  of  the  UK  GDPR.  These  safeguards  are  similar  to  those  under  Article  46  of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. They include legally binding and enforceable instruments 
between  public  authorities  or  bodies,  binding  corporate  rules75,  standard  data 
protection  clauses,  approved  codes  of  conduct,  approved  certification  mechanisms, 
and  with  authorisation  from  the  Information  Commissioner,  contractual  clauses 
between  controllers  (or  processors)  or  administrative  arrangements  between  public 
authorities. However, the rules have been modified, from a procedural point of view, 
to  work  within  the  United  Kingdom  framework,  in  particular  the  standard  data 
protection  clauses  can  be  adopted  by  the  Secretary  of  State  (Section  17C)  or  the 
Information Commissioner (Section 119A) in accordance with the DPA 2018. 

(80) 

In absence of an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards, a transfer can only take 
place based on derogations set  out  in  Article 49  of the UK GDPR76. The UK GDPR

The  UK  GDPR  retains  the  rules  in  Article  47  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  subject  to  only 
modifications  to  fit  the  rules  into  domestic  context,  for  example  by  replacing  the  references  to 
competent  supervisory  authority  to  the  Information  Commissioner,  deleting  reference  to  consistency

Under Article 49 of the UK GDPR, transfers are possible if one of the following conditions is satisfied: 
(a) the data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the

introduces  no  material  changes  to  the  derogations,  compared  to  the  corresponding 
rules of Regulation  (EU) 2016/679.  Under the UK GDPR, as under Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679,  certain  derogations  can  only  be  relied  on  if  the  transfer  is  occasional77. 
Moreover,  the  ICO  in  its  guidance  on  international  transfers,  clarifies  that:  “You 
should  only  use  these  as  true  ‘exceptions’  from  the  general  rule  that  you  should  not 
make  a  restricted  transfer  unless  it  is  covered  by  an  adequacy  decision  or  there  are 
appropriate  safeguards  in  place”78.  With  respect  to  transfers  that  are  necessary  for 
important reasons of public interest (Article 49(1)(d)), the Secretary of State can make 
regulations  to  specify  circumstances  in  which  a  transfer  of  personal  data  to  a  third 
country  or international  organisation is  not  necessary for important  reasons of public 
interest. Furthermore, the Secretary of State can by regulations restrict the transfer of a 
category  of  personal  data  to  a  third  country  or  international  organisation  where  the 
transfer  cannot  take  place  based  on  adequacy  regulations,  and  the  Secretary  of  State 
considers  the  restriction  to  be  necessary  for  important  reasons  of  public  interest.  No 
such regulations have been adopted so far.  

(81)  This  framework  for  international  transfers  has  become  applicable  at  the  end  of  the 
transition period79. However, paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 to the DPA 2018 (introduced 
by the DPPEC Regulations) provide that as of the end of the transition period, certain 
transfers  of  personal  data  are  treated  as  if  they  are  based  on  adequacy  regulations. 
These  transfers  include  transfers  to  an  EEA  State,  the  territory  of  Gibraltar,  a  Union 
institution, body, office or agency set up by, or on the basis of the EU Treaty, and third 
countries  which  were  the  subject  of  an  EU  adequacy  decision  at  the  end  of  the 
transition period. Consequently, the transfers to these countries can continue as before 
the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. After the end of the transition period, 

                                                                                                                                                         
possible  risks  of  such  transfers  for  the  data  subject  due  to  the  absence  of  an  adequacy  decision  and 
appropriate safeguards; (b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data 
subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's 
request;  (c)  the  transfer  is  necessary  for  the  conclusion  or  performance  of  a  contract  concluded  in  the 
interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person; (d) the transfer is 
necessary  for  important  reasons  of  public  interest;  (e)  the  transfer  is  necessary  for  the  establishment, 
exercise or defence of legal claims; (f) the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of 
the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving 
consent; (g) the transfer is made from a register which according to domestic law is intended to provide 
information  to  the  public  and  which  is  open  to  consultation  either  by  the  public  in  general  or  by  any 
person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, but only to the extent that the conditions laid down by 
domestic law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case. Furthermore, where none of the above 
conditions are applicable, a transfer may take place only if it is not repetitive, concerns only a limited 
number of data subjects, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the 
controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the 
controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that 
assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. 
Recital 111 of the UK GDPR specifies that transfers in relation to a contract or a legal claim can only 
take place where they are occasional.

During a period of maximum six months ending at the latest on 30 June 2021, the applicability of this 
new  framework  must  be  read  in  the  light  of  Article  782  of  the  Trade  and  Cooperation  Agreement 
between  the  European  Union  and  the  European  Atomic  Energy  Community,  of  the  one  part,  and  the

the  Secretary  of  State  must  conduct  a  review  of  these  adequacy  findings  during  a 
period of four years, i.e. by the end of December 2024. According to the explanation 
provided by the United Kingdom authorities, although the Secretary of State needs to 
undertake such a review by the end of December 2024, the transitional provisions do 
not  include  a  “sunset”  provision  and  the  relevant  transitional  provisions  will  not 
automatically cease to have effect if a review is not completed by the end of December 
2024. 

(82)  Finally, as regards the future evolution of the United Kingdom’s international transfers 
regime  –  through  the  adoption  of  new  adequacy  regulations,  the  conclusion  of 
international  agreements  or  the  development  of  other  transfer  mechanisms  –  the 
Commission  will  closely  monitor  the  situation,  assess  whether  the  different  transfer 
mechanisms  are  used  in  a  way  that  ensures  the  continuity  of  protection,  and,  if 
necessary,  take  appropriate  measures  to  address  possible  adverse  effects  for  such 
continuity  (see  recitals  (278)  to  (287)).  As  the  EU  and  the  United  Kingdom  share 
similar  rules  on  international  transfers,  it  is  expected  that  problematic  divergence 
could  also  be  avoided  through  cooperation,  exchange  of  information  and  sharing  of 
experience, including between the ICO and the EDPB. 

2.5.8   Accountability  

(83)  Under the accountability principle, entities processing data are required to put in place 
appropriate technical and organisational measures to effectively comply with their data 
protection obligations and be able to demonstrate such compliance, in particular to the 
competent supervisory authority.  

(84)  The  principle  of  accountability  provided  for  in  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  has  been 
retained in Article 5(2) of the UK GDPR without material change and the same applies 
to  Article  24  on  the  responsibility  of  the  controller,  Article  25  on  data  protection  by 
design  and  by  default  and  Article  30  on  records  of  processing  activities.  Articles  35 
and  36  on  data  protection  impact  assessment  and  prior  consultation  of  supervisory 
authority have also been retained. Articles 37-39 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the 
designation and the tasks of the data protection officers have been retained in the UK 
GDPR with no material changes. Furthermore, the provisions of Articles 40 and 42 of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on codes of conduct and certification have been retained in 
the UK GDPR80. 

2.6   Oversight and enforcement 

2.6.1   Independent Oversight 

(85) 

In order to ensure that an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed in practice, an 
independent  supervisory  authority  tasked  with  powers  to  monitor  and  enforce 
compliance with the data protection rules should be in place. This authority should act 
with  complete  independence  and  impartiality  in  performing  its  duties  and  exercising 
its powers. 

(86) 

In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  oversight  and  enforcement  of  compliance  with  the  UK 
GDPR  and  the  DPA  2018  is  carried  out  by  the  Information  Commissioner.  The 
Information Commissioner is a “Corporation Sole”: a separate legal entity constituted 

                                                 
80

 

Where necessary, these references are replaced with references to the United Kingdom authorities. For 
example,  under  Section  17  of  the  DPA  2018,  the  Information  Commissioner  or  United  Kingdom 
national accreditation body can accredit a person meeting the requirements set out in Article 43 of the 
UK GDPR to monitor compliance with a certification.

in  a  single  person.  The  Information  Commissioner  is  supported  in  her  work  by  an 
office. On 31 March 2020 the Information Commissioner’s Office had 768 permanent 
staff81.  The  sponsor-department  of  the  Information  Commissioner  is  the  Department 
for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport82. 

(87)  The  independence  of  the  Commissioner  is  explicitly  established  in  Article  52  of  the 
UK GDPR which does not make any substantive changes to Article 52(1)-(3) GDPR. 
The Commissioner must act with complete independence in performing her tasks and 
exercising  her  powers  in  accordance  with  the  UK  GDPR,  remain  free  from  external 
influence, whether direct or indirect, in relation to those tasks and powers, and neither 
seek nor take instructions from anyone. The Commissioner must also refrain from any 
action incompatible with her duties and shall not, while holding office, engage in any 
incompatible occupation, whether gainful or not.  

(88)  The conditions for the appointment and removal of the Information Commissioner are 
set out in Schedule 12 to the DPA 2018. The Information Commissioner is appointed 
by  Her  Majesty  on  a  recommendation  from  Government  pursuant  to  a  fair  and  open 
competition.  The  candidate  must  have  the  appropriate  qualifications,  skills  and 
competence.  In  accordance  with  the  Governance  Code  on  Public  Appointments83,  a 
list  of  appointable  candidates  is  made  by  an  advisory  assessment  panel.  Before  the 
Secretary of State at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport finalises his 
or  her  decision,  the  relevant  Select  Committee  of  Parliament  must  carry  out  a  pre-
appointment scrutiny. The position of the Committee is made public84.  

(89)  The Information Commissioner holds office for a term of up to seven years. A person 
cannot  be  appointed  as  the  Information  Commissioner  more  than  once.  The 
Information Commissioner can be removed from office by Her Majesty following an 
Address by both Houses of Parliament85. No request for dismissal of the Information 
Commissioner  can  be  presented  to  either  House  of  Parliament  unless  a  Minister  has 
presented a report stating that he or she is satisfied that the Information Commissioner 
is  guilty  of  serious  misconduct  and/or  the  Commissioner  no  longer  fulfils  the 
conditions required for the performance of the Commissioner’s functions86.

(90)  The  funding  of  the  Information  Commissioner  comes  from  three  sources:  (i)  data 
protection  charges  paid  by  controllers,  which  are  set  by  Secretary  of  State’s 
regulations87  (the  Data  Protection  (Charges  and  Information)  Regulations  2018),  and 
amount  to  85%  -  90%  of  the  Office’s  annual  budget88;  (ii)  grant  in  aid  paid  by  the 
Government to the Information Commissioner. Grant in aid is mainly used to finance 
the  operating  costs  of  the  Information  Commissioner  as  regards  non-data  protection 
related  tasks89;  and  (iii)  fees  charged  for  services90.  At  present,  no  such  fees  are 
charged.  

(91)  The general functions of the Information Commissioner in relation to the processing of 
personal  data  that  the  UK  GDPR  applies  to,  are  laid  down  in  Article  57  of  the  UK 
GDPR,  mirroring  closely  the  corresponding  rules  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679.  Its 
functions  include  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  the  UK  GDPR,  promoting  public 
awareness, handling complaints lodged by the data subjects, conducting investigations 
etc.. In addition, Section 115 of the DPA 2018 sets out other general functions of the 
Commissioner, which include a duty to  advise Parliament,  the  government  and other 
institutions  and  bodies  on  legislative  and  administrative  measures  relating  to  the 
protection  of  individuals’  rights  and  freedoms  with  regard  to  the  processing  of 
personal  data,  and  a  power  to  issue,  on  the  Commissioner’s  own  initiative  or  on 
request,  opinions  to  Parliament,  the  government  or  other  institutions  and  bodies  as 
well  as  to  the  public  on  any  issue  related  to  the  protection  of  personal  data.  To 
maintain  the  independence  of  the  judiciary,  the  Information  Commissioner  is  not 
authorised to exercise her functions in relation to the processing of personal data by an 
individual  acting  in  a  judicial  capacity,  or  a  court  or  tribunal  acting  in  its  judicial 
capacity.  However,  oversight  on  the  judiciary  is  ensured  by  specialised  bodies  (see 
recitals (99) to (103). 

2.6.2   Enforcement, including sanctions 

(92)  The  powers  of  the  Information  Commissioner  are  set  out  in  Article  58  of  the  UK 
GDPR,  which  introduces  no  material  changes  to  the  corresponding  article  of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The DPA 2018 sets out supplementary rules on how these 
powers can be exercised. In particular, the Commissioner has powers to: (a) order the 
controller and the processor (and in certain circumstances any other person) to provide

Section 137 of the DPA 2018, see recital (17).

Section 137 and 138 of the DPA 2018 contain a number of safeguards to ensure the charges are set at an 
appropriate level. In particular Section 137(4) lists the matters which the Secretary of State must have 
regard  to  when  making  regulations  which  specify  the  amount  different  organisations  must  pay; 
Secondly,  Section  138(1)  and  Section  182  of  the  DPA  2018  also  contain  a  legal  requirement  for  the 
Secretary  of  State  to  consult  with  the  Information  Commissioner  and  other  representatives  of  persons 
likely  to  be  affected  by  the  regulations,  before  they  are  made  so  that  their  views  can  be  taken  into 
account. In addition, under Section 138(2) of the DPA 2018, the Information Commissioner is required 
to  keep  the  working  of  the  Charges  Regulations  under  review  and  may  submit  proposals  to  the 
Secretary of State for amendments to be made to the Regulations. Finally, except where regulations are 
made simply to take into account an increase in the retail price index (in which case they will be subject 
to the negative resolution procedure), the regulations are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure 
and may not be made until they have been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.  
The management agreement clarified that “The Secretary of State may make payments to the IC out of 
money provided by Parliament under Paragraph 9 of Schedule 12 to the DPA 2018. After consultation

carry out investigations and audits by giving an assessment notice, which may require 
the  controller  or  processor  to  permit  the  Commissioner  to  enter  specified  premises, 
inspect  or  examine  documents  or  equipment,  interview  people  processing  personal 
data  on  behalf  of  the  controller  etc.  (“assessment  notice”)92;  (c)  obtain  otherwise 
access to documents etc. of controllers and processors and access to their premises in 
accordance with Section 154 of the DPA 2018 (“powers of entry and inspection”); (d) 
exercise  corrective  powers  including  by  means  of  warnings  and  reprimands  or  give 
orders  by  means  of  an  enforcement  notice,  which  requires  controllers/processors  to 
take  or  refrain  from  taking  specified  steps,  including  ordering  the  controller  or 
processor  to  do  anything  specified  in  Article  58(2)(c)-(g)  and  (j)  of  the  UK  GDPR 
(“enforcement  notice”)93;  (e)  and  issue  administrative  fines  in  the  form  of  a  penalty 
notice (“penalty notice”)94. The latter can be issued also in case a public authority has 
failed to comply with the provisions of the UK GDPR95. 

(93)  The  ICO’s  Regulatory  Action  Policy  sets  out  the  circumstances  under  which  it  will 
issue  an  information,  assessment,  enforcement  or  penalty  notice96.  An  enforcement 
notice  given  in  response  to  a  failure  by  a  controller  or  processor  may  only  impose 
requirements  which  the  Commissioner  considers  appropriate  for  the  purpose  of 
remedying the failure. Enforcement and penalty notices may be issued to  a controller 
or  processor  in  relation  to  violations  of  Chapter  II  of  the  UK  GDPR  (principles  of 
processing), Articles 12 -22 (rights of the data subject), Articles 25-39 (obligations of 
controllers  and  processors)  and  Articles  44-49  (international  transfers)  of  the  UK 
GDPR.  An  enforcement  notice  may  also  be  given  where  a  controller  has  failed  to 
comply with the requirement to pay a charge in regulations made under Section 137 of 
the  DPA  2018.  In  addition,  a  monitoring  body  under  Article  41  or  a  certification 
provider  can  be  given  an  enforcement  notice  if  they  fail  to  comply  with  their 
obligations under the UK GDPR. A penalty notice can be also given to a person who 
has not complied with an information notice, an assessment notice or an enforcement 
notice.  

(94)  The  penalty  notice  requires  the  person  to  pay  to  the  Information  Commissioner  an 
amount  specified  in  the  notice.  In  determining  whether  to  give  a  penalty  notice  to  a 
person  and  determining  the  amount  of  the  penalty,  the  Information  Commissioner 
must have regard to the matters listed in Article 83(1) and (2) of the UK GDPR, which 
are identical to the corresponding rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/67997. Under Article

Commissioner can also impose fines as a percentage of worldwide annual turnover, if 
higher.  As  in  the  equivalent  provisions  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  these  amounts 
are  set  at  2%  and  4%  in  Articles  83(4)  and  (5)  respectively.  In  case  of  a  failure  to 
comply with an information notice, an assessment notice or an enforcement notice, the 
maximum amount of the penalty that may be imposed by a penalty notice is the higher 
of £17,500,000 or, in the case of an undertaking, 4% worldwide annual turnover. 

the 

(95)  The  UK  GDPR  together  with  the  DPA  2018  have  also  strengthened  other  powers  of 
the  Information  Commissioner.  For  example,  the  Commissioner  can  now  conduct 
compulsory  audits  in  relation  to  all  controllers  and  processors  through  the  use  of 
assessment  notices,  whereas  under  the  previous  legislation,  the  Data  Protection  Act 
1998,  the  Commissioner  only  had  this  power  in  respect  of  central  government  and 
health organisations, others having to agree to an audit.  

(96)  Since  the  introduction  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  ICO  handles  about  40,000 
complaints  from  data  subjects  per  year98  and,  in  addition,  carries  out  about  2,000  ex 
officio investigations99. A majority of complaints are related to the rights of access to 
and  disclosure  of  data.  Following  her  investigations,  the  Commissioner  is  taking 
enforcement measures across a broad range of sectors. More specifically, according to 
the 
the 
Commissioner  issued  54  information  notices,  8  assessment  notices,  7  enforcement 
notices, 4 cautions, 8 prosecutions and 15 fines during the reporting period101.

cooperation  with  the  Commissioner,  the  categories  of  personal  data  affected  by  the  failure,  any  other 
aggravating or  mitigating  factor applicable to the circumstances of  the case, such as financial benefits 
gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement 
According  to  the  information  provided  by  the  UK  authorities,  during  the  period  covered  by  the 
Information Commissioner’s Annual Report 2019-2020, no infringement was found in about 25% of the 
cases,  in  about  29%  of  the  cases  the  data  subject  was  asked  to  either  raise  the  concern  with  the  data 
controller for the first time, to wait for the controller’s reply or to continue an ongoing dialogue with the 
data controller, in about 17% of the cases,  no infringement  was found but advice  was provided  to the 
data  controller,  in  about  25%  of  the  cases  the  Information  Commissioner  found  an  infringement  and 
either provided advice to the data controller or the data controller was required to take certain actions, in 
about  3%  of  the  cases  it  was  determined  that  the  complaint  did  not  fall  under  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679, and about 1% of the cases were referred to another data protection authority in the framework 
of the European Data Protection Board. 
The  ICO  can  initiate  those  investigations  based  on  information  received  from  a  variety  of  sources, 
including personal data breach notifications, referrals from other United Kingdom public authorities or 
foreign data protection authorities, and complaints from individuals or civil society organisations. 
Information Commissioner’s Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019-2020 (see footnote 81). 
According to the previous annual report covering the period 2018-2019, the Information Commissioner 
issued  22  penalty  notices  under  the  DPA  1998  during  the  reporting  period,  with  fines  totalling 
£3,010,610, including two  fines of £500,000 (the  maximum permitted under the DPA 1998). In 2018, 
the  Information  Commissioner  notably  conducted  an  investigation  into  the  use  of  data  analytics  for 
political purposes following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The investigation resulted in a policy 
report,  a  set  of  recommendations,  a  £500,000  fine  against  Facebook  and  an  enforcement  notice  to 
Aggregate  IQ,  a  Canadian  data  broker,  ordering  the  company  to  delete  personal  data  it  held  about 
United  Kingdom  citizens  and  residents  (See  the  Information  Commissioner’s  Annual  Report  and 
Financial  Statement  2018-2019  available  at  the  following  link  https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-

(97)  This  includes  several  significant  monetary  penalties  imposed  under  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679 and the DPA 2018. In particular, the Information Commissioner in October 
2020 fined a British airline company £20 million for a data breach affecting more than 
400,000 customers. At the end of October 2020, an international hotel chain was fined 
£18.4  million  for  failing  to  keep  millions  of  customers’  personal  data  secure  and  in 
November 2020 a British service provider selling event tickets online was fined £1.25 
million for failing to protect customers' payment details102.  

(98) 

In addition to the enforcement powers of the Information Commissioner described in 
recital (92), certain violations of the data protection legislation constitute offences and 
may  therefore  be  subject  to  criminal  sanctions  (Section  196  of  the  DPA  2018).  This 
applies, for example, to knowingly or recklessly obtaining or disclosing personal data 
without  the  consent  of  the  controller,  procuring  the  disclosure  of  personal  data  to 
another person without the consent of the controller103, re-identifying information that 
is de-identified personal data without the consent of the controller responsible for de-
identifying the personal data104, intentionally obstructing the Commissioner’s power to 
exercise  her  powers  in  relation  to  the  inspection  of  personal  data  in  accordance  with 
international  obligations105,  making  false  statements  in  response  to  an  information 
notice,  or  destroying  information  in  connection  to  information  and  assessment 
notices106.  

2.6.3   Oversight over the judiciary 

(99)  Oversight  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  the  courts  and  judiciary  is  twofold. 
Where a judicial office holder or a court is not acting in a judicial capacity, oversight 
is  provided  by  the  ICO.  Where  the  controller  is  operating  in  a  judicial  capacity,  the 
ICO  cannot  exercise  its  oversight  functions107  and  the  oversight  is  carried  out  by 
special bodies. This reflects the approach taken in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Article 
55(3)).  

(100)  In particular, in the second scenario, for the courts of England and Wales and the First-
tier  and  Upper  Tribunals  of  England  and  Wales,  such  oversight  is  provided  by  the 
Judicial  Data  Protection  Panel108.  Additionally,  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  and  Senior

Sections 144 and 148 of the DPA 2018. 
Section 117 of the DPA 2018. 
The  Panel  is  responsible  for  providing  guidance  and  training  to  the  judiciary.  It  also  deals  with 
complaints  from  data  subjects  in  respect  of  the  processing  of  personal  data  by  courts,  tribunals  and 
individuals  acting  in  a  judicial  capacity.  The  Panel  aims  to  provide  the  means  through  which  any 
complaint  could  be  resolved.  If  a  complainant  was  unhappy  with  a  decision  of  the  Panel,  and  they 
provided  additional  evidence,  the  Panel  could  reconsider  its  decision.  While  the  Panel  itself  does  not 
impose financial sanctions, if the Panel considers that there is a sufficiently serious breach of the DPA 
2018,  it  may  refer  it  to  the  Judicial  Conduct  Investigation  Office  (JCIO),  which  will  investigate  the 
complaint. If the complaint is upheld, it is a matter for the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice (or a 
senior  judge  delegated  to  act  on  his  behalf)  to  decide  what  action  should  be  taken  against  the  office 
holder.  This  could  include,  in  order  of  severity:  formal  advice,  formal  warning,  and  reprimand  and, 
ultimately,  removal  from  office.  If  an  individual  is  dissatisfied  with  the  way  the  complaint  has  been

England and Wales process personal data for a judicial function. A similar notice has 
been issued by the Northern Irish110 and Scottish judiciaries111. 

(101)  Moreover,  in  Northern  Ireland,  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  of  Northern  Ireland  has 
appointed  a  High  Court  judge  as  Data  Supervisory  Judge  (DSJ)112.  They  have  also 
issued guidance to the Northern Irish Judiciary on what to do in the event of a loss or 
potential loss of data and the process for dealing with any issues arising from this113. 

(102)  In Scotland, the Lord President has appointed a Data Supervisory Judge to investigate 
any  complaints  on  grounds  of  data  protection.  This  is  set  out  under  the  judicial 
complaints rules which mirror those established for England and Wales114.  

(103)  Finally,  in  the  Supreme  Court,  one  of  the  Supreme  Court  Justices  is  nominated  to 

oversee data protection.  

2.6.4  Redress 

(104)  In order to ensure adequate protection and in particular the enforcement of individual 
rights,  the  data  subject  should  be  provided  with  effective  administrative  and  judicial 
redress, including compensation for damages. 

 

109

110 

(105)  First,  a  data  subject  has  the  right  to  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  Information 
Commissioner,  if  the  data  subject  considers  that,  in  connection  with  personal  data 
relating  to  him  or  her,  there  is  an  infringement  of  the  UK  GDPR115.  The  UK  GDPR 
retains  the  rules  in  Article  77  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  on  that  right  without 
material  modifications.  The  same  applies  to  Article  57(1)(f)  and  (2)  that  set  out  the 
tasks of the Commissioner in  relation to  the handling of  complaints. As described in 
recitals (92) to (98) above, the Information Commissioner has the power to assess the 
compliance of the controller and processor with the UK GDPR and DPA 2018, require 
                                                                                                                                                         
ombudsman).  The  Ombudsman  has  the  power  to  ask  the  JCIO  to  reinvestigate  a  complaint  and  can 
propose that the complainant be paid compensation where it believes that they have suffered damage as 
a result of maladministration.

for  further  investigation  in  accordance  with  the  Lord  Chief  Justice  in  Northern  Ireland’s  Code  of 
Practice  on  Complaints.  The  outcome  of  such  a  complaint  could  include:  no  further  action,  advice,

them to take or refrain from taking necessary steps in case of non-compliance and to 
impose fines.  

(106)  Second,  the  UK  GDPR  and  DPA  2018  provide  the  right  to  a  remedy  against  the 
Information Commissioner. Pursuant to Article 78(1) of the UK GDPR, an individual 
has  a  right  to  an  effective  judicial  remedy  against  a  legally  binding  decision  of  the 
Commissioner  concerning  them.  In  the  context  of  the  judicial  review,  the  judge 
examines  the  decision  being  challenged  in  the  claim,  and  considers  whether  the 
Information Commissioner has acted lawfully. Moreover, pursuant to Article 78(2) of 
the UK GDPR, if the Commissioner fails to appropriately handle a complaint made by 
the  data  subject,116  the  complainant  has  access  to  judicial  remedy.  It  can  apply  to  a 
First Tier Tribunal to order the Commissioner to take appropriate steps to respond to 
the  complaint,  or  to  inform  the  complainant  of  progress  on  the  complaint117.  In 
addition,  any  person  who  is  served  one  of  the  abovementioned  notices  (information, 
assessment, enforcement or penalty notice) by the Commissioner may appeal to a First 
Tier Tribunal118. If the Tribunal considers that the decision of the Commissioner is not 
in  accordance  with  the  law  or  the  Information  Commissioner  should  have  exercised 
her  discretion  differently,  the  Tribunal  must  allow  the  appeal,  or  substitute  another 
notice or decision which the Information Commissioner could have given or made.  

(107)  Third,  individuals  can  obtain  judicial  redress  against  controllers  and  processors 
directly  before  the  courts  under  Article  79  of  the  UK  GDPR  and  Section  167  of  the 
DPA  2018.  If,  on  an  application  by  a  data  subject,  a  court  is  satisfied  that  there  has 
been an infringement of the data subject's rights under the data protection legislation, 
the court may order the controller in respect of the processing, or a processor acting on 
behalf of that controller, to take steps specified in the order or to refrain  from taking 
steps specified in the order.  

(108)  Moreover, under Article 82 of the UK GDPR and Section 168 of the DPA 2018, any 
person  who  has  suffered  material  or  non-material  damage  as  a  result  of  an 
infringement  of  the  UK  GDPR  has  the  right  to  receive  compensation  from  the 
controller  or  processor  for  the  damage  suffered.  The  rules  on  the  compensation  and 
liability in Article 82(1)  – (5) of the  UK GDPR are identical  with  the corresponding 
rules in Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Under Section 168 of the DPA 2018, non-material 
damage includes also distress. Under Article 80 of the UK GDPR the data subject has 
also  a  right  to  mandate  a  representative  body  or  organisation  to  lodge  the  complaint 
with the Commissioner on his or her behalf (under Article 77 of the UK GDPR) and to 
exercise  the  rights  referred  to  in  Articles  78  (right  to  an  effective  judicial  remedy 
against  the  Commissioner),  79  (right  to  an  effective  judicial  remedy  against  a 
controller or processor) and 82 (right to compensation and liability) of the UK GDPR 
on his or her behalf. 

(109)  Fourth,  and  in  addition  to  the  avenues  for  redress  described  above,  any  person  that 
considers  that  his  or  her  rights,  including  rights  to  privacy  and  data  protection,  have 

                                                 
116

 

Section 166 of the DPA 2018 refers specifically to the following situations: (a) the Commissioner fails 
to  take  appropriate  steps  to  respond  to  the  complaint,  (b)  the  Commissioner  fails  to  provide  the 
complainant  with  information  about  progress  on  the  complaint,  or  of  the  outcome  of  the  complaint, 
before the end of the period of 3 months beginning when the Commissioner received the complaint, or 
(c)  if  the  Commissioner’s  consideration  of  the  complaint  is  not  concluded  during  that  period,  fails  to 
provide the complainant with such information during a subsequent period of 3 months.

been violated by public authorities, can obtain redress before the UK courts under the 
Human Rights Act 1998119. An individual who claims that a public authority has acted 
(or  proposes  to  act)  in  a  way  which  is  incompatible  with  a  Convention  right,  and 
consequently  unlawful  under  Section  6(1)  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  can  bring 
proceedings  against  the  authority  in  the  appropriate  court  or  tribunal,  or  rely  on  the 
rights concerned in any legal proceedings, when he or she is (or would be) a victim of 
the unlawful act.  

(110)  If the court finds any act of a public authority to be unlawful, it can grant such relief or 
remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate120. 
The court can also declare a provision of primary legislation to be incompatible with a 
Convention right. 

(111)  Finally, after exhausting national remedies, an individual can obtain redress before the 
European  Court  of  Human  Rights  for  violations  of  the  rights  guaranteed  under  the 
European Convention of Human Rights. 

ACCESS  AND  USE  OF  PERSONAL  DATA  TRANSFERRED  FROM  THE 

3. 
EUROPEAN UNION BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM 

(112)  The  Commission  also  assessed  the  United  Kingdom’s  legal  framework  for  the 
collection and subsequent use of personal data transferred to business operators in the 
United  Kingdom  by  United  Kingdom  public  authorities  in  the  public  interest,  in 
particular  for  criminal  law  enforcement  and  national  security  purposes  (hereinafter 
referred to as “government access”). In assessing whether the conditions under which 
government access to data transferred to the UK under this Decision would fulfil the 
“essential equivalence” test pursuant to Article 45(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as 
interpreted  by  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union  in  light  of  the  Charter  of 
Fundamental  Rights,  the  Commission  took  into  account  in  particular  the  following 
criteria. 

(113)  First, any limitation to the right to the protection of personal data must be provided for 
by law and the legal basis which permits the interference with such a right must itself 
define the scope of the limitation on the exercise of the right concerned121.  

(114)  Second,  in  order  to  satisfy  the  requirement  of  proportionality,  according  to  which 
derogations from and limitations to the protection of personal data must apply only in 
so  far  as  is  strictly  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  to  meet  specific  objectives  of 
general  interest  equivalent  to  those  recognized  by  the  Union,  the  legislation  of  the 
third  country  in  question  which  permits  the  interference  must  lay  down  clear  and 
precise  rules  governing  the  scope  and  application  of  the  measures  in  question  and 
impose minimum safeguards so that the persons whose data has been transferred have 
sufficient  guarantees  to  protect  effectively  their  personal  data  against  the  risk  of

Section  7(1)  of  the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.  According  to  Section  7(7)  a  person  is  a  victim  of  an 
unlawful act only if he would be a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the European Convention of 
Human  Rights if proceedings  were brought in the European Court of Human Rights in respect of that 
act.

abuse122. The legislation must, in particular, indicate in what circumstances and under 
which  conditions  a  measure  providing  for  the  processing  of  such  data  may  be 
adopted123  as  well  as  subject  the  fulfilment  of  such  requirements  to  independent 
oversight124. 

(115)  Third,  that  legislation  must  be  legally  binding  under  domestic  law  and  these  legal 
requirements must not only be binding on the authorities, but also enforceable before 
courts  against  the  authorities  of  the  third  country  in  question125.  In  particular,  data 
subjects must have the possibility of bringing legal action before an independent and 
impartial  court  in  order  to  have  access  to  their  personal  data,  or  to  obtain  the 
rectification or erasure of such data126. 

3.1  General legal framework 

(116)  As  an  exercise  of  power  by  a  public  authority,  government  access  in  the  United 
Kingdom  must  be  carried  out  in  full  respect  of  the  law.  The  United  Kingdom  has 
ratified  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights  (see  recital  (9))  and  all  public 
authorities  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  required  to  act  in  compliance  with  the 
Convention127. Article 8 of the Convention provides that any interference with privacy 
must  be  in  accordance  with  the  law,  in  the  interests  of  one  of  the  aims  set  out  in 
Article  8(2),  and  proportionate  in  light  of  that  aim.  Article  8  also  requires  that  the 
interference is “foreseeable”, i.e. have a clear, accessible basis in law, and that the law 
contains appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse.  

(117)  In  addition,  in  its  case  law,  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  has  specified  that 
any interference with the right to privacy and data protection should be subject to an 
effective, independent and impartial oversight system that must be provided for either 
by  a  judge  or  by  another  independent  body128  (e.g.  an  administrative  authority  or  a 
parliamentary body).  

(118)  Moreover,  individuals  must  be  provided  with  an effective  remedy,  and  the  European 
Court  of  Human  Rights  has  clarified  that  the  remedy  must  be  offered  by  an 
independent  and  impartial  body  which  has  adopted  its  own  rules  of  procedure, 
consisting  of  members  that  must  hold  or  have  held  high  judicial  office  or  be 
experienced  lawyers,  and  that  there  must  be  no  evidential  burden  to  be  overcome  in 
order to lodge an application with it. In undertaking its examination of complaints by 
individuals,  the  independent  and  impartial  body  should  have  access  to  all  relevant

See  Schrems  I,  paragraph  95  and  Schrems  II,  paragraph  194.  In  that  respect,  the  CJEU  has  notably 
stressed that compliance with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, guaranteeing the right to 
an effective remedy before an independent and impartial tribunal, “contributes to the  required level of 
protection  in  the  European  Union  [and]  must  be  determined  by  the  Commission  before  it  adopts  an 
adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679” (Schrems II, paragraph 186).

information, including closed materials. Finally, it should have the powers to remedy 
non-compliance129.  

(119)  The United Kingdom also ratified the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection 
of  Individuals  with  regard  to  Automatic  Processing  of  Personal  Data  (Convention 
108),  and  signed  the  Protocol  amending  the  Convention  for  the  Protection  of 
Individuals  with  regard  to  Automatic  Processing  of  Personal  Data  (known  as 
Convention  108+)  in  2018130.  Article  9  of  Convention  108  provides  that  derogations 
from  the  general  data  protection  principles  (Article  5  Quality  of  data),  the  rules 
governing  special  categories  of  data  (Article  6  Special  categories  of  data)  and  data 
subject rights (Article 8 Additional safeguards to the data subject) are only permissible 
when  such  derogation  is  provided  for  by  the  law  of  the  Party  and  constitutes  a 
necessary measure in a democratic society in the interests of protecting State security, 
public  safety,  the  monetary  interests  of  the  State  or  the  suppression  of  criminal 
offences, or for protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others131. 

(120)  Therefore, through membership of the Council of Europe, adherence to the European 
Convention of Human Rights and submission to the jurisdiction of the European Court 
of Human Rights, the United Kingdom is subject to a number of obligations, enshrined 
in  international  law,  that  frame  its  system  of  government  access  on  the  basis  of 
principles, safeguards and individual rights similar to those guaranteed under EU law 
and applicable to the Member States. As stressed in recital (19), continued adherence 
to such instruments is therefore a particularly important element of the assessment on 
which this Decision is based. 

(121)  Further, specific data protection safeguards and rights are guaranteed by the DPA 2018 
when  data  is  processed  by  public  authorities,  including  by  law  enforcement  and 
national security bodies.  

(122)  In particular, the regime for the processing of personal data in the context of criminal 
law enforcement is set out in Part 3 of the DPA 2018, which was enacted to transpose 
Directive (EU) 2016/680. Part 3 of the DPA 2018 applies to the processing of personal 
data  by  competent  authorities  for  the  purposes  of  the  prevention,  investigation, 
detection  or  prosecution  of  criminal  offences  or  the  execution  of  criminal  penalties, 
including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security132.  

(123)  The concept of “competent authority” is defined in Section 30 of the DPA as a person 
listed in Schedule 7 to the DPA 2018 as well as any other person to the extent that the 
person  has  statutory  functions  for  any  of  the  law  enforcement  purposes133.  As

(“Kennedy”), paragraphs 167 and 190. 
For more information on the European Convention of Human Rights and its incorporation into United 
Kingdom law through the Human Rights Act 1998 as well as on Convention 108, see recital (9). 
Similarly,  pursuant  to  Article  11  of  Convention  108+,  restrictions  to  certain  specific  rights  and 
obligations  of  the  Convention  for  purposes  of  national  security  or  the  prevention,  investigation  and 
prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties are only permissible when such 
a  restriction  is  provided  for  by  law,  respects  the  essence  of  the  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms,  and 
constitutes  a  necessary  and  proportionate  measure  in  a  democratic  society.  Processing  activities  for 
national  security  and  defence  purposes  must  also  be  subject  to  independent  and  effective  review  and 
supervision under the domestic legislation of the respective Party to the Convention 
Section 31 of the DPA 2018. 
Competent  authorities  listed  in  Schedule  7  include  not  only  police  forces,  but  also  all  UK  ministerial 
government  departments  as  well  as  other  authorities  with  investigatory  functions  (e.g.  the

explained  below  (see  recital  (139)),  certain  competent  authorities  (for  example  the 
National  Crime  Agency)  may  make  use,  under  certain  conditions,  of  the  powers 
provided by the Investigatory Power Act 2016 (IPA 2016). In this case, the safeguards 
provided  by  the  IPA  2016  will  apply  in  addition  to  those  provided  by  Part  3  of  the 
DPA 2018. The intelligence services (Secret Intelligence Service, Security Service and 
the  Government  Communications  Headquarters)  are  not  “competent  authorities”134 
falling under Part 3 of the DPA 2018 and, therefore, the rules provided therein do not 
apply to any of their activities. A specific Part of the DPA 2018 (Part 4) is dedicated to 
the  processing  of  personal  data  by  intelligence  services  (for  more  details  see  recital 
(125)). 

(124)  Similarly to Directive (EU) 2016/680, Part 3 of the DPA 2018 sets out the principles 
of lawfulness and fairness135, purpose limitation136, data minimisation137, accuracy138, 
storage  limitation139  and  security140.  The  legislation  imposes  specific  transparency 
obligations141  and  provides  individuals  with  a  right  of  access142,  rectification  and 
deletion143  and  the  right  not  to  be  subject  to  automated  decision-making144.  The 
competent  authorities  are  also  required  to  implement  data  protection  by  design  and 
default, to keep records of processing activities, and, for certain processing operations, 
to  carry  out  data  protection  impact  assessments  and  to  pre-consult  the  Information 
Commissioner145.  Pursuant  to  Section  56  of  the  DPA  2018,  they  are  required  to 
demonstrate  compliance.  Moreover,  they  are  required  to  put  in  place  appropriate 
measures to ensure security of processing146 and are subject to specific obligations in 
case  of  a  data  breach,  including  notification  of  such  breaches  to  the  Information 
Commissioner and data subjects147. As is the case in Directive (EU) 2016/680, there is 
also a requirement for a controller (unless it is a court or other judicial authority acting 
in a judicial capacity) to designate a data protection officer (DPO)148 which assists the 
controller in complying with its obligations as well as monitoring that compliance149. 
Furthermore,  the  legislation  imposes  specific  requirements  for  international  transfers 
of  personal  data  for  law  enforcement  purposes  to  third  countries  or  international 

                                                                                                                                                         
Commissioner  for  Her  Majesty’s  Revenue  and  Customs,  the  National  Crime  Agency,  the  Welsh 
Revenue  Authority,  the  Competition  and  Markets  Authority  or  Her  Majesty’s  Land  Register), 
prosecutorial agencies, other criminal justice agencies and other holders or organisations who carry out 
law  enforcement  activities  (among  those,  Schedule  7  of  the  DPA  2018  lists  the  Directors  of  Public 
Prosecutors, the Director of Public Prosecutors for Northern Ireland or the Information Commission).

organisations to ensure continuity of protection150. At the same date as this Decision, 
the  Commission  has  adopted  an  adequacy  decision  on  the  basis  of  Article  36(3)  of 
Directive  (EU)  2016/680,  finding  that  the  data  protection  regime  applicable  to 
processing by United Kingdom criminal law enforcement authorities ensures a level of 
protection essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by Directive (EU) 2016/680. 

(125)  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018  applies  to  all  processing  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  intelligence 
services.  In  particular,  it  sets  out  the  main  data  protection  principles  (lawfulness, 
fairness  and  transparency151;  purpose  limitation152;  data  minimisation153;  accuracy154; 
storage limitation155 and security156), imposes conditions on the processing of special 
categories  of  data157,  provides  for  data  subject  rights158,  requires  data  protection  by 
design159  and  regulates  international  transfers  of  personal  data160.  The  ICO  has 
recently issued detailed guidance on the processing by intelligence agencies under Part 
4 of the DPA 2018161.

Under  Section  86(6)  of  the  DPA  2018,  to  determine  fairness  and  transparency  of  the  processing,  the 
method  by  which  it  is  obtained  must  be  regarded.  In  this  sense,  the  fairness  and  transparency 
requirement is accomplished if data is obtained from a person who is lawfully authorised or required to 
supply it. 
Under  Section  87  of  the  DPA  2018,  the  purposes  of  the  processing  must  be  specified,  explicit  and 
legitimate. The data must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes for which 
it is collected. Under Section 87(3) of the DPA 2018, further compatible processing of personal data can 
be  only  allowed  if  the  controller  is  authorised  by  law  to  process  the  data  for  that  purpose  and  the 
processing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose. The processing should be regarded as 
compatible,  if  the  processing  consists  of  processing  for  archiving  purposes  in  the  public  interest,  for 
purposes  of  scientific  or  historical  research  or  for  statistical  purposes,  and  is  subject  to  appropriate 
safeguards (Section 87(4) of the DPA 2018). 
Personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive (Section 88 of the DPA 2018). 

Personal data must be accurate and up to date (Section 89 of the DPA 2018). 

Personal data must not be kept longer than is necessary (Section 90 of the DPA 2018). 

The  sixth  data  protection  principle  is  that  personal  data  must  be  processed  in  a  manner  that  includes 
taking appropriate security measures as regards risks that arise from processing personal data. The risks 
include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  accidental  or  unauthorised  access  to,  or  destruction,  loss,  use, 
modification  or  disclosure  of,  personal  data  (Section  91  of  the  DPA  2018).  Section  107  also  requires 
that  (1)  each  controller  must  implement  appropriate  security  measures  appropriate  to  the  risks  arising 
from  the  processing  of  personal  data  and  (2)  in  the  case  of  automated  processing,  each  controller  and 
each processor implement preventative or mitigative measures based on an evaluation of risk.  
Section 86(2)(b) and Schedule 10 to the DPA 2018. 

Chapter  3  of  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018,  notably  the  rights:  of  access,  of  rectification  and  deletion,  to 
object to the processing and not to be subject to automated decision making, to intervene in automated 
decision-making and to be informed about the decision-making. Moreover, the controller must give the 
data subject information about the processing of their personal data. As explained in the ICO guidance 
on the processing by intelligence services, individuals can exercise all their rights (including a request 
for  rectification)  by  making  a  complaint  to  the  ICO  or  taking  matters  to  court  (see  ICO  Guidance  to 
intelligence

(126)  At  the  same  time,  Section  110  of  the  DPA  2018  provides  for  an  exemption  from 
specified provisions in Part 4 of the DPA 2018162 when such exemption is required to 
safeguard national security. This exemption can be relied upon on the basis of a case-
by-case analysis163. As explained by the United Kingdom authorities and confirmed by 
the case law, a “controller must consider the actual consequences to national security 
or defence if they had to  comply  with  the particular data protection provision,  and if 
they could reasonably comply with the usual rule without affecting national security or 
defence”164.  Whether  or  not  the  exemption  has  been  used  appropriately  is  subject  to 
the oversight of the ICO165. 

(127)  Moreover,  in  relation  to  the  possibility  to  restrict  for  the  protection  of  “national 
security” the application of the above specified provisions, according to Section 111 of 
the DPA 2018, a controller may apply for a certificate signed by a Cabinet Minister or 
the  Attorney  General  certifying  that  a  restriction  of  such  rights  is  a  necessary  and 
proportionate measure to the protection of national security166.  

(128)  The  United  Kingdom  government  has  issued  guidance  to  assist  controllers  when 
considering  whether  to  apply  for  a  national  security  certificate  under  the  DPA  2018 
that  notably  highlights  that  any  limitation  to  data  subjects’  rights  for  safeguarding 
national  security  must  be  proportionate  and  necessary167.  All  national  security 
certificates must be published on the ICO’s website168.

Section 110(2) of the DPA 2018 lists the provisions from which an exemption is allowed. It includes the 
data protection principles (except the principle of lawfulness), the data subject rights, the obligation to 
inform the Information Commissioner about a data breach, the Information Commissioner’s powers of 
inspection  in  accordance  with  international  obligations,  certain  of  the  Information  Commissioner’s 
enforcement powers, the provisions that make certain data protection violations a criminal offence, and 
the  provisions  relating  to  special  purposes  of  processing,  such  as  journalistic,  academic  or  artistic 
purposes. 
See Baker v Secretary of State, see footnote 61. 

The  UK  Explanatory  Framework  for  Adequacy  Discussions,  section  H:  National  Security  Data 
Protection  and  Investigatory  Powers  Framework,  pages  15-16  (see  footnote  31).  See  also  Baker  v 
Secretary of State (see footnote 61), in which the court quashed a national security certificate issued by 
the Home Secretary and confirming the application of the national security exception, considering that 
there was no reason to provide for a blanket exception on the obligation to answer access requests and 
that  allowing  such  exception  in  all  circumstances  without  a  case-by-case  analysis  exceeded  what  was 
necessary and proportionate for the protection of national security. 
See MoU between ICO and UKIC according to which “Upon the ICO receiving a complaint from a data 
subject, the ICO  will  want to satisfy themselves that the issue  has been  handled correctly, and,  where 
applicable,  that  the  application  of  any  exemption  has  been  used  appropriately”.  Memorandum  of 
Understandings  between  Information  Commission’s  Office  and  the  UK  Intelligence  Community, 
paragraph  16,  available  at  the  following  link:  https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/mou/2617438/uk-
intelligence-community-ico-mou.pdf 
The  DPA  2018  has  repealed  the  possibility  to  issue  certificates  under  Section  28(2)  of  the  Data 
Protection  Act  1998.  However,  the  possibility  to  issue  “old  certificates”  still  exists  to  the  extent  that 
there is an historic challenge under the 1998 Act (see paragraph 17 of Part 5 of Schedule 20 of the DPA 
2018).  However,  this  possibility  seems  very  rare  and  will  apply  only  in  limited  cases,  such  as,  for 
example,  where  a  data  subject  brings  a  challenge  on  the  use  of  the  national  security  exemption  in 
relation to a processing by a public authority that has carried out its processing under the 1998 Act. It is 
to be noted that in these cases, Section 28 of the DPA 1998 will apply in its entirety, including therefore 
the possibility for the data subject to challenge the certificate before the Court.

(129)  The  certificate  should  be  for  a  fixed  duration  of  no  more  than  five  years,  so  to  be 
regularly reviewed by the Executive169. A certificate shall identify the personal data or 
categories of personal data subject to the exemption as well the provisions of the DPA 
2018 to which the exemption applies170.  

(130)  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  national  security  certificates  do  not  provide  for  an 
additional ground for restricting data protection rights for national security reasons. In 
other  words,  the  controller  or  processor  can  only  rely  on  a  certificate  when  it  has 
concluded  it  is  necessary  to  rely  on  the  national  security  exemption  which,  as 
explained  above,  must  be  applied  on  a  case-by-case  basis171.  Even  if  a  national 
security certificate applies to the matter in question, the ICO can investigate whether 
or not reliance on the national security exemption was justified in a specific case172. 

(131)  Any person directly affected by the issuing of the certificate may appeal to the Upper 
Tribunal173 against the certificate174 or, where the certificate identifies data by means 
of a general description, challenge the application of the certificate to specific data175. 
The  tribunal  will  review  the  decision  to  issue  a  certificate  and  decide  whether  there 
were reasonable grounds for issuing the certificate176. It can consider a wide range of 
issues, including necessity, proportionality and lawfulness, having regard to the impact 
on the rights of data subjects and balancing the need to safeguard national security. As 
a  result,  the  tribunal  may  determine  that  the  certificate  does  not  apply  to  specific 
personal data which is the subject of the appeal177.  

                                                                                                                                                         
explanation  provided  by  the  UK  authorities,  while  a  certificate  is  conclusive  proof  that,  in  respect  to 
data  or  processing  described  in  the  certificate,  the  exemption  is  applicable,  it  does  not  remove  the 
requirement for the controller to consider whether there is a need to rely on the exemption on a case-by-
case basis. 
According to section 130 of the DPA 2018,  the ICO  may  decide not to publish the text or part of the 
text of the certificate, if it would be against the interest of national security or would be contrary to the 
public interest or might jeopardise the safety of any person. In this cases the ICO will however publish 
the fact that the certificate has been issued.

Section  102  of  the  DPA  2018  requires  the  controller  to  be  in  a  position  to  demonstrate  that  it  has 
complied with the DPA 2018. This implies that an intelligence service would need to demonstrate to the 
ICO that when relying on the exemption, it has considered the specific circumstances of the case. The 
ICO also publishes a record of the national security certificates, which is available at the following link:

protection of national security.

(132)  A  different  set  of  possible  restrictions  concern  those  applying,  under  Schedule  11  of 
the DPA 2018, to certain provisions of Part 4 of the DPA 2018178 to safeguard other 
important  objectives  of  general  public  interest  or  protected  interests  such  as,  for 
example, parliamentary  privilege, legal professional privilege, the conduct of judicial 
proceedings  or  the  combat  effectiveness  of  the  armed  forces179.  The  application  of 
these  provisions  is  either  exempted  for  certain  categories  of  information  (“class 
based”),  or  exempted  to  the  extent  that  the  application  of  these  provisions  would  be 
likely  to  prejudice  the  protected  interest  (“prejudice  based”)180.  Prejudice-based 
exemptions can only be invoked as far as the application of the listed data protection 
provision would be likely to prejudice the specific interest in question. The use of an 
exemption must therefore always be justified by referring to the relevant prejudice that 
would  be  likely  to  occur  in  the  individual  case.  Class-based  exemptions  can  be 
invoked only with respect to the specific, narrowly defined category of information for 
which the exemption is granted. These are similar in purpose and effect  to several of 
the exceptions to the UK GDPR (under Schedule 2 of the DPA 2018) which, in turn, 
reflect those provided in Article 23 GDPR. 

(133)  It  follows  from  the  above  that  limitations  and  conditions  are  in  place  under  the 
applicable UK legal  provisions, as also  interpreted by the courts and the  Information 
Commission,  to  ensure  that  these  exemptions  and  restrictions  remain  within  the 
boundaries of what is necessary and proportionate to protect national security. 

Access  and  use  by  United  Kingdom  public  authorities  for  criminal  law 

3.2 
enforcement purposes 

(134)  The law of the United Kingdom imposes a number of limitations on the access and use 
of  personal  data  for  criminal  law  enforcement  purposes,  and  provides  oversight  and 
redress mechanisms in this area which are in line with the requirements referred to in 
recitals (113) to (115) of the present decision. The conditions under which such access

This  includes:  (i)  the  Part  4  data  protection  principles,  except  for  the  lawfulness  of  processing 
requirement  under  the  first  principle  and  the  fact  that  the  processing  must  meet  one  of  the  relevant 
conditions set out in Schedules 9 and 10; (ii) the rights of data subjects; and (iii) the duties relating to 
reporting breaches to the ICO. 
Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018  provides  for  the  legal  framework  that  applies  to  all  types  of  processing  of 
personal data carried out by intelligence agencies (and not only to the exercise of their national security 
tasks). Therefore, Part 4 applies also when intelligence agencies process data for example for purposes 
of  human  resources  management,  in  the  context  of  litigation  or  in  the  context  of  public  procurement. 
The restrictions listed in Schedule 11 are mainly meant to apply in these other contexts. For example, in 
the  context  of  litigation  with  an  employee,  the  restriction  for  purposes  of  “legal  proceedings”  may  be 
invoked,  or  in  the  context  of  public  procurement,  the  restriction  for  “negotiation”  purposes  may  be 
invoked, etc. This is reflected in the ICO guidance on intelligence services processing, which mentions 
the negotiation of a settlement between an intelligence agency and a former employee who is pursuing 
an employment claim as an example for the application of Schedule 11 restrictions (see footnote 161). It 
should  also  be  noted  that  the  same  restrictions  are  available  to  other  public  authorities  pursuant  to 
Schedule 2 to Part 2 of the DPA 2018.  
According to the UK Explanatory Framework the exceptions that are “class based” are: (i) information 
about the conferring of Crown honours and dignities; (ii) legal professional privilege; (iii) confidential 
employment, training or education references; and (iv) exam scripts and marks. The “prejudice based” 
exceptions  concern  the  following  matters:  (i)  prevention  or  detection  of  crime;  apprehension  and 
prosecution  of  offenders;  (ii)  parliamentary  privilege;  (iii)  judicial  proceedings;  (iv)  the  combat 
effectiveness  of  the  armed  forces  of  the  Crown;  (v)  the  economic  well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom; 
(vi) negotiations with the data subject; (vii) scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes; (viii) 
archiving in the public interest. The UK Explanatory Framework for Adequacy Discussions, section H: 
National Security, page 13, see footnote 31.

can take place and the safeguards applicable to the use of these powers are assessed in 
detail in the following sections. 

3.2.1  Legal bases and applicable limitations/safeguards 

(135)  Pursuant to the principle of lawfulness guaranteed under Section 35 of the DPA 2018, 
the processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is lawful only 
if it is based on law and either the data subject has given consent to the processing for 
that purpose181 or the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out 
for that purpose by a competent authority.  

3.2.1.1 Search warrants and production orders 

(136)  In the United Kingdom legal framework, the collection of personal data from business 
operators,  including  those  that  would  be  processing  data  transferred  from  the  EU 
under  the  present  adequacy  decision,  for  purposes  of  criminal  law  enforcement  is 
permissible on the basis of search warrants182 and production orders183.  

(137)  Search warrants  are issued by a  court, usually on the application of the investigating 
officer. They permit an officer to  enter premises  to search for material or individuals 
relevant  to  their  investigation  and  retain  anything  for  which  a  search  has  been 
authorised, including any  relevant  documents or material  containing personal  data184. 
A  production  order,  which  also  needs  to  be  issued  by  a  court,  requires  the  person 
specified in  it to  produce or give access  to  material  they  are in  possession or control 
of.  The  applicant  must  justify  to  the  court  why  the  warrant  or  order  is  necessary,  as 
well as why it is in the public interest. There are several statutory powers that permit 
the issuance of search warrants and production orders. Each provision has its own set

The use of consent does not appear relevant in an adequacy scenario as in a transfer situation the data 
will  not  have been directly collected from an EU data  subject by a United Kingdom law  enforcement 
authority on the basis of consent. 
For the relevant legal basis, See Sections 8 et seq. of PACE 1984 (for England and Wales), Sections 10 
et  seq,  of  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Order  (Northern  Ireland)  1989  and  for  Scotland  it  is 
obtained under common law (see Section 46 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016) and Section 
23B  of  the  Criminal  Law  (Consolidation)  (Scotland).  For  a  search  warrant  issued  after  the  arrest  the 
legal basis is section 18 of PACE 1984 (for England and Wales), Sections 20 et seq., of the Police and 
Criminal  Evidence  Order  (Northern  Ireland)  1989  and  for  Scotland  it  is  obtained  under  common  law 
(see  Section  46  of  the  Criminal  Justice  (Scotland)  Act  2016).  UK  authorities  clarified  that  search 
warrants are issued by a court, on the application of the investigating officer. They permit an officer to 
enter premises to search for material or individuals relevant to their investigation; the execution of the 
warrant will often require the assistance of a police constable. 
When  the  investigation  concerns  money  laundering  (including  confiscation  and  civil  recovery 
proceedings),  the  relevant  legal  basis  for  applying  for  a  production  order  are  Sections  345  et  seq.  for 
England, Wales and Northern Ireland and sect 380 et seq. of Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for Scotland. 
When  the  investigation  concerns  other  issues  than  money  laundering,  an  application  for  a  production 
order  can  be  made  under  Section  9  and  Schedule  1  to  the  PACE  1984  for  England  and  Wales,  and 
Section  10  et  seq.  of  the  Police  and  Criminal  Evidence  Order  (Northern  Ireland)  1989  for  Northern 
Ireland.  For  Scotland  it  is  obtained  under  common  law  (see  Section  46  of  the  Criminal  Justice 
(Scotland) Act 2016) and Section 23B of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland). UK authorities 
clarified  that  a  production  order  requires  the  person  specified  in  it  to  produce  or  to  give  access  to  the 
material they are in possession or control of (see para 4 of Schedule 1 to the PACE 1984). 
For  instance,  the  PACE  1984  contains  powers  in  Sections  8  and  18  to  seize  and  retain  anything  for 
which a search has been authorised.

of statutory conditions which must be satisfied for a warrant185 or a production order186 
to be issued.  

For  example,  Section  8  and  Section  18  of  PACE  regulate  respectively  the  power  of  a  justice  of  the 
peace  to  authorise  a  warrant  and  of  a  police  officer  to  search  a  property.  In  the  first  case  (Section  8), 
before issuing a warrant a justice of the peace must first be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds 
for  believing  that:  (i)  an  indictable  offence  has  been  committed;  (ii)  there  is  material  on  the  premises 
which  is  likely  to  be  of  substantial  value  (whether  by  itself  or  together  with  other  material)  to  the 
investigation of the offence; (iii) the material is likely to be relevant evidence; (iv) it does not consist of 
or  include  items  subject  to  legal  privilege,  excluded  material  or  special  procedure  material;  and  (v)  it 
wouldn’t be possible to obtain entry without the use of a warrant. In the second case, Section 18 allows 
a police officer to search the premises of a person arrested for an indictable offence for material other 
than  material  subject  to  legal  privilege  if  they  have  reasonable  grounds  for  suspecting  that  there  is 
evidence on the premises that relate to that offence or another similar or connected indictable offence. 
Such  a  search  must  be  limited  to  uncovering  that  material  and  must  be  authorised,  in  writing,  by  a 
police officer of at least the rank of inspector unless it is necessary for the investigation of the offence. 
In which case, an officer of the rank of at least inspector must be informed as soon as practicable after it 
has been carried out. The grounds for the search and  nature of the evidence sought  must be recorded. 
Moreover, Sections 15 and 16 the PACE 1984 provide statutory safeguards that must be followed when 
applying  for  a  search  warrant.  Section  15  specifies  the  requirements  applicable  for  obtaining  a  search 
warrant  (including  the  content  of  the  application  made  by  the  constable  and  the  fact  that  the  warrant 
must  specify,  among  the  other  things,  the  enactment  under  which  it  is  issued  and  identify,  as  far  as 
possible, the articles and persons to be sought and the premises to be searched). Section 16 governs how 
a  search  under  a  warrant  must  be  carried  out  (for  example:  section  16(5)  provides  that  the  officer 
executing the warrant provides the occupier with a copy of the warrant; section 16(11) requires that the 
warrant,  once  executed,  be  retained  for  a  period  of  12  months;  Section  16(12)  provides  the  occupier 
with  the  right  to  inspect  the  warrant  during  that  period  if  they  so  wish).  These  Sections  help  ensure 
compliance  with Art. 8 ECHR (see for instance Kent Pharmaceuticals v Director of the Serious Fraud 
Office [2002] EWHC 3023 (QB) at [30] by Lord Woolf CJ). A failure to comply with these safeguards 
can result in the search being declared unlawful (examples include  R (Brook) v Preston Crown Court 
[2018]  EWHC  2024  (Admin),  [2018]  ACD  95;  R  (Superior  Import  /  Export  Ltd)  v  Revenue  and 
Customs  Commissioners  [2017]  EWHC  3172  (Admin),  [2018]  Lloyd’s  Rep  FC  115;  and  R  (F)  v 
Blackfriars  Crown  Court  [2014]  EWHC  1541  (Admin)).  Sections  15  and  16  of  PACE  1984  are 
supplemented by Code B of PACE, a Code of Practice which governs the exercise of police powers to 
search premises. 
For instance, when issuing a production order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, in addition to the 
need  to  have  reasonable  grounds  to  meet  the  conditions  set  in  out  in  346(2)  Proceeds  of  Crime  Act, 
there  should  be  reasonable  grounds  that  the  person  is  in  possession  or  control  of  the  material  so 
specified  and  that  the  material  is  likely  to  be  of  substantial  value.  Moreover,  another  requirement  for 
issuing a production order is that there must be reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public 
interest for the material to be produced or for access to it to be given, having regard to (a) the benefit 
likely to accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and (b) the circumstances under which 
the person the application specifies as appearing to be in possession or control of the material holding 
their information. Similarly, a court considering an application for a production order under Schedule 1 
to the PACE 1984 must be satisfied that specific conditions are met. In particular, Schedule 1 of PACE 
sets out two separate alternative sets of conditions, one of which must be met before a judge can issue a 
production  order. The  first  set  requires  that  the  judge  has  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  (i)  that  an 
indictable offence has been committed; (ii) the material sought on the premises consists of, or includes, 
special  procedure  but  not  excluded  material;  (iii)  it  is  likely  to  be  of  substantial  value,  whether  on  its 
own or together with other material, to the investigation; (iv) and that it is likely to be relevant evidence; 
(v)  other  methods  of  obtaining  the  material  have  either  been  attempted  or  have  not  been  attempted 
because they would be bound to fail; and (vi) having considered the benefit to the investigation and the 
circumstances  under  which  the  individual  possesses  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that  the  material  be 
produced or that access to it be provided. The second set of conditions requires: (i) there is material on 
the  premises  which  consists  of  special  procedure  or  excluded  material;  (ii)  were  it  not  for  the 
prohibition  on  searches  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  legislation  passed  before  PACE  for  special 
procedure,  excluded  or  legal  privilege  material,  a  search  warrant  for  the  material  could  have  been 
issued; and (iii) it would have been appropriate to do so.

(138)  Production orders and search warrants may be challenged by way of judicial review187. 
In  terms  of  safeguards,  all  criminal  law  enforcement  authorities    falling  within  the 
scope of Part 3 of the DPA 2018), may only access personal data – which is a form of 
processing – in line with the principles and requirements set out in the DPA 2018 (see 
recitals  (122)  and  (124)  above).  Therefore,  a  request  made  by  any  law  enforcement 
authority should be in compliance with the principle according to which the purposes 
of  processing  must  be  specified,  explicit  and  legitimate188  and  that  the  personal  data 
processed  by  a  competent  authority  must  be  relevant  to  that  purpose  and  not 
excessive189.  

3.2.1.2 Investigatory powers for law enforcement purposes 
(139)  For  the  purpose  of  preventing  or  detecting  only  serious  crimes190,  certain  law 
enforcement  authorities,  for  example  the  National  Crime  Agency  or  the  Chief  of 
Police191, can use targeted investigatory powers under the IPA 2016. In this case, the 
safeguards provided by the IPA 2016 will apply in addition to those provided by Part 3 
of  the  DPA  2018.  The  specific  investigatory  powers  that  those  law  enforcement 
authorities  can  rely  upon  are:  targeted  interceptions  (Part  2  of  the  IPA  2016), 
acquisition  of  communications  data  (Part  3  of  the  IPA  2016),  retention  of 
communications  data  (Part  4  of  the  IPA  2016)  and  targeted  equipment  interference 
(Part  5  of  the  IPA  2016).  Interception  covers  the  acquisition  of  the  content  of  a

Judicial review is the legal procedure by which the decisions of a public body can be challenged in the 
High  Court.  The  Courts  “review”  the  decision  being  challenged  and  decide  if  it  is  arguable  that  the 
decision  is  legally  flawed,  considering  public  law  concepts/principles.  The  core  grounds  for  judicial 
review  are  namely,  illegality,  irrationality,  procedural  impropriety,  legitimate  expectations  and  human 
rights.  Following a successful judicial review a court is able to order a number of different remedies; 
the most common of which is a quashing order (which would set aside or cancel the original decision  - 
i.e.  the  decision  to  issue  a  search  warrant),  in  some  circumstances  this  can  also  include  the  award  of 
financial compensation.  Additional detail on judicial review in the UK is available in the Government 
Legal  Department’s  publication  “Judge  Over  Your  Shoulder  –  a  guide  to  good  decision-making”,

following 

the 

at 

Section 37 of the UK DPA 2018. 

Section 263(1) of the IPA 2016 provides that “serious crime” means an offence for which an adult, who 
had no previous conviction, could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 
3  years  or  more  or  the  conduct  involves  the  use  of  violence,  results  in  substantial  financial  gain  or  is 
conduct by a large number of persons. Moreover, for the purposes of the acquisition of communications 
data  under  Part  4  of  the  IPA  2016,  Section  87(10B)  provides  that  “serious  crime”  means  a  crime  for 
which a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more can be imposed or an offence committed by a 
person  who  is  not  an  individual  or  which  involves,  as  an  integral  part  of  it,  the  sending  of  a 
communication or a breach of a person's privacy.  
In  particular,  the  following  law  enforcement  authorities  can  apply  for  a  targeted  interception  warrant: 
the Director General of the National Crime Agency, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, the 
Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of 
Scotland, the Commissioner for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Chief of Defence Intelligence 
and a person who is a competent authority of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom for the 
purposes  of  an  EU  mutual  assistance  instrument  or  an  international  mutual  assistance  agreement 
(Section 18(1) of the IPA 2016).

communication192 while acquisition and retention of communications data is not aimed 
at obtaining the content of the communication, but at the “who”, “when”, “where” and 
“how”  of  the  communication.  This  covers  for  instance  the  time  and  duration  of  a 
communication, the phone number or email address of the originator and recipient of 
the  communication,  and  sometimes  the  location  of  the  devices  from  which  the 
communication was made, the subscriber to a telephone service or an itemised bill193. 
Equipment  interference  is  a  set  of  techniques  used  to  obtain  a  variety  of  data  from 
equipment,  which  includes  computers,  tablets  and  smart  phones  as  well  as  cables, 
wires and storage devices194. 

(140)  Targeted  interception  powers  can  also  be  used  when  “necessary  for  the  purpose  of 
giving  effect  to  the  provisions  of  an  EU  mutual  assistance  instrument  or  an 
international mutual assistance agreement” (so-called “mutual assistance warrant”195). 
Mutual  assistance  warrants  are  only  provided  in  relation  to  interception,  not 
acquisition of communications data or equipment interference. These targeted powers 
are  regulated  in  the  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2016  (IPA  2016)196,  which,  together 
with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) for England, Wales and 
Northern  Ireland  and  the  Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  (Scotland)  Act  2000 
(RIPSA) for Scotland, provide for the legal basis and set out the applicable limitations 
and safeguards for the use of such powers. The IPA 2016 also provides the regime for 
the  use  of  bulk  investigatory  powers,  although  those  are  not  available  to  law 
enforcement authorities (only intelligence agencies can make use of them)197.  

(141)  In order to exercise these powers, the authorities need to obtain a warrant198 issued by 
a  competent  authority199,  and  approved  by  an  independent  Judicial  Commissioner200

A mutual assistance warrant authorises a UK authority to provide assistance to an authority outside the 
UK  territory  for  the  interception  and  the  disclosure  of  the  intercepted  material  to  such  authority,  in 
accordance with an international mutual assistance instrument (Section 15(4) of the IPA 2016). 
The 
(see: 
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/25/contents/enacted)  replaced  a  different  laws  concerning 
the interception of communications, equipment interference and the acquisition of communication data, 
in particular Part I of the RIPA 2000 that provided the previous general legislative framework  for the 
use of investigatory powers by law enforcement and national security authorities. 
Sections 138(1), 158(1), 178(1), 199(1) of the IPA 2016. 
Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the IPA 2016 provides for a limited number of cases where interceptions can be 
performed without a warrant. This includes: interception with the consent of the sender or the recipient, 
interception for administrative or enforcement purposes, interception taking place in certain institutions 
(prisons, psychiatric hospitals and immigration detention facilities) as well as interception carried out in 
accordance with a relevant international agreement. 
In most of the cases, the Secretary of State is the authority that issues the warrants under the IPA 2016, 
while  Scottish  Ministers  are  empowered  to  issue  targeted  interception  warrants,  mutual  assistance 
warrant  and  targeted  equipment  interference  warrants  when  the  persons  or  premises  to  be  intercepted 
and the equipment to be interfered are located in Scotland (see Sections 22 and 103 of the IPA 2016). In 
case  of  targeted  equipment  interference,  a  law  enforcement  chief  (described  in  Part  1  and  Part  2  of 
Schedule 6 to the IPA 2016) can issue the warrant under the conditions of Section 106 of the IPA 2016.

(so-called  “double-lock”  procedure).  The  obtaining  of  such  a  warrant  is  subject  to  a 
necessity  and  proportionality  test201.  Since  these  targeted  investigatory  powers 
provided by the IPA 2016 are the same as those available to national security agencies, 
the conditions, limitations and safeguards applicable to such powers are addressed in 
detail  in  the  Section  on  access  and  use  of  personal  data  by  United  Kingdom  public 
authorities for national security purposes (see recitals (177) and following). 

3.2.2  Further use of the information collected 

(142)  The  sharing  of  data  by  a  law  enforcement  authority  with  a  different  authority  for 
purposes other than the ones for which it was originally collected (so-called “onward 
sharing”) is subject to certain conditions.  

(143)  Similarly to what is provided under Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, Section 
36(3)  of  the  DPA  2018  allows  that  personal  data  collected  by  a  competent  authority 
for  a  law  enforcement  purpose  may  be  further  processed  (whether  by  the  original 
controller  or  by  another  controller)  for  any  other  law  enforcement  purpose,  provided 
that  the  controller  is  authorised  by  law  to  process  data  for  the  other  purpose  and  the 
processing  is  necessary  and  proportionate  to  that  purpose202.  In  this  case,  all  the 
safeguards provided by Part 3 of the DPA 2018, referred to in recitals (122) and (124) 
apply to the processing carried out by the receiving authority. 

(144)  In  the  United  Kingdom  legal  order,  different  laws  explicitly  allow  such  onward 
sharing.  In  particular,  (i)  the  Digital  Economy  Act  2017  allows  the  sharing  between 
public  authorities  for  several  purposes,  for  example  in  case  of  any  fraud  against  the 
public sector which would involve loss or a risk to loss for public authorities203 or in 
case of a debt owed to a public authority or to the Crown204; (ii) the Crime and Courts 
Act  2013  that  permits  the  sharing  of  information  with  the  National  Crime  Agency 
(NCA)205  for  combating,  investigating  and  prosecuting  serious  and  organised  crime; 
(iii) the Serious Crime Act 2007 that allows public authorities to disclose information 
to anti-fraud organisations for the purposes of preventing fraud206.  

(145)  These laws explicitly provide that the sharing of information should be in compliance 
with the principles set in the DPA 2018. Moreover, the College of Policing has issued 
an  Authorised  Professional  Practice  on  Information  Sharing207  to  assist  the  police  in 
complying  with  their  data  protection  obligations  under  the  UK  GDPR,  DPA  and

Human  Rights  Act  1998.  The  compliance  of  the  sharing  with  the  applicable  data 
protection legal framework is, of course, subject to judicial review208.  

(146)  Moreover,  similarly  to  what  is  set  out  in  Article  9  of  Directive  (EU)  2016/680,  the 
DPA 2018 provides that personal data collected for any law enforcement purpose may 
be processed for a purpose that is  not  a law enforcement one when the processing is 
authorised by law209.  

(147)  This  type  of  sharing  covers  two  scenarios:  1)  when  a  criminal  law  enforcement 
authority  shares  data  with  a  non-criminal  law  enforcement  authority  other  than  an 
intelligence agency (such as, e.g. a financial or tax authority, a competition authority, a 
youth  welfare  office,  etc.);  and  2)  when  a  criminal  law  enforcement  authority  shares 
data with an intelligence agency. In the first scenario, the processing of personal data 
will fall within the scope of the UK GDPR as well as under Part 2 of the DPA 2018. 
The Commission has assessed the safeguards provided by the UK GDPR and Part 2 of 
the DPA 2018 in recitals (12) to (111) and has come to the conclusion that the United 
Kingdom ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred within 
the  scope  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  from  the  European  Union  to  the  United 
Kingdom.  

(148)  In the second scenario, with respect to the sharing of data collected by a criminal law 
enforcement  authority  with  an  intelligence  agency  for  purposes  of  national  security, 
the  legal  basis  authorising  such  sharing  is  Section  19  of  the  Counter  Terrorism  Act 
2008 (CTA 2008)210. Under this Act,  any person may  give information to  any of the 
intelligence services for the purpose of discharging any of the functions of that service, 
including “national security”. 

(149)  As  regards  the  conditions  under  which  data  can  be  shared  for  national  security 
purposes,  the  Intelligence  Services  Act211  and  the  Security  Service  Act212  limit  the 
ability of the intelligence services to obtain data to what is necessary to discharge their 
statutory  functions.  Law  enforcement  agencies  seeking  to  share  data  with  the 
intelligence services will need to consider a number of factors/limitations, in addition 
to the statutory functions of the agencies which are set out in the Intelligence Services 
Act and the Security Service Act213. Section 20 of the CTA 2008 makes clear that any

See for example case M, R v the Chief Constable of Sussex Police [2019] EWHC 975 (Admin) where 
the High Court was asked to consider data sharing between the police and a Business Crime Reduction 
Partnership  (BCRP),  an  organisation  empowered  to  manage  exclusion  notice  schemes,  prohibiting 
persons  from entering its  members' commercial premises.  The court reviewed  the data sharing,  which 
was  taking  place  on  the  basis  of  an  agreement  having  the  purpose  of  protecting  the  public  and 
preventing  crime  and  ultimately  concluded  that  most  aspects  of  data  sharing  were  lawful,  except  in 
relation to some sensitive information  shared between the  police and BCRP.  Another example is case 
Cooper v NCA [2019] EWCA Civ 16 where the Court of Appeal upheld the data sharing between the 
police and the Serious Organised Crime  Agency (SOCA),  a law enforcement agency currently part of 
the NCA.

data  sharing  pursuant  to  Section  19  must  still  comply  with  the  data  protection 
legislation;  which  means  that  all  of  the  limitations  and  requirements  in  Part  3  of  the 
DPA 2018 apply. Furthermore, as competent authorities are public authorities for the 
purpose of the Human Rights Act 1998, they must ensure that they act in compliance 
with Convention rights, including Article 8 of the ECHR. These limits ensure that all 
data  sharing  between  the  law  enforcement  agencies  and  the  intelligence  services 
complies with data protection legislation and the ECHR. 

(150)  When a competent authority intends to share personal data processed under Part 3 of 
the  DPA  2018  with  law  enforcement  authorities  of  a  third  country,  specific 
requirements apply214. In particular, such transfers may take place when they are based 
on  adequacy  regulations  made  by  the  Secretary  of  State  or,  in  the  absence  of  such 
regulations,  appropriate  safeguards  must  be  ensured.  Section  75  of  the  DPA  2018 
provides  that  appropriate  safeguards  are  in  place  where  established  by  a  legal 
instrument binding the intended recipient, or where the controller, having assessed all 
the  circumstances  surrounding  transfers  of  that  type  of  personal  data  to  the  third 
country  or  international  organisation,  concludes  that  appropriate  safeguards  exist  to 
protect the data.  

(151)  If  a  transfer  is  not  based  on  an  adequacy  regulation  or  appropriate  safeguards,  it  can 
take  place  only  in  certain,  specified  circumstances,  referred  to  as  “special 
circumstances”215.  This  is  the  case  when  the  transfer  is  necessary:  (a)  to  protect  the 
vital  interests  of  the  data  subject  or  another  person;  (b)  to  safeguard  the  legitimate 
interests of the data subject; (c) for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat 
to the public security of a member state or third country; (d) in individual cases for any 
of the law enforcement purposes; or (e) in individual cases for a legal purpose (such as 
in relation to legal proceedings or to obtain legal advice). It may be noted that (d) and 
(e)  do  not  apply  if  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subject  override  the  public 
interest in the transfer. This set of circumstances corresponds to the specific situations 
and  conditions  qualifying  as  “derogations”  under  Article  38  of  Directive  (EU) 
2016/680.  

(152)  Moreover, when the material acquired by law enforcement authorities under a warrant 
authorising the use of interception or equipment interference is handed over to a third 
country,  the  IPA  2016  imposes  additional  safeguards.  In  particular,  such  disclosure, 
defined as “overseas disclosure”, is allowed only if the issuing authority considers that 
specific  appropriate  arrangements  are  in  place  which  limit  the  number  of  persons  to 

                                                                                                                                                         
as necessary for the proper discharge of its functions and that no information is disclosed by it except so 
far as necessary— (i) for that purpose; (ii) in the interests of national security; (iii) for the purpose of the 
prevention  or  detection  of  serious  crime;  or  (iv)  for  the  purpose  of  any  criminal  proceedings;  and  (b) 
that  the  Intelligence  Service  does  not  take  any  action  to  further  the  interests  of  any  United  Kingdom 
political party” while Section 2(2) of the Security Service Act 1989 provides that “The Director-General 
shall be responsible for the efficiency of the Service and it shall be his duty to ensure— (a) that there are 
arrangements for securing that no information is obtained by the Service except so far as necessary for 
the proper discharge of its functions or disclosed by it except so far as necessary for that purpose or for 
the  purpose  of  the  prevention  or  detection  of]  serious  crime  or  for  the  purpose  of  any  criminal 
proceedings]; and (b) that  the Service does not  take any action to  further the interests of any political 
party; and (c) that there are arrangements, agreed with Director General of the National Crime Agency, 
for co-ordinating the activities of the Service in pursuance of Section 1(4) of this Act with the activities 
of police forces, the National Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies”. 
See Chapter 5 of Part 3 of the DPA 2018.

whom  the  data  is  disclosed,  the  extent  to  which  any  material  is  disclosed  or  made 
available as well as the extent to which any of the material is copied and the number of 
copies  made.  Moreover,  the  issuing  authority  may  consider  that  appropriate 
arrangements are necessary to ensure that every copy made of any part of that material 
is destroyed as soon as there are no longer any relevant grounds for retaining it (if not 
destroyed earlier)216. 

(153)  Finally,  specific  forms  of  onward  transfers  from  the  United  Kingdom  to  the  United 
States  could  in  the  future  take  place  based  on  the  “Agreement  between  the 
Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern  Ireland  and  the 
Government  of  the  United  States  of  America  on  Access  to  Electronic  Data  for  the 
Purpose  of  Countering  Serious  Crime 
(the  “UK-US  Agreement”  or  “the 
Agreement”)217, concluded in October 2019218. While the UK-US Agreement has not 
yet entered into force at the time of adoption of this Decision, its foreseeable entry into 
force  may  affect  onward  transfers  to  the  US  of  data  first  transferred  to  the  United 
Kingdom on the basis of the Decision. More specifically, data transferred from the EU 
to  service  providers  in  the  United  Kingdom  could  be  subject  to  orders  for  the 
production of electronic evidence issued by competent US law enforcement authorities 
and made applicable in the United Kingdom under this Agreement once in force. For 
these  reasons,  the  assessment  of  the  conditions  and  safeguards  under  which  such 
orders can be issued and executed is relevant to this Decision. 

(154)  In  this  respect,  it  should  be  noted  that,  first,  as  regards  its  material  scope,  the 
Agreement is  only applicable to  crimes that  are  punishable with  a maximum term  of 
imprisonment  of  at  least  three  years  (defined  as  “serious  crime”)219,  including 
“terrorist  activity”.  Second,  data  processed  in  the  other  jurisdiction  may  be  obtained 
under  this  Agreement  only  following  an  “Order  […]  subject  to  review  or  oversight 
under  the  domestic  law  of  the  Issuing  Party  by  a  court,  judge,  magistrate,  or  other 
independent  authority  prior  to  or  in  proceedings  regarding,  enforcement  of  the 
Order”220.  Third,  any  order  must  “be  based  on  requirements  for  a  reasonable 
justification based on articulable and credible facts, particularity, legality, and severity

The  United  States  CLOUD  Act  is  a  US  federal  law  that  was  adopted  on  23  March  2018  and  that

regarding the conduct under investigation”221 and “be targeted at specific accounts as 
well  as  identify  a  specific  person,  account,  address,  or  personal  device,  or  any  other 
specific  identifier”222.  Fourth,  data  obtained  under  this  agreement  benefits  from 
equivalent  protections  to  the  specific  safeguards  provided  by  the  so-called  “EU-US 
Umbrella  Agreement”223  –  a  comprehensive  data  protection  agreement  concluded  in 
December  2016  by  the  EU  and  the  US  and  that  sets  out  the  safeguards  and  rights 
applicable to data transfers in the area of law enforcement cooperation – which are all 
incorporated into this Agreement by reference on a mutatis mutandis basis to notably 
take  into  account  the  specific  nature  of  the  transfers  (i.e.  transfers  from  private 
operators  to  a  law  enforcement,  rather  than  transfers  between  law  enforcement 
authorities)224.  The  UK-US  Agreement  specifically  provides 
that  equivalent 
protections to those provided by the EU-US Umbrella Agreement will be applied “to 
all personal information produced in the execution of Orders subject to the Agreement 
to produce equivalent protections”225.  

(155)  Data  transferred  to  US  authorities  under  the  UK-US  Agreement  should  therefore 
benefit  from  protections  provided  by  an  EU  law  instrument,  with  the  necessary 
adaptations  to  reflect  the  nature  of  the  transfers  at  issue.  The  United  Kingdom 
authorities have further confirmed that the protections of the Umbrella Agreement will 
apply  to  all  personal  information  produced  or  preserved  under  the  Agreement, 
irrespective  of  the  nature  or  type  of  body  making  the  request  (e.g.  both  federal  and 
State  law  enforcement  authorities  in  the  US),  so  that  equivalent  protection  must  be 
provided  in  all  cases.  However,  the  United  Kingdom  authorities  have  also  explained 
that  the  details  of  the  concrete  implementation  of  the  data  protection  safeguards  are 
still subject to discussions between the United Kingdom and the US. In the context of 
the  talks  with  the  European  Commission’s  services  on  this  decision,  the  United 
Kingdom authorities confirmed that they will only let the Agreement enter into force 
once  they  are  satisfied  that  its  implementation  complies  with  the  legal  obligations 
provided therein, including clarity with respect to compliance with the data protection 
standards for any data requested under this Agreement. As a possible entry into force 
of  the  Agreement  may  impact  the  level  of  protection  assessed  in  this  Decision,  any 
information  and  future  clarification  regarding  the  way  the  US  will  comply  with  its 
obligations under the Agreement should be communicated by the United Kingdom to 
the European Commission, as soon as it becomes available and in any case before the 
entry into force of the Agreement, to ensure proper monitoring of this decision in line 
with Article 45 (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Particular attention will be given to 
the application and adaptation of the Umbrella Agreement’s protections to the specific 
type of transfers covered by the UK-US Agreement.

(156)  More  generally,  any  relevant  development  as  regards  the  entry  into  force  and 
application  of  the  Agreement  will  be  duly  taken  into  account  in  the  context  of  the 
continuous  monitoring  of  this  decision,  including  with  respect  to  the  necessary

3.2.3  Oversight 

(157)  Depending on the powers used by the competent authorities when processing personal 
data for a law enforcement purpose (whether under the DPA 2018 or the IPA 2016), 
different  bodies  ensure  the  oversight  over  the  use  of  these  powers.  In  particular,  the 
Information  Commissioner  oversees  the  processing  of  personal  data  when  it  falls 
under the scope of Part  3 of the DPA 2018226.  Independent  and judicial oversight  on 
the  use  of  investigatory  powers  under  the  IPA  2016  is  ensured  by  the  Investigatory 
Powers  Commissioner’s  Office  (IPCO)227  (this  part  is  addressed  in  recitals  (250)  to 
(255)).  Moreover,  additional  oversight  is  guaranteed  by  the  Parliament  as  well  as  by 
other bodies. 

3.2.3.1 Oversight over Part 3 of the DPA 2018 

(158)  The  general  functions  of  the  Information  Commissioner  –  whose  independence  and 
organisation  are  explained  in  recital  (87)  –  in  relation  to  the  processing  of  personal 
data falling under the scope of Part 3 of the DPA 2018 are laid down in Schedule 13 to 
the DPA 2018. The ICO’s main task is to monitor and enforce Part 3 of the DPA 2018 
as well as to promote public awareness, advise Parliament, the government and other 
institutions and bodies. To maintain the independence of the judiciary, the Information 
Commissioner  is  not  authorised  to  exercise  its  functions  in  relation  to  processing  of 
personal data by an individual acting in a judicial capacity, or a court or tribunal acting 
in  its  judicial  capacity.  In  these  circumstances,  other  bodies  would  exercise  the 
oversight functions, as explained in recitals (99) to (103). 

(159)  The  Commissioner  has  general  investigative,  corrective,  authorisation  and  advisory 
powers in relation to processing of personal data to which Part 3 applies. In particular, 
the Commissioner has the powers to notify the controller or the processor of an alleged 
infringement of Part 3 of the DPA 2018, to issue warnings or reprimand to a controller 
or processor that has infringed provisions of Part 3 of the Act, as well as to issue on its 
own initiative or on request,  opinions to  Parliament,  government  or other institutions 
and bodies as  well as to the public on any issue  related to  the protection  of personal 
data228. 

(160)  Moreover,  the  Commissioner  has  powers  to  issue  information  notices229,  assessment 
notices230  and  enforcement  notices231  as  well  as  the  power  to  access  documents  of

controllers  and  processors,  access  their  premises232  and  issue  administrative  fines  in 
the  form  of  penalty  notices233.  The  ICO’s  Regulatory  Action  Policy  sets  out  the 
circumstances under which it issues respectively information, assessment, enforcement 
and  penalty  notices234  (see  also  recital  (93)  and  Directive  (EU)  2016/680  adequacy 
decision recitals 101-102).  

(161)  According  to  its  latest  annual  reports  (2018–2019235,  2019-2020236),  the  Information 
Commissioner  has  conducted  a  number  of  investigations  and  taken  enforcement 
measures  with  respect  to  processing  of  data  by  law  enforcement  authorities.  For 
example,  the  Commissioner  conducted  an  investigation  and  published  an  Opinion  in 
October  2019  concerning  law  enforcement’s  use  of  facial  recognition  technology  in 
public  places.  The  investigation  focused,  in  particular,  on  the  use  of  live  facial 
recognition  capabilities  by  South  Wales  Police  and  the  Metropolitan  Police  Service 
(MPS). The  Information Commissioner also  investigated the MPS “Gangs matrix”237 
and found a range of serious  infringements of data protection law that were likely to 
undermine  public  confidence  in  the  matrix  and  how  the  data  was  being  used.  In 
November 2018, the Information Commissioner issued an enforcement notice and the 
MPS subsequently took the steps required to increase security and accountability and 
to ensure that the data was used proportionately. Another example of an enforcement 
action  in  this  area  is  the  £325,000  fine  issued  by  the  Commissioner  in  May  2018 
against  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service,  for  losing  unencrypted  DVDs  containing 
recordings  of  police  interviews.  The  Information  Commissioner  also  conducted 
investigations into broader topics, for  example in  the first  half of 2020 on the use of 
Mobile Phone Extraction for Policing Purposes and the processing of victims’ data by 
the police. Moreover, the Commissioner is currently investigating a case that involves 
the  access  of  law  enforcement  authorities  to  data  held  by  a  private  sector  entity, 
Clearview AI Inc.238  

(162)  Besides  the  enforcement  powers  of  the  Information  Commissioner  mentioned  in 
recitals ((160) and (161)), certain violations of the data protection legislation constitute 
offences and may therefore be subject  to  criminal  sanctions (section 196 of the DPA 
2018).  This  applies,  for  example,  to  obtaining,  disclosing  or  retaining  personal  data 
without the consent of the controller and procuring the disclosure of personal data to 
another person without the consent of the controller239’; re-identifying information that 
is de-identified personal data without the consent of the controller responsible for de-
identifying  the  personal  data240;  intentionally  obstructing  the  Commissioner  to 
exercise  its  powers  in  relation  to  inspection  of  personal  data  in  accordance  with 
international  obligations241,  making  false  statements  in  response  to  an  information

3.2.3.3 Other oversight bodies in the area of criminal law enforcement 

(163)  In addition to the Information Commissioner, there are several oversight bodies in the 
area  of  criminal  law  enforcement  with  specific  mandates  relevant  for  data  protection 
issues.  This  includes  for  instance  the  Commissioner  for  the  Retention  and  Use  of 
Biometric  Material  (‘the  Biometrics  Commissioner’)243  and  the  Surveillance  Camera 
Commissioner244. 

3.2.3.4 Parliamentary oversight in the area of criminal law enforcement  

(164)  The  Home  Affairs  Select  Committee  (HASC)  ensures  parliamentary  oversight  in  the 
area  of  law  enforcement.  This  Committee  consists  of  11  Members  of  Parliament, 
drawn from the three largest political parties. The Committee has the task to examine 
the expenditure, administration, and policy of the Home Office and associated public 
bodies,  i.e.  including  the  police  and  the  NCA  –  whose  work  the  Committee  can 
scrutinise specifically245. 

(165)  The Committee can, within the limits of their remit, choose its own subject of inquiry, 
including  specific  cases,  as  long  as  the  issue  is  not  sub  judice.  The  Committee  may 
also  seek  written  and  oral  evidence  from  a  wide  range  of  relevant  groups  and 
individuals.  It  produces  reports  on  its  findings  and  issues  recommendations  to  the 
Government246.  The  Government  is  expected  to  respond  to  each  of  the  report’s 
recommendations and must respond within 60 days247.

During  the  financial  year  covering  the  period  from  1  April  2019  to  31  March  2020,  the  ICO’s 
investigations have resulted in four cautions and eight prosecutions. These cases were prosecuted under 
Section  55  of  the  Data  Protection  Act  1998,  Section  77  of  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  2000  and 
Section  170  of  the  Data  Protection  Act  2018.  In  75%  of  cases,  the  defendants  submitted  guilty  pleas 
negating  the  necessity  for  protracted  trials  with  the  associated  costs.  (Information  Commissioner’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2019/2020, see footnote 87, page 40).  
The  Biometrics  Commissioner  was  established  by  the  Protection  of  Freedoms  Act  2012  (PoFA)  (see: 
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents).  Among  others  functions, 
the  Biometrics 
Commissioner  decides  whether  or  not  the  police  may  retain  DNA  profile  records  and  fingerprints 
obtained from individuals arrested but not charged with a qualifying offence (Section 63G of the PACE 
1984).  Moreover,  the  Biometrics  Commissioner  has  a  general  responsibility  to  keep  the  retention  and 
use of DNA and fingerprints, and retention on national security grounds, under review (Section 20(2) of 
the  POFA  2012). The  Biometric  Commissioner  is  appointed  under  the  Code  for  Public Appointments 
(the  Code  is  available  at  the  following  link:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-
code-for-public-appointments ) and his terms of appointment make it clear that he may only be removed 
from  office  by  the  Home  Secretary  under  a  narrowly  defined  set  of  circumstances;  these  include  a 
failure to carry out his duties for a period of three months, conviction for a criminal offence or a failure 
to comply with the terms of his appointment. 
The Surveillance Camera Commissioner  was established by  the Protection of Freedoms  Act 2012 and 
has the role of encouraging compliance with the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice; reviewing the 
operation of this Code ; and providing advice to ministers on whether this Code needs amending. The 
Commissioner is appointed under the  same rules as the Biometrics  Commissioners and  enjoys similar 
powers, resources and protection against removal.

Select Committees, including the Home Affairs Select Committee, are subject to the Standing Orders of 
the House of Commons. Standing Orders are the rules, agreed by the House of Commons, governing the 
way  parliament  does  business.  The  remit  of  select  committees  is  broad,  with  Standing  Order  152(1) 
providing that the “Select committees shall be appointed to examine the expenditure, administration and

(166)  In  the  area  of  surveillance,  the  Committee  also  produced  a  report  concerning  the 
Regulation  of  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2000  (RIPA  2000)248,  which  found  that  the 
RIPA  2000  was  not  fit  for  purpose.  Their  report  was  taken  into  account  during  the 
replacement  of  significant  parts  of  the  RIPA  2000  with  the  IPA  2016.  A  full  list  of 
inquiries can be found on the Committee’s website249. 

(167)  The  tasks  of  the  HASC  are  performed  in  Scotland  by  the  Justice  Subcommittee  on 

Policing and in Northern Ireland by the Committee for Justice250.  

3.2.4  Redress 

(168)  As regards processing of data by law enforcement authorities, redress mechanisms are 
available under Part 3 of the DPA 2018 and under the IPA 2016, as well as under the 
Human Rights Act 1998.  

(169)  This  series  of  mechanisms  provide  data  subjects  with  effective  administrative  and 
judicial means of redress, enabling them in particular to ensure their rights, including 
the right to have access to their personal data, or to obtain the rectification or erasure 
of such data. 

(170)  First,  under  Section  165  the  DPA  2018,  a  data  subject  has  the  right  to  lodge  a 
complaint  with  the  Information  Commissioner  if  the  data  subject  considers  that,  in 
connection with personal data relating to him or her, there is an infringement of Part 3 
of  the  DPA  2018251.  The  Information  Commissioner  has  the  power  to  assess  the 
compliance  of  the  controller  and  processor  with  the  DPA  2018,  require them  to  take 
necessary steps in case of non-compliance and impose fines. 

(171)  Second,  the  DPA  2018  provides  the  right  to  a  remedy  against  the  Information 
Commissioner if it fails to appropriately handle a complaint made by the data subject. 
More specifically, if the Commissioner fails to “progress”252 a complaint made by the 

                                                                                                                                                         
policy of the principal government departments as set out in paragraph (2) of this order and associated 
public  bodies.”  This  enables  the  Home  Affairs  Select  Committee  to  look  at  any  policy  owned  by  the 
Home Office, which includes policies (and the related legislation) on investigatory powers. Moreover, 
standing  Order  152(4)  makes  clear  that  Committees  have  various  powers,  including  the  ability  to 
request  persons  to  give  evidence  or  documents  on  a  particular  issue,  and  to  produce  reports.  The

The  last  ICO  annual  report  provides  a  breakdown  of  the  nature  of  complaints  received  and  closed.  In 
particular, the number of complaints received for “policing and criminal records” amount to 6% of the 
total number of complaints received (with an increase of 1% compared to the previous financial year). 
The annual report also shows that complaints concerning subjects’ access requests represent the highest 
number  (46%  over  total  number  of  complaints,  with  an  increase  of  8%  compared  to  the  previous 
financial year) (ICO’ s Annual report 2019-2020, page 55; see footnote 88).  
Section 166 of the DPA 2018 refers specifically to the following situations: (a) the Commissioner fails 
to  take  appropriate  steps  to  respond  to  the  complaint,  (b)  the  Commissioner  fails  to  provide  the 

the  following

data subject, the complainant has access to judicial remedy, as they can apply to a First 
Tier Tribunal253 to order the Commissioner to take appropriate steps to respond to the 
complaint, or to  inform  the complainant of progress  on the complaint254.  In addition, 
any  person  who  is  given  any  of  the  mentioned  notices  (information,  assessment, 
enforcement  or  penalty  notice)  from  the  Commissioner  may  appeal  to  a  First  Tier 
Tribunal.  If  the  Tribunal  considers  that  the  decision  of  the  Commissioner  is  not  in 
accordance  with  the  law  or  the  Information  Commissioner  should  have  exercised  its 
discretion differently, the Tribunal must allow the appeal, or substitute another notice 
or decision which the Information Commissioner could have given or made255. 

(172)  Third,  individuals  can  obtain  judicial  redress  against  controllers  and  processors 
directly  before  the  courts.  In  particular,  under  Section  167  of  the  DPA  2018,  a  data 
subject may submit an application before the court for an infringement of his/her right 
under the data protection legislation and the court may by means of an order request 
the controller to take (or to refrain from taking) any step with respect to the processing 
to  comply  with  the  DPA  2018.  Moreover,  under  Section  169  of  the  DPA  2018,  any 
person  who  has  suffered  damage  due  to  a  violation  of  a  requirement  of  the  data 
protection legislation (including Part 3 of the DPA 2018), other than the UK GDPR, is 
entitled to compensation for that damage from the controller or the processor, except if 
the  controller  or  processor  proves  that  the  controller  or  processor  is  not  in  any  way 
responsible  for  the  event  giving  rise  to  the  damage.  Damage  includes  both  financial 
loss and damage not involving financial loss, such as distress. 

(173)  Finally,  any  person,  as  far  as  he/she  considers  that  his/her  rights,  including  rights  to 
privacy  and data protection, have been violated by  any public authorities, can obtain 
redress before the courts of the United Kingdom under the Human Rights Act 1998256, 
and, after exhausting national remedies, a person, non-governmental organisation and

complainant  with  information  about  progress  on  the  complaint,  or  of  the  outcome  of  the  complaint, 
before the end of the period of 3 months beginning when the Commissioner received the complaint, or 
(c)  if  the  Commissioner’s  consideration  of  the  complaint  is  not  concluded  during  that  period,  fails  to 
provide the complainant with such information during a subsequent period of 3 months. 
The  First  Tier  Tribunal  is  the  court  competent  for  handling  appeals  against  decisions  made  by 
government regulatory bodies. In the case of the Information Commissioner’s decision, the competent 
chamber is the “General Regulatory Chamber” which has jurisdiction over the whole United Kingdom. 
Section  166  of  the  DPA  2018.  Example  of  successful  actions  against  the  ICO  before  the  Tribunal 
include  a  case  where  the  ICO  acknowledged  receipt  of  a  complaint  from  a  data  subject  but  did  not 
indicate  what  course  of  action  it  intended  to  take,  and  was  therefore  ordered  to  confirm,  within  21 
calendar days, whether it was going to investigate the complaints and, if so, to inform the complainant 
of  the  progress  of  the  investigation  no  less  frequently  than  every  21  calendar  days  thereafter  (the 
judgment has not  yet been published), and a case  where the First Tier Tribunal considered that it  was 
unclear  whether  the  ICO’s  response  to  a  complainant  properly  constituted  the  ‘outcome’  of  the 
complaint  (see  Susan  Milne  v  The  Information  Commissioner  [2020],  judgement  available  at  the

Sections 162 and 163 of the DPA 2018. 
See for example  Brown v  Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis  &  Anor [2019] EWCA  Civ 1724

unlawful obtaining and  misuse of personal  information, and  R (on the application of Bridges) v  Chief 
Constable  of  South  Wales  [2020]  EWCA  Civ  1058  where  the  Court  of  Appeal  declared  unlawful  the 
deployment of a facial recognition system by the Wales police, as it  was in breach of Article 8 of the 
ECHR  and  the  data  protection  impact  assessment  produced  by  the  controller  did  not  comply  with  the

purposes 

(175)  In  the  United  Kingdom  legal  order,  the  intelligence  services  empowered  to  collect 
electronic information held by controllers or processors on national security grounds, 
in  situations  that  are  relevant  to  an  adequacy  scenario,  are  the  Security  Service258 
(MI5),  the  Secret  Intelligence  Service259  (SIS)  and  the  Government  Communications 
Headquarters260 (GCHQ)261.  

3.3.1  Legal bases, limitations and safeguards 

(176)  In the United Kingdom, the powers of the intelligence agencies are set out in the IPA 
2016 and the RIPA 2000, which, together with the DPA 2018, defines the material and 
personal scope of these powers as well as the limitations and safeguards for their use.

Article  34  of  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights  provides  that  “The  Court  may  receive 
applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the 
victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or 
the  Protocols  thereto.  The  High  Contracting  Parties  undertake  not  to  hinder  in  any  way  the  effective 
exercise of this right”. 
The MI5 is under the authority of the Home  Secretary. The Security Service  Act 1989 sets out MI5’s 
functions:  protecting  national  security  (including  protection  against  threats  from  espionage,  terrorism 
and  sabotage,  from  activities  of  agents  of  foreign  powers  and  from  actions  intended  to  overthrow  or 
undermine  parliamentary  democracy  by  political,  industrial  or  violent  means),  safeguarding  the 
economic well-being of the UK against outside threats and supporting activities of the police forces and 
other law enforcement agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime.  
The  SIS  is  under  authority  of  the  Foreign  Secretary  and  its  functions  are  set  out  in  the  Intelligence 
Services  Act  1994.  Its  functions  are  to  obtain  and  provide  information  relating  to  the  actions  or 
intentions  of  persons  outside  the  British  Islands  and  to  perform  other  tasks  relating  to  the  actions  or 
intentions of such persons. These functions can be exercised only in the interest of national security, in 
the  interests  of  the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  or  in  support  of  the  prevention  or  detection  of 
serious crime. 
The GCHQ is under authority of the Foreign Secretary and its functions are set out in the Intelligence 
Services  Act  1994.  These  are  (a)  to  monitor,  make  use  of  or  interfere  with  electromagnetic  and  other 
emissions  and  equipment  producing  such  emissions,  obtain  and  provide  information  derived  from  or  
related  to  such  emissions  or  equipment  and  from  encrypted  material;  (b)  to  provide  advice  and 
assistance  about  languages,  including  terminology  used  for  technical  matters  and  cryptography  and 
other  matters relating to the protection of information to the armed forces, to the government or other 
organisations or persons considered appropriate. These functions can be exercised only in the interest of 
national security, in the interests of the economic well-being of the UK in the relation to the actions or 
intentions of persons outside the British Islands or in support of the prevention or detection of serious 
crime. 
Other public bodies exercising functions relevant to national security are the Defence Intelligence (DI), 
the  National  Security  Council  and  Secretariat,  the  Joint  Intelligence  Organisation  and  the  Joint 
Intelligence  Committee.  However,  neither  the  JIC  nor  the  JIO  are  able  to  make  use  of  investigatory 
powers under the IPA 2016 while the DI has limited scope to use its powers.

Those powers as well as the limitations and safeguards applicable to them are assessed 
in detail in the following sections. 

3.3.1.1 Investigatory powers exercised in the context of national security  

(177)  The  IPA  2016  provides  the  legal  framework  for  the  use  of  investigatory  powers,  i.e. 
the  power  to 
intercept,  access  communication  data  and  perform  equipment 
interference.  The  IPA  2016  introduces  a  general  prohibition  and  makes  it  a  criminal 
offence to use techniques that allow access to the content of  communications, access 
to  communication data or equipment  interference without lawful  authority262. This  is 
reflected  in  the  fact  that  the  use  of  these  investigatory  powers  is  lawful  only  when 
carried out on the basis of a warrant or an authorization263. 

(178)  The  IPA  2016  lays  down  detailed  rules  governing  the  scope  and  application  of  each 
investigatory  powers  as  well  as  their  specific  limitations  and  safeguards.  Different 
rules  apply  depending  on 
investigatory  power  (interception  of 
communications,  acquisition  and  retention  of  communication  data  and  equipment 
interference)264 as well as on whether the power is exercised on a specific target or in 
bulk. Details on the scope, safeguards and limitations of each measure provided by the 
IPA 2016 are described in the specific section below.  

type  of 

the 

(179)  Moreover,  the  IPA  2016  is  supplemented  with  a  number  of  statutory  Codes  of 
Practice,  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  approved  by  both  Houses  of  the 
Parliament265 and applicable throughout the country, providing further guidance on the 
use  of  these  powers266.  While  data  subjects  can  rely  directly  on  the  provisions  laid 
down in the IPA 2016 to exercise their rights, Schedule 7 paragraph 5 to the IPA 2016 
specifies  that  the  Codes  of  Practice  are  admissible  as  evidence  in  civil  and  criminal 
proceedings, and the court, tribunal or supervisory authority may take into account any 
non-compliance  with  the  Codes  when  determining  a  relevant  issue  in  judicial 
proceedings267. In the context of its assessment of the “quality of the law” of the UK’s 

                                                 
262

The prohibition applies to both public and private communication networks, as well as the public postal 
service when the interception is carried out in the United Kingdom. The prohibition does not apply to 
the controller of the private network if the controller has given express or implied consent to carry out 
the interception (Section 3 of the IPA 2016). 
In  specific  limited  cases  lawful  interception  without  a  warrant  is  possible,  i.e.  when  intercepting  with 
the consent of the sender or recipient (Section 44 of the IPA 2016), in case of limited administrative or 
enforcement purposes (Section 45 to 48 of the IPA), in certain special institutions (Sections 49-51 of the 
IPA 2016) and in accordance with overseas requests (Section 52 of the IPA 2016). 
As regards for example the scope of such measures, under Part 3 and Part 4 (retention and acquisition of 
communication data), the scope of the measure is strictly linked to the definition of “telecommunication 
operators” whose users’ data are subject to the measure. Another example can be given in relation to the 
use  of  “bulk”  powers.  In  this  case,  the  scope  of  these  powers  is  limited  to  “communications  sent  or 
received by individuals outside the British Island”.  
Schedule  7  to  the  IPA  2016  determines  the  scope  of  the  Codes,  the  procedure  to  be  followed  when 
issuing them, the rules for the revision of them and the effect of the codes. 
The  codes  of  practice  under 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigatory-powers-act-2016-codes-of-practice 
The  Courts  and  Tribunals  use  the  Codes  of  practice  to  assess  the  lawfulness  of  the  conduct  of  the 
authorities.  See  for  example:  Dias  v  Cleveland  Police,  [2017]  UKIPTrib15_586-CH  ,  where  the 
Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal  made  reference  to  specific  passages  of  the  Code  of  Practice  on 
Communication Data to understand the definition of the ground of “preventing or detecting crime or of 
preventing disorder” used to apply for the acquisition of communication data. The Code was included in 
the reasoning to find whether that ground was used incorrectly. The Court went on to conclude that the 
conducts  contested  were  unlawful.  Courts  have  also  made  evaluation  on  the  level  of  safeguards

previous legislation in the area of surveillance, the RIPA 2000, the Grand Chamber of 
the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  expressly  recognised  the  relevance  of  the  UK 
Codes  of  Practice  and  accepted  that  its  provisions  could  be  taken  into  account  in 
assessing the foreseeability of the legislation permitting the surveillance268.  

(180)  It  should  then  be  noted  that  targeted  powers  (targeted  interception269,  acquisition  of 
communication  data270,  retention  of  communication  data271  and  targeted  equipment 
interference272) are available to national security agencies and certain law enforcement 
authorities273 while only intelligence services may make use of bulk powers (i.e. bulk 
interception274,  bulk  acquisition  of  communications  data275,  bulk  equipment 
interference276 and bulk personal datasets277). 

(181)  In deciding which investigation power should be used, the intelligence agency has to 
comply with the “general duties in relation to privacy” listed in Section 2(2)(a) of the 
IPA  2016,  which  include  a  necessity  and  proportionality  test.  More  specifically, 
pursuant  to  this  provision,  a  public  authority  having  the  intention  to  use  an 
investigatory  power  must  consider  (i)  whether  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved  by  the 
warrant,  authorisation  or  notice  could  reasonably  be  achieved  by  other  less  intrusive 
means; (ii) whether the level of protection to be applied in relation to any obtaining of 
information  by  virtue  of  the  warrant,  authorisation  or  notice  is  higher  because  of  the 
particular  sensitivity  of  that  information;  (iii)  the  public  interest  in  the  integrity  and 
security of telecommunication systems and postal services, and (iv) any other aspects 
of the public interest in the protection of privacy278.

available in the Codes, see for example Just for Law Kids v Secretary of State for the Home Department 
[2019]  EWHC  1772  (Admin)  where  the  High  Court  found  that  primary  and  secondary  legislation 
together  with  the  internal  guidance  provided  sufficient  safeguards;  or  R  (National  Council  for  Civil 
Liberties) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Others [2019] EWHC 2057 (Admin), where 
it  found  that  both  the  IPA  2016  and  Code  of  Practice  on  Equipment  Interference  contained  sufficient 
provisions as to the need for specificity of warrants. 
In the Big Brother Watch case, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights noted that 
“The IC Code is a public document approved by both Houses of Parliament, which is published by the 
Government  online  and  in  print  version,  and  which  has  to  be  taken  into  account  both  by  persons 
exercising interception duties and the courts (see paragraphs 93-94 above). As a consequence, this Court 
has  accepted  that  its  provisions  could  be  taken  into  account  in  assessing  the  foreseeability  of  RIPA 
(see Kennedy,  cited  above, § 157).  Accordingly,  the  Court  would  accept  that  domestic  law  was 
adequately ‘accessible’”.” (see European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber), Big Brother Watch 
and  others  v  United  Kingdom,  Applications  nos.  58170/13,  62322/14  and  24960/15,  of  25  May  2021

Part 5 of the IPA 2016. 

For the list of relevant law enforcement authorities that can apply targeted investigative  powers under 
the IPA 2016, see footnote (139). 
Section 136 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 158 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 176 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 199 of the IPA 2016. 

The  Code  of  Practice  on  Interception  of  Communications  specifies  that  other  elements  of  the 
proportionality test are: “(i) the extent of the proposed interference with privacy against what is sought 
to be achieved; (ii) how and why the methods to be adopted will cause the least possible interference to 
the person and others; (iii) whether the activity is an appropriate use of the Act and a reasonable way, 
having  considered  all  reasonable  alternatives,  of  achieving  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved;  (iv)  what

(182)  The way these criteria should be applied – and the way their compliance is assessed as 
part  of  the  authorisation  of  the  use  of  such  powers  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the 
independent  Judicial  Commissioners  –  is  further  specified  in  the  relevant  Codes  of 
Practice. In particular, the use of any one of these investigative powers must always be 
“proportionate  to  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved  [which]  involves  balancing  the 
seriousness of the intrusion into the privacy (and other considerations set out in section 
2(2)) against the need for the activity in investigative, operational or capability terms”. 
This  means notably that  it “should offer a  realistic prospect  of bringing the expected 
benefit  and  should  not  be  disproportionate  or  arbitrary”  and  “[n]o  interference  with 
privacy  should  be  considered  proportionate  if  the  information  which  is  sought  could 
reasonably  be  obtained  by  other  less  intrusive  means”  279.  More  specifically, 
compliance with the principle of proportionality must be assessed having regard to the 
following  criteria:  “(i)  the  extent  of  the  proposed  interference  with  privacy  against 
what is sought to be achieved; (ii) how and why the methods to be adopted will cause 
the least possible interference to the person and others; (iii) whether the activity is an 
appropriate  use  of  the  Act  and  a  reasonable  way,  having  considered  all  reasonable 
alternatives,  of  achieving  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved;  (iv)  what  other  methods,  as 
appropriate,  were  either  not  implemented  or  have  been  employed  but  which  are 
assessed as insufficient to fulfil operational objectives without the use of the proposed 
investigatory power”280. 

(183)  In  practice,  as  explained  by  the  United  Kingdom  authorities,  this  ensures  that  an 
intelligence  agency,  first,  sets  the  operational  objective  (thus  delimitating  the 
collection, e.g. an international counterterrorism purpose in a specific geographic area) 
and,  second,  on  the  basis  of  that  operational  objective,  will  have  to  consider  which 
technical option (e.g. targeted or bulk interception, equipment interference, acquisition 
of communication data) is the most proportionate (i.e. the least intrusive to privacy cf. 
Section  2(2)  of  the  IPA)  to  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved  and  therefore  can  be 
authorised under one of the available statutory bases.  

(184)  It  is  worth  noting  that  this  reliance  on  standards  of  necessity  and  proportionality  has 
also been noted and welcomed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy, 
Joseph Cannataci, who stated, regarding the system established by the IPA 2016, that 
“[t]he  procedures  in  place  both  within  the  intelligence  services  as  within  the  law 
enforcement  agencies  appear  to  systematically  require  consideration  of  the  necessity 
and  proportionality  of  a  surveillance  measure  or  operation  before  it  is  recommended 
for authorization as well as its review on the same grounds”281. He also observed that 

279 

                                                                                                                                                         
other  methods,  as  appropriate,  were  either  not  implemented  or  have  been  employed  but  which  are 
assessed  as  insufficient  to  fulfil  operational  objectives  without  the  use  of  the  proposed  investigatory 
power”. Code of Practice on Interception of Communications paragraph 4.16, available at the following

in his meeting with representatives of law enforcement and national security agencies 
“[he]  received  a  consensus  view  that  the  right  to  privacy  needs  to  be  a  primary 
consideration  for  any  decision  regarding  surveillance  measures.  All  of  them 
understood and appreciated necessity and proportionality as the cardinal principles to 
be taken into account”. 

(185)  The  specific  criteria  for  issuing  the  different  warrants,  as  well  as  the  limitations  and 
safeguards  established  by  the  IPA  2016  regarding  each  investigatory  power  are 
detailed in recitals (186) to (243). 

3.3.1.1.1 Targeted interception and examination  

(186)  There  are  three  types  of  warrant  for  targeted  interception:  the  targeted  interception 
warrant282,  the  targeted  examination  warrant  and  a  mutual  assistance  warrant283.  The 
conditions  to  obtain  such  warrants  as  well  as  the  relevant  safeguards  are  set  out  in 
Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the IPA 2016.  

(187)  A  targeted  interception  warrant  authorizes  the  interception  of  the  communications 
described  in  the  warrant  in  the  course  of  their  transmission  and  obtaining  other  data 
relevant  for  those  communications284,  including  secondary  data285.  A  targeted 
examination warrant authorises a person to carry out the selection for examination of 
intercepted content obtained under a bulk interception warrant286. 

(188)  Any  warrant  pursuant  to  Part  2  of  the  IPA  2016  may  be  issued  by  the  Secretary  of 
State287 and approved by a Judicial Commissioner288. In all cases the duration of any 
type of targeted warrant is limited to 6 months289 and specific rules apply concerning 
its modification290 and renewal291.

Secondary  data  are  data  attached  or  logically  associated  with  the  intercepted  communication,  can  be 
logically  separated  from  it  and  if  it  were  so  separated,  would  not  reveal  anything  of  what  might 
reasonably  be  considered  to  be  the  meaning  (if  any)  of  the  communication.  Some  examples  of 
secondary data include router configurations or firewalls or the period of time a router has been active 
on a network when they are part of, attached to or logically associated with intercepted communication. 
For more details see the definition in Section 16 of the IPA 2016 and Code of Practice on Interception 
of Communications, paragraph 2.19, see footnote 278.  
This examination is carried out as an exception of section 152(4) of the IPA 2016 which provides for 
the prohibition of seeking to identify communication of individuals which are in the British Islands. See 
recital (229). 
The Scottish Minister authorises the warrant when it relates to serious criminal activity in Scotland (see 
Section 21 and Section 22 of the IPA 2016) while a senior officer can be designated by the Secretary of 
State to issue a mutual assistance warrant when it appears that the interception will concern a person or 
premises located outside the United Kingdom (Section 40 of the IPA 2016).  
Sections 19 and 23 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 32 of the IPA 2016. 

Section  39  of  the  IPA  2016.  Limited  modifications  can  be  made  to  the  warrants  by  prescribed 
persons under the conditions set out in the IPA 2016. The person who issued the warrant can cancel a 
warrant at any time. They must do so if the warrant is no longer necessary on any relevant grounds or 
the conduct authorised by the warrant is no longer proportionate to what is sought to be achieved. 
Section  33  of  the  IPA  2016.  The  decision  to  renew  the  warrant  must  be  approved  by  a  Judicial 
Commissioner.

(189)  Before  issuing  the  warrant,  the  Secretary  of  State  must  carry  out  a  necessity  and 
proportionality  assessment292.  Specifically,  for  a  targeted  interception  warrant  and  a 
targeted  examination  warrant,  the  Secretary  of  State  should  verify  whether  the 
measure  is  necessary  for  one  of  the  following  grounds:  the  interest  of  national 
security;  the  prevention  or  detection  of  a  serious  crime;  or  the  interests  of  the 
economic  well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom293  in  so  far  as  those  interests  are  also 
relevant to the interests of national security294. On the other hand, a mutual assistance 
warrant (see recital (139) above) can be issued only if the Secretary of State considers 
that circumstances exist equivalent to those in which he/she would issue a warrant for 
the purpose of preventing and or detecting serious crime295. 

(190)  Moreover, the Secretary of State should assess whether the measure is proportionate to 
what  is  sought  to  be  achieved296.  The  assessment  on  the  proportionality  of  the 
measures requested must take into account the general duties in relation to privacy set 
out in Section 2(2) of the IPA 2016, notably the need to assess whether what is sought 
to be achieved by the warrant, authorisation or notice could reasonably be achieved by 
other less intrusive means and whether the level of protection to be applied in relation 
to  any  obtaining  of  information  by  virtue  of  the  warrant,  is  higher  because  of  the 
particular sensitivity of that information (see recital (181) above).  

(191)  To this end, the Secretary of State will have to take into account all the elements of the 
application provided by the authority submitting the request, in particular those related 
to the persons to be intercepted and the relevance of the measure for the investigation. 
Such  elements  are  spelled  out  in  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Interception  of 
Communications and must be described at a certain level of specificity297. Moreover, 
Section 17 of the IPA 2016 requires that any warrant issued under its Chapter 2 must 
name or describe the specific person or a group of persons, organisation or premises to 
be  intercepted  (the  “target”).  In  case  of  a  targeted  interception  warrant  or  a  targeted 
examination  warrant,  these  may  also  relate  to  a  group  of  persons,  more  than  one 
person  or  organisation,  or  more  than  one  set  of  premises  (also  so  called  “thematic 
warrant”)298.  In  these  cases,  the  warrant  should  describe  the  common  purpose  or 
activity  shared  by  the  group  of  persons  or  the  operation/investigations  and  name  or 
describe  as  many  of  those  persons/organisations  or  set  of  premises  where  it  is 
reasonably practicable299. Finally, all the warrants issued under Part 2 of the IPA 2016

Section 19 of the IPA 2016. 
On the notion of “interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, so far as those interests 
are  also  relevant  for  national  security”,  the  Grand  Chamber  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights 
found in Big Brother Watch and others v United Kingdom (see footnote 268 above), para. 371, that this 
notion was sufficiently focused on national security. While the Court’s finding in this case was related 
to the use of this notion in the RIPA 2000, the same notion is used in the IPA 2016.

must specify the addresses, numbers, apparatus, factors, or combination of factors that 
are  to  be  used  for  identifying  the  communications300.  In  this  respect,  the  Code  of 
Practice  on  Interception  of  Communications  specifies  that,  in  case  of  a  targeted 
interception  warrant  and  targeted  examination  warrant  “the  warrant  must  specify  (or 
describe) the  factors or  combination of factors that  are to  be used  for identifying the 
communications.  Where  the  communications  are  to  be  identified  by  reference  to  a 
telephone number (for example) the number must be specified by being rendered in its 
entirety. But where very complex or continually-changing internet selectors are to be 
used for identifying the communications, those selectors should be described as far as 
possible”301.  

(192)  An  important  safeguard  in  this  context  is  that  the  assessment  carried  out  by  the 
Secretary  of  State  to  issue  a  warrant  must  be  approved  by  an  independent  Judicial 
Commissioner302  that  will  notably  check  whether  the  decision  to  issue  the  warrant 
complies with the necessity and proportionality principles303 (on the status and role of 
Judicial Commissioners see recitals (251) to (256) below). The IPA 2016 also clarifies 
that,  when  carrying  out  such  check,  the  Judicial  Commissioner  must  apply  the  same 
principles as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review304. This 
ensure  that  in  each  case,  and  before  access  to  data  takes  place,  compliance  with  the 
principle  of  necessity  and  proportionality  is  systematically  check  by  an  independent 
body. 

(193)  The  IPA  2016  provides  for  few  specific  and  narrow  exceptions  to  carry  out  targeted 
interceptions without a warrant. The limited cases are detailed in the law305 and, except 
for  the  one  based  on  the  “consent”  of  the  sender/recipient,  they  are  carried  out  by 
persons (private or public bodies) different than national security agencies. Moreover, 
this  type  of  interceptions  are  carried  out  for  purposes  different  than  “intelligence” 
gathering306 and for some of them it is very unlikely that the collection can take place 
in the context of  a “transfer” scenario (for example in case of interception carried out 
in psychiatric hospital or in prison). Considering the nature of the body to which these 
specific  cases  apply  (different  than  national  security  agencies),  all  the  safeguards 
provided  by  Part  2  of  the  DPA  2018  and  the  UK  GDPR  will  apply,  including  the 
ICO’s  oversight  and  the  available  redress  mechanisms.  Moreover,  in  addition  to  the 
safeguards provided by the DPA 2018, in certain cases, the IPA 2016 also provides for 
the IPCO’s ex post oversight307

The  approval  by  a  Judicial  Commissioner  is  not  required  when  the  Secretary  of  State  considers  that 
there  is  an  urgent  need  to  issue  the  warrant  (Section  19(1)  of  the  IPA).  However,  the  Judicial 
Commissioner needs to be informed in a short period of time and must decide whether to approve or not 
the warrant. If it does not, the warrant ceases to have effect (Sections 24 and 25 of the IPA 2016).

check the conduct of detained person or a patient) or by a postal or a telecommunication operator for 
example to detect abusive content.

(194)  When  interception is  carried out,  additional limitations and safeguards are applicable 
in  light  of  to  the  specific  status  of  the  person(s)  intercepted308.  For  example,  the 
interception  of  items  subject  to  legal  privilege  is  authorised  only  in  presence  of 
exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances,  the  person  issuing  the  warrant  must  give 
regard  to  the  public  interest  in  the  confidentiality  of  items  subject  to  legal  privilege 
and that specific requirements are in place for the handling, retention and disclosure of 
such material309.  

(195)  Furthermore,  the  IPA  2016  provides  for  specific  safeguards  related to  security, 
retention  and  disclosure  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should  take  into  account  before 
issuing a targeted warrant310. In particular, Section 53(5) of the IPA 2016 requires that 
every copy made of any of that material collected under the warrant must be stored in 
a secure manner and is destroyed as soon as there are no longer any relevant grounds 
for  retaining  it,  while  Section  53(2)  of  the  IPA  2016  requires  that  the  number  of 
persons  to  whom  the  material  is  disclosed  and  the  extent  to  which  any  material  is 
disclosed, made available or copied must be limited to the minimum that is necessary 
for the statutory purposes.  

(196)  Finally,  when  the  material  that  has  been  intercepted  either  by  a  targeted  interception 
warrant  or  by  a  mutual  assistance  warrant  is  to  be  handed  over  to  a  third  country 
(“overseas  disclosures”),  the  IPA  2016  provides  that  the  Secretary  of  State  must 
ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that similar safeguards on 
security,  retention  and  disclosure  exist  in  that  third  country311.  In  addition,  Section 
109(2) of the DPA 2018 provides that intelligence services may only transfer personal 
data  outside  of  the  United  Kingdom  territory  if  the  transfer  is  a  necessary  and 
proportionate  measure  carried  out  for  the  purposes  of  the  controller’s  statutory 
functions or for other purposes provided for in Section 2(2)(a) of the Security Service 
Act  1989  or  Sections  2(2)(a)  and  4(2)(a)of  the  Intelligence  Services  Act  1994312. 
Importantly,  these  requirements  also  apply  in  cases  where  the  national  security 
exemption pursuant to Section 110 of the DPA 2018 is invoked, as Section 110 of the 
DPA 2018 does not list Section 109 of the DPA 2018 as one of the provisions that can 
be  disapplied  if  an  exemption  from  certain  provisions  is  required  for  the  purpose  of 
safeguarding national security.

Member  of  Parliament  (any  Parliament  of  the  United  Kingdom), the  interception  of  items  subject  to 
legal  privilege,  the  interception  of  communications  which  the  intercepting  authority  believes  will  be 
communications containing confidential journalistic material, and when the purpose of the warrant is to 
identify or confirm a source of journalistic information.

(197)  The IPA 2016 permits the Secretary of State to require telecommunications operators 
to retain communications data for the purpose of targeted access by a range of public 
authorities,  including  law  enforcement  and  intelligence  agencies.  Part  4  of  the  IPA 
2016  provides  for  the  retention  of  communications  data,  while  Part  3  provides  for 
targeted acquisition of communications data (TCD). Part 3 and Part 4 of the IPA 2016 
also  set  out  specific  limitations  on  the  use  of  these  powers  and  provide  for  specific 
safeguards. 

(198)  The term “communications data” covers the “who”, “when”, “where” and “how” of a 
communication,  but  not  the  content,  i.e.  what  was  said  or  written.  Different  from 
interception,  the  acquisition  and  retention  of  communications  data  is  not  aimed  at 
obtaining the content of the communication, but aimed at obtaining information such 
as the subscriber to a telephone service or an itemised bill. This could include the time 
and  duration  of  communication,  the  number  or  email  address  of  the  originator  and 
recipient and sometimes the location of the devices from which the telecommunication 
was made313. 

(199)  It should be noted that the retention and acquisition of communications data normally 
will not concern personal  data of EU data subjects  transferred under this Decision to 
the  United  Kingdom.  The  obligation  to  retain  or  disclose  communications  data 
pursuant  to  Part  3  and  4  of  the  IPA  2016  covers  data  that  is  collected  by 
telecommunication operators in the UK directly from the users of a telecommunication 
service314.  This  type  of  “customer  facing”  processing  typically  does  not  involve  a 
transfer on the basis of this Decision, i.e. a transfer from a controller/processor in the 
EU to a controller/processor in the United Kingdom.  

(200)  However, for the sake of completeness, the conditions and safeguards governing these 

acquisition and retention regimes are analysed in the following recitals. 

(201)  As  a  premise,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  retention  and  the  targeted  acquisition  of 
communications data is available both to national security agencies and to certain law 

                                                 
313

 

314 

Communications  data  is  defined  in  Section  261(5)  to  the  IPA  2016.  Communications  data  is  divided 
into  “events  data”  (any  data  which  identifies  or  describes an  event,  whether  or  not  by  reference  to  its 
location, in or by means of a telecommunication system where the event consists of one or more entities 
engaging in a  specific activity at a specific time) and “entity data” (any data  which (a) is about (i) an 
entity,  (ii)  an  association  between  a  telecommunications  service  and  an  entity,  or  (iii)  an  association 
between any part of a telecommunication system and an entity, (b) consists of, or includes, data which 
identifies  or  describes  the  entity  (whether  or  not  by  reference  to  the  entity's  location),  and  (c)  is  not 
events data). 
This follows from the definition of communications data provided in Section 261(5) of the IPA 2016, 
according to  which communications data is held or obtained by a telecommunications  operator and  is 
either about the user of a telecommunications service and relating to the provision of this service, or is 
comprised  in,  included  as  part  of,  attached  to  or  logically  associated  with  a  communication  (see  also 
Code 
link 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7578
50/Communications_Data_Code_of_Practice.pdf, paragraphs 2.22 to 2.33). Moreover, the definition of 
telecommunications  operator  provided  in  Section  261(10)  of  the  IPA  2016  requires  that  a 
telecommunications  operator  is  a  person  who  offers  or  provides  a  telecommunications  service  to 
persons in the UK or who controls or provides a telecommunication system which is (wholly or partly) 
in or controlled from the UK. These definitions make clear that obligations under the IPA 2016 cannot 
be imposed on telecommunications operators whose equipment is not in or controlled from the UK and 
who  do  not  offer  or  provide  services  to  persons  in  the  UK  (see  also  Code  of  Practice  on 
Communications  Data,  paragraph  2.1).  If  EU  subscribers  (whether  located  in  the  EU  or  in  the  UK) 
made use of services in the UK, any communications in relation to the provision of this service would 
be collected directly by the service provider in the UK rather than subject to a transfer from the EU.

enforcement  authorities315.  The  conditions  to  require  the  retention  and/or  acquisition 
of  communications  data  may  vary  depending  on  the  ground  for  requesting  the 
measure, namely a national security or a law enforcement purpose.   

 In  particular,  while  the  new  regime  has  introduced  the  general  requirement  of  an  ex 
ante  authorization  by  an  independent  body  that  will  apply  in  all  cases  when 
communication data is retained and/or acquired (either for a law enforcement or for a 
national  security  purpose),  following  the  Tele2/Watson  judgment  of  the  European 
Court  of  Justice316,  specific  safeguards  have  been  introduced  when  the  measure  is 
requested  for  law  enforcement  purposes.  In  particular,  when  the  retention  or  the 
acquisition of communication data is requested for a law enforcement purpose, the ex 
ante  authorisation  must  always  be  given  by  the  Investigatory  Power  Commissioner. 
This  is  not  always  the  case  when  the  measure  is  requested  for  a  national  security 
purpose,  since,  as  described  below,  in  certain  cases  such  type  of  measures  may  be 
authorised by different “authorising individual”. Moreover, the new regime has raised 
to  “serious  crimes”  the  threshold  for  which  the  retention  and  the  acquisition  of 
communication data can be permitted317.  

(i) 

Authorisation for obtaining communications data 

(203)  According  to  Part  3  of  the  IPA  2016,  relevant  public  authorities  are  authorised  to 
obtain communications data from a telecommunication operator or any person capable 
of  obtaining  and  disclosing  such  data.  The  authorisation  may  not  allow  the 
interception of the content of the communications318 and ceases to have effect after a 
period  of  one  month319  with  the  possibility  to  be  renewed  subject  to  an  additional 
authorisation320. The acquisition of communications data requires an authorisation by 
the Investigatory Powers Commissioner (IPC)321 (on the status and powers of the IPC 
see  recitals  (250)  to  (251)  below).  This  is  always  the  case  when  the  acquisition  of 
communication  data  is  requested  by  a  relevant  law  enforcement  authority.  However, 
according  to  Section  61  of  the  IPA  2016,  when  data  is  acquired  for  the  interests  of 
national  security  or  economic  well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom  as  long  as  it  is 
relevant  for  national  security,  or  where  an  application  is  made  by  a  member  of  an 
intelligence  agency  under  Section  61(7)(b)322,  the  acquisition  may  be  alternatively323

The relevant authorities are listed in the Schedule 4 to the IPA 2016 and they include the police forces, 
intelligence  services,  some  ministries  and  government  departments,  the  National  Crime  Agency,  Her 
Majesty’s  Revenue  and  Customs,  Competition  and  Markets  Authority,  Information  Commissioner, 
ambulance, fire and rescue services and authorities for example in the area of health and food safety.  
Joined Cases C-203/15 and C-698/15, Tele2/Watson, ECLI:EU:C:2016:970). 
See section 61.7(b) for the acquisition of communication data and section 87.10A for the retention of 
communication data.  
Section 60A(6) of the IPA 2016.  
This  period  is  reduced  to  three  days  when  the  authorization  is  given  for  reasons  of  urgency  (Section 
65(3)A of the IPA 2016). 
According to Section 65 of the IPA 2016, the renewed authorisation will last for a period of one month 
from the date the current authorisation expires. The person who has granted the authorisation can cancel 
the authorisation at any time if it considers that the requirements are not anymore satisfied.  
Section  60A  (1)  of  the  IPA  2016.  The  Office  for  Communications  Data  Authorisations  (OCDA) 
performs this function on behalf of the IPC (see Communication Data Codes of Practice, para. 5.6) 
The  application  under  Section  61(7)(b)  of  the  IPA  2016  is  made  for  “an  applicable  crime  purpose” 
meaning, according to Section 61(7)A of the IPA 2016: “where the communications data is  wholly or 
partly events data, the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime; in  any other case, the purpose 
of preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder”.

authorised by the IPC or by a designated senior officer324. The designated officer must 
be  independent  from  the  investigation  or  operation  concerned  and  have  working 
knowledge  of  human  rights  principles  and  legislation,  specifically  those  of  necessity 
and proportionality325. The decision taken by the designated officer will be subject to 
the ex-post oversight carried out by the IPC (see recital (254) below for more details 
on ex-post oversight functions of the IPC).  

(204)  The  authorisation  to  acquire  communication  data  is  based  on  an  assessment  of 
necessity  and  proportionality  of  the  measure.  More  specifically,  the  necessity  of  the 
measure is assessed in light of the grounds listed in the legislation326. Considering the 
targeted nature of this measure, it must also be necessary for a specific investigation or 
operation327. Further requirements on the assessment of the necessity of the measures 
are laid out in the Code of Practice on Communication Data328. In particular, this Code 
provides  that  the  application  submitted  by  the  requesting  authority  should  identify 
three  minimum  elements  to  justify  the  necessity  of  such  request:  (i)  the  event  under 
investigation such as a crime or location of vulnerable missing person; (ii) the person 
whose data is sought, such as a suspect, witness or missing person, and how they are 
linked  to  the  event;  and  (iii)  the  communications  data  sought,  such  as  a  telephone 
number or IP address, and how this data is related to the person and the event329.  

(205)  Moreover  the  acquisition  of  communication  data  has  to  be  proportionate  to  what  is 
sought to be achieved330. The Code of Practice on Communication Data clarifies that, 
in conducting such assessment, the authorising individual should carry out a balancing 
exercise  between  “the  extent  of  the  interference  with  an  individual’s  rights  and 
freedoms against a specific benefit to the investigation or operation being undertaken 
by a relevant public authority in the public interest” and that taking into account all the 
considerations  of  a  particular  case,  “an  interference  with  the  rights  of  an  individual 
may still not be justified because the adverse impact on the rights of another individual

323
The Code of Practice on Communication Data specifies that “Where an application relating to national 
security could be made under either section 60A or section 61, the decision on which authorisation route 
is most appropriate in any given case is a matter for individual public authorities. Public authorities who 
wish  to  use  the  designated  senior  officer  route  should  have  clear  guidelines  in  place  on  when  this 
authorisation  route  is  appropriate”  (Code  of  Practice  on  Communication  Data,  paragraph  5.  19, 
available 
link: 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/82281
7/Communications_Data_Code_of_Practice.pdf ). 
Section 70(3) of the IPA 2016 provides the definition of a “designated officer” which varies depending 
on the relevant public authority (as set out in Schedule 4 of the IPA 2016)... 
Further details on the independence of the designated senior officer are provided in the Communication 
Data Code of practice (Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraphs 4.12-4.17, see footnote 
323). 
The  grounds  are:  (i)  national  security;  (ii)  preventing  or  detecting  crime  or  of  preventing  disorder  (in 
case of “events data” only serious crime); (iii) in the interests of the economic well-being of the United 
Kingdom  so  far  as  those  interests  are  also  relevant  to  the  interests  of  national  security;  (iv)  in  the 
interests of public safety; (v) for the purpose of preventing death or injury or any damage to a person’s 
physical or mental health, or of mitigating any injury or damage to a person’s physical or mental health; 
(vi)  to  assist  investigations  into  alleged  miscarriages  of  justice  or  (vii)  to  identify  a  dead  person  or 
person unable to identify themselves because of a certain condition (Section 61(7) of the IPA 2016).

or  group  of  individuals  is  too  severe”.  Moreover,  in  order  to  specifically  assess  the 
proportionality  of  the  measure,  the  Code  lists  a  number  of  elements  that  should  be 
included  in  the  application  submitted  by  the  requesting  authority331.  Furthermore, 
particular consideration must be given to the type of communication data (“entity” or 
“events”  data332)  to  be  acquired,  and  preference  must  be  given  to  the  use  of  less 
intrusive  category  of  data333.  The  Code  of  Practice  on  Communication  Data  also 
contains specific instructions for authorisations involving the communications data of 
people  in  particular  professions  (such  as  medical  doctors,  lawyers,  journalists, 
parliamentarians,  or  ministers  of  religion)334  which  are  subject  to  additional 
safeguards335. 

(ii)   Notice requiring the retention of communication data 

(206)  Part 4 of the IPA 2016 sets out the rules on retention of communications data, and in 
particular the criteria allowing the Secretary of State to issue a retention notice336. The 
safeguards introduced by  the  IPA  are the same  when the data is  retained either  for a 
law enforcement purpose or in the interest of national security.  

(207)  The  issuance  of  such  retention  notices  aims  at  securing  that  telecommunication 
operators  retain,  for  a  maximum  period  of  12  months,  relevant  communications  data 
that would otherwise be deleted once no longer required for business purpose337. The 
data retained are to remain available for the period required should it subsequently be 
necessary  for  a  public  authority  to  acquire  it  under  an  authorisation  for  a  targeted 
acquisition of communication data provided by Part 3 of the IPA 2016 and described 
in recitals (203) to (205). 

(208)  The exercise of the power to require the retention of certain data is subject to a number 
of limitations and safeguards. The Secretary of State can issue a retention notice to one 

                                                 
331 

This information to be included must contain: (i) an outline of how obtaining the data will benefit the 
investigation or operation; (ii) an explanation of the relevance of time periods requested, including  how 
these periods are proportionate to the event under investigation; (iii) an explanation of how the level of 
intrusion  is  justified  when  taking  into  consideration  the  benefit  the  data  will  give  to  the  investigation 
(this  justification  should  include  consideration  of  whether  less  intrusive  investigations  could  be 
undertaken  to  achieve  the  objective);  (iv)  a  consideration  of  the  rights  (particularly  to  privacy  and,  in 
relevant  cases,  freedom  of  expression)  of  the  individual  and  a  balancing  of  these  rights  against  the 
benefit to the investigation; (v) details of what collateral intrusion may occur and how the time periods 
requested  impact  on  the  collateral  intrusion  (Code  of  Practice  on  Communications  Data,  paragraph 
3.22-3.26, see footnote 323). 
See footnote 313. 

When more intrusive communication data are sought (i.e. events data) the Code specifies that it is more 
appropriate  to  acquire  first  entity  data  or  to  acquire  directly  events  data  in  limited  cases  of  specific 
urgency (Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraph 6.10-6.14, see footnote 323). 
Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraph 8.8-8.44, see footnote 323. 

The  Code  of  Practice  specifies  that  “particular  care  must  be  taken  by  an  authorising  individual  when 
considering such applications, including additional consideration of whether there might be unintended 
consequences  of  such  applications  and  whether  the  public  interest  is  best  served  by  the  application” 
(Code of Practice on communications data, paragraph 8.8). Furthermore, records must be kept for this 
type  of  applications  and  at  the  next  inspection,  such  applications  should  be  marked  for  the  IPC’s 
attention (Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraph 8.10, see footnote 323). 
Sections 87 to 89 of the IPA 2016. 

Under Section 90 of the IPA  2016, a telecommunication operator to whom a retention  notice is  given 
may ask for a review from the Secretary of State that has issued it.

or several operators338 only when he/she considers that the requirement to retain data is 
necessary for one of the statutory purposes339 and is proportionate to what is sought to 
be achieved340. As clarified by the IPA 2016 itself341, before issuing a retention notice, 
the  Secretary  of  State  must  take  into  account:  the  likely  benefits  of  the  notice342;  a 
description  of  the  telecommunications  services;  the  appropriateness  of  limiting  the 
data  to  be  retained  by  reference  to  location,  or  descriptions  of  persons  to  whom 
telecommunications services are provided343; the likely number of users (if known) of 
any telecommunications service to which the notice relates344; the technical feasibility 
of  complying  with  the  notice;  the  likely  cost  of  complying  with  the  notice,  and  any 
other  effect  of  the  notice  on  the  telecommunications  operator  (or  description  of 
operators)  to  whom  it  relates345.  As  further  detailed  in  Chapter  17  of  the  Code  of 
Practice on Communications Data, all retention notices need to specify each data type 
that needs to be retained and how that data type meets the necessary tests for retention. 

(209)  In all cases (for both national security and law enforcement purposes) the decision of 
the Secretary of State to issue the retention notice must be approved by an independent 
Judicial Commissioner under the so-called “double-lock procedure”, who must review 
in  particular  whether  the  notice  to  retain  relevant  communications  data  is  necessary 
and proportionate for one or more of the statutory purposes346.

Pursuant to Section 87(2)(a) of the IPA 2016 a retention notice may relate “to a particular operator or 
any description of operators”. 
The  purposes  are  (i)  the  interests  of  national  security;  (ii)  the  applicable  crime  purpose  (as  defined  in 
section 87.10A of the IPA 2016); (iii) the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom 
in  so  far  as  those  interests  are  also  relevant  to  the  interests  of  national  security;  (iv)  the  interests  of 
public  safety;  (v)  the  purpose  of  preventing  death  or  injury  or  any  damage  to  a  person’s  physical  or 
mental health, or of mitigating any injury or damage to a person’s physical or mental health; or (vi) to 
assist investigations into alleged miscarriages of justice (Section 87 of the IPA). 
Section 87 of the IPA 2016. Moreover, according to the relevant Code of Practice, in order to assess the 
proportionality  of  the  retention  notice,  the  criteria  provided  by  Section  2(2)  of  the  IPA  2016  apply, 
notably the requirement to assess whether what is sought to be achieved by the notice, could reasonably 
be achieved by less intrusive means. Similarly to the assessment of proportionality on the acquisition of 
communication  data,  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Communications  Data  clarifies  that  such  assessment 
involves the “balancing between the extent of the interference with an individual’s right to respect for 
their  private  life  against  a  specific  benefit  to  the  investigation  (Code  of  Practice  on  Communications 
Data, paragraph 16.3, see footnote 323). 
See section 88 of the IPA 2016. 
The benefits may be existing or projected and must be in respect of the statutory purposes for which the 
data can be retained (Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraph 17.17, see footnote 323). 
These  considerations  will  include  determining  whether  the  full  geographical  reach  of  the  retention 
notice  is  necessary  and  proportionate  and  whether  it  is  necessary  and  proportionate  to  include  or 
exclude  any  particular  descriptions  of  persons  (Code  of  Practice  on  Communications  Data,  paragraph 
17.17, see footnote 323). 
This  will  help  the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider  both  the  level  of  intrusion  on  customers  but  also  the 
likely benefits of the data to be retained (Code of Practice on Communications Data, paragraph 17.17, 
see footnote 323).

(210)  Equipment  interference  is  a  set  of  techniques  used  to  obtain  a  variety  of  data  from 
equipment347,  which  includes  computers,  tablets  and  smart  phones  as  well  as  cables, 
wires and storage devices348. Equipment interference allows to obtain both the content 
of communications and equipment data349.  

(211)  In accordance with Section 13(1) of the IPA 2016, the use of equipment  interference 
by  an  intelligence  service  requires  an  authorisation  by  means  of  a  warrant  under  the 
“double lock” procedure established by the IPA 2016, provided that there is “a British 
Islands  connection”350.  According  to  the  explanations  provided  by  the  United 
Kingdom authorities, in situations where data is transferred from the European Union 
to  the  United  Kingdom  within  the  scope  of  this  Decision,  there  would  always  be  a 
“British Islands connection” and any equipment interference covering such data would 
therefore be subject to the mandatory warrant requirement of Section 13(1) of the IPA 
2016351. 

(212)  The rules on targeted equipment interference warrants are set out in Part 5 of the IPA 
2016. Similarly to targeted interception, targeted equipment interference has to relate 
to a specific “target”, which has to be set out in the  warrant352. The details on how a

Interference, 

on  Equipment 

Pursuant to Sections 135(1) and 198(1) of the IPA 2016, “equipment” comprises equipment producing 
electromagnetic, acoustic or other emissions and any device capable of being used in connection  with 
such equipment. 
Code 
link: 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/71547
9/Equipment_Interference_Code_of_Practice.pdf , paragraph 2.2. 
Equipment  data  is  defined  in  Section  100  of  the  IPA  2016  as  system  data  and  data  which  is  (a) 
comprised in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with a communication (whether by 
the  sender  or  otherwise)  or  any  other  item  of  information;  (b)  is  capable  of  being  logically  separated 
from  the  remainder  of  the  communication  or  the  item  of  information,  and  (c)  if  it  were  so  separated, 
would  not  reveal  anything  of  what  might  reasonably  be  considered  to  be  the  meaning  (if  any)  of  the 
communication or the item of information.  
For  the  warrant  requirement  to  be  mandatory,  Section  13(1)  of  the  IPA  2016  also  requires  that  the 
conduct of the intelligence service would constitute one or more offences under Sections 1 to 3A of the 
Computer Misuse Act 1990, which would be the case in the vast majority of circumstances, see Code of 
Practice  on  Equipment  Interference,  paragraphs  3.32  and 3.6  to 3.9).  Pursuant  to  Section  13(2) of  the 
IPA  2016,  there  is  a  “British  Islands  connection”  if  (a)  any  of  the  conduct  would  take  place  in  the 
British  Islands  (regardless  of  the  location  of  the  equipment  which  would,  or  may,  be  interfered  with), 
(b) the intelligence service believes that any of the equipment which would, or may, be interfered with 
would,  or  may,  be  in  the  British  Islands  at  some  time  while  the  interference  is  taking  place,  or  (c)  a 
purpose of the interference is to obtain (i) communications sent by, or to, a person who is, or whom the 
intelligence  service  believes  to  be,  for  the  time  being  in  the  British  Islands,  (ii)  private  information 
relating to an individual who is, or whom the intelligence service believes to be, for the time being in 
the British Islands, or (iii) equipment data which forms part of, or is connected with, communications or 
private information falling within subparagraph (i) or (ii). 
For reasons of completeness it should be noted that even in situations where there is no “British Islands 
connection”  and  the  use  of  equipment  interference  is  therefore  not  subject  to  the  mandatory  warrant 
requirement of Section 13(1) of the IPA 2016, an intelligence service that plans to engage in activity for 
which it is able to obtain a bulk equipment interference warrant should obtain such warrant as a matter 
of policy (see Code of Practice on Equipment Interference, paragraph 3.24). Even where an equipment 
interference warrant under the IPA 2016 is neither legally required nor obtained as a matter of policy, 
actions of the intelligence services are subject to a number of conditions and limitations under Section 7 
of the Intelligence Services Act 1994. This includes notably the requirement of an authorisation by the 
Secretary of State, who must be satisfied that any action does not go beyond what is necessary for the 
proper discharge of the functions of the Intelligence Service.  
Section 115 of the IPA 2016 regulates the content of the warrant, specifying that it needs to include the 
name or description of persons, organisations, location or group of persons that constitute the “target”, a 

 

348

“target”  must  be  identified  depend  on  the  matter  and  the  type  of  equipment  to  be 
interfered. In particular Section 115(3) of the IPA specifies the elements that should be 
included  in  the  warrant  (e.g.  name  of  the  person  or  organisation,  description  of  the 
location), depending for  example on whether the  interference  concerns an equipment 
that belongs, is used to or is in possession of a particular person or an organisation or a 
group  of  person,  is  in  a  specific  location  etc.353.  The  purposes  for  which  targeted 
equipment  interference  warrants  can  be  issued  depends  on  the  public  authority 
applying for it354.  

(213)  Similarly to targeted interception, the issuing authority needs to consider whether the 
measure is  necessary to  achieve a specific purpose and whether it is  proportionate to 
what is sought to be achieved355. Moreover, it should also consider whether safeguards 
exist in relation to security, retention and disclosure as well as in relation to “overseas 
disclosure”356 (see recital (196)).  

(214)  The  warrant  has  to  be  approved  by  a  Judicial  Commissioner,  except  in  cases  of 
urgency357.  In  the  latter  case,  a  Judicial  Commissioner  has  to  be  informed  that  a 
warrant  has  been  issued  and  must  approve  it  within  three  working  days.  In  case  the 
Judicial Commissioner refuses to approve it, the warrant ceases to have affect and may 
not be renewed358. Moreover, the Judicial Commissioner has the power to require that 
any data that was obtained under the warrant is deleted359. The fact that a warrant was 
issued  urgently  does  not  impact  ex  post  oversight  (see  recitals  (244)  to  (255))  or  the 
possibilities  for  individuals  to  seek  redress  (see  recitals  (260)  to  (270)).  Individuals 
can  complain  to  the  ICO  or  make  a  claim  regarding  any  alleged  conduct  to  the 
Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal  in  the  usual  way.  In  all  cases,  the  test  applied  by  the 
Judicial  Commissioner  when  deciding  whether  or  not  to  approve  a  warrant  is  the

description of the nature of the investigation and a description of the activities for which the equipment 
is  used.  It  must  also  describe  the  type  of  equipment  and  the  conduct  which  the  person  to  whom  the 
warrant is addressed is authorised to take.  
See also the Code of Practice on Equipment Interference, paragraph 5.7, see footnote 348. 
National security agencies can apply for an equipment interference warrant when necessary for national 
security  purposes,  for  the  purpose  of  detecting  serious  crime  and/or  in  the  interests  of  the  economic 
well-being  of  the  United  Kingdom  in  so  far  as  those  interests  are  also  relevant  for  the  interests  of 
national  security  (Section  102-103  of  the  IPA  2016).  Depending  on  the  agency,  an  equipment 
interference warrant may be requested for a law enforcement purpose when it is necessary for detecting 
or  preventing  a  serious  crime  or  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  death  or  any  injury  or  damage  to  a 
person's physical or mental health or of mitigating any injury or damage to a person's physical or mental 
health (see Section 106(1) and 106(3) of the IPA 2016).

Section 109 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 109(4) of the IPA 2016. 
Section  110(3)(b)  of  the  IPA  2016.  Pursuant  to  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Equipment  Interference, 
paragraph  5.67,  urgency  is  determined  by  whether  it  would  be  reasonably  practicable  to  seek  the 
Judicial  Commissioner’s  approval  to  issue  the  warrant  in  the  time  available  to  meet  an  operational  or 
investigative  need.  Urgent  warrants  should  fall  into  one  or  both  of  the  following  categories:  (i) 
imminent  threat  to  life  or  serious  harm  -  for  example,  if  an  individual  has  been  kidnapped  and  it  is 
assessed  that  their  life  is  in  imminent  danger;  or  (ii)  an  intelligence-gathering  or  investigative 
opportunity with limited time to act - for example, a consignment of Class A drugs is about to enter the 
UK and law enforcement agencies want to have coverage of the perpetrators of serious crime in order to 
effect arrests. See footnote 348.

necessity and proportionality test as applicable to requests for targeted interception360 
(see recital (192) above).  

(215)  Finally, specific safeguards applicable to targeted interception apply also to equipment 
interference as regards the duration, renewal, and modification of the warrant as well 
as the interception of Members of Parliament, of items subject to legal privilege and of 
journalistic material (see further details in recital (193)).  

3.3.1.1.4 Exercise of bulk powers 

(216)  Bulk powers are regulated in Part 6 of the IPA 2016. Moreover, the Codes of practice 
provide  for  more  details  on  the  use  of  bulk  powers.  While  there  is  no  definition  in 
United  Kingdom  law  of  ‘bulk  power’,  in  the  context  of  the  IPA  2016  it  has  been 
described  as  the  collection  and  retention  of  large  quantities  of  data  acquired  by  the 
Government  through  various  means  (i.e.  the  powers  of  bulk  interception,  bulk 
acquisition,  bulk  equipment  interference  and  bulk  personal  datasets)  and  which  can 
subsequently be accessed by the authorities. This description is clarified by contrasting 
it  to  what  ‘bulk  power’  is  not:  it  does  not  equate  to  so-called  “mass  surveillance” 
without limitations or safeguards. On the contrary, as explained below, it incorporates 
limitations  and  safeguards  designed  to  ensure  that  access  to  data  is  not  given  on  an 
indiscriminate or unjustified basis361. In particular, bulk powers can only be used if a 
link  is  established  between  the  technical  measure  that  a  national  intelligence  agency 
intends to use and the operational objective for which such measure is requested. 

(217)  Moreover,  bulk  powers  are  available  to  intelligence  agencies  only  and  are  always 
subject  to  a  warrant  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  approved  by  a  Judicial 
Commissioner. In choosing the means to collect intelligence, regards must be given to 
whether  the  objective  in  question  can  be  sought  by  “less  intrusive  means”362.  This 
approach follows from the framework of the legislation which is built on the principle 
of proportionality and therefore prioritises targeted over bulk collection. 

3.3.1.1.4.1 Bulk interception and bulk equipment interference 

(218)  The  regime  for  bulk  interception  is  provided  in  Chapter  1  of  Part  6  of  the  IPA  2016 
while Chapter 3 of the same Part regulates bulk equipment interference. These regimes 
are  substantially  the  same,  so  the  conditions  and  additional  safeguards  applicable  to 
those warrants are analysed together.

Section 108 of the IPA 2016. 
According to the Report on bulk powers presented by Lord David Anderson, independent reviewer of 
terrorism legislation ahead of the approval of the IPA 2016, “it should be plain that the collection and 
retention of data in bulk does not equate to so-called “mass surveillance”. Any legal system worth the 
name will incorporate limitations and safeguards designed precisely to ensure that access to stores of 
sensitive  data  (…)  is  not  given  on  an  indiscriminate  or  unjustified  basis.  Such  limitations  and 
safeguards certainly exist in the Bill. Lord David Anderson, Report of the bulk power review, August

(219)  A  bulk  interception  warrant  is  limited  to  the  interception  of  communications  in  the 
course of their transmission sent or received by individuals who are outside the British 
Islands363,  so-called  “overseas-related  communications”364
  ,  as  well  as  other  relevant 
data  and  the  subsequent  selection  for  examination  of  the  intercepted  material365.  A 
bulk equipment interference warrant366 authorises the addressee to secure interference 
with  any  equipment  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  overseas-related  communications 
(including  anything  comprising  speech,  music,  sounds,  visual  images  or  data  of  any 
description), equipment data (data that enables or facilitates a functioning of a postal 
service;  a  telecommunication  system;  telecommunications  service)  or  any  other 
information367. 

(220)  The Secretary of State can issue a bulk warrant only on an application made by a head 
of  an  intelligence  service368.  A  warrant  authorising  a  bulk  interception  or  a  bulk 
equipment  interference  must  be  issued  only  if  necessary  for  the  interest  of  national 
security  and  for  a  further  purpose  of  preventing  or  detecting  serious  crime,  or  the 
interest of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom when relevant for national 
security369. Moreover, Section 142(7) of the IPA 2016 requires that a bulk interception 
warrant  must  be  specified  in  a  greater  detailed  than  the  simple  reference  to  the 
“interests  of  national  security”,  the  “economic  wellbeing  of  the  UK”  and  of 
“preventing and combating serious crime” but a link must be established between the 
measure to be sought and one or more operational purpose/s that must be included in 
the warrant.  

(221)  The  choice  of  the  operational  purpose  is  a  result  of  a  multi-layer  process.  Section 
142(4)  provides  that  the  operational  purposes  specified  in  the  warrant  must  be

The “British Islands” constitute the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and are 
defined 
link 
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30/schedule/1. 
According  to  Section  136  of  the  IPA  2016,  “overseas-related  communications”  means:  (i) 
communications  sent  by  individuals  who  are  outside  the  British  Islands,  or  (ii)  communications 
received  by  individuals  who  are  outside  the  British  Islands.  This  regime,  as  confirmed  by  the  UK 
authorities, also covers communications between two persons that are both outside the British Islands. 
The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in Big Brother Watch and others v United 
Kingdom  (see  footnote  279  above),  para.  376,  found,  with  respect  to  a  similar  limitation  (referring  to 
“external communications”) of the communications that can be captured by bulk interception under the 
RIPA 2000, that it was sufficiently delimited and foreseeable. 
Section 136(4) of the IPA 2016. According to the explanations received from the UK government, bulk 
interception can be used, for example, to identify previously unknown threats to the national security of 
the  UK,  by  filtering  and  analysing  intercepted  material  in  order  to  identify  communications  of 
intelligence  value  (The  UK  Explanatory  Framework  section  H:  National  security,  p.  27  –  28,  see 
footnote  29).  As  explained  by  the  UK  authorities,  such  instruments  can  be  used  to  establish  links 
between known subjects of interest as well as to search for traces of activity by individuals who may not 
yet be known but who surface in the course of an investigation, and to identify patterns of activity that 
may indicate a threat to the United Kingdom. 
In accordance with Section 13(1) of the IPA 2016, the use of equipment interference by an intelligence 
service requires an authorisation by  means of a  warrant  under the IPA 2016, provided that there is  “a 
British Islands connection”, see recital (211). 
Section  176  of  the  IPA  2016.  A  bulk  equipment  interference  warrant  may  not  authorise  a  conduct, 
which would (unless done with lawful authority) constitute unlawful interception (except in relation to a 
stored communication). According to the UK Explanatory Framework, the information obtained could 
be necessary  for the  identification of subjects of interest and  would be usually appropriate large-scale 
operations (The UK Explanatory Framework, section H: National security p. 28, see footnote 29).

specified  in  a  list  maintained  by  the  heads  of  the  intelligence  services,  as  purposes 
which  they  consider  are  operational  purposes  for  which  intercepted  content  or 
secondary  data  obtained  under  bulk  interception  warrants  may  be  selected  for 
examination.  The  list  of  operational  purposes  must  be  approved  by  the  Secretary  of 
State.  The  Secretary  of  State  may  give  such  approval  only  if  satisfied  that  the 
operational purpose is specified in a greater level of detail than the general grounds for 
authorising the warrant (national security or national security and economic well-being 
or  preventing  serious  crime)370.  At  the  end  of  each  relevant  three-month  period,  the 
Secretary  of  State  must  give  a  copy  of  the  list  of  operational  purposes  to  the 
Parliamentary  ISC.  Finally,  the  Prime  Minister  must  review  the  list  of  operational 
purposes  at  least  once  a  year371.  As  noted  by  the  High  Court,  “[t]hese  are  not  to  be 
belittled as insignificant safeguards, as they build together an intricate set of modes of 
accountability, which involve Parliament as well as members of the government at the 
highest level”372. 

(222)  Such  operational  purposes  also  limit  the  scope  of  the  selection  of  the  interception 
material  for  the  examination  stage.  The  selection  for  examination  of  any  material 
collected under the bulk warrant must be justified in light of the operational purpose/s. 
As  explained  by  the  United  Kingdom  authorities,  this  means  that  practical 
arrangements on examination must be assessed by the Secretary of State already at the 
stage  of  the  warrant,  providing  sufficient  details  to  fulfil  the  statutory  duties  under 
section 152 and 193 of the IPA 2016373. The details given to the Secretary of State in 
relation  to  those  arrangements  would  need  to  include  for  example,  information  (if 
applicable)  on  how  filtering  arrangements  might  vary  during  the  time  that  a  warrant 
will have effect374. For more details  on the process and the safeguards  applied to  the 
filtering and examination phases, see recital (229) below. 

(223)  A  bulk  power  can  be  authorised  only  if  it  is  proportionate  to  what  is  sought  to  be 
achieved375.  As  specified  in  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Interception,  any  assessment  of 
proportionality  involves  “balancing  the  seriousness  of  the  intrusion  into  the  privacy 
(and  other  considerations  set  out  in  section  2(2))  against  the  need  for  the  activity  in 
investigative,  operational  or  capability  terms.  The  conduct  authorised  should  offer  a 
realistic prospect of bringing the expected benefit and should not be disproportionate 
or arbitrary”376. As already mentioned, this means in practice that the proportionality 
test  is  based  on  a  balance  test  between  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved  (“operational 
purpose/s”)  and  the  technical  options  available  (e.g.  targeted  or  bulk  interception, 
equipment  interference,  acquisition  of  communication  data),  giving  preference  to  the 
least  intrusive  means  (see  recitals  (181)  and  (182)  above).  When  more  than  one 
measure is appropriate to the objective, the less intrusive means must be preferred.

According to the explanations provided by the UK authorities, for example, an operational purpose may 
limit the scope of the measure to the existence of a threat in a specific geographical area.

(224)  An  additional  safeguard  on  the  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  the  measure 
requested  is  ensured  by  the  fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State  must  receive  the  relevant 
information needed to properly carry out his/her assessment. In particular, the Code of 
Practice  on  Interception  and  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Equipment  Interference  require 
that the application submitted by the relevant authority should mention the background 
of  the  application,  the  description  of  communications  to  be  intercepted  and  the 
telecommunications  operators  required  to  assist,  the  description  of  the  conduct  to  be 
authorised,  the  operational  purposes,  and  an  explanation  on  why  the  conduct  is 
necessary and proportionate377. 

(225)  Finally and importantly, the Secretary of State’s decision to issue the warrant must be 
approved by an independent Judicial Commissioner that assesses the evaluation of the 
necessity and proportionality of the proposed measure, using the same principles that 
would be used by a court in an application for judicial review378. More specifically, the 
Judicial Commissioner will review the Secretary of State’s conclusions as to whether 
the  warrant  is  necessary  and  whether  the  conduct  is  proportionate  in  the  light  of  the 
principles  set  in  Section 2(2)  of  the  IPA  2016  (general  duties  in  relation  to  privacy). 
The Judicial Commissioner will also review the Secretary of State’s conclusions as to 
whether  each  of  the  operational  purposes  specified  on  the  warrant  is  a  purpose  for 
which  selection  is,  or  may  be,  necessary.  If  the  Judicial  Commissioner  refuses  to 
approve the decision to issue a warrant the Secretary of State may either: (i) accept the 
decision and therefore not issue the warrant; or (ii) refer the matter to the Investigatory 
Powers Commissioner for a decision (unless  the  Investigatory Powers Commissioner 
has made the original decision)379.  

(ii)  

Additional safeguards  

(226)  The IPA 2016 has introduced further limits on the duration, renewal and modification 
of a bulk warrant. The warrant must have a duration of a maximum of six months and 
any  decision  to  renew  or  modify  (except  minor  modifications)  the  warrant  must  be 
also  approved  by  a  Judicial  Commissioner380.  The  Code  of  Practice  on  Interception 
and  the  Code  of  Practice  on  Equipment  Interference  specified  that  a  change  in  the

Practice on Equipment Interference, paragraph 6.13, see footnote 348. 
Section 138(1)(g) and 178(1)(f) of the IPA 2016. Prior authorisation by an independent body has been 
notably identified by the European Court of Human Rights as an important safeguard against abuse in 
the  context  of  bulk  interception.  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  (Grand  Chamber),  Big  Brother 
Watch and others v United Kingdom, (see footnote 269 above), paras. 351 and 352. It is important to 
bear  in  mind  that  this  judgment  concerned  the  previous  legal  framework  (RIPA  2000)  that  did  not 
contain some of the safeguards (including prior authorisation by an independent Judicial Commissioner) 
introduced by the IPA 2016. 
Section 159 (3) and (4) of the IPA 2016. 
Sections 143 – 146, and 184 - 188 of the IPA 2016. In case of an urgent modification the Secretary of 
State  can  make  the  modification  without  an  approval,  but  must  notify  the  Commissioner  and  the 
Commissioner must then decide whether to approve or refuse the modification (Section 147 of the IPA 
2016). The  warrants  must  be  cancelled,  where  the  warrant  is  no  longer  necessary  or  proportionate,  or 
that  the  examination  of  intercepted  content,  metadata  or  other  data  obtained  under  the  warrant  is  no 
longer necessary for any of the operational purposes specified on the warrant (Section 148, and 189 of 
the IPA 2016).

operational  purposes  of  the  warrant  is  considered  as  a  major  modification  of  the 
warrant381.  

(227)  Similar to what is provided for targeted interception, Part 6 of the IPA 2016 provides 
that  the  Secretary  of  State  must  ensure  that  arrangements  are  in  force  to  provide 
safeguards on the retention  and disclosure of material  obtained under the  warrant382., 
as well as for overseas disclosure383.  In particular,  Sections  150(5) and 191(5) of the 
IPA  2016  require  that  every  copy  made  of  any  of  that  material  collected  under  the 
warrant  must  be  stored  in  a  secure  manner  and  is  destroyed  as  soon  as  there  are  no 
longer any relevant grounds for retaining it, while Sections 150(2) and 191(2) require 
that the number of persons to whom the material is disclosed and the extent to which 
any  material  is  disclosed,  made  available  or  copied  must  be  limited  to  the  minimum 
that is necessary for the statutory purposes384.  

(228)  Finally, when the material that has been intercepted either through a bulk interception 
or  a  bulk  equipment  interference  is  to  be  handed  over  to  a  third  country  (“overseas 
disclosures”),  the  IPA  2016  provides  that  the  Secretary  of  State  must  ensure  that 
appropriate  arrangements  are  in  place  to  ensure  that  similar  safeguards  on  security, 
retention  and  disclosure  exist in  that  third  country385.  In  addition,  Section  109  of  the 
DPA 2018 sets out specific requirements for international transfers of personal data by 
intelligence  services  to  third  countries  or  international  organisations,  and  does  not 
allow data to be transferred to a country or territory outside the United Kingdom or to 
an international organisation, unless the transfer is necessary and proportionate for the 
purpose  of  the  controller’s  statutory  functions  or  for  other  purposes  provided  for  in 
Section 2(2)(a) of the Security Service Act 1989 or Sections 2(2)(a) and 4(2)(a)of the 
Intelligence Services Act 1994386. Importantly, these requirements also apply in cases 
where  the  national  security  exemption  pursuant  to  Section  110  of  the  DPA  2018  is 
invoked, as Section 110 of the DPA 2018 does not list Section 109 of the DPA 2018 as 
one of the provisions that can be disapplied if an exemption from certain provisions is 
required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. 

(229)  Once the warrant has been approved and the data has been collected in bulk, the data 
will  be  subject  to  a  selection  before  being  examined.  The  selection  and  examination 
phase is subject to a further proportionality test carried out by the analyst that defines, 
on  the  basis  of  the  operational  purposes  included  in  the  warrant  (and  potentially 
existing filtering arrangements) the criteria for selection. As provided by sections 152 
and 193 of the IPA, when issuing the warrant the Secretary of State must ensure that 
arrangements are in place to guarantee that the selection of the material is carried out 
only for the specified operational purposes and that it is necessary and proportionate in 
all  circumstances.  In  this  respect,  the  United  Kingdom  authorities  clarified  that  the 
material intercepted in bulk is selected, first of all, via automated filtering with the aim

to discard data that is unlikely to be of national security interest. The filters will vary 
from  time  to  time  (as  internet  traffic  patterns,  types  and  protocols  change)  and  will 
depend  on  the  technology  and  operational  context.  After  this  phase,  the  data  can  be 
selected for examination only if relevant for the operational purposes specified in the 
warrant387.  The  safeguards  provided  by  the  IPA  2016  for  the  examination  of  the 
material  collected  apply  to  any  type  of  data  (both  intercepted  content  and  secondary 
data)388. Section 152 and 193 of the IPA 2016 also provide for a general prohibition to 
select  for  examination  material  referring  to  conversations  sent  by  or  intended  to 
individuals  who  are  in  the  British  Islands.  If  the  authorities  wish  to  examine  such 
material, they would submit a request for a targeted examination warrant under Part 2 
and Part 4 of the IPA 2016, issued by the Secretary of State and approved by a Judicial 
Commissioner389.  If  a  person  deliberately  selects  intercepted  content  for  examination 
in  breach  of  the  requirements  set  in  the  legislations390  he  or  she  commits  a  criminal 
offence391.  

(230)  The assessment carried out by the analyst over the selection of the material is subject 
to  an  ex  post  oversight  by  the  IPC  who  evaluates  the  compliance  with  the  specific 
safeguards  set  in  the  IPA  2016  for  the  examination  phase392  (see  also  recital  (229)). 
The  IPC  must  keep  under  review  (including  by  way  of  audit,  inspection  and 
investigation) the exercise by public authorities of the investigatory powers mentioned 
in the IPA 2016393. In this respect, the Code of Practice on Interception and the Code 
of Practice on Equipment Interference clarify that records must be kept by the agency 
for  purposes  of  subsequent  examination  and  audits,  and  these  records  must  outline 
why  access  to  the  material  by  authorised  persons  is  necessary  and  proportionate  and 
the  applicable  operational  purposes394.  For  example,  in  its  2018  Annual  report  the 
Investigatory Powers Commissioner Office (IPCO)395 concluded that the justifications

The Codes on interception of communications specifies, in this respect that “These processing systems 
process  data  from  the  communications  links  or  signals  that  the  intercepting  authority  has  chosen  to 
intercept. A degree of filtering is then applied to the traffic on those links and signals, designed to select 
types  of  communications  of  potential  intelligence  value  whilst  discarding  those  least  likely  to  be  of 
intelligence  value.  As  a  result  of  this  filtering,  which  will  vary  between  processing  systems,  a 
significant proportion of the communications on these links and signals will be automatically discarded. 
Further complex searches may then take place to draw out further communications most likely to be of 
greatest intelligence value, which relate to the agency’s statutory functions. These communications may 
then  be  selected  for  examination  for  one  or  more  of  the  operational  purposes  specified  in  the  warrant 
where the conditions of necessity and proportionality are met. Only items which have not been filtered 
out  can  potentially  be  selected  for  examination  by  authorised  persons”  (Codes  of  practice  on 
interception of communications, paragraph 6.6, see footnote 278). 
See section 152(1) (a) and (b) of the IPA 2016 according to which the examination of both type of data 
(intercepted  content  and  secondary  data)  must  be  carried  out  only  for  the  specified  purpose  and  be 
necessary and proportionate in all circumstances.  
This type of warrant is not required when the data related to individuals who are in the  British Island 
are “secondary data” (see section 152(1) (c) of the IPA 2016)

recorded by the analysts for the examination of certain material collected in bulk met 
the required standard of proportionality, by providing sufficient details of the reasons 
of  their  “queries”  in  relation  to  the  purpose  to  be  achieved396.  In  its  2019  report,  the 
IPCO, in relation to bulk powers, clearly stated its intention to continue the inspections 
of  bulk  interceptions,  including  a  detailed  examination  of  the  selectors  and  search 
criteria397.  It  will  also  continue  to  scrutinise  carefully,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  the 
choice  of  surveillance  measures  (targeted  v.  bulk)  both  during  its  consideration  of 
warrant  applications  under  the  double  lock  and  at  inspections398.  This  further 
monitoring  will  be  duly  taken  into  account  in  the  context  of  the  Commission’s 
monitoring of this Decision referred to in recitals (281)-(284). 

3.3.1.1.4.2 Bulk acquisition of communications data 

(231)  Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the IPA 2016 regulates bulk acquisition warrants that authorise 
the  addressee  to  require  a  telecommunications  operator  to  disclose  or  obtain  any 
communications data in the possession of the operator. These warrants also authorize 
the requesting authority to select the data for the further phase of the examination. As 
it is the case for targeted retention and acquisition of communications data (see recital 
(199)),  also  the  bulk  acquisition  of  communications  data  does  normally  not  concern 
personal  data  of  EU  data  subjects  transferred  under  this  Decision  to  the  United 
Kingdom.  The  obligation  to  disclose  communications  data  pursuant  to  Chapter  2  of 
Part 6 of the IPA 2016 covers data that is collected by telecommunication operators in 
the  United  Kingdom  directly  from  the  users  of  a  telecommunication  service399.  This 
type of “customer facing” processing typically does not involve a transfer on the basis 
of  this  Decision,  i.e.  a  transfer  from  a  controller/processor  in  the  EU  to  a 
controller/processor in the United Kingdom. 

(232)  However,  for  the  sake  of  completeness  the  conditions  and  safeguards  governing  the 

acquisition of bulk communications data are described below.

The IPCO Annual Report of 2018 specified that the justifications recorded by the analysts of the GCHQ 
“were  meeting  the  required  standard  and  analysts  were  accounting  for  the  proportionality  of  their 
queries  of  bulk  data  in  sufficient  detail”.  Annual  Report  of  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner 
2018, paragraph 6.22, see footnote 464. 
Annual Report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner 2019, paragraph 7.6, see footnote 463.  

Annual Report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner 2019, paragraph 10.22, see footnote 463.  
This follows from the definition of communications data provided in Section 261(5) of the IPA 2016, 
according to  which communications data is held or obtained by a telecommunications  operator and is 
either about the user of a telecommunications service and relating to the provision of this service, or is 
comprised  in,  included  as  part  of,  attached  to  or  logically  associated  with  a  communication  (see  also 
Code  of  Practice  on  Bulk  Acquisition  of  Communications  Data,  available  at  the  following  link: 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7154
the 
77/Bulk_Communications_Data_Code_of_Practice.pdf  paragraphs  2.15 
definition of telecommunications operator provided in Section 261(10) of the IPA 2016 requires that a 
telecommunications  operator  is  a  person  who  offers  or  provides  a  telecommunications  service  to 
persons in the UK or who controls or provides a telecommunication system  which is (wholly or partly) 
in or controlled from the UK. These definitions make clear that obligations under the IPA 2016 cannot 
be imposed on telecommunications operators whose equipment is not in or controlled from the UK and 
who  do  not  offer  or  provide  services  to  persons  in  the  UK  (see  also  Code  of  Practice  on  Bulk 
Acquisition of Communications Data, paragraph 2.2). If EU subscribers (whether located in the EU or 
in  the  UK)  made  use  of  services  in  the  UK,  any  communications  in  relation  to  the  provision  of  this 
service  would be collected directly by the service provider in the UK rather than subject to a transfer 
from the EU.

the  acquisition  of  bulk 
communications  data  which  was  the  subject  of  the  CJEU  judgment  in  the  Privacy 
International  case.  The  legislation  at  issue  in  that  case  was  repealed  and  the  new 
regime provides for specific conditions and safeguards under which such measure can 
be authorised.  

legislation  concerning 

(234)  In particular, differently from the previous regime under which the Secretary of State 
had full discretion in authorising the measure400, the IPA 2016 requires the Secretary 
of  State  to  issue  a  warrant  only  if  the  measure  is  necessary  and  proportionate.  This 
means in practice that there should be a link between the access to the data and the aim 
pursued401. More specifically, the Secretary of State will have to assess the existence 
of  a  link  between  the  measure  requested  and  one  or  more  “operational  purpose/s” 
indicated  in  the  warrant  (see  recital  (219))  respect  to  the  assessment  of  the 
proportionality,  the  relevant  Code  of  Practice  specifies  that  “the  Secretary  of  State 
must  take  into  account  whether  what  is  sought  to  be  achieved  by  the  warrant  could 
reasonably be achieved by other less intrusive means (Section 2(2)(a) of the Act). For 
example, obtaining the required information through a less intrusive power such as the 
targeted acquisition of communications data”402.  

(235)  To  conduct  such  assessment,  the  Secretary  of  State  will  rely  on  information  that  the 
heads of intelligence403 are required to submit in their application, such as the reasons 
why the measure is considered to be necessary for one of the statutory grounds and the 
reasons why what is sought to be achieved could not reasonably be achieved by other 
less intrusive means404. Moreover, the operational purposes limit the scope for which 
data obtained under the warrant can be selected for examination405. As specified in the 
relevant Code of Practice, the operational purposes must describe a clear requirement 
and  contain  sufficient  detail  to  satisfy  the  Secretary  of  State  that  acquired  data  may 
only be selected for examination for specific reasons406. In fact, the Secretary of State 
will  have  to  ensure,  before  authorising  the  warrant,  that  specific  arrangements  are  in 
place  for  securing  that  only  that  material  which  has  been  considered  necessary  for 
examination  for  an  operational  purpose  and  a  statutory  purpose  is  selected  for  the 
examination  and  should  be  proportionate  and  necessary  in  all  circumstances.  This 
specific requirement, reflected in sections 158 and 172407 of the IPA 2016, regarding 
the  prior  assessment  of  the  necessity  and  proportionality  of  the  criteria  used  for  the

Section  94(1)  of  the  Telecommunication  Act  1984  provided  that  the  Secretary  of  State  could  issue 
“directions of a general character as appear to the Secretary of State to be requisite or expedient in the 
interests of national security (…)” (see footnote 451). 
See Privacy International, paragraph 78  
See  Code  of  Practice  on  Bulk  Acquisition  of  Communications  Data,  paragraph  4.11,  (see  footnote 
399414). 
A bulk acquisition warrant may be requested only by the heads of the intelligences services which are: 
(i) the Director General of the Security Service; (ii) the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service; or (iii) 
the Director of the GCHQ (see section 158 and 263 of the IPA 2016). 
Code of practice on bulk acquisition of communications data, paragraph 4.5 (see footnote 399). 
According  to  section  161  of  the  IPA  2016,  the  operational  purposes  specified  in  the  warrant  must  be 
ones  specified,  in  a  list  maintained  by  the  heads  of  the  intelligence  services  (“the  list  of  operational 
purposes”), as purposes  which they consider are operational purposes  for  which communications data 
obtained under bulk acquisition warrants may be selected for examination. 
Code of Practice on Bulk Acquisition of Communications Data, paragraph 6.6 (see footnote 399). 
Section  172  of  the  IPA  2016  requires  that  specific  safeguards  must  be  put  in  place  for  the  phase  of 
filtering and  selection  for the examination of communication acquired in bulk. Moreover, a deliberate 
examination in breach of these safeguards is also a criminal offense (see section 173 of the IPA 2016).

purposes of selection represents another important novelty of the regime introduced by 
the IPA 2016 compared to the regime previously in place. 

(236)  The IPA 2016 also introduced the obligation on the Secretary of State, to ensure that, 
before  issuing  the  warrant  for  the  bulk  acquisition  of  communications  data  specific 
limitations are in place on the security, the retention and the disclosure of the personal 
data  collected408.  In  case  of  overseas  disclosure,  the  safeguards,  described  in  recital 
(227),  for  bulk  interception  and  bulk  equipment  interference  apply  also  in  this 
context409.  Further  limits  are  set  out  in  the  legislation  on  the  duration410,  renewal411 
and modification of the bulk warrants412.  

(237)  Importantly, as for the other bulk powers, before issuing the warrant, the Secretary of 
State needs get the approval by a Judicial Commissioner413. This is a key feature of the 
regime put in place by the IPA 2016. 

(238)  The  IPC  carries  out  an  ex  post  oversight  on  the  examination  procedure  over  the 
material  (communication  data)  acquired  in  bulk  (see  recital  (254)  below).  In  that 
respect, the IPA 2016 introduced the requirement that the intelligence analyst carrying 
out  the  examination,  has  to  record,  prior  to  selecting  the  data  for  examination,  the 
reason  why  the  proposed  examination  is  necessary  and  proportionate  for  a  specified 
operational purpose414. In the IPCO Annual Report 2019 it was found with respect to 
GCHQ’s and MI5’s practice that “the critical role of bulk communications data (BCD) 
to the range of activities conducted at GCHQ was well articulated in the casework we 
inspected.  We  considered  the  nature  of  the  requested  data  and  the  stated  intelligence 
requirements  and  were  satisfied  that  the  documentation  demonstrated  that  their 
approach was necessary and proportionate”415. MI5’s recorded justifications were of a 
good standard and satisfied the principles of necessity and proportionality”416.  

3.3.1.1.4.3 Retention and examination of bulk personal datasets  
(239)  Bulk Personal Dataset (BPD) warrants417 authorise intelligence agencies to retain and 
examine  sets  of  data  that  contain  personal  data  relating  to  a  number  of  individuals. 
According  to  the  explanations  provided  by  the  United  Kingdom  authorities,  the 
analysis of such datasets can be “the only way for UKIC to progress investigations and 
identify  terrorists  from  very  limited  lead  intelligence,  or  when  their  communications 
have  been  deliberately  concealed”418.  There  are  two  types  of  warrants:  “class  BPD 
warrants”419  which  concern  a  certain  category  of  datasets,  i.e.  datasets  which  are 
similar  in  their  content  and  proposed  use  and  raise  similar  considerations  as  to,  for 
instance,  the  degree  of  intrusion  and  sensitivity  and  the  proportionality  of  using  the

data,  therefore  allowing  the  Secretary  of  State  to  consider  the  necessity  and 
proportionality of acquiring all data within the relevant class all at once. For example, 
a class BPD warrant may cover travel datasets that relate to similar routes420. “Specific 
BPD warrants”421 instead concern one specific dataset, such as a dataset of a novel or 
unusual type of information which does not fall within an existing class BPD warrant, 
or  a  dataset  that  concerns  specific  types  of  personal  data422  and  therefore  requires 
additional safeguards423. The provisions of the IPA 2016 relating to BPDs allow such 
datasets  to  be examined  and retained only  where it is  necessary  and proportionate to 
do so424, and in line with the general obligations relating to privacy425.  

(240)  The  power  to  issue  a  BPD  warrant  is  subject  to  the  “double  lock”  procedure:  the 
assessment  of  the  necessity  and  proportionality  of  the  measure  is  first  carried  out  by 
the Secretary of State and then by the Judicial Commissioner426. The Secretary of State 
is  required  to  consider  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  type  of  warrant  being  sought,  the 
category of data concerned and the number of individual bulk personal datasets likely 
to fall within the specific type of warrant427. Also, as specified in the Code of Practice 
on  Intelligence  Services’  Retention  and  Use  of  Bulk  Personal  Datasets,  detailed 
records are to be kept  and are subject to  IPC audit428. Retaining and examining BPD 
outside the limits of the IPA 2016 is a criminal offense429. 

3.3.2  Further use of the information collected  

(241)  Personal  data  processed  under  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018  must  not  be  processed  in  a 
manner that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected430. The DPA 
2018  provides  that  the  controller  can  process  the  data  for  another  purpose,  different 
from that for which the data was collected, when it is compatible with the original one 
and  provided  that  the  controller  is  authorised  by  law  to  process  the  data  and  that

footnote 469.  
An application for a specific BPD warrant must be considered individually by the Secretary of State, i.e. 
with  respect  to  one  specific  dataset.  The  intelligence  service  is  required  by  Section  205  of  the  IPA  to 
include in its application for a specific BPD warrant a detailed explanation of the nature and extent of 
the  material  in  question  and  a  list  of  the  “operational  purposes”  for  which  the  relevant  intelligence 
service  wishes  to  examine  the  BPD  (where  the  intelligence  service  seeks  a  warrant  for  retention  and 
examination,  rather  than  retention  only).  When  issuing  a  class  BPD  warrant,  the  Secretary  instead 
considers the whole category of datasets at once.

processing is necessary and proportionate431. Moreover, the Security Service Act 1989 
and  the  Intelligence  Services  Act  1994  specify  that  the  heads  of  the  intelligence 
agencies have the duty to ensure that no information is obtained or disclosed except so 
far  as  necessary  for  the  proper  discharge  of  the  agency  functions  or  for  the  other 
limited and specific purposes listed in the relevant provisions432. 

(242)  In  addition,  Section  109  of  the  DPA  2018  sets  out  specific  requirements  for 
international  transfers  of  personal  data  by  intelligence  services  to  third  countries  or 
international organisations. According to this provision, personal data is not allowed to 
be  transferred  to  a  country  or  territory  outside  the  United  Kingdom  or  to  an 
international  organisation,  unless  the  transfer  is  necessary  and  proportionate  for  the 
purpose  of  the  controller’s  statutory  functions  or  for  other  purposes  provided  for  in 
Section 2(2)(a) of the Security Service Act 1989 or Sections 2(2)(a) and 4(2)(a)of the 
Intelligence Services Act 1994433. Importantly, these requirements also apply in cases 
where  the  national  security  exemption  pursuant  to  Section  110  of  the  DPA  2018  is 
invoked, as Section 110 of the DPA 2018 does not list Section 109 of the DPA 2018 as 
one of the provisions that can be disapplied if an exemption from certain provisions is 
required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.  

(243)  Moreover, as stressed by the ICO in its guidance on intelligence services processing, 
in  addition  to  the  safeguards  provided  by  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018,  an  intelligence 
agency,  when  sharing  data  with  a  third  country  intelligence  body,  is  also  subject  to 
safeguards  provided  by  other  legislative  measures  applying  to  them  to  ensure  that 
personal  data  is  obtained,  shared  and  handled  lawfully  and  responsibly434.  For 
example,  the  IPA  2016  sets  out  further  safeguards  in  relation  to  transfers  to  a  third 
country  of  material  collected  through  targeted  interception435,  targeted  equipment 
interference436,  bulk  interception437,  bulk  acquisition  of  communications  data438  and 
bulk  equipment  interference439  (so-called  “overseas  disclosures”).  In  particular,  the 
authority issuing the warrant  must ensure that arrangements are in  force for securing 
that  the  third  country  receiving  the  data  limits  the  number  of  persons  who  see  the 
material, and the extent of disclosure and the number of copies made of any material 
to the minimum necessary for the authorised purposes set out in the IPA 2016440.

Section 87(3) of the DPA 2018. While controllers can be exempt from this principle pursuant to Section 
110 of the DPA 2018 to the extent that such exemption is required to safeguard national security, such 
exemption  must  be  assessed  case-by-case  and  can  be  invoked  only  as  far  as  the  application  of  a 
particular  provision  would  have  negative  consequences  for  national  security  (see  recital  (132)).  The 
national  security  certificates  for  the  UK  intelligence  services  (available  at  the  following  link: 
https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/our-information/national-security-certificates/)  do  not  cover  Section 
87(3) of the DPA 2018. Moreover, as any processing for a different purpose must be authorised by law, 
intelligence services must have a clear legal basis for the further processing. 
For further information on these purposes, see footnote 312.

3.3.3  Oversight 

(244)  Government access for national security purposes is overseen by a number of different 
bodies.  The  Information  Commissioner  oversees  the  processing  of  personal  data  in 
light  of  the  DPA  2018  (for  more  information  on  the  independence,  appointment  role 
and  powers  of  the  Commissioner  see  recitals  (85)  to  (98)),  while  independent  and 
judicial oversight on the use of investigatory powers under the IPA 2016 is provided 
by the IPC. The IPC oversees the use of  IPA 2016 investigatory powers by both law 
enforcement and national security authorities. Political oversight is guaranteed by the 
Intelligence Service Committee of the Parliament. 

3.3.3.1 Oversight under Part 4 of the DPA 

(245)  The processing of personal data carried out by the intelligence services under Part 4 of 

the DPA 2018, is overseen by the Information Commissioner441. 

(246)  The general functions of the Information Commissioner in relation to the processing of 
personal data by intelligence services under Part 4 of the DPA 2018 are laid down in 
Schedule  13  to  the  DPA  2018.  The  tasks  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  monitoring 
and  enforcement  of  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018,  promoting  public  awareness,  advising 
Parliament,  the  government  and  other  institutions  on  legislative  and  administrative 
measures,  promote  the  awareness  of  controllers  and  processors  of  their  obligations, 
provide  information  to  a  data  subject  concerning  the  exercise  of  the  data  subject’s 
rights, conduct investigations etc.  

(247)  The Commissioner, as for Part 3 of the DPA 2018, has the powers to notify controllers 
of an alleged infringement and to issue warnings that a processing is likely to infringe 
the rules, and issues reprimands when the infringement is confirmed. It can also issue 
enforcement  and  penalty  notices  for  violations  of  certain  provision  of  the  act442. 
However, differently than for other parts of the DPA 2018, the Commissioner cannot 
give an assessment notice to a national security body443.  

(248)  Moreover,  Section  110  of  the  DPA  2018  provides  an  exception  to  the  use  of  certain 
powers  of  the  Commissioner  when  this  is  required  for  the  purposes  of  safeguarding 
national security. This includes the power of the Commissioner to issue (any type of) 
notices  under  the  DPA  (information,  assessment,  enforcement  and  penalty  notices), 

                                                                                                                                                         
for retaining it (see Sections 150 (2), 150(5) and 151(2) of the IPA 2016). It is worth noting  that similar 
safeguards, provided under the previous legal framework (RIPA 2000) were found in compliance with 
the  requirements  set  by  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  for  the  sharing  of  material  obtained  by 
bulk  interception  with  foreign  States  or  international  organisations  (European  Court  of  Human  Rights 
(Grand Chamber), Big Brother Watch and others v  United Kingdom, (see  footnote 279 above), paras. 
362 and 399). 
Section 116 of the DPA 2018. 

441

443

 

Pursuant to Schedule 13 paragraph 2 to the DPA 2018, enforcement and penalty notices may be issued 
to a controller or processor in relation to violations of Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the DPA 2018 (principles 
of processing), a provision of Part 4 of the DPA 2018 conferring rights on a data subject, a requirement 
to communicate a personal data breach to the Commissioner under Section 108 of the DPA 2018, and 
the  principles  for  transfers  of  personal  data  to  third  countries,  non-Convention  countries  and 
international  organisations  in  Section  109  of  the  DPA  2018  (for  further  details  on  enforcement  and 
penalty notice see recital (92)).  
Under  Section  147(6)  of  the  DPA  2018,  the  Information  Commissioner  may  not  give  an  assessment 
notice to a body specified in Section 23(3) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. That includes the 
Security  service  (MI5),  the  Secret  Intelligence  Service  (MI6)  and  the  Government  Communications 
Headquarter).

the power to do inspections in accordance with international obligations, the powers of 
entry and inspection, and the rules on offences444. As explained in recital (126), these 
exceptions apply only if necessary and proportionate and on a case-by-case basis. 

(249)  The 

ICO  and  UK 

intelligence  services  have  signed  a  Memorandum  of 
Understanding445 that establishes a framework for co-operation on a number of issues, 
including  data  breach  notifications  and  the  handling  of  data  subjects  complaints.  In 
particular,  it  provides  that,  upon  receiving  a  complaint,  the  ICO  will  assess  that  the 
application of any national security exemption has been used appropriately. Responses 
to queries made by the ICO in the context of the examination of individual complaints 
have to be given within 20 working days by the concerned intelligence agency, using 
appropriate  secure  channels  if  it  involves  classified  information.  From  April  2018  to 
date,  the  ICO  has  received  21  complaints  from  individuals  about  the  intelligence 
services. Each complaint was assessed and the outcome was communicated to the data 
subject446. 

3.3.3.2 Oversight of the use of investigatory powers under the IPA 2016 

(250)  Pursuant to Part 8 of the IPA 2016, oversight over the use of investigatory powers is 
exercised  by  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner  (IPC).  The  IPC  is  assisted  by 
other  Judicial  Commissioners,  which  are  collectively  referred  to  as  Judicial 
Commissioners447. The IPA 2016 sets out the guarantees that protect the independence 
of the Judicial Commissioners. Judicial Commissioners are required to hold, or to have 
held,  a  high  judicial  office  (i.e.  must  be  or  have  been  a  member  of  the  most  senior 
courts)448 and, as any member of the judiciary, they enjoy an independent status from 
the government449. Pursuant to Section 227 of the IPA 2016, it is the Prime Minister 
that appoints the IPC and as many Judicial Commissioners as he considers necessary. 

                                                 
444

449 

The provisions that can be exempted are: Section 108 (communication of a personal data breach to the 
Commissioner), Section 119  (inspection in accordance  with international obligations); Sections 142 to 
154 and Schedule 15 (Commissioner’s notices and powers of entry and inspection); and Sections 170 to 
173  (offences  relating  to  personal  data).  Furthermore,  in  relation  to  processing  by  the  intelligence 
services in Schedule 13 (other general functions of the Commissioner), paragraphs 1(a) and (g) and 2. 
Memorandum  of  Understandings  between  Information  Commission’s  Office  and  the  UK  Intelligence 
Community, see footnote 165.  
In seven of  these cases, the ICO advised the complainant to raise the concern  with the  data controller 
(this  is  the  case  when  an  individual  has  raised  a  concern  with  the  ICO,  but  should  have  first  raised  it 
with the data controller), in one of these cases, the ICO provided general advice to the data controller 
(this  is  used  when  the  actions  of  the  controller  do  not  appear  to  have  breached  the  legislation,  but  an 
improvement of the practices may have avoided the concern being raised with the ICO), and in the other 
13 cases, there was no action required from the data controller (this is used when concerns raised by the 
individual do fall under the Data Protection Act 2018 because they concern the processing of personal 
information, but based on the information provided the controller does not appear to have breached the 
legislation). 
In accordance with Section 227(7) and (8) of the IPA 2016, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner is a 
Judicial  Commissioner,  and  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner  and 
the  other  Judicial 
Commissioners  are  to  be  known,  collectively,  as  the  Judicial  Commissioners.  There  are  currently  15 
Judicial Commissioners. 
According  to  Section  60(2)  of  Part  3  of  the  Constitutional  Reform  Act  2005,  a  “high  judicial  office” 
means office as a judge of any of the following courts: (i)the Supreme Court; (ii )the Court of Appeal in 
England and Wales; (iii) the High Court in England and Wales; (iv) the Court of Session; (v) the Court 
of  Appeal  in  Northern  Ireland;  (vi)  the  High  Court  in  Northern  Ireland;  or  as  a  Lord  of  Appeal  in 
Ordinary. 
The  independence  of  the  judiciary  is  based  on  convention  and  has  been  broadly  recognized  since  the 
1701 Act of Settlement. 

EN 

79 

  EN 

All Commissioners, whether they are current or former members of the judiciary, can 
only be appointed on the basis of a joint recommendation by the three Chief Justices 
for England & Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Lord Chancellor450. The 
Secretary  of  State  must  provide  the  IPC  with  staff,  accommodation,  equipment  and 
other facilities and services451. The term of the Commissioners is three years and they 
can  be  reappointed452.  As  a  further  guarantee  of  their  independence,  Judicial 
Commissioners can be removed from office only subject to strict conditions imposing 
a high threshold: either by the Prime Minister in the specific circumstances listed in an 
exhaustive  manner  in  Section  228(5)  of  the  IPA  2016  (such  as  bankruptcy  or 
imprisonment),  or  if  a  resolution  approving  the  removal  has  been  passed  by  each 
House of Parliament453. 

(251) 

 The IPC and Judicial Commissioners are supported in their roles by the Investigatory 
Powers  Commissioner’s  Office  (IPCO).  The  IPCO’s  staff  includes  a  team  of 
inspectors, in-house legal and technical expertise, and a Technology Advisory Panel to 
provide expert advice. As it is the case for the individual Judicial Commissioners, the 
independence  of  the  IPCO  is  protected.  The  IPCO  is  an  “arm’s-length  body”  of  the 
Home  Office,  i.e.  it  receives  funding  from  the  Home  Office,  but  carries  out  its 
functions independently454. 

(252)  The  main  functions  of  the  Judicial  Commissioners  are  set  out  in  Section  229  of  the 
IPA  2016455.  In  particular,  the  Judicial  Commissioners  have  an  extensive  power  of 
prior approval, which is part of the safeguards introduced in the United Kingdom legal 
framework with the IPA 2016. Warrants in relation to targeted interception, equipment 
interference, bulk personal datasets, bulk acquisition of communication data as well as 
retention  notices  for  communication  data  all  have  to  be  approved  by  Judicial 
Commissioners456.  The  IPC  must  also  always  pre-authorise  the  acquisition  of 
communication  data  for  law  enforcement  purposes457.  If  a  Commissioner  refuses  to

Section  227(3)  of  the  IPA  2016.  Judicial  Commissioners  must  be  recommended  also  by  the 
Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Section 227(4)(e) of the IPA 2016. 
Section 238 of the IPA 2016. 

Section 227(2) of the IPA 2016. 

The  removal  process  is  identical  to  the  removal  process  for  other  judges  in  the  UK  (see  for  example 
Section  11(3)  of  the  Senior  Courts  Act  1981  and  Section  33  of  the  Constitutional  Reform  Act  2005, 
which  also  require  a  resolution  following  an  approval  by  both  House  of  the  Parliament).  To  date,  no 
Judicial Commissioner has been removed from office. 
An arm’s-length body is an organisation or agency that receives funding from a government, but is able 
to act independently (for a definition and more information on an arm’s length body see the Handbook 
of  the  Cabinet  Office  on  the  classification  of  Public  Bodies,  available  at  the  following  link:

2015  of  the  Public  Administration  Select  Committee  of  the  House  of  Commons,  available  at  the 
following link: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubadm/110/110.pdf ) 
According to section 229 of the IPA 2016, the Judicial Commissioner have extensive oversight powers 
which  also  cover  the  oversight  on  the  retention  and  the  disclosure  of  the  data  collected  by  the 
intelligence agencies. 
Decisions on whether to approve a decision by the Secretary of State to issue a warrant are a matter for 
the Judicial Commissioners themselves. If a Commissioner refuses to approve a warrant, the Secretary 
of State can appeal to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, whose decision is final.  
The IPC authorization is always requested  where communication data is acquired for purposes of law 
enforcement  (Section  60A  of  the  IPA  2016).  Where  communication  data  is  acquired  for  purposes  of 
national  security,  the  authorisation  can  be  granted  by  the  IPC  or,  alternatively,  by  a  designated  senior 
officer of the relevant public authority (See Sections 61 and 61A of the IPA 2016 and recital (203)).

Commissioner, whose decision is final. 

(253)  The  UN  Special  Rapporteur  on  the  Right  to  Privacy  strongly  welcomed  the 
establishment  of  the  Judicial  Commissioners  with  the  IPA  2016,  as  “all  the  more 
sensitive or intrusive requests to conduct surveillance need to be authorized by both a 
cabinet minister and the  Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office”.  In particular, 
he stressed that “this element of judicial review [through the role of the IPC] assisted 
by a better-resourced team of experienced inspectors and technology experts is one of 
the most significant new safeguards introduced by the IPA”, that replaced a previously 
fragmented  system  of  oversight  authorities  and  complements  the  role  of  the

Tribunal”458. 

(254)  In addition, the IPC has the powers to carry out ex post oversight, including by way of 
audit,  inspection  and  investigation,  of  the  use  of  investigatory  powers  under  the  IPA 
2016459 and some other powers and functions provided in relevant legislation460. The 
results of such  ex post oversight  are included in the report that the IPC must prepare 
annually  and  present  to  the  Prime  Minister461  and  that  must  be  published  and  laid 
before Parliament462. The report contains relevant statistics and information about the 
use  of  the  investigatory  powers  by  intelligence  agencies  and  law  enforcement 
authorities as well as the deployment of the safeguards in relation to items subject to 
legal  privilege,  confidential 
journalistic 
information, information on the arrangements taken and the operational purposes used 
in the context of bulk warrants. Finally, in the IPCO Annual Report, it is specified in 
which area recommendations were given to public authorities and how they have been 
addressed463.

Section 229 of the IPA 2016. The Judicial Commissioner’s investigation and information powers are set 
out in Section 235 of the IPA 2016. 
This includes surveillance measures under the RIPA 2000, the exercise of functions under Part 3 of the 
Police  Act  1997  (authorisation  of  action  in  respect  of  property),  and  the  exercise  by  the  Secretary  of 
State of functions under Sections 5 to 7 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 (warrants for interference 
with wireless telegraphy, entry and interference with property (Section 229 of the IPA 2016). 
Section 230 of the IPA 2016. The IPC can also report to the Prime Minister on his own initiative on any 
matter relating to his functions. The IPC must also report to the Prime Minister on his request and the 
Prime Minister can direct the IPC to review any functions of the Intelligence Services. 
Some parts may be excluded if publishing them would be contrary to national security.  

For  example,  in  the  IPCO  annual  report  2019  (paragraph  6.38)  it  is  mentioned  that  MI5  was 
recommended to modify their policy of retention for bulk personal datasets (BPD) since it should have 
taken an approach where consideration was given to the proportionality of the retention for all fields in 
BPD  holdings  and  for  each  BPD  held.  At  the  end  of  2018,  the  IPCO  was  not  satisfied  that  this 
recommendation  was  followed  and  the  2019  report  explained  that  the  MI5  is  now  introducing  a  new 
process  to  discharge  this  requirement.  The  2019  annual  report  (paragraph  8.22)  mentions  also  that 
GHCQ was given a series of recommendations concerning the record accounting for the proportionality 
of their queries on bulk data. The report confirms that improvements have been made in this area at the 
end  of  2018.  Annual  Report  of  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner  Office  2019,  available  at  the

provided to the authority and includes any recommendations that arise from that inspection. The IPCO 
then  starts  each  subsequent  inspection  with  a  review  of  any  previous  recommendations  from  the  last

(255)  In  accordance  with  Section  231  of  the  IPA  2016,  if  the  IPC  becomes  aware  of  any 
relevant error committed by public authorities in the use of their investigatory powers, 
it must inform the person concerned where they consider that the error is serious and it 
is in the public interest for the person to be informed464. In particular, Section 231 of 
the  IPA  2016  specifies  that,  when  informing  a  person  of  an  error,  the  IPC  must 
provide  information  on  any  right  he/she  has  to  apply  to  the  Investigatory  Powers 
Tribunal,  and  provide  such  details  as  the  Commissioner  considers  necessary  for  the 
exercise of those rights and there is a public interest for the disclosure465. 

3.3.3.3 Parliamentary oversight of Intelligence services 

(256)  The parliamentary oversight by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has its 
statutory  footing  in  the  Justice  and  Security  Act  2013  (JSA  2013)466.  The  Act 
establishes the ISC as a committee of the United Kingdom Parliament. Since 2013, the 
ISC  has  been  provided  with  greater  powers  including  the  oversight  of  operational 
activities of security services. Under Section 2 of the JSA 2013, the ISC has the task to 
oversee  the  expenditure,  administration,  policy  and  operations  of  national  security 
agencies.  The  JSA  2013  specifies  that  the  ISC  is  able  to  conduct  investigations  on 
operational  matters  when  they  do  not  relate  to  ongoing  operations467.  The 
Memorandum  of  Understanding  agreed  between  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  ISC468 
specifies in details the elements to be taken into account when considering whether an 
activity  is  not  part  of  any  ongoing  operation469.  The  ISC  can  also  be  asked  to 
investigate  ongoing  operations  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  can  review  information 
voluntarily provided by the agencies. 

(257)  Under  Schedule  1  to  the  JSA  2013  the  ISC  may  ask  the  heads  of  any  of  the  three 
intelligence  services  to  disclose  any  information.  The  agency  must  make  such 
information  available,  unless  the  Secretary  of  State  vetoes  it470.  According  to  the

the 

Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner  Office  2018,  Annex  C 

                                                                                                                                                         
time and it is reflected in the new inspection report whether previous recommendations were addressed 
or are carried forward. 
An  error  is  considered  “serious”  when  the  Commissioner  considers  that  it  has  caused  significant 
prejudice or  harm  to  the  person  concerned  (Section  231(2)  of  the  IPA  2016).  In 2018,  22  errors  were 
reported of which eight were deemed serious and resulted in information to the person concerned. See 
Annual  Report  of 
(see 
https://www.ipco.org.uk/docs/IPCO%20Annual%20Report%202018%20final.pdf).  In  2019,  14  errors 
were  considered  to  amount  to  serious.  See  Annual  Report  of  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner 
Office 2019, Annex C, see footnote 463. 
Section 231 of the IPA 2016 specifies that when informing a person of an error, the IPC must provide 
such details as the Commissioner considers necessary for the exercise of those rights, having regard in 
particular  to  the  extent  to  which  disclosing  the  details  would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest  or 
prejudicial  to  the  prevention  or  detection  of  serious  crime,  the  economic  well-being  of  the  United 
Kingdom, or the continued discharge of the functions of any of the intelligence services.  
As explained by UK authorities, the JSA expanded the remit of the ISC to include a role in overseeing 
intelligence  community  beyond  the  three  agencies  and  allowing  retrospective  oversight  of  the 
operational activities of the Agencies on matters of significant national interest.

Memorandum of Understanding between the Prime minister and the ISC, para 14, see footnote 468. 

The  Secretary  of  State  may  only  veto  disclosure  of  information  on  two  grounds:  the  information  is 
sensitive and should not be disclosed to the ISC in the interests of national security; or it is information 
of such a nature that, if the Secretary of State were requested to produce it before a Departmental Select

explanations  provided  by  the  United  Kingdom  authorities,  in  practice  very  little 
information is withheld from the ISC471.  

(258)  The  ISC  consists  of  members  belonging  to  either  House  of  the  Parliament  and 
appointed  by  the  Prime  Minister  after  consulting  the  leader  of  the  opposition472.  The 
ISC  is  required  to  make  an  annual  report  to  Parliament  on  the  discharge  of  its 
functions  and  other  reports  that  it  considers  appropriate473.  Moreover,  the  ISC  is 
entitled  to  receive  every  three  months  the  list  of  operational  purposes  that  is  used  to 
examine  material  obtained  in  bulk474.  Copies  of  the  investigations,  inspections  or 
audits of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner are shared with the ISC by the Prime 
Minister  when  the  matter  of  the  reports  is  relevant  for  the  Committee  statutory 
competences475.  Finally  the  Committee  can  ask  the  IPC  to  perform  an  investigation 
and the Commissioner must inform the ISC of the decision as to whether to carry out 
such investigation476.  

(259)  The  ISC  also  provided  input  on  the  draft  IPA  2016,  which  resulted  in  a  number  of 
amendments  that  are  now  reflected  in  the  IPA  2016477.  In  particular,  the  ISC 
recommended the strengthening of privacy protections by introducing a set of privacy 
protections  which  apply  across  the  full  range  of  investigatory  powers478.  It  also 
suggested  changes  to  the  proposed  capabilities  concerning  Equipment  Interference,

These  general  duties  in  relation  to  privacy  are  now  set  out  in  Section  2(2)  of  the  IPA  2016,  which 
provides that a public authority acting under the IPA 2016 must have regard to  whether what is sought 
to  be  achieved  by  the  warrant,  authorisation  or  notice  could  reasonably  be  achieved  by  other  less 
intrusive means, whether the level of protection to be applied in relation to any obtaining of information 
by  virtue  of  the  warrant,  authorisation  or  notice  is  higher  because  of  the  particular  sensitivity  of  that 
information,  the  public  interest  in  the  integrity  and  security  of  telecommunication  systems  and  postal 
services, and any other aspects of the public interest in the protection of privacy.

3.3.4   Redress 

(260)  In  the  field  of  government  access  for  national  security  purposes,  data  subjects  must 
have the possibility of bringing legal action before an independent and impartial court 
in order to have access to their personal data, or to obtain the rectification or erasure of 
such  data480.  Such  a  judicial  body  must  notably  have  the  power  to  adopt  binding 
decisions  on  the  intelligence  service481.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  as  explained  in 
recitals (261) to (271), a number of judicial redress avenues provide data subjects with 
the possibility to pursue and obtain such legal remedies. 

3.3.4.1 Redress mechanisms available under Part 4 of the DPA 

(261)  Under Section 165 of the DPA 2018, a data subject has the right to lodge a complaint 
with  the  Information  Commissioner  if  the  data  subject  considers  that,  in  connection 
with personal data relating to him or her, there is an infringement of Part 4 of the DPA 
2018.  The  Information  Commissioner  has  the  power  to  assess  the  compliance  of  the 
controller  and  processor  with  the  DPA  2018,  requiring  them  to  take  necessary  steps. 
Moreover, under Part 4 of the DPA 2018, individuals are entitled to apply to the High 
Court (or Court of Session in Scotland) for an order requiring the controller to comply 
with  the  rights  of  access  to  data482,  to  object  to  processing483  and  to  rectification  or 
erasure484. 

(262)  Individuals  are  also  entitled  to  seek  compensation  for  damage  suffered  due  to  a 
contravention  of  a  requirement  of  Part  4  of  the  DPA  2018  from  the  controller  or  a 
processor485. Damage includes both financial loss and damage not involving financial 
loss, such as distress486. 

3.3.4.2 Redress mechanisms available under the IPA 2016 

(263)  Individuals can obtain redress for violations of the IPA 2016 before the Investigatory 

Powers Tribunal.  

(264)  The Investigatory Powers Tribunal is established by the RIPA 2000 and is independent 
from the executive487. In accordance with Section 65 of the RIPA 2000, the members 
of that Tribunal are appointed by Her Majesty for a period of five years. A member of

For example, further to the request of the ISC, the number of days an “urgent” warrant can be in place 
before the Judicial Commissioner has to approve it has been reduced from five to three working days, 
and  the  ISC  was  given  the  power  to  refer  matters  to  the  Investigatory  Powers  Commissioner  for 
investigation.

Section 99(4) of the DPA 2018. 
Section 100(1) of the DPA 2018. 
Section  169  of  the  DPA  2018  allows  claims  from  “A  person  who  suffers  damage  by  reason  of  a 
contravention  of  a  requirement  of  the  data  protection  legislation”.  According  to  the  information 
provided  by  the  UK  authorities,  in  practice,  a  claim  or  complaint  against  the  intelligence  services  is 
likely  to  be  made  to  the  Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal,  who  has  a  broad  jurisdiction,  is  capable  of 
awarding compensation/damages and where bringing a claim does not involve any costs. 
Section 169(5) of the DPA 2018. 

Under  Schedule  3  to  the  RIPA  2000,  the  members  must  have  specified  judicial  experience  and  are 
eligible for reappointment.

that Tribunal may be removed from  office by  Her Majesty on an Address488 by both 
Houses of Parliament489.  

(265)  Under Section 65 of the RIPA 2000 the Tribunal  is  the appropriate judicial body for 
any complaint by  a person aggrieved by  conduct under the  IPA 2016, RIPA 2000 or 
any conduct of the intelligence services490. 

(266)  To bring an action before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (“standing requirement”), 
according  to  Section  65  of  the  RIPA  2000  an  individual  has  to  believe491  that  the 
conduct  of  an  intelligence  service  has  taken  place  in  relation  to  him,  any  of  his 
property, any communications sent by or to him, or intended for him, or his use of any 
postal  service,  telecommunications  service  or  telecommunications  system”492.  In 
addition,  the  complainant  is  required  to  believe  that  the  conduct  has  taken  place  in 
“challengeable  circumstances”493  or  “to  have  been  carried  out  by  or  on  behalf  of  the 
intelligence  services494.  As  in  particular  this  “belief”  standard  has  been  interpreted 
quite  broadly495,  bringing  a  case  before  that  Tribunal  is  subject  to  low  standing 
requirements.

An  “Address”  is  a  motion  laid  before  Parliament  which  seeks  to  make  the  Monarch  aware  of 
Parliament’s opinions on a particular issue. 
Schedule 3 paragraph 1(5) to the RIPA 2000. 

Section 65(5) to the RIPA 2000. 

On  the  standard  of  the  “belief”  test  see  case  Human  Rights  Watch  v  Secretary  of  State  [2016] 
UKIPTrib15_165-CH, paragraph 41. In this case, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, by referring to the 
European  Court  of  Human  Rights  case  law,  held  that  the  appropriate  test  is  whether  in  respect  of  the 
asserted belief that any conduct falling within Subsection 68(5) of RIPA 2000 has been carried out by or 
on behalf of any of the intelligence services, there is any basis for such belief, such that the individual 
may  claim  to  be  a  victim  of  a  violation  occasioned  by  the  mere  existence  of  secret  measures  or 
legislation permitting secret measures, only if he is able to show that due to his personal situation, he is 
potentially at risk of being subjected to such measures. 
Section 65(4)(a) of the RIPA 2000. 

Such circumstances refer to conduct of public authorities taking place with authority (e.g. an warrant, an 
authorisation/notice  for  the  acquisition  of  communications,  etc.),  or  if  the  circumstances  are  such  that 
(whether or not there is such authority) it would not have been appropriate for the conduct to take place 
without it, or at least without proper consideration having been given to whether such authority should 
be  sought.  Conduct  authorised  by  a  Judicial  Commissioner  are  considered  as  to  have  taken  place  in 
challengeable circumstance (Section 65 (7ZA) of the RIPA 2000) while other conducts that take place 
with  the  permission  of  a  person  holding  judicial  office  are  considered  not  to  have  taken  place  in 
challengeable circumstance (Section 65(7) and (8) of the RIPA 2000). 
According  to  the  information  provided  by  UK  authorities,  the  low  threshold  for  making  a  complaint 
determines that it is not unusual for the Tribunal’s investigation to determine that the complainant was 
in  fact  never  subject  to  investigation  by  a  public  authority.  The  latest  Statistical  Report  of  the 
Investigatory  Powers  Tribunal  specifies  that  in  2016  the  Tribunal  received  209  complaints,  52%  of 
those  were  considered  frivolous  or  vexatious  and  25%  received  a  “no  determination”  outcome.  UK 
authorities  explained  that  this  either  means  that  no  covert  activity/powers  were  used  in  relation  to  the 
complainant,  or  that  covert  techniques  were  used  and  the  Tribunal  determined  that  the  activity  was 
lawful. Additionally, 11% were ruled out of jurisdiction, withdrawn or not valid, 5% were ruled out of 
time  7%  were  found  in  favour  of  the  complainant.  Statistical  Report  of  the  Investigatory  Powers 
Tribunal

See  case  Human  Rights  Watch  v  Secretary  of  State  [2016]  UKIPTrib15_165-CH.  In  this  case,  the 
Investigatory Powers Tribunal, by referring to the European Court of Human Rights case law, held that 
the  appropriate  test  in  respect  of  the  belief  that  any  conduct  falling  within  Subsection  68(5)  of  RIPA 
2000 has been carried out by or on behalf of any of the intelligence services is whether there is any basis 
for such belief, including the fact that an individual may claim to be a victim of a violation occasioned

(267)  Where the Investigatory Powers Tribunal considers a complaint made to them, it is the 
duty of the Tribunal to investigate whether the persons against whom any allegation is 
made  in  the  complaint  have  engaged  in  relation  to  the  complainant  as  well  as  to 
investigate the authority  that has allegedly  engaged in  the violations and whether the 
alleged conduct has taken place496. Where that Tribunal hears any proceedings, it must 
apply  the  same  principles  for  making  their  determination  in  those  proceedings  as 
would  be  applied  by  a  court  on  an  application  for  judicial  review497.  In  addition,  the 
addressees  of  the  warrants  or  notices  under  the  IPA  2016,  and  every  other  person 
holding  office  under  the  Crown,  employed  by  the  police  force  or  the  Police 
Investigations and Review Commissioner have the duty to disclose or provide to that 
Tribunal  all  such  documents  and  information  as  the  Tribunal  may  require  for  the 
purpose of enabling them to exercise their jurisdiction498. 

(268)  The Investigatory Powers Tribunal must give notice to the complainant whether there 
has been determination in his or her favour or not499. Under Section 67(6) and (7) of 
the RIPA 2000, the Tribunal has the power to issue interim orders and to provide any 
such award of compensation or other order as it thinks fit. This may include an order 
quashing  or  cancelling  any  warrant  or  authorisation  and  an  order  requiring  the 
destruction of any records of information obtained in exercise of any power conferred 
by  a  warrant,  authorization  or  a  notice,  or  otherwise  held  by  any  public  authority  in 
relation to any person500. According to Section 67A of the RIPA 2000, a determination 
of the Tribunal  can be appealed, subject  to  leave granted by the Tribunal or relevant 
appellate court. 

(269)  Finally, it is worth noting that the role of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal has been 
discussed in the context of legal actions before the European Court of Human Rights 
in  several  occasions,  notably  in  the  case  of  Kennedy  v.  the  United  Kingdom501  and 
more recently in the case Big Brother Watch and others v. United Kingdom502, where 
the  Court  declared  that  the  “IPT  offered  a  robust  judicial  remedy  to  anyone  who

in  the  other,  because  the  procedure  on  examination  was  not  followed  as  laid  down  in  GCHQ  internal

(270)  As explained in recitals (109) to (111), means of redress under the Human Rights Act 
1998 and before the European Court of Human Rights504 are also available in the area 
of  national  security.  Section  65(2)  of  RIPA  2000  provides  the  Investigatory  Powers 
Tribunal  with  exclusive  jurisdiction  for  all  Human  Rights  Act’s  claims  in  relation  to 
the  intelligence  agencies505.  This  means,  as  noted  by  the  High  Court,  “whether  there 
has been a breach of the HRA on the facts of a particular case is something that can in 
principle be raised and adjudicated by an independent tribunal which can have access 
to  all  relevant  material,  including  secret  material.  […]  We  also  bear  in  mind  in  this 
context  that  the  Tribunal  is  itself  now  subject  to  the  possibility  of  an  appeal  to  an 
appropriate appellate court (in England and Wales that would be the Court of Appeal); 
and  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  recently  decided  that  the  Tribunal  is  in  principle 
amenable  to  judicial  review:  see  R  (Privacy  International)  v  Investigatory  Powers 
Tribunal [2019] UKSC 22; [2019] 2 WLR 1219”506. 

(271)  It  follows  from  the  above  that  when  United  Kingdom  law  enforcement  or  national 
security authorities access personal data falling within the scope of this Decision, such 
access is governed by laws that set the conditions under which access can take place 
and ensures that access and further use of the data is limited to what is necessary and 
proportionate to the law enforcement or national security objective pursued. Moreover, 
such  access  is  subject  in  most  instances  to  prior  authorisation  by  a  judicial  body, 
through  the  approval  of  a  warrant  or  a  production  order,  and  in  any  case  to 
independent  oversight.  Once  data  has  been  accessed  by  public  authorities,  its 
processing,  including  further  sharing  and  onward  transfer,  is  subject  to  specific  data 
protection  safeguards  under  Part  3  the  DPA  2018,  reflecting  those  provided  by 
Directive (EU) 2016/680, for processing by law enforcement authorities and Part 4 of 
the DPA 2018 for processing by intelligence agencies. Finally, data subjects enjoy in 
this area effective administrative and judicial redress rights, including to obtain access 
to their data or rectification or erasure of such data. 

(272)  Given the importance of such conditions, limitations and safeguards for the purposes 
of  the  present  Decision,  the  Commission  will  closely  monitor  the  application  and 
interpretation  of  the  UK  rules  framing  government  access  to  data.  This  will  include 
relevant legislative, regulatory and case-law developments, as well as activities of the 
ICO and other oversight authorities in this area. Close attention will also be paid to the 
execution by the UK of relevant judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, 
including  measures  identified  in  the  “action  plans”  and  “action  reports”  submitted  to 
the  Committee  of  Ministers  in  the  context  of  the  supervision  of  compliance  with  the 
Court’s rulings.

CONCLUSION 

                                                 
504 

As  illustrated,  for  example,  by  the  recent  judgment  of  the  Grand  Chamber  of  the  European  Court  of 
Human Rights in Big Brother Watch and others v United Kingdom (see footnote 279 above), this allows 
effective  judicial  control  –  similar  to  the  one  to  which  EU  Member  States  are  subject  to  –  by  an 
international  court  over  compliance  by  public  authorities  with  fundamental  rights  when  accessing 
personal  data.  Moreover,  the  execution  of  the  judgments  of  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  is 
subject to specific supervision by the Council of Europe. 
In  Belhaj  &  others  [2017]  UKSC  3  the  determination  of  unlawfulness  of  the  interception  of  legally 
privileged material was based directly on Article 8 of the ECHR (see determination 11).

(273)  The  Commission  considers  that  the  UK  GDPR  and  the  DPA  2018  ensure  a  level  of 
protection  for  personal  data  transferred  from  the  European  Union  that  is  essentially 
equivalent to the one guaranteed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

(274)  Moreover, the Commission considers that, taken as a whole, the oversight mechanisms 
and redress avenues in United Kingdom law enable infringements to be identified and 
punished  in  practice  and  offer  legal  remedies  to  the  data  subject  to  obtain  access  to 
personal  data  relating  to  him/her  and,  eventually,  the  rectification  or  erasure  of  such 
data. 

(275)  Finally,  on  the  basis  of  the  available  information  about  the  United  Kingdom  legal 
order, the Commission considers that any interference with the fundamental rights of 
the  individuals  whose  personal  data  are  transferred  from  the  European  Union  to  the 
United Kingdom by United Kingdom public authorities for public interest purposes, in 
particular  law  enforcement  and  national  security  purposes,  will  be  limited  to  what  is 
strictly  necessary  to  achieve  the  legitimate  objective  in  question,  and  that  effective 
legal protection against such interference exists.  

(276)  Therefore,  in  the  light  of  the  findings  of  this  Decision,  it  should  be  decided  that  the 
United Kingdom ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 
45  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  interpreted  in  light  of  the  Charter  of  Fundamental 
Rights of the European Union. 

(277)  This conclusion is based on both the relevant UK domestic regime and its international 
commitments,  in  particular  adherence  to  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights 
and submission to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights. Continued 
adherence  to  such  international  obligations  is  therefore  a  particularly  important 
element of the assessment on which this Decision is based. 

5. 

EFFECTS  OF  THIS  DECISION  AND  ACTION  OF  DATA  PROTECTION 
AUTHORITIES 

(278)  Member States and their organs are required to take the measures necessary to comply 
with  acts  of  the  Union  institutions,  as  the  latter  are  presumed  to  be  lawful  and 
accordingly  produce  legal  effects  until  such  time  as  they  expire,  are  withdrawn, 
annulled  in  an  action  for  annulment  or  declared  invalid  following  a  reference  for  a 
preliminary ruling or a plea of illegality.  

(279)  Consequently, a Commission adequacy decision adopted pursuant to Article 45(3) of 
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is binding on all organs of the Member States to which it is 
addressed, including their independent supervisory authorities. In particular, during the 
period  of  application  of  this  Decision,  transfers  from  a  controller  or  processor  in  the 
European  Union  to  controllers  or  processors  in  the  United  Kingdom  may  take  place 
without the need to obtain any further authorisation. 

(280)  It should be recalled that, pursuant to Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 
as explained by the Court of Justice in the Schrems judgment507, where a national data 
protection  authority  questions,  including  upon  a  complaint,  the  compatibility  of  a 
Commission  adequacy  decision  with  the  fundamental  rights  of  the  individual  to 
privacy  and  data  protection,  national  law  must  provide  it  with  a  legal  remedy  to  put

a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice508. 

6. 

MONITORING,  SUSPENSION,  REPEAL  OR  AMENDMENT  OF  THIS 
DECISION  

(281)  Pursuant to Article 45(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the Commission is to monitor, 
on an ongoing basis, relevant developments in the United Kingdom after the adoption 
of  this  Decision  in  order  to  assess  whether  it  still  ensures  an  essentially  equivalent 
level  of  protection.  Such  monitoring  is  particularly  important  in  this  case,  as  the 
United Kingdom  will administer, apply and enforce a new data protection regime no 
longer  subject  to  European  Union  law  and  which  may  be  liable  to  evolve.  In  that 
respect,  special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the  application  in  practice  of  the  United 
Kingdom rules on transfers of personal data to third countries, and the impact it may 
have on the level of protection afforded to data transferred under this Decision; to the 
effectiveness of the exercise of individual rights, including any relevant development 
in law and practice concerning the exceptions to or restrictions of such rights (notably 
the  one  relating  to  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control);  as  well  as 
compliance  with  the  limitations  and  safeguards  with  respect  to  government  access. 
Amongst other elements, case law developments  and oversight by the ICO and other 
independent bodies will inform the Commission’s monitoring.  

(282)  To facilitate this monitoring, the United Kingdom authorities should promptly inform 
the  Commission  of  any  material  change  to  the  UK  legal  order  that  has  an  impact  on 
the  legal  framework  that  is  the  object  of  this  Decision,  as  well  as  any  evolution  in 
practices related to the processing of the personal data assessed in this Decision, both 
as regards the processing of personal data by controllers and processors under the UK 
GDPR  and  the  limitations  and  safeguards  applicable  to  access  to  personal  data  by 
public  authorities.  This  should  include  developments  regarding  the  elements 
mentioned in recital (281). 

(283)  Moreover,  in  order  to  allow  the  Commission  to  effectively  carry  out  its  monitoring 
function, the Member States should inform the Commission about any relevant action 
undertaken by the national  data protection authorities, in  particular regarding queries 
or  complaints  by  EU  data  subjects  concerning  the  transfer  of  personal  data  from  the 
Union  to  controllers  or  processors  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Commission  should 
also  be  informed  about  any  indications  that  the  actions  of  United  Kingdom  public 
authorities  responsible  for  the  prevention,  investigation,  detection  or  prosecution  of 
criminal  offences,  or  for  national  security  including  any  oversight  bodies,  do  not 
ensure the required level of protection.  

(284)  Where  available  information,  in  particular  information  resulting  from  the  monitoring 
of  this  Decision  or  provided  by  United  Kingdom  or  Member  States’  authorities, 
reveals that the level of protection afforded by the United Kingdom may no longer be 
adequate,  the  Commission  should  promptly  inform  the  competent  United  Kingdom 
authorities  thereof  and  request  that  appropriate  measures  be  taken  within  a  specified 
timeframe, which may not exceed three months. Where necessary, this period may be 

                                                 
508 

Schrems,  paragraph  65:  “It  is  incumbent  upon  the  national  legislature  to  provide  for  legal  remedies 
enabling the national supervisory authority concerned to put forward the objections which it considers 
well founded before the national courts in order for them, if they share its doubts as to the validity of the 
Commission decision, to make a reference for a preliminary ruling for the purpose of examination of the 
decision's validity”.

extended for a specified period of time, taking into account the nature of the issue at 
stake  and/or  of  the  measures  to  be  taken.  For  example,  such  a  procedure  would  be 
triggered  in  cases  where  onward  transfers,  including  on  the  basis  of  new  adequacy 
regulations adopted by the Secretary of State or international agreements concluded by 
the  United  Kingdom,  would  no  longer  be  carried  out  under  safeguards  ensuring  the 
continuity  of  protection  within  the  meaning  of  Article  44  of  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679. 

(285)  If, at the expiry of that specified timeframe, the competent United Kingdom authorities 
fail  to  take  those  measures  or  otherwise  demonstrate  satisfactorily  that  this  Decision 
continues to be based on an adequate level of protection, the Commission will initiate 
the procedure referred to in Article 93(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with a view to 
partially or completely suspend or repeal this Decision. 

(286)  Alternatively,  the  Commission  will  initiate  this  procedure  with  a  view  to  amend  the 
Decision,  in  particular  by  subjecting  data  transfers  to  additional  conditions  or  by 
limiting the scope of the adequacy finding only to data transfers for which an adequate 
level of protection continues to be ensured. 

(287)  On duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission will make use of the 
possibility  to  adopt,  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  referred  to  in  Article  93(3)  of 
Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  immediately  applicable  implementing  acts  suspending, 
repealing or amending the Decision. 

7. 

DURATION AND RENEWAL OF THIS DECISION 

(288)  The  Commission  must  take  into  account  that,  with  the  end  of  the  transition  period 
provided  by  the  Withdrawal  Agreement  and  as  soon  as  the  interim  provision  under 
Article 782 of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will cease to apply, the 
United  Kingdom  will  administer,  apply  and  enforce  a  new  data  protection  regime 
compared to the one in place when it was bound by EU law. This may notably involve 
amendments or changes to the data protection framework assessed in this Decision, as 
well as other relevant developments. 

(289)  It is therefore appropriate to provide that this Decision will apply for a period of four 

years as of its entry into force. 

(290)  Where in particular information resulting from the monitoring of this Decision reveals 
that  the  findings  relating  to  the  adequacy  of  the  level  of  protection  ensured  in  the 
United Kingdom are still factually and legally justified, the Commission should, at the 
latest six months before this Decision ceases to apply, initiate the procedure to amend 
this Decision by extending its temporal scope, in principle, for an additional period of 
four  years.  Any  such  implementing  act  amending  this  Decision  is  to  be  adopted  in 
accordance  with  the  procedure  referred  to  in  Article  93(2)  of  Regulation  (EU) 
2016/679.

(292)  The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the 

Committee established under Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, 

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:  

Article 1 

1. 

2. 

For  the  purposes  of  Article  45  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  the  United  Kingdom 
ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred within the scope 
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 from the European Union to the United Kingdom. 

This decision does not cover personal data that is transferred for purposes of United 
Kingdom  immigration  control  or  that  otherwise  falls  within  the  scope  of  the 
exemption  from  certain  data  subject  rights  for  purposes  of  the  maintenance  of 
effective immigration control pursuant  to  paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 2 to  the DPA 
2018. 

Article 2 

Whenever  the  competent  supervisory  authorities  in  Member  States,  in  order  to  protect 
individuals with regard to the processing of their personal data, exercise their powers pursuant 
to  Article  58  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  with  respect  to  data  transfers  falling  within  the 
scope  of  application  set  out  in  Article  1,  the  Member  State  concerned  shall  inform  the 
Commission without delay.

5. 

Article 3 

The Commission  shall continuously monitor the  application of the legal  framework 
upon  which  this  Decision  is  based,  including  the  conditions  under  which  onward 
transfers are carried out, individual rights are exercised and United Kingdom public 
authorities have access to data transferred on the basis of this Decision, with a view 
to  assessing  whether  the  United  Kingdom  continues  to  ensure  an  adequate  level  of 
protection within the meaning of Article 1. 

The Member States and the Commission shall inform each other of cases where the 
Information Commissioner, or any other competent United Kingdom authority, fails 
to ensure compliance with the legal framework upon which this Decision is based. 

The Member States and the Commission shall inform  each other of any indications 
that interferences by United Kingdom public authorities with the right of individuals 
to the protection of their personal data go beyond what is strictly necessary, or that 
there is no effective legal protection against such interferences. 

Where  the  Commission  has  indications  that  an  adequate  level  of  protection  is  no 
longer  ensured,  the  Commission  shall  inform  the  competent  United  Kingdom 
authorities and may suspend, repeal or amend this Decision. 

The  Commission  may  suspend,  repeal  or  amend  this  Decision  if  the  lack  of 
cooperation  of  the  United  Kingdom  government  prevents  the  Commission  from 
determining whether the finding in Article 1(1) is affected.
