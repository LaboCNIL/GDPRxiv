The IDPC has today launched an online form which will facilitate the process for applicants to lodge an FOI complaint against the decision of a public authority following a request for access to information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.  The online form is accessible here. 


In addition, the IDPC has created a new page on this website where FOI decisions taken by the Commissioner will be published in full.  For the time being, decision notices issued during the current year will be uploaded but the intention is to gradually publish other decision notices issued in previous years.  The page to view the decision notices is accessible here.
