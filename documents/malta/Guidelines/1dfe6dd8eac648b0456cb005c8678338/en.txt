  Introduction 

This guidance  is intended for employers based in Malta which act as controllers (‘employers’) and 

intend to  collect  information about the  COVID-19 vaccination (‘vaccine’) status of their employees 

(‘vaccination status’).  

Information about the vaccination status is data concerning health, which under the GDPR (Art 9.1) 

constitute  a  special  category  of  personal  data.  By  nature,  special  categories  of  personal  data  are 

considered sensitive and merit enhanced protection and safeguards. 

Within this context and taking into account that a risk-based approach must be adopted, employers 

which are desirous to collect information about the vaccination status shall conduct an assessment 

on the impact of the perspective processing activities. This is required to ensure adherence to the data 

protection  principles  of  the  GDPR  (Art.  5)  and  overall  compliance  with  data  protection  law.  It  is 

remarked that such assessment  shall be  conducted  prior to  the  commencement  of the processing 

operation. 

Employers  may  refer  to  the  guidance  below,  which  explains  how  the  data  principles  of  the  GDPR 

should be assessed whilst carrying out such assessment. Employers shall also keep in mind that, by 

virtue of the  principle of accountability, they shall be  responsible  for and be able to demonstrate 

compliance with the data protection principles in their capacity of controllers. 

It has to be remarked that in the event that, as a result of the aforementioned assessment, employers 

establish that the  processing  is  likely  to  result  in  a  high risk  to  the  rights  and  freedoms of  natural 

persons,  then  they  are  bound  to  carry  out  a  fully-fledged  data  protection  impact  assessment,  in 

accordance with the GDPR (Art. 35).

  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency (GDPR, Art. 5.1.a) 

2.1  Lawfulness 

It  is  generally  prohibited  to  process  data  concerning  health  (GDPR,  Art.  9.1),  unless  an  exemption 

applies (GDPR, Art. 9.2). In the employment context, the following exemptions may be appropriate: 

 

 

 

 

i. 

the preventive or occupational medicine condition (GDPR, Art. 9.2.h). 

This condition is two-fold, and requires that the following conditions be fulfilled at the 

same time: 

a.  the  purpose(s)  for  the  processing  shall  be  clearly  selected  amongst:  preventive  or 

occupational  medicine,  the  assessment  of  the  working  capacity  of  the  employee, 

medical  diagnosis,  the  provision  of  health  or  social  care  or  treatment  or  the 

management of health or social care systems and services; and 

b.  Union or  Member  State  law  or  the  contract with  health  professional  subject  to  an 

obligation of secrecy on which the processing is founded are clearly individuated and 

documented; 

ii. 

the public health condition (Article 9.2.i). 

For this legal basis to apply, the following requirements must co-exist: 

a.  the reasons for processing information must be identified in the public interest in the 

area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health 

or  ensuring  high  standards  of  quality  and  safety  of  health  care  and  of  medicinal 

products or medical devices. 

b.  Union  or  Member  State  law  must  be  in  place  to  provide  for  suitable  and  specific 

measures  to  safeguard  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  the  data  subject,  in  particular 

professional secrecy. Such legal act must be clearly individuated and documented. 

As a general rule, consent does not apply to situations where there is an imbalance of power between 

the controller and the data subjects, such in an employer-employee relationship. In the employment 

context, unless the circumstances of the case provide otherwise, consent is not considered to be freely 

given and thus does not represent a valid legal basis.

2.2 Fairness 

Employers must make sure that by processing information about the vaccination status they do not 

engage in any potential unfair, discriminatory or otherwise unjustified treatment of employees. In 

the  event  that  employers  assess  that  the  collection  of  the  vaccination  status  is  likely  to  produce 

negative  consequences  for  employees,  such  as  for  example  infringement  of  human  and  /  or 

fundamentals  rights,  then  the  envisaged  processing  operation  runs  contrary  to  the  principle  of 

fairness and should not be carried out. 

To conduct this assessment, employers should take into account, for example that: 

due to their age, health status or profession, certain individuals have been given priority in the vaccine 

i. 

distribution program. Therefore, other individuals may not have been yet vaccinated at the time of 

collecting the vaccination status for reasons over which they had no control; and 

ii. 

the vaccine is voluntary. Hence, individuals have the right to decide whether to take it or otherwise, 

and they should not be prejudiced or otherwise discriminated for their choice in this respect. 

 

 

2.3 Transparency 

Employers must ensure that employees are duly informed about the processing of information about 

their vaccination status in the manner prescribed by the law. This is to ensure that full transparency 

is maintained during the course of the processing activity and that the employees remain in control 

of their personal data.  

This means that employers shall: 

draft and deliver to the employees data protection notices prepared in compliance with the GDPR (Art. 

i. 

13  or  Art.  14,  for  example  in  case  the  information  is  collected  by  a  medical  professional  acting  as 

processor); a read-and-sign approach is generally advisable; and 

ensure that the information contained within such notices and directed to employees is provided free 

ii. 

of charge, it is concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, using clear and plain language (GDPR, 

Art. 12).

  Purpose limitation (GDPR, Art. 5.1.b) 

The  principle  of  purpose  limitation  establishes  that  personal  data  shall  be  collected  for  specified, 

explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those 

purposes.  Employees  shall  assess  and  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  a  clear,  lawful 

compelling reason to process their employee’s vaccination status. In essence, employers can collect 

this  information  only  in  case  they  cannot  achieve  the  same  purpose  without  collecting  the  same 

information, or in a less intrusive manner. Hence, employers shall clarify and duly  document what 

they  intend  to  achieve  by collecting  information  about  the  vaccination  status  before  any  concrete 

processing operation is discharged. 

 

 

  Data minimisation (GDPR, Art. 5.1.c) 

Once determined the purpose(s) for processing information about the vaccination status, employers 

shall then assess what information is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation 

to such purpose(s). This is of utmost importance in connection with the fiduciary obligation which 

exists between the controller and the data subjects. 

When  feasible,  employers  may  consider  collecting  information  about  the  vaccination  status  from 

employees without collecting copies of actual medical certificates, if not strictly necessary. Such key 

information may be combined with minimum identifiers to single out the employee concerned; any 

supplementary or additional information which is not required to conduct the processing operation 

and to achieve the pre-defined purpose(s) of such activity shall not be collected.  

 

 

  Accuracy (GDPR, Art. 5.1.d) 

Taking into account that obsolete data has no business value and could even result harmful, employers 

shall commit to keep the information they process about the vaccination status accurate and up-to-

date and to rectify or erase without delay information which is inaccurate.

  Storage limitation (GDPR, Art. 5.1.e) 

Having defined the lawful ground and the purpose(s) for collecting the vaccination status, employers 

should establish for how long the information collected is necessary to serve to such purpose(s). Once 

that is established, employers should ensure that information about the vaccination status is kept in 

a  form  which  permits  identification  of  the  employees  only  for  the  duration  of  the  previously 

designated period. 

 

 

  Integrity and confidentiality (GDPR, Art. 5.1.f) 

Giving  due  regard  to  the  sensitivity  of  information  about  the  vaccination  status  of  employees, 

employers should assess the security risk posed by processing such information. After that, employers 

should  select  and  implement  appropriate  technical  and  organisational  measures  to  address  the 

encountered risks. These measures may involve the mitigation, transfer, avoidance or retention of 

risks, and may include, for example, the implementation of the following controls: 

 

 

only  authorised  and designated  individuals  within the  organisation should have  the  right  to  access 

i. 

information about the vaccination status. These rights are to be assigned on a need-to-know basis. As 

a consequence, in structured organisations, only certain individuals within certain departments (ex. 

HR) shall be entitled to process the information about the vaccination status; 

such  designated  individuals  should  be  made  aware  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  information  they  are 

ii. 

entrusted with, and should be instructed on how to report or escalate any personal data breach which 

may occur to such data; 

iii. 

iv. 

information about the vaccination status should be kept confidential, stored in a secure environment 

and kept segregated from other information about the same individual; and 

at  the  expiry  of  the  retention  period,  the  information  (and  any  copy  thereof)  should  be  securely 

disposed of in an irreversible manner.
