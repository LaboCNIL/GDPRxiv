Report on the supervisory matter
The obligation for the personal data controller - ie. private and public
actors - to report certain personal data incidents to the Data Inspectorate
was introduced on 25 May 2018 by the Data Protection Regulation1 (GDPR).
A corresponding notification obligation was introduced on 1 August 2018 in
the Criminal Data Act (BDL) for so-called competent authorities.2 The obligation to
report personal data incidents (hereinafter referred to as incidents) aims to strengthen
privacy protection by the Data Inspectorate receiving information about
the incident and may choose to take action when the inspectorate deems it appropriate
is needed for the personal data controller to handle the incident on one
satisfactorily and take steps to prevent something similar
occurs again.
According to ch. 1, a personal data incident is § 6 BDL a security incident that
leads to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration; or
unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data. IN
the preparatory work for the law states that it is usually a question of an unplanned
event that adversely affects the security of personal data
and which have serious consequences for the protection of data.3 En
personal data incident may, for example, be that personal data has been sent
to the wrong recipient, that access to the personal data has been lost, that
computer equipment that stores personal data has been lost or stolen, that
someone inside or outside the organization takes part in information like that
lacks authority to.
A personal data incident that is not dealt with quickly and appropriately can
entail risks to the data subject's rights or freedoms. An incident can
lead to physical, material or intangible damage by, for example

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General
Data Protection Regulation).
2 A competent authority is in accordance with ch. § 6 BDL an authority that deals
personal data for the purpose of preventing, deterring or detecting criminal activities, investigating
or prosecute crimes, enforce criminal sanctions or maintain public order and
security.

discrimination, identity theft, identity fraud, damaged reputation,
financial loss and breach of confidentiality or secrecy.
There can be many reasons why a personal data incident occurs. Of
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's report series Reported personal data incidents under
The period May 2018 - December 2019 shows that the most common causes
behind the reported incidents were i.a. the human factor, technical errors,
antagonistic attacks and shortcomings in organizational routines or processes.4
The Data Inspectorate has initiated this supervisory case against the Swedish Tax Agency with the aim of
check if the authority has procedures in place to detect
personal data incidents and whether the authority has and has had routines for
to handle incidents according to the Criminal Data Act. The review also includes that
check whether the Swedish Tax Agency has routines for documenting incidents
which meets the requirements of the Criminal Data Regulation (BDF) and if
the authority has carried out information and training initiatives on
personal data incidents.
The audit began with a letter to the Swedish Tax Agency on 4 December 2019
and was followed up with a request for completion on 4 March 2020.
The authority's response to the supervisory letter was received on 27 January 2020 and
the supplement was received on March 25, 2020.

Applicable regulations
According to ch. 3, the person responsible for personal data must § 2 BDL, by appropriate
technical and organizational measures, ensure and be able to demonstrate that
the processing of personal data is in accordance with the constitution and that it
data subjects' rights are protected. This means that competent authorities,
Using these measures, should not just ensure that
the data protection regulations are followed but must also be able to show that this is the case. Which
technical and organizational measures required to protect
personal data is regulated in ch. 8 § BDL.

In the preparatory work for the law, it is stated that organizational measures referred to in section 2 are
i.a. to have internal strategies for data protection, to inform and educate
staff and to ensure a clear division of responsibilities. Measures such as
taken to show that the treatment is in accordance with the constitution, e.g. be
documentation of IT systems, treatments and measures taken and
technical traceability through logging and log monitoring. What measures
to be taken may be decided after an assessment in each individual case.5 The measures shall
reviewed and updated as needed. The measures it
the person responsible for personal data shall take in accordance with this provision shall, in accordance with ch.
§ 1 BDF be reasonable taking into account the nature, scope of treatment,
context and purpose and the specific risks of the treatment.
Of ch. 3 Section 8 of the BDL states that the person responsible for personal data shall take
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect them
personal data processed, in particular against unauthorized or unauthorized use
treatment and against loss, destruction or other unintentional damage. IN
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that security must include
access protection for equipment, control of data media, storage control,
user control, access control, communication control, input control,
transport control, restoration, reliability and data integrity. This
enumeration, however, is not exhaustive. As an example of organizational
security measures include the establishment of a security policy,
security controls and follow-up, computer security training and
information on the importance of following current safety procedures. Routines for
reporting and follow-up of personal data incidents also constitute such
measures.6
What circumstances should be taken into account in order to achieve an appropriate level of protection
is regulated in ch. 11 § BDF. The measures must achieve a level of safety
appropriate taking into account the technical possibilities, the costs of
the measures, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment, and
the specific risks of the treatment. Special consideration should be given in which
the extent to which sensitive personal data is processed and how sensitive to privacy
other personal data processed is.7 Violation of provisions in

Chapter 3 2 and 8 §§ BDL can lead to sanction fees according to ch. 1 § 2 BDL.
According to ch. 3, the person responsible for personal data must § 14 BDF document all
personal data incidents. The documentation must report the circumstances
about the incident, its effects and the measures taken as a result
of that. The person responsible for personal data must document all that occurred
incidents regardless of whether it must be reported to the Data Inspectorate or not.8
The documentation must enable the supervisory authority to:
check compliance with the provision in question. Failure to
documenting personal data incidents can lead to penalty fees
according to ch. 6 1 § BDL.
A personal data incident must also, according to ch. § 9 BDL, notified to
The Data Inspectorate no later than 72 hours after the person responsible for personal data
become aware of the incident. A report does not need to be made if it is
it is unlikely that the incident has or will entail any risk
for undue invasion of the data subject's privacy. Of ch. 3 § 10
BDL states that the person responsible for personal data must in certain cases inform it
registered affected by the incident. Failure to report one
personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate can lead to administrative
sanction fees according to ch. 6 1 § BDL.9

Justification of the decision
The Data Inspectorate's review
In this supervisory matter, the Data Inspectorate has a position to decide on
The Swedish Tax Agency has documented routines for detecting
personal data incidents according to the Criminal Data Act and if the authority has
and has had routines for handling incidents since the BDL came into force.
The review also covers the issue of compliance with the requirement

information and training initiatives for its employees with a focus on
handling of personal data incidents according to BDL.
The review does not include the content of the routines or training efforts
but is focused on verifying that the reviewing authority has
routines on site and that it has implemented training initiatives for
employees regarding personal data incidents. The review includes
however, if the authority's routines contain instructions to document them
information required by the Criminal Data Regulation.
Routines for detecting personal data incidents
The personal data that competent authorities handle within the framework of their
law enforcement and crime investigation activities are to a large extent of
sensitive and privacy sensitive nature. The nature of the business is high
requirements on the ability of law enforcement agencies to protect them
information was registered through the necessary protection measures to e.g.
prevent an incident from occurring.
The obligation to report personal data incidents according to ch. 9 § BDL
shall be construed in the light of the general requirements to take appropriate technical and
organizational measures, to ensure appropriate security for
personal data, which is prescribed in ch. 2 and 8 §§. An ability to fast
Detecting and reporting an incident is a key factor. Because they
law enforcement agencies must be able to live up to
the reporting requirement, they must have internal routines and technical capabilities for
to detect an incident.
Based on the needs of the business and with the support of risk and vulnerability analyzes
competent authorities can identify the areas where there is a greater risk
that an incident may occur. Based on the analyzes, the authorities can then
use various instruments to detect a security threat. These can be
both technical and organizational measures. The starting point is that they
the safety measures taken must provide adequate protection and that incidents do not
should occur.
Examples of technical measures include intrusion detectors as automatic
analyzes and detects data breaches and the use of
log analysis tool to detect unauthorized access
(log deviations). An increased insight into the business' "normal" network

traffic patterns help to identify things that deviate from the normal
the traffic picture towards, for example, servers, applications or data files.
Organizational measures can, for example, be the adoption of internal strategies
for data protection relating to internal rules, guidelines, routines and different types of
governing documents and policy documents.10 Guidelines and rules for handling
personal data, routines for incident management and log follow-up11 constitute
examples of such strategies. Periodic follow-up of assigned
authorizations is another example of organizational measures. In a competent
authority, there shall be procedures for allocation, change, removal and
regular verification of privileges.12 Information and training of
staff on the rules and routines for incident management to be followed
also examples of such measures.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Swedish Tax Agency has mainly stated the following. The personal data incidents
which is discovered and reported is based on the individual manager and
the employee is observant and has the ability and knowledge to be able to
identify a suspected personal data incident. All managers and
employees have a responsibility to report suspects
personal data incidents. Information about what could be a suspect
personal data incident has been communicated to all managers and
employees at the tax crime unit (SBE). The Swedish Tax Agency further states that
the authority has implemented organizational and technical routines such as
log follow-up and authorization assignment. In terms of technical solutions
states that the central computer systems for the administrators of the tax crime unit
is the Swedish Tax Agency's criminal investigation support (RIF BU) for the criminal investigator
operations (the pre-investigation operation) and the Swedish Tax Agency
intelligence register (SKUR) for the intelligence activities. RIF BU is
built and designed in such a way that it has a number of technical routines
to counteract personal data incidents. Regarding organizational
measures state that access to information and permissions is controlled
through the use of various access control systems and access cards.
The access control system has registers of all users and theirs
authorizations and transactions against the system being continuously checked against

the register. In addition, during 2018-2019, the Swedish Tax Agency has trained and
informed employees and managers within the tax crime unit in
data protection issues. All employees have received information especially about e.g.
how a personal data incident is to be reported and what support is available for
to report and assess personal data incidents.
The Data Inspectorate can state that the Swedish Tax Agency has routines for
detect personal data incidents on site.
The obligation to take precautionary measures to detect
personal data incidents are not linked to a specific time but the measures
shall be continuously reviewed and, if necessary, changed. For the Swedish Tax Agency to
be able to maintain an adequate level of protection of personal data over time
recommends the Data Inspectorate, with the support of ch. § 6 BDL, att
the authority regularly evaluates the effectiveness of those taken
security measures to detect personal data incidents and that
the authority updates these if necessary.
Routines for handling personal data incidents
In order to be able to live up to the requirements for organizational measures in ch. § 8
BDL, the person responsible for personal data must have documented internal routines such as
describes the process to be followed when an incident has been detected or
occurred, including how to limit, manage and recover the incident,
and how the risk assessment is to be carried out and how the incident is to be reported internally
and to the Data Inspectorate. The routines must state e.g. what a
personal data incident is / can be, when an incident needs to be reported, and
to whom, what is to be documented, the division of responsibilities and which
information that should be provided in the context of notification to
The Data Inspectorate.
The Data Inspectorate's control of routines for handling
personal data incidents refer to the time from the entry into force of the Criminal Data Act
i.e. on August 1, 2018.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Swedish Tax Agency has i.a. stated the following. The authority has routines / guidelines
to report and manage detected personal data incidents. The boss
or employees who discover a suspected personal data incident within

9 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-13114

SBE must report this in the Swedish Tax Agency's User Support or the IT portal via
one
e-service. SBE has its own entrance in User Support and the IT portal called
"Personal data incident according to the Criminal Data Act (SBE)". The Swedish Tax Agency has i.a.
submitted Routine personal data incidents dated 2019-05-09 and
Complementary internal routine at SBE for reporting of
personal data incidents dated 2019-08-13 that supplement it
the former routine. The Swedish Tax Agency states that the authority's routine
personal data incidents are primarily developed for the Data Protection Regulation,
but also takes into account BDL and BDF. The Swedish Tax Agency further states that
the authority in May 2018 established a support to identify, report,
assess and manage personal data incidents (Report 2018-05-18
Data Protection Ordinance Managing Personal Data Incidents). The report
intended to support the Swedish Tax Agency's activities in the event of personal data incidents
in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation and to support the activities of
the tax crime unit in the event of personal data incidents according to the Criminal Data Act.
On 26 November 2018, the Swedish Tax Agency adopted the document Routine
personal data incidents (updated on 9 May 2019 and 30 respectively
December 2019). The Swedish Tax Agency states that there were special routines / guidelines
for handling personal data incidents and a digital management system
for reported personal data incidents on site when BDL came into force
August 1, 2018.
Taking into account the documents submitted and what has emerged in
the case, the Data Inspectorate states that the Tax Agency from the time then
the Criminal Data Act came into force has had and has routines for dealing with
personal data incidents on site.
To be able to handle discovered personal data incidents in a correct way
and counteract its effects and risks on the data subjects' personalities
Integrity is important. The Data Inspectorate therefore recommends, with the support of
Chapter 5 § 6 BDL, that the Tax Agency regularly checks that the routines for
handling of personal data incidents is followed.
Routines for documentation of personal data incidents
A prerequisite for the Data Inspectorate to be able to check
compliance with the documentation requirement of incidents in ch. § 14 BDF is that
the documentation includes certain information that should always be included.
The documentation shall include all details of the incident, including its

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-13114

reasons, what happened and the personal data involved. It should too
contain the consequences of the incident and the corrective actions taken
personal data controller has taken.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Swedish Tax Agency has mainly stated the following. It is
the responsibility of the personal data coordinators (PU-IK) that the reports become
recorded, processed and documented. It is further stated that in support of
processing and documentation of reported personal data incidents
there is a digital management system where all measures taken
documented. There are also supporting documents for record keeping of
personal data incidents. Of the authority's Routine personal data incidents
as well as their Complementary internal routine at SBE for reporting by
personal data incidents it appears that all personal data incidents must
documented. The documentation must state the circumstances surrounding it
the personal data incident, its effects and the measures taken
occasion of it.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Tax Agency has an internal IT system for
to report personal data incidents. In addition, it appears from the submitted
the routines that all personal data incidents must be documented and that
has specified which information the documentation must include.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Tax Agency's routines for documentation
meets the requirements of the relevant provision.
To be able to document occurred personal data incidents correctly
and thereby counteract the risk of the documentation becoming deficient or
incomplete is important. Inadequate documentation can lead to
the incidents are not handled and remedied properly, which can get
impact on privacy protection. The Data Inspectorate therefore recommends,
with the support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Tax Agency implements regular
controls of the internal documentation of personal data incidents.
Information and education about personal data incidents
The staff is an important resource in the security work. It's not just enough
internal procedures, rules or governing documents if users do not follow them.
All users must understand that the handling of personal data must take place in one go
legally secure and that it is more serious not to report an incident than

1 1 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-13114

to report e.g. a mistake or a mistake. It is therefore required that everyone
users receive adequate training and clear information on data protection.
The person responsible for personal data must inform and train his staff in matters
on data protection including the handling of personal data incidents. Of
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's report series Reported Personal Data Incidents under
in the period 2018-2019, it appears that the human factor is the most common
the cause of reported personal data incidents. 13 These mainly consist of
individuals who, consciously or unconsciously, do not follow internal routines
processing of personal data or made a mistake in handling
personal data. About half of the incidents are due to it
The human factor is about misplaced letters and emails.
In the Data Inspectorate's opinion, this underlines the importance of
internal routines and technical safety measures need to be supplemented with
ongoing training, information and other measures to increase knowledge and
awareness among employees.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
On the question of how information and education about incidents is provided
employees, the Swedish Tax Agency has stated i.a. following. The Swedish Tax Agency has internal
training in data protection for employees and managers. The Swedish Tax Agency has
trained and informed all employees and managers within SBE through
that during 2018-2019 they have undergone the Swedish Tax Agency's training in
data protection issues. During the spring / summer of 2018, the employees took part
of educational films produced by the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency about
the data protection reform, including the Criminal Data Act. In addition, they have received
information on the Data Protection Regulation and the Criminal Data Act, in particular on
reporting of personal data incidents. Section heads have also left
information to all employees that personal data incidents should
reported, how to proceed to report as well as what may be one
personal data incident. All managers at SBE have received information from
The Swedish Tax Agency's data protection representative. Every manager and employee has completed
a basic digital course on the Data Protection Regulation, which includes about two
hours of self-study.
Report 2019: 1, report 2019: 3 and report 2020: 2. MSB has drawn similar conclusions
its annual report for serious IT incidents, ie. that most of the incidents are due
human mistakes, see https://www.msb.se/sv/aktuellt/nyheter/2020/april/arsrapporten-forallvarliga-it-incidenter-2019-ar-slappt/

In the light of what appears from the investigation, the Data Inspectorate considers
that the Swedish Tax Agency has shown that the authority has provided information and
training on the handling of personal data incidents to their employees
To maintain competence and ensure that new staff receive
education, recurring information and education is important
the employees and hired staff. The Data Inspectorate recommends, with
support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Tax Agency provides employees with ongoing information
and recurring training in the handling of personal data incidents
and the obligation to report these.
