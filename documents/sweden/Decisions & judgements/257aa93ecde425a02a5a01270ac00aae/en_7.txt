Account of the supervisory matter
The obligation of the personal data controller – i.e. private and public
actors - to report certain personal data incidents to the Swedish Data Protection Authority
was introduced on 25 May 2018 through the Data Protection Regulation1 (GDPR).
The corresponding notification obligation was introduced on 1 August 2018 in
the crime data act (BDL) for so-called competent authorities.2 The obligation to
reporting personal data incidents (hereinafter referred to as incident) aims to strengthen
privacy protection by the Data Inspectorate receiving information about
the incident and may choose to take action when the inspection judges that it
is needed for the personal data controller to handle the incident in one go
satisfactory way and take measures to prevent something like that
occurs again.
A personal data incident is according to ch. 1 § 6 BDL a security incident which
leads to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, or
unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data. IN
the preparatory work for the law states that it is usually an unplanned one
event that affects the security of personal data in a negative way
and which entail serious consequences for the protection of the data.3 One
personal data incident can be, for example, that personal data has been sent
to the wrong recipient, that access to the personal data has been lost, that
computer equipment that stores personal data has been lost or stolen, that
someone inside or outside the organization accesses information like that
lacks authorization to.
A personal data incident that is not quickly and appropriately addressed can
entail risks for the data subject's rights or freedoms. An incident can
lead to physical, material or immaterial damage through, for example

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016
on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and on the repeal of Directive 95/46/EC (general
data protection regulation).
2 A competent authority is according to ch. 1 § 6 BDL an authority that processes
personal data for the purpose of preventing, preventing or detecting criminal activity, investigate
or prosecuting offences, enforcing criminal penalties or maintaining public order and
security.

discrimination, identity theft, identity fraud, damaged reputation,
financial loss and breach of confidentiality or confidentiality.
There can be many reasons why a personal data incident occurs. Of
Datainspektionen's report series Reported personal data incidents under
period May 2018 - December 2019 it appears that the most common causes
behind the reported incidents was i.a. the human factor, technical errors,
antagonistic attacks as well as deficiencies in organizational routines or processes.4
The Data Inspectorate has initiated this supervisory case against the Public Prosecutor's Office i
purpose of checking whether the authority has routines in place to detect
personal data incidents and whether the authority has and has had routines for
to handle personal data incidents according to the Criminal Data Act. In the review
also includes checking whether the Public Prosecutor's Office has routines for
documentation of incidents that meet the requirements of
the crime data regulation (BDF) and whether the authority has implemented
information and training efforts regarding personal data incidents.
The inspection began with a letter to the Public Prosecutor's Office on 4 December
2019 and was followed up with the request for completion on March 4, 2020.
The authority's response to the supervisory letter was received on 17 January 2020 and
the supplement was received on March 25, 2020.

Applicable regulations
The person in charge of personal data must according to ch. 3. § 2 BDL, by appropriate means
technical and organizational measures, ensure and be able to demonstrate that
the processing of personal data is constitutional and that it
data subject's rights are protected. This means that competent authorities,
by means of these measures, shall not only ensure that
the data protection regulations are followed but must also be able to demonstrate that this is the case. Which
technical and organizational measures required to protect
personal data is regulated in ch. 3. § 8 BDL.

In the preparatory work for the law, it is stated that organizational measures referred to in § 2 are
i.a. to have internal strategies for data protection, to inform and educate
the staff and to ensure a clear division of responsibilities. Measures such as
taken to show that the processing is constitutional can e.g. be
documentation of IT systems, treatments and measures taken and
technical traceability through logging and log follow-up. What actions that
must be taken may be decided after an assessment in each individual case.5 The measures must
reviewed and updated as necessary. The actions that it
personal data controller must take according to this provision must according to ch. 3
§ 1 BDF be reasonable taking into account the nature, scope,
context and purpose and the particular risks of the processing.
Of ch. 3 § 8 BDL states that the person in charge of personal data must take
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect them
personal data that is processed, especially against unauthorized or unauthorized persons
processing and against loss, destruction or other accidental damage. IN
the preparatory work for the Crime Data Act states that the security must include
equipment access protection, data media control, storage control,
user control, access control, communication control, input control,
transport control, recovery, operational security and data integrity. This one
However, the enumeration is not exhaustive. As an example of organizational
security measures may include the establishment of a security policy,
checks and follow-up of security, training in data security and
information about the importance of following current safety procedures. Routines for
notification and follow-up of personal data incidents also constitute such
actions.6
What circumstances should be considered to achieve an appropriate level of protection
is regulated in ch. 3. § 11 BDF. The measures must achieve a level of security
which is appropriate taking into account the technical possibilities, the costs of
the measures, the nature, extent, context and purpose of the processing, as well as
the particular risks of the treatment. Special consideration should be given in which
extent to which sensitive personal data is processed and how privacy-sensitive
other personal data processed are.7 Violation of regulations i

3 ch. §§ 2 and 8 BDL can lead to penalty fees according to ch. 6. 1 § 2 BDL.
The person in charge of personal data must according to ch. 3. § 14 BDF document all
personal data incidents. The documentation must report the circumstances
about the incident, its effects and the measures taken as a result
of that. The personal data controller must document all incidents
incidents regardless of whether it must be reported to the Data Protection Authority or not.8
The documentation must enable the supervisory authority to
check compliance with the current provision. Failure to
documenting personal data incidents may result in penalty fees
according to ch. 6 § 1 BDL.
A personal data incident must also, according to ch. 3 § 9 BDL, reported to
Datainspektionen no later than 72 hours after the personal data controller
became aware of the incident. A report does not need to be made if it is
unlikely that the incident has caused or will cause any risk
for improper intrusion into the data subject's personal privacy. Of ch. 3 Section 10
BDL states that the person in charge of personal data must inform it in certain cases
data subjects affected by the incident. Failure to report a
personal data incident to the Swedish Data Protection Authority can lead to administrative
penalty fees according to ch. 6 § 1 BDL.9

information and training efforts for its employees with a focus on
handling of personal data incidents according to BDL.
The review does not cover the content of the routines or training efforts
but is focused on checking that the reviewing authority has
routines in place and that it has carried out training efforts for
the employees regarding personal data incidents. The review includes
however, if the authority's procedures contain instructions to document them
information required under the Criminal Data Ordinance.
Procedures for detecting personal data incidents
The personal data that competent authorities handle within the framework of their
law enforcement and criminal investigation activities are largely off
sensitive and privacy-sensitive nature. The nature of the business sets high standards
demands on the law enforcement authorities' ability to protect them
information was recorded through the necessary protective measures in order to, among other things,
prevent an incident from occurring.
The obligation to report personal data incidents according to ch. 3 § 9 BDL
shall be interpreted in the light of the general requirements to take appropriate technical and
organizational measures, to ensure appropriate security for
personal data, which is prescribed in ch. 3 Sections 2 and 8. An ability to quickly
detecting and reporting an incident is a key factor. Because they
the law enforcement authorities must be able to live up to
the reporting requirement, they must have internal procedures and technical capabilities for
to detect an incident.
Based on the needs of the business and with the support of risk and vulnerability analyses
competent authorities can identify the areas where there is a greater risk
that an incident may occur. Based on the analyses, the authorities can then
use various instruments to detect a security threat. These can be
both technical and organizational measures. The starting point is that they
the security measures taken must provide sufficient protection and that incidents do not
shall occur.
Examples of technical measures include intrusion detectors that automatically
analyzes and detects data breaches and use of
log analysis tools to be able to detect unauthorized access
(log deviations). An increased insight into the business's "normal" network

traffic patterns help identify things that deviate from the normal
the traffic picture against, for example, servers, applications or data files.
Organizational measures can, for example, be the adoption of internal strategies
for data protection relating to internal rules, guidelines, routines and various types of
steering documents and policy documents.10 Guidelines and rules for handling of
personal data, routines for incident management and log follow-up11 constitute
examples of such strategies. Periodic follow-up of assigned
permissions are another example of organizational action. In a competent
authority, there must be procedures for allocation, change, removal and
regular control of authorizations.12 Information to and training of
staff about the incident management rules and procedures to be followed are
also examples of such measures.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The public prosecutor's office has essentially stated the following. The authority has one
number of technical solutions and organizational routines to, on both technical
level as at the user level, detect deviations in the IT environment. Based on it
the information they can discover what could constitute or imply
risk of a personal data incident. Regarding organizational measures
it appears from the investigation that the Public Prosecutor's Office has written procedures for
handling of personal data incidents and that information about this is available
on the authority's intranet. The authority has also carried out training for
its staff.
The Data Inspectorate can state that the Public Prosecutor's Office has routines to
detect personal data incidents on the spot.
The duty to take security measures to detect
personal data incidents are not tied to a specific time but the actions
must be continuously reviewed and, if necessary, changed. In order to
The public prosecutor's office must be able to maintain a sufficient level of protection of
personal data over time recommends the Data Inspectorate, with the support of
5 ch. § 6 BDL, that the authority regularly evaluates the effectiveness of the

the security measures taken to detect personal data incidents and
that the authority updates these if necessary.
Procedures for handling personal data incidents
In order to live up to the requirements for organizational measures in ch. 3. Section 8
BDL, the personal data controller must have documented internal routines that
describes the process to be followed when an incident has been detected or
occurred, including how the incident will be contained, managed and recovered,
as well as how the risk assessment should be carried out and how the incident should be reported internally
and to the Swedish Data Protection Authority. The routines must include, among other things, what a
personal data incident is/can be, when an incident needs to be reported, and
to whom, what must be documented, the distribution of responsibilities and which
information that should be provided within the framework of notification to
The Swedish Data Protection Authority.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's control of procedures for handling
personal data incidents refer to the time from the entry into force of the Criminal Data Act
i.e. on August 1, 2018.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The prosecutor's office has, among other things, stated the following. The authority has one
documented routine for reporting personal data incidents. Like one
the first stage of this routine includes internally reporting events that would
could be a personal data incident to the authority's central office
support function. The support function forwards the information to
people in the authority's IT management group who then reassess
the incident is a personal data incident and whether it should be reported to
The Swedish Data Protection Authority. The public prosecutor's office has submitted the agency's routine
for reporting personal data incidents dated 2018-07-09 (revised
2018-11-27) as well as an extract of information available on the authority's website
intranet. The authority further states that it is followed in assessment and action
the instructions published on the Swedish Data Protection Authority's website.
Taking into account the submitted documents and what appeared in
the case, the Data Inspectorate states that the Prosecutor's Office from
the time when the Criminal Data Act came into force has had and has routines to
handle personal data incidents on site.

To be able to handle detected personal data incidents correctly
and counteract its effects and risks for the data subjects' personal lives
integrity is important. The Swedish Data Protection Authority therefore recommends, with the support of
5 ch. § 6 BDL, that the Public Prosecutor's Office regularly checks that
the routines for handling personal data incidents are followed.
Procedures for documentation of personal data incidents
A prerequisite for the Data Inspection Authority to be able to check
compliance with the documentation requirement of incidents in ch. 3. § 14 BDF is that
the documentation includes certain information that should always be included.
The documentation must include all details of the incident, including its
reasons, what happened and the personal data affected. It should also
contain the consequences of the incident and the corrective actions that it takes
taken by the data controller.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The public prosecutor's office has mainly stated the following. The authority's
decisions are documented and kept in a diary in the Public Prosecutor's Office
diarium and the authority refer to their procedures for handling
personal data incidents. The routine shows that if you suspect that a
personal data incident has occurred, this must be reported to without delay
their central support function. This applies regardless of whether the incident has
occurred in administrative or law enforcement activities. In this way
the reported incidents are also documented. Then do
the authority's IT department an assessment of whether the incident should be reported
further to the Data Protection Authority. If the assessment means that the incident does not
must be reported, the reason for it must be justified and documented in writing.
The public prosecutor's office further states that the assessment support used for
Incidents that have occurred are what can be found on the inspection's website, i.a.
The Data Inspectorate's form for reporting personal data incidents according to
BDL.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Public Prosecutor's Office has an IT system for
that i.a. report incidents related to personal data. In addition, it appears from
the authority's routine for reporting personal data incidents that everyone
incidents must be documented regardless of whether they are reported to the inspection or
not. However, the Data Inspectorate notes that the current routine lacks one
description of which information the documentation must cover.

Being able to document personal data incidents that have occurred in an accurate manner
way and thus counteract the risk of the documentation becoming deficient
or incomplete is important. Insufficient documentation can lead to
the incidents are not handled and remedied correctly, which can get
impact on privacy protection. The Swedish Data Protection Authority therefore recommends,
with the support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Prosecutor's Office's routines for
reporting of personal data incidents is supplemented with a description of
which details of an incident to be documented. In addition
the Public Prosecutor's Office should carry out regular checks of the internal
the documentation of personal data incidents.
Information and training regarding personal data incidents
The staff is an important resource in security work. It's just not enough
internal procedures, rules or governing documents if users do not follow them.
All users must understand that handling of personal data must take place in one
legally secure way and that it is more serious not to report an incident yet
to report e.g. a mistake or an error. It is therefore required that all
users receive adequate training and clear information about data protection.
The person in charge of personal data must inform and train his staff in matters
on data protection including handling of personal data incidents. Of
Datainspektionen's report series Reported personal data incidents under
period 2018-2019, it appears that the human factor is the most common
the cause of reported personal data incidents. 13 These mainly consist of
individuals who, knowingly or unknowingly, do not follow internal procedures at
processing of personal data or committed a mistake in the handling of
personal data. About half of the incidents are due to it
the human factor is about misdirected letters and e-mails.
According to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, this underlines the importance of
internal procedures and technical security measures need to be supplemented with
ongoing training, information and other measures to increase knowledge and
awareness among employees.

Report 2019:1, report 2019:3 and report 2020:2. Similar conclusions have been drawn by MSB
its annual report for serious IT incidents, i.e. that most of the incidents are due to
human mistakes, see https://www.msb.se/sv/aktuellt/nyheter/2020/april/arsrapporten-forallvarliga-it-incidenter-2019-ar-slappt/

The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
When asked how information and training about incidents is provided
employees, the Public Prosecutor's Office has stated i.a. following. A collective
information on personal data processing can be found at the Public Prosecutor's Office
intranet. The authority has also informed about the procedures for handling
personal data incidents to chief administrators and IT coordinators in it
operational activities. Furthermore, it is stated that special webinars have
carried out for different professional categories within the authority.
Against the background of what appears from the investigation, the Data Protection Authority believes
that the Public Prosecutor's Office has shown that the authority has provided information and
training on handling personal data incidents to its employees.
To maintain competence and ensure that new staff get
training, it is important to have recurring information and training
the employees and hired personnel. The Swedish Data Protection Authority recommends, with
support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Public Prosecutor's Office provides the employees on an ongoing basis
information and recurring training in the handling of
personal data incidents and the obligation to report them.

This decision has been made by unit manager Charlotte Waller Dahlberg after
presentation by lawyer Maria Angelica Westerberg. At the final
IT security specialist Ulrika is also handling the case
Sundling and the lawyer Jonas Agnvall participated.
