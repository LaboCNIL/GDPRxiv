Report on the supervisory matter
The obligation for the personal data controller - ie. private and public
actors - to report certain personal data incidents to the Data Inspectorate
was introduced on 25 May 2018 by the Data Protection Regulation1 (GDPR).
A corresponding notification obligation was introduced on 1 August 2018 in
the Criminal Data Act (BDL) for so-called competent authorities.2 The obligation to
report personal data incidents (hereinafter referred to as incidents) aims to strengthen
privacy protection by the Data Inspectorate receiving information about
the incident and may choose to take action when the inspectorate deems it appropriate
is needed for the personal data controller to handle the incident on one
satisfactorily and take steps to prevent something similar
occurs again.
According to ch. 1, a personal data incident is § 6 BDL a security incident that
leads to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration; or
unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data. IN
the preparatory work for the law states that it is usually a question of an unplanned
event that adversely affects the security of personal data
and which have serious consequences for the protection of data.3 En
personal data incident may, for example, be that personal data has been sent
to the wrong recipient, that access to the personal data has been lost, that
computer equipment that stores personal data has been lost or stolen, that
someone inside or outside the organization takes part in information like that
lacks authority to.
A personal data incident that is not dealt with quickly and appropriately can
entail risks to the data subject's rights or freedoms. An incident can
lead to physical, material or intangible damage by, for example

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016
on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General
Data Protection Regulation).
2 A competent authority is in accordance with ch. § 6 BDL an authority that deals
personal data for the purpose of preventing, deterring or detecting criminal activities, investigating
or prosecute crimes, enforce criminal sanctions or maintain public order and
security.

discrimination, identity theft, identity fraud, damaged reputation,
financial loss and breach of confidentiality or secrecy.
There can be many reasons why a personal data incident occurs. Of
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's report series Reported personal data incidents under
The period May 2018 - December 2019 shows that the most common causes
behind the reported incidents were i.a. the human factor, technical errors,
antagonistic attacks and shortcomings in organizational routines or processes.4
The Data Inspectorate has initiated this supervisory case against the Swedish Prison and Probation Service for the purpose
to check whether the authority has procedures in place to detect
personal data incidents and whether the authority has and has had routines for
to handle personal data incidents according to the Criminal Data Act. In the review
also includes checking whether the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has routines for documentation
of incidents that meet the requirements of the Criminal Data Regulation (BDF) and
if the authority has carried out information and training initiatives around
personal data incidents.
The inspection began with a letter to the Swedish Prison and Probation Service on 4 December 2019
and was followed up with a request for completion on 4 March 2020.
The authority's response to the supervisory letter was received on 4 February 2020 and
the supplement was received on April 9, 2020.

Applicable regulations
According to ch. 3, the person responsible for personal data must § 2 BDL, by appropriate
technical and organizational measures, ensure and be able to demonstrate that
the processing of personal data is in accordance with the constitution and that it
data subjects' rights are protected. This means that competent authorities,
Using these measures, should not just ensure that
the data protection regulations are followed but must also be able to show that this is the case. Which
technical and organizational measures required to protect
personal data is regulated in ch. 8 § BDL.

In the preparatory work for the law, it is stated that organizational measures referred to in section 2 are
i.a. to have internal strategies for data protection, to inform and educate
staff and to ensure a clear division of responsibilities. Measures such as
taken to show that the treatment is in accordance with the constitution, e.g. be
documentation of IT systems, treatments and measures taken and
technical traceability through logging and log monitoring. What measures
to be taken may be decided after an assessment in each individual case.5 The measures shall
reviewed and updated as needed. The measures it
the person responsible for personal data shall take in accordance with this provision shall, in accordance with ch.
§ 1 BDF be reasonable taking into account the nature, scope of treatment,
context and purpose and the specific risks of the treatment.
Of ch. 3 Section 8 of the BDL states that the person responsible for personal data shall take
appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect them
personal data processed, in particular against unauthorized or unauthorized use
treatment and against loss, destruction or other unintentional damage. IN
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that security must include
access protection for equipment, control of data media, storage control,
user control, access control, communication control, input control,
transport control, restoration, reliability and data integrity. This
enumeration, however, is not exhaustive. As an example of organizational
security measures include the establishment of a security policy,
security controls and follow-up, computer security training and
information on the importance of following current safety procedures. Routines for
reporting and follow-up of personal data incidents also constitute such
measures.6
What circumstances should be taken into account in order to achieve an appropriate level of protection
is regulated in ch. 11 § BDF. The measures must achieve a level of safety
appropriate taking into account the technical possibilities, the costs of
the measures, the nature, scope, context and purpose of the treatment, and
the specific risks of the treatment. Special consideration should be given in which
the extent to which sensitive personal data is processed and how sensitive to privacy
other personal data processed is.7 Violation of provisions in

it is unlikely that the incident has or will entail any risk
for undue invasion of the data subject's privacy. Of ch. 3 § 10
BDL states that the person responsible for personal data must in certain cases inform it
registered affected by the incident. Failure to report one
personal data incident to the Data Inspectorate can lead to administrative
sanction fees according to ch. 6 1 § BDL.9

Justification of the decision
The Data Inspectorate's review
In this supervisory matter, the Data Inspectorate has a position to decide on
The Swedish Prison and Probation Service has documented routines for detecting
personal data incidents according to the Criminal Data Act and if the authority has

information and training initiatives for its employees with a focus on
handling of personal data incidents according to BDL.
The review does not include the content of the routines or training efforts
but is focused on verifying that the reviewing authority has
routines on site and that it has implemented training initiatives for
employees regarding personal data incidents. The review includes
however, if the authority's routines contain instructions to document them
information required by the Criminal Data Regulation.
Routines for detecting personal data incidents
The personal data that competent authorities handle within the framework of their
law enforcement and crime investigation activities are to a large extent of
sensitive and privacy sensitive nature. The nature of the business is high
requirements on the ability of law enforcement agencies to protect them
information was registered through the necessary protection measures to e.g.
prevent an incident from occurring.
The obligation to report personal data incidents according to ch. 9 § BDL
shall be construed in the light of the general requirements to take appropriate technical and
organizational measures, to ensure appropriate security for
personal data, which is prescribed in ch. 2 and 8 §§. An ability to fast
Detecting and reporting an incident is a key factor. Because they
law enforcement agencies must be able to live up to
the reporting requirement, they must have internal routines and technical capabilities for
to detect an incident.
Based on the needs of the business and with the support of risk and vulnerability analyzes
competent authorities can identify the areas where there is a greater risk
that an incident may occur. Based on the analyzes, the authorities can then
use various instruments to detect a security threat. These can be
both technical and organizational measures. The starting point is that they
the safety measures taken must provide adequate protection and that incidents do not
should occur.
Examples of technical measures include intrusion detectors as automatic
analyzes and detects data breaches and the use of
log analysis tool to detect unauthorized access
(log deviations). An increased insight into the business' "normal" network

traffic patterns help to identify things that deviate from the normal
the traffic picture towards, for example, servers, applications or data files.
Organizational measures can, for example, be the adoption of internal strategies
for data protection relating to internal rules, guidelines, routines and different types of
governing documents and policy documents.10 Guidelines and rules for handling
personal data, routines for incident management and log follow-up11 constitute
examples of such strategies. Periodic follow-up of assigned
authorizations is another example of organizational measures. In a competent
authority, there shall be procedures for allocation, change, removal and
regular verification of privileges.12 Information and training of
staff on the rules and routines for incident management to be followed
also examples of such measures.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Swedish Prison and Probation Service has mainly stated the following. Since 2005 working
the authority structured with incident management. There are also since several
is a guideline that regulates the reporting obligation of occurred
incidents. The guideline also covers incidents that are discovered and that affect
personal data. Regarding technical protection, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service's IT freight structure is linked to IT security. Examples of protection include
firewalls, network segmentation, intrusion detection and
log follow-up. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service further states that the technical and
organizational procedures that the authority has to detect
personal data incidents can be divided into prevention and follow-up
routines. Preventive measures are described in the Swedish Prison and Probation Service's regulations for IT security and include regulations to avoid information security and
IT security incidents where personal data incidents are a type of incident.
In addition, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service describes in its opinion what preventive measures
which the authority has taken and described e.g. how log follow-up is done. Of
The investigation shows that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has carried out training and
information initiatives for its employees on personal data processing
which includes information on personal data incidents and on
reporting obligation.

The Data Inspectorate can state that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has routines for that
detect personal data incidents on site.
The obligation to take precautionary measures to detect
personal data incidents are not linked to a specific time but the measures
shall be continuously reviewed and, if necessary, changed. To the Swedish Prison and Probation Service
must be able to maintain an adequate level of protection of personal data over time
recommends the Data Inspectorate, with the support of ch. § 6 BDL, att
the authority regularly evaluates the effectiveness of those taken
security measures to detect personal data incidents and that
the authority updates these if necessary.
Routines for handling personal data incidents
In order to be able to live up to the requirements for organizational measures in ch. § 8
BDL, the person responsible for personal data must have documented internal routines such as
describes the process to be followed when an incident has been detected or
occurred, including how to limit, manage and recover the incident,
and how the risk assessment is to be carried out and how the incident is to be reported internally
and to the Data Inspectorate. The routines must state e.g. what a
personal data incident is / can be, when an incident needs to be reported, and
to whom, what is to be documented, the division of responsibilities and which
information that should be provided in the context of notification to
The Data Inspectorate.
The Data Inspectorate's control of routines for handling
personal data incidents refer to the time from the entry into force of the Criminal Data Act
i.e. on August 1, 2018.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Prison and Probation Service has i.a. stated the following. The authority has had one for several years
guideline that regulates the reporting obligation of incidents that have occurred. According to
the guideline, all types of incidents must be reported within 24 hours in
the agency's joint incident reporting system Isap. It appears
further that all employees have authority and an obligation to report
incidents. Personal data incidents, as well as other incidents, are reported
also in Isap. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service has submitted the authority's guidelines for
reporting and investigation of incidents (2018: 8) dated 2018-09-11 and a
internal routine for reporting personal data to the Data Inspectorate dated
2018-04-09. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service has stated that the first-mentioned guideline is one
general routine for the authority's reporting and investigation of incidents.

9 (13)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-13116

This includes all the different types of incidents that can occur within
authority and also applies to personal data incidents. Regarding it
the internal routine states that it applies specifically to the function within
the authority that analyzes, assesses and also reports
personal data incidents to the Data Inspectorate.
Taking into account the documents submitted and what has emerged in
the case, the Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service from the time then
the Criminal Data Act came into force has had and has routines for dealing with
personal data incidents on site.
To be able to handle discovered personal data incidents in a correct way
and counteract its effects and risks on the data subjects' personalities
Integrity is important. The Data Inspectorate therefore recommends, with the support of
Chapter 5 § 6 BDL, that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service regularly checks that the routines for
handling of personal data incidents is followed.
Routines for documentation of personal data incidents
A prerequisite for the Data Inspectorate to be able to check
compliance with the documentation requirement of incidents in ch. § 14 BDF is that
the documentation includes certain information that should always be included.
The documentation shall include all details of the incident, including its
reasons, what happened and the personal data involved. It should too
contain the consequences of the incident and the corrective actions taken
personal data controller has taken.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Swedish Prison and Probation Service has mainly stated the following. All incidents
is initially documented in the incident reporting system Isap, which also
includes personal data incidents. Regarding the incidents that are assessed
constitute personal data incidents, the Data Inspectorate's forms are used for
to analyze, assess and, where appropriate, report. This also applies
the personal data incidents that have not been reported after assessment
The Data Inspectorate. Of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service's internal routine for reporting
personal data incidents to the Data Inspectorate it appears that in cases one
personal data incident is not subject to reporting, it is also documented
through the Data Inspectorate's report template and stored internally.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-13116

The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has an internal IT system
to e.g. report incidents involving personal data. In addition
it appears from the authority's internal routine that all personal data incidents must
documented and that the authority uses the Data Inspectorate's
forms for reporting personal data incidents to document
personal data incidents occurred even if they are not subject to reporting.
The Data Inspectorate notes, however, that the internal routines lack one
description of what information the documentation must include.
To be able to document occurred personal data incidents correctly
and thereby counteract the risk of the documentation becoming deficient or
incomplete is important. Inadequate documentation can lead to
the incidents are not handled and remedied properly, which can get
impact on privacy protection. The Data Inspectorate therefore recommends,
with the support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service's internal routines for
reporting of personal data incidents is supplemented with a description of
what information of an incident has occurred to be documented. In addition
the Swedish Prison and Probation Service should carry out regular inspections of the internal
the documentation of personal data incidents.
Information and education about personal data incidents
The staff is an important resource in the security work. It's not just enough
internal procedures, rules or governing documents if users do not follow them.
All users must understand that the handling of personal data must take place in one go
legally secure and that it is more serious not to report an incident than
to report e.g. a mistake or a mistake. It is therefore required that everyone
users receive adequate training and clear information on data protection.
The person responsible for personal data must inform and train his staff in matters
on data protection including the handling of personal data incidents. Of
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's report series Reported Personal Data Incidents under
in the period 2018-2019, it appears that the human factor is the most common
the cause of reported personal data incidents. 13 These mainly consist of
individuals who, consciously or unconsciously, do not follow internal routines
Report 2019: 1, report 2019: 3 and report 2020: 2. MSB has drawn similar conclusions

processing of personal data or made a mistake in handling
personal data. About half of the incidents are due to it
The human factor is about misplaced letters and emails.
In the Data Inspectorate's opinion, this underlines the importance of
internal routines and technical safety measures need to be supplemented with
ongoing training, information and other measures to increase knowledge and
awareness among employees.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
On the question of how information and education about incidents is provided
employees, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has stated, among other things. following. The authority has
informed the staff about reporting of personal data incidents, e.g. via
the intranet, a compulsory e-course for all employees, information film,
training for managers and for certain administrative staff, e-mails and
through regional ISAP coordinators.
In the light of what appears from the investigation, the Data Inspectorate considers
that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has shown that the authority has provided information and
training on the handling of personal data incidents to their employees.
To maintain competence and ensure that new staff receive
education, recurring information and education is important
the employees and hired staff. The Data Inspectorate recommends, with
support of ch. 5 § 6 BDL, that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service provides the employees on an ongoing basis
information and recurrent training in the management of
personal data incidents and the obligation to report them.
