Summary of results from
the review of data protection agents in public
and private sector
Summary of the result
The audit shows that the majority of the audited authorities and
the private actors have notified and appointed a data protection officer in time.
The Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in about 16 percent of those just over
350 activities included in the review. There is a marginal difference in
compliance with the rules between authorities and private actors.
Of a total of 66 supervisory cases, the Data Inspectorate has decided to grant
reprimand in 57 cases. In two cases, the supervised entities have received an injunction and
seven cases have been closed without action.
Introduction
At the end of May 2018, the Data Inspectorate began an investigation of whether
data protection representatives have been appointed in a number of activities. This is a
compilation of the results of the audit.
According to Article 37 of the Data Protection Regulation1 (GDPR) is an authority or a
public body obliged to appoint a data protection officer. Also private actors
has such an obligation under the article if the core business involves one
regular, systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale
or that the core business involves a treatment of the sensitive
personal data or information on crime on a large scale. According to the same
article, there is also an obligation to notify the data protection officer
contact information for the Data Inspectorate.

The cases handled within the framework of the supervisory project can be divided into two
categories: state administrative authorities and private actors. The private
the players represent six industries. These are banks, telecom operators,
insurance companies, trade unions, public transport companies and care providers.
A total of 362 businesses were inspected, 66 businesses were inspected
more specifically, of which 35 authorities and 31 private actors.2
Reporting of the results of the supervision
The compilation of supervisory cases shows that there are four different types of
errands. The first category is the items that are done right from the beginning and there
appointed and notified data protection representative no later than 25 May 2018. It
the second category is objects that have been designated by a data protection officer and / or notified
contact information to the Data Inspectorate only after 25 May 2018 but
during the review ie. before the inspection made a supervisory decision. The third
category are the objects that still at the time of supervisory decisions do not
appointed a data protection officer and / or communicated the contact details to
The Data Inspectorate. In addition, there is a fourth category that includes a case
where the inspectorate has determined that there is no obligation for the object
to appoint a data protection officer.
Supervision cases in categories one and four have been closed without action. They have
either done right from the beginning or the Data Inspectorate has found that
there is no obligation to appoint a data protection officer for it
personal data controller. Seven of the supervisory cases fall into this category.
In addition, all the activities that are included in the data and there
The Data Inspectorate has chosen not to initiate a special supervisory case for this one
category. A total of 303 activities out of the 352 included in the data
belonging to this category.

The selection process started with the project team identifying over 400

activities for which the starting point was that there was an obligation to appoint one
data protection officer. Of these over 400 operations, the Swedish Data Inspectorate has selected
362 pieces checked against the notifications by data protection officers that
the inspection received. The 66 activities that were finally examined in special
supervisory matters are those where the report has not been made to the inspectorate at the time of the review
initiated. As shown below under the results of the supervision, there are a couple of
the supervised entities which, despite the review of the notifications, have shown that they have designated and
notified a representative in time.

Cases in category two have ended with the supervised objects being assigned separately
reprimand for the infringement. Not having appointed and announced
data protection representatives to the Data Inspectorate may cause an administrative
penalty fee.3 The main reason why the decisions stopped at one
reprimand instead of an administrative penalty fee is the relatively short time
which has expired since May 25, 2018.
In total, there are 57 cases in category two and which are distributed according to
following;


31 authorities



3 banks



4 insurance companies



1 public transport company



4 telecom operators



12 unions



2 private care providers.

Cases in category three, ie. the two objects still at the time of
supervisory decisions have not appointed a data protection officer and / or notified
contact information to the Data Inspectorate, has ended with that
the supervised entities were each assigned an injunction for the infringement.
Conclusions on compliance with the rules
It is interesting to compare how well the authorities and the six different ones
industries follow the requirement to appoint a data protection officer in the light of the soon
over 350 authorities and private actors that the Data Inspectorate has been involved in
the selection process. It gives an indication of both what it looks like in total and how
well the authorities as a group and the respective industry follow the requirement to appoint
a data protection officer.
Of the objects included in the sample, the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in
16.3% (59 of 362) of the just over 350 activities included in
the review. Distributed by each category and industry, it looks like this:



Authorities: Of the 210 authorities that were included in the sample have
The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 33 cases. In percent
corresponds to the number of cases with deficiencies about 16 percent.



Private actors: of the 152 private actors that were included in the sample have
The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 26 cases. In percent
corresponds to the number of cases with deficiencies just over 17 percent.

additional provisions to the EU Data Protection Regulation



The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 3 cases.



Insurance companies: Of the 42 insurance companies that were included in the sample



Telecom operators: Of the 8 telecom operators that were included in the sample
The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 4 cases.



Trade unions: Of the 45 that were included in the sample, the Data Inspectorate has
found deficiencies in 12 cases.



Private care providers: of the 9 private care providers that were included in the sample
the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in 2 cases.

Of the activities that have been examined specifically in supervisory matters can
The Data Inspectorate states that very many have chosen to comply
requirements during the ongoing review. Only in two cases does it remain
shortcomings, which led to injunctions.
It can also be stated that the difference in compliance between rules
authorities and private actors are marginal. Some industries stand out
however, negative4. This applies especially to telecom operators where four out of eight companies did not live
up to the requirements. Trade unions also stand out negatively in a comparison
with the cut.

Given that the number of objects in certain categories is relatively low, there are
reason to be cautious in interpreting the percentage distribution.
