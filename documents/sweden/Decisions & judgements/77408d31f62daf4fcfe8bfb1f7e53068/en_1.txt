Compilation of the results from
the review of data protection officers in public
and private sector
Summary of the results
The audit shows that the majority of the audited authorities and
the private actors have notified and appointed a data protection officer in time.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority has identified deficiencies in approximately 16 percent of those just above
350 businesses included in the review. There is a marginal difference in
compliance with the rules between authorities and private actors.
Out of a total of 66 supervisory cases, the Data Inspectorate has decided to give
reprimands in 57 cases. In two cases, the objects of supervision have received an injunction and
seven cases have been closed without action.
Introduction
At the end of May 2018, the Swedish Data Protection Authority started an examination of
data protection officer appointed within a number of businesses. This is a
compilation of the results from the review.
According to Article 37 of the General Data Protection Regulation1 (GDPR), an authority or a
public body obliged to appoint a data protection officer. Also private actors
has such an obligation under the article if the core business involves a
regular, systematic surveillance of individuals on a large scale
or that the core business involves the treatment of sensitive
personal data or information about crimes on a large scale. According to the same
article there is also an obligation to notify the data protection officer
contact details for the Swedish Data Protection Authority.

The cases handled within the framework of the supervision project can be divided into two
categories: state administrative authorities and private actors. The private ones
the actors represent six industries. These are banks, telecom operators,
insurance companies, trade unions, public transport companies and healthcare providers.
A total of 362 businesses have been checked, 66 businesses have been audited
more closely, of which 35 authorities and 31 private actors.2
Reporting of the results from the inspection
The compilation of the supervisory cases shows that there are four different types of
errands. The first category is the items that were done right from the beginning and there
appointed and notified data protection officer no later than 25 May 2018. The
the second category is objects that have appointed a data protection officer and/or notified
the contact details for the Data Inspectorate only after 25 May 2018 but
during the review ie. made a supervisory decision before the inspection. The third
the category is the objects that are still at the time of the supervisory decisions not
appointed a data protection officer and/or communicated the contact details to
The Swedish Data Protection Authority. In addition, there is a fourth category that includes a case
where the inspection found that there is no obligation for the object
to appoint a data protection officer.
Supervisory cases in categories one and four have been closed without action. They have
either done right from the start or the Data Protection Authority has established that
there is no obligation to appoint a data protection officer for it
personal data controller. Seven of the supervisory cases belong to this category.
In addition, all the activities that were included in the documentation belong there
The Swedish Data Protection Authority has chosen not to initiate a special supervisory case for this one
the category. In total, there are 303 businesses out of the 352 included in the database
that belong to this category.

The selection process started with the project group identifying over 400

activities for which the starting point was that there was an obligation to appoint one
data protection officer. Of these over 400 businesses, Datainspektionen has selected
362 paragraphs that have been checked against the notifications by data protection officers who
the inspection received. The 66 businesses that were finally examined in special
supervisory matters are those where the notification has not been made to the inspection when the review
was initiated. As can be seen below under the results of the inspection, there are a couple of
the subjects of supervision who, despite the review of the reports, have shown that they appointed and
notified an agent in time.

The cases in category two have been concluded with the supervisory objects assigned to each
reprimand for the violation. Not having appointed and notified
data protection officer of the Data Protection Authority can cause an administrative
sanction fee.3 The main reason why the decisions stopped at a
reprimand instead of an administrative penalty fee is relatively short
which has expired since 25 May 2018.
In total, there are 57 cases in category two, which are distributed according to
following;


31 authorities



3 banks



4 insurance companies



1 public transport company



4 telecom operators



12 unions



2 private caregivers.

Cases in category three, i.e. the two objects still at the time of
the supervisory decision has not appointed a data protection officer and/or notified
the contact details for the Swedish Data Protection Authority, has ended with
the objects of supervision have each been assigned an injunction for the violation.
Conclusions on regulatory compliance
It is interesting to compare how well the authorities and the six different ones
the industries comply with the requirement to appoint a data protection officer in light of the immediate
over 350 authorities and private actors that Datainspektionen was involved in
the selection process. It gives an indication both of how it looks in total and how
well, the authorities as a group and the respective industry follow the requirement to appoint
a data protection officer.
Of the objects that were included in the selection, the Data Inspectorate has identified deficiencies in
16.3% (59 out of 362) of the just over 350 businesses included in
the review. Broken down by category and industry, it looks like this:

3



Authorities: Of the 210 authorities that were included in the sample,
The Swedish Data Protection Authority found deficiencies in 33 cases. Calculated as a percentage
corresponds to the number of cases with deficiencies of approximately 16 percent.



Private actors: of the 152 private actors that were included in the sample have
The Swedish Data Protection Authority found deficiencies in 26 cases. Calculated as a percentage
corresponds to the number of cases with deficiencies of just over 17 percent.

Article 83 p. 4 (a) data protection regulation and ch. 6 Section 2 of the Act (2018:218) re
supplementary regulations to the EU data protection regulation

The private actors are distributed as follows:


Banks: Of the 40 banks that were included in the sample,
The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 3 cases.



Insurance company: Of the 42 insurance companies that were included in the sample
the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in 4 cases.



Public transport: Of the 8 companies in public transport that were included in
the selection, the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in 1 case.



Telecom operators: Of the 8 telecom operators that were included in the sample have
The Data Inspectorate found deficiencies in 4 cases.



Unions: Of the 45 that were included in the selection, the Data Inspection Authority has
found deficiencies in 12 cases.



Private caregivers: of the 9 private caregivers that were included in the sample
the Data Inspectorate has found deficiencies in 2 cases.

Of the businesses that have been audited in particular in supervisory matters,
The Swedish Data Protection Authority notes that many have chosen to comply
requirements during the ongoing review. Only in two cases does it remain
deficiencies, which led to injunctions.
It can also be stated that the difference in compliance between
authorities and private actors is marginal. Some industries stand out
however negative4. This particularly applies to telecom operators, where four out of eight companies did not exist
up to the requirements. Trade unions also stand out negatively in a comparison
with the cut.

In light of the fact that the number of objects in certain categories is relatively low, there are
reason to be cautious when interpreting the percentage distribution.
