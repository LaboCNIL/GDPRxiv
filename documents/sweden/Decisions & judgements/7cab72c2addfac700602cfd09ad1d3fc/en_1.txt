Report on the supervisory matter
The Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Spotify AB (Spotify)
or the company) in connection with a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, i

The complaint essentially states the following. The complainant has previously had one account and one
paid subscription to the company's music service. The complainant has repeatedly requested that
the company will delete his card details. According to the company, the complainant has registered via
PayPal and the company therefore do not process the complainant's card details. The complainant
questions this, as the complainant's son has been refused registration for one
free trial period in which the complainant's card details were used, with the justification that
the card has already been used.
Spotify AB has mainly stated the following.

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and on
repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

The complainant has requested deletion of his credit or debit card details. Spotify
however, does not process card details when a user pays via PayPal, such as
the complainant made, but instead deals with unique identifiers for the debit cards or
"Instrument" ("unique payment instrument identifier") used by a customer at
registration of free trial periods. The legal basis for the treatment is
legitimate interests. That the complainant wrote that he withdraws his consent may be interpreted
as an objection to the treatment. The continued treatment is not subject to
the right to delete because Spotify has a strong, legitimate interest in continuing
treatment which outweighs the complainant's rights and freedoms.
To sign up for a free trial period, potential customers must
provide Spotify debit card information that will be used for billing when
the free trial period has expired. To counteract the abuse of those
free trial periods that the company offers use the company unique
payment instrument identifier. This means that the same payment instrument can not
used several times. Without this feature, it would be easy for a customer to
launch new free Spotify accounts for additional trial periods each time their
free trial period expires, by varying information such as e-mail address, and
thus fraudulently utilizing Spotify. The unique payment instrument identifier is one
alphanumeric chain generated by Spotify's payment processor PayPal. The
allows the unique identification of credit cards, but it does not contain
the credit card number or other card details. Spotify can not through
the payment instrument identifier gain access to payment card details via
reverse engineering. This process is compatible with PCI
DSS2.
The processing is necessary for Spotify to be able to counter fraud. This is both
a legitimate interest in Spotify and the company's broad customer base, as the company does not
could continue to offer free trial periods of the company's service if
fraud could not be countered in this way. It is also in the public domain
legitimate interest.
Spotify has responded to the complainant's requests but has not deleted the information since
the right to delete is not applicable. The company responded on December 7, 2017
the complainant's original request of 6 December 2017 and 8 June 2018 on
the complainant's latest request of 24 May 2018 and thus within the deadline in
the Data Protection Regulation. Regarding the complainant's letter of 15 March 2018
the company did not interpret it as a request for deletion under the Data Protection Regulation;
but replied to the letter on May 4, 2018. The company has in several of these answers informed
the complainant that the company does not store his debit card information and that the company does not
could delete the payment instrument reference that identifies that his card already has
used to take advantage of one of the company's offers or services.
Regarding what information was provided to the complainant on 8 June 2018 with
due to his objection, Spotify considers that the company responded to the complainant's
ask by explaining that it does not store any card information but only uses one
algorithm to see if a credit card has been used to take advantage of a Spotify offer
earlier. If the company had had reason to believe that the complainant wanted more details
if these categories of personal data had been provided by the company. When the company
customer service advisers communicate with users the company always tries to
provide the information that users request in a format that is relevant
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and is a generally accepted set of guidelines
and routines aimed at optimizing the security of the use of credit and debit cards.

for users and also by someone unfamiliar with the provisions of
the Data Protection Regulation would understand. Because the complainant neither mentioned
regulation or asked for the legal basis for the processing went the company
does not go into legal details in its response such as the company's balancing of interests. In addition, had
the company in its privacy policy communicated to its users that it on request
is happy to provide more information about the balance of interests that the company has made
to rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis and informed of the possibility
to lodge complaints with the supervisory authorities. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that the case
began more than five months before the entry into force of the Data Protection Regulation and that
the only correspondence that took place in the time after was the company's response two weeks
then. Since then, the company's customer service advisor has undergone additional training
in how to answer users in a clear and unambiguous way, what questions to consider
as inquiries in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation and the issues to be addressed
forwarded to the company's data protection team and data protection representative. Finally, it should
It is taken into account that the company receives more than 11,000 customer service cases daily. Although the company
customer service receive continuous training in data protection can be the human factor sometimes
lead to a case being answered as a customer service case instead of a response to one
request under the Data Protection Regulation referred to in Article 12 (4), in particular when
the user does not mention personal data or the data protection regulation in his
communication with the company.
The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it applies
cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation
and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected
regulators have been the data protection authorities of Portugal, Belgium, Cyprus,
Austria, France, Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Norway and
Finland.

Justification of decision
The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment
Has the company had the right to continue processing the complainant's information after that
the complainant objected to the treatment?
According to Article 17 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation, the data subject shall have the right to do so
personal data controllers without undue delay have their personal data deleted and
the person responsible for personal data shall be obliged to delete without undue delay
personal data of the data subject objects to the processing in accordance with Article
21.1 and there are no justified reasons for the treatment which weighs heavier. According to the article
21.1, the data subject, for reasons relating to his or her specific
situation, have the right to object at any time to the treatment of
personal data relating to him or her based on Article 6 (1) (f)
the person responsible for personal data may no longer process the personal data unless he or she does not
can demonstrate decisive legitimate reasons for the treatment that outweigh it
registered interests, rights and freedoms.
The complainant's letter of 24 May 2018 may be understood as an objection to
treatment under Article 21 (1), for reasons relating to his specific situation in
in such a way that it means that the card number cannot be reused to register new ones
free trial periods on the company's services. Because the request had not been processed
before the data protection ordinance began to be applied on 25 may 2018, the company's must
handling of requests is assessed according to the Data Protection Regulation, ie if

the company has demonstrated decisive legitimate reasons for the treatment that outweigh
the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject.
In order for treatment to be able to rely on Article 6 (1) (f), all three conditions must be met
provided therein are fulfilled, namely, first, that it
personal data controller or third party has a legitimate interest (legitimate interest),
secondly, that the treatment is necessary for purposes relating to the justifiable
interest (necessary) and thirdly that not the interests of the data subject or
fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh and require protection of
personal data (balancing of interests).
The company has stated, among other things, that the company's legitimate interest in the treatment is
to counter fraud regarding free trial periods. In recital 47
The Data Protection Regulation states that such processing of personal data is
absolutely necessary to prevent fraud constitutes a legitimate interest of the person concerned
personal data controller. IMY thus considers that the company has a legitimate interest.
Furthermore, the IMY considers that the treatment is absolutely necessary for purposes relating to it
legitimate interest. The investigation shows that the information has been minimized
to the extent possible for the company to be able to achieve the purpose that pertains to it
legitimate interest.
In the balance of interests to be made between the company's legitimate interest and
the complainant's interests, rights and freedoms, IMY states that the company's justified
interest weighs heavily. The treatment appears to be something that the complainant reasonably can
expect when registering a free trial period and not specifically
invasion of privacy. The data itself is also not to be regarded as
privacy sensitive. In a weighted assessment, IMY considers that the company has shown
decisive legitimate reasons which outweigh the appellant's interest in his
card data can be reused to register new free trial periods of
the company's services and that his personal data should not be processed.
In the light of the reasons put forward by the company, IMY considers that the company has shown
crucial legitimate reasons which outweigh the interests, freedoms and freedoms of the appellant
rights. The company has thus been justified in continuing to process the information after that
the appellant has objected to the proceedings and the appellant has therefore not been entitled to
deletion in accordance with Article 17 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Has the company handled the complainant's requests in a formally correct manner according to
the Data Protection Regulation?
According to Article 12 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller shall take
appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all communications under
Articles 17 and 21 which relate to treatment in a concise, clear and distinct, comprehensible and easy
available form, using clear language, In accordance with Article 12 (3)
data protection regulation, the data controller shall, upon request, without undue need
delay and in any case no later than one month after receiving the request
provide the data subject with information on the measures taken pursuant to Article
17 and 21. According to Article 12 (4), the data controller shall, if he does not take action
measures at the request of the data subject, without delay and no later than one month after
have received the request inform the data subject of the reason why action is not
taken and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and
request legal action. According to recital 59 of the Data Protection Regulation
data controllers without undue delay and within one month at the latest

obliged to respond to the data subjects' requests and provide a justification, if they do not
intends to fulfill such wishes.
In the case, the company's actions must only be assessed during the period that
the Data Protection Regulation has been applicable, ie since 25 May 2018. At
the assessment of whether the company has fulfilled its information obligations towards
the complainant through its response on June 8, 2018, however, the responses provided by the company earlier
submitted to the complainant is taken into account for the benefit of the company.
The company has, among other things, stated the reason why the company in its response to the complainant
not informed of its legal basis for the treatment, its balancing of interests or
the possibility of complaining to regulators is due to the fact that the complainant did not mention
personal data or the Data Protection Ordinance in its communication with the company and that
the complainant shortly before received information about this through the company's privacy policy
which came into force on 25 May 2018. IMY notes, however, that the complainant expressly
stated that it concerns credit card information and for what purposes he intended to
the data may be processed, which can hardly be understood as anything other than that
personal data and references to the data protection rules. As IMY stated above
and the company also stated itself, the complainant's request must also be perceived as one
objection under Article 21, which has thus entailed an obligation for the company to:
notify a decision individualized for the complainant in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation.
Since the company's decision was negative, the company's response under recital 59 would have been justified
and according to Article 12 (4) contained the reason for this and referral of complaints, which it did not
did. What the company stated that information about this appeared from the company's
privacy policy is not enough. This is because it is an individualized
decision and the individual can not be expected to take part in such a policy in its entirety to
draw conclusions about the type of decision the company has made, especially when the company
neither stated the legal basis on which the proceedings were based nor that of the appellant
objection had been rejected.
Against this background, IMY finds that the company's response of 8 June 2018 has not been
sufficiently justified in accordance with Article 12 (4) as the company does not clearly and unequivocally
has reported which data is processed, that the data is processed on the basis of
a legitimate interest and what the legitimate interest is and that the answer did not contain
information on the possibility of submitting a complaint to the supervisory authority and
request legal action. Spotify has thereby processed personal data in violation of
Article 12 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation.

Choice of intervention
Article 58 (2) (i) and Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation state that the IMY has:
power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83.
Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, administrative
penalty fees are imposed in addition to or in place of the other measures referred to in Article
58.2, such as injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83 (2) states which
factors to be taken into account when deciding on administrative penalty fees shall be imposed
and in determining the amount of the fee. In the case of a minor infringement
receive IMY as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty fee
issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b). Account shall be taken of aggravating and
mitigating circumstances in the case, such as the nature of the infringement, the degree of difficulty
and duration as well as previous violations of relevance.

In its defense, the company has mainly stated that this is a one-off event
and that the company handles a large number of customer service matters. Furthermore, then it has
occurred the company's customer service advisors have undergone further training in how to
answer users in a clear and unambiguous way, what questions to consider
inquiries in accordance with the Data Protection Ordinance and which issues are to be forwarded
to the company's data protection team and data protection representative.
The IMY finds in an overall assessment of the circumstances that it is a question of one
such minor infringement within the meaning of recital 148 and that Spotify AB
therefore, a reprimand must be granted in accordance with Article 58 (2) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation for it
found the infringement.
The case is closed.

This decision has been made by Catharina Fernquist, Head of Unit, after a presentation by
lawyer Olle Pettersson.
