Decision after supervision according to
data protection regulation against
The Regional Board Region Värmland
The Privacy Protection Authority's decision
The Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) states that the Regional Board of Governors Region Värmland
(Regional Board) for an unknown period before and during the review until 31
October 2019 has processed personal data in violation of articles 5.1 a and 13 i
the data protection regulation1 by not informing care seekers who called 11772 about
collection of telephone numbers and municipality ID for the purpose of ensuring that calls to 1177
was answered by the healthcare provider MedHelp AB.
IMY decides with the support of ch. 6. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act3 and Article 58.2 and 83 i
data protection regulation that the Regional Board must pay an administrative
penalty fee for the violations of articles 5.1 a and 13 of the data protection regulation
of 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) kroner.

Background
On February 18, 2019, Computer Sweden published an article with the title "2.7
million recorded calls to 1177 Vårdguiden completely unprotected on the internet". In the article
is stated, among other things, that "On an open web server, completely without password protection or
other security, we have found 2.7 million recorded calls to the advice number 1177.”

It emerged that three regions hired MedHelp AB as care providers at 1177 and Inera
AB to connect the calls to MedHelp AB. IMY therefore initiated written supervision
27 June 2019 against the Regional Board to control the processing of personal data
on the grounds that care seekers call 1177. Supervision was started at the same time against the Health Care Board Stockholm Region and the Regional Board Region Sörmland.

Justification of the decision
Legal background
National regulations on health care
The tasks of the health and medical services are regulated in, among other things, the Health and Medical Services Act
(2017:30), HSL.
Measures to medically prevent, investigate and treat diseases and injuries
is defined as health care, ch. 2 § 1 HSL. Principal refers to that region
or the municipality which, according to the law, is responsible for offering healthcare to
the population of the region or municipality. Within a principal's geographic area may
one or more care providers conduct business, ch. 2 § 2 HSL. By care providers is meant
government authority, region, municipality, other legal person or individual trader
who conduct health and medical care activities, ch. 2 § 3 HSL. Regions and
municipalities may, while maintaining ownership, enter into an agreement with someone else to
perform the tasks for which the county council or the municipality is responsible, ch. 15 § 1 HSL.
The person who has a constitutionally regulated responsibility for providing care is referred to as the principal.
The responsibility does not mean an obligation to run the business yourself, but the operation can
lie on someone else who is then referred to as a caregiver (prop. 1981/82:97 p. 33 f.). The
the public responsibility as principal does not imply control over the care provider
day-to-day activities and that does not relieve the caregiver of the responsibility that comes with it either
the role of caregiver (prop. 2016/17:43 p. 86).
Personal data responsibility
According to Article 4.7 of the data protection regulation, the person in charge of personal data means a
natural or legal person, public authority, institution or other body which
alone or together with others determines the ends and the means for
the processing of personal data. About the purposes and means of the processing
determined by Union law or the national law of the Member States, it can
personal data controller or the special criteria for how he is to be appointed
provided for in Union law or in the national law of the Member States.
According to Article 5.2, personal data controllers must be responsible for and be able to demonstrate that
the principles of Article 5.1 are complied with (principle of responsibility).
Basic principles and legal basis
According to Article 5.1 a of the data protection regulation, personal data must be processed in one
legal, correct and transparent manner in relation to the data subject (principle of legality,
correctness and transparency). The principle of data minimization in Article 5.1 c means that
personal data must be adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to
the purposes for which they are processed.
In order for the processing of personal data to be legal, it must be supported by someone
of the legal grounds specified in Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. At
treatment for health care purposes, it is primarily Article 6.1 c (legal

obligation) or 6.1.e (public interest or exercise of authority) which may be
applicable. According to Article 6.3, the basis for the processing stated in Article 6.1 c
and e determined in accordance with Union law or the national law of a Member State which
the personal data controller is covered by. This means that if a caregiver's
processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation or
perform a task of public interest as required for the processing to be legal that
the legal obligation or task of public interest is governed by national law
(or in Union law).
Information about health constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is forbidden to
process such personal data in accordance with Article 9.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, if not
the processing is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 9.2.
Registered right to information
Obligation of personal data controller to independently provide registered
information on the processing of personal data can be found in articles 13 and 14 i
data protection regulation. Relatively comprehensive information is required
provided to the registered.

Call to 1177
Region Värmland states, among other things, the following. The region is responsible as principal
according to ch. 2 § 2 HSL for healthcare advice via the number 1177. That is the region
which is responsible for offering residents health and medical care. MedHelp is a healthcare provider
according to ch. 2 § 3 HSL. It is thus MedHelp that conducts health and
healthcare operations. Information about the caller's phone number and
municipality ID is collected from the caller's telecom operator. The purpose of
the treatment is to be able to connect the caller to the right healthcare provider. The treatment
is necessary to fulfill a task of public interest, Article 6.1 e
data protection regulation. Sensitive personal data is not processed. It is
The Regional Board in Region Värmland, which is responsible for personal data processing
of the personal data. The processing is carried out by Inera AB as a personal data processor.
Inera's processing only refers to calling telephone numbers and municipality ID. The region
Since November 1, 2019, has been providing healthcare advice by telephone under its own auspices and
no longer has an agreement with MedHelp.
IMY's assessment
The regional board could, while maintaining its principalship according to ch. 15. § 1 HSL stop
agreement with MedHelp to perform the tasks for which the region is responsible according to HSL.
IMY notes that no contradictory circumstances have emerged
The Regional Board's statement that the board was responsible for personal data according to Article 4.7 i
data protection regulation.
IMY assesses that the Regional Board's processing of personal data about municipality ID and
phone number was adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to
the purpose of ensuring that calls to 1177 were taken care of by MedHelp AB. The treatment
is therefore deemed to have been compatible with the principle of data minimization in Article 5.1 c i
data protection regulation.
The Regional Board has a task that is established in national law through HSL. The foundation
for the processing is established in accordance with Article 6.3 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY
assesses that the Regional Board's treatment of municipality ID and telephone number was one

necessary processing of personal data for the board to fulfill a task of
public interest and that there was legal support for the processing according to Article 6.1 e.

The region's information for care seekers
In the data protection regulation there are far-reaching obligations to provide information to
registered. The personal data controller is responsible for the information
provided.
The Regional Board states, among other things, the following.
The Regional Board admits that clear and unambiguous information about treatment of
phone number and municipality ID are not provided and therefore believe that an addition can
be done on the website 1177.se according to a text that appears in an opinion on 25
November 2020.
IMY's assessment
On 25 June 2019, IMY received a transcript from www.1177.se about 1177
health care advice by telephone, which has been served in the case. The website states that
behind the 1177 Vårdguiden is the Swedish healthcare system in all regions
cooperation. 1177 is a national telephone number for healthcare advice that you can
call around the clock. Each region operates its own healthcare advisory service
either in-house or through a procured subcontractor. The calls that are
counseling calls are recorded. The question "Who is responsible for the personal data
handled correctly?” are answered as follows. "It is your healthcare provider who is responsible for
the personal data is handled correctly and legally. When care is provided by a region
is it one or more boards in the region that are ultimately responsible. Within the private sector
care is the company or business that provides care that is responsible."
The obligation to provide information is extensive and a fundamental prerequisite for
individuals must be able to have knowledge of and control over how their personal data is processed
treated. The requirement of transparency is a fundamental principle according to Article 5.1 a i
data protection regulation. Reason 60 in the data protection regulation states that the principles
if fair and open treatment requires that the data subject be informed that
processing takes place and the purpose of it. The personal data controller should to it
Data subjects provide all additional information required to ensure a fair
and open processing, taking into account the specifics of personal data processing
circumstances and context.
According to Article 12.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data shall take
appropriate measures to provide to the data subject all information according to
articles 13 and 14 in a concise, clear and distinct, comprehensible and easily accessible form, with
use of clear language, especially for information that is specifically targeted
to children. Article 13 specifies the information that the personal data controller must
provide if the personal data is collected from the data subject.
Information must be provided about, among other things, the identity of the person in charge of personal data and
contact details, the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is
intended, the legal basis for the processing and that there is a right to of
the personal data controller request access to personal data. If appropriate
information must be given about contact details for the data protection officer.

The regional board collected the telephone number and municipality ID of the care seekers
the purpose of ensuring that calls to 1177 could be taken care of by the healthcare provider MedHelp
AB. As of November 1, 2019, the Regional Board has switched to running
care under own management when calling the 1177 number.
IMY notes that, according to Article 13 of the data protection regulation, it is set extensively
requirements for information to registered persons that the Regional Board has not provided. It is not
enough that the board states on the 1177.se website that "It is your care provider
who is responsible for the personal data being handled correctly and legally."
For example, information was missing that the Regional Board is responsible for personal data,
about the board's contact details, about the purpose of the processing, about the legal
the basis for the processing and that there was a right to from it
personal data controller request access to personal data. It was also missing
contact details for the data protection officer.
Because the Regional Board has not provided the necessary information to care seekers i
in connection with the collection of telephone numbers and municipal IDs for those seeking care
telephone conversation, which was linked to MedHelp AB, IMY states that the Regional Board
has processed personal data in violation of Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation.
The population in Värmland County was 282,885 quarter 4 2020.4 The lack of information
could thus affect many care seekers.
Article 5.1 a of the data protection regulation states that personal data must be processed
in a legal, accurate and transparent manner in relation to the data subject. Absence of
information according to Article 13 is deemed to have significantly limited that of care seekers
conditions to exercise their rights. IMY therefore makes the assessment that it also
is a violation of the transparency principle in Article 5.1 a.

Choice of intervention
Possible intervention measures regarding information for care seekers
The IMY has a number of corrective powers available under Article 58.2 i
the data protection regulation, among other things IMY can submit to the personal data controller
to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with the regulation and if required in one
specific way and within a specific period.
According to articles 58.2 and 83.2 of the data protection regulation, IMY has the authority to impose
administrative penalty fees in accordance with Article 83. Depending on
the circumstances of the individual case, administrative penalty fees must be imposed
in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2.
Furthermore, Article 83.2 of the data protection regulation states which factors must be taken into account
when deciding that administrative penalty fees are to be imposed and when determining
the amount of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to what
stated in recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation instead of imposing a penalty fee
issue a reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating circumstances and
mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature of the violation, degree of severity
and duration as well as previous violations of relevance.

According to Article 83.7, the member states may establish rules for whether and to what extent
public authorities and bodies must be able to impose administrative penalty fees.
Of ch. 6 Section 2 of the Data Protection Act states that the supervisory authority may charge a
sanction fee by an authority for violations referred to in article 83.4, 83.5 and
83.6 of the data protection regulation. In that case, Article 83.1, 83.2 and 83.3 shall be applied.
A penalty fee must be imposed
IMY has assessed above that the Regional Board has violated articles 5.1 a and 13 i
data protection regulation. These articles are covered by article 83.5 and at a
violation of these, the supervisory authority shall consider imposing administrative
penalty fee in addition to, or in lieu of, other corrective measures.
In light of the fact that the violation found concerning the lack of information has
concerned a large number of care seekers, which has limited the opportunities for care seekers to take
protect their rights, it is not a question of a minor violation. There is thus
not reason to replace the penalty fee with a reprimand. The Regional Board must therefore
administrative penalty fees are imposed.
Determining the size of the penalty fee
General provisions
According to Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority must ensure that
the imposition of administrative penalty charges on a case-by-case basis is effective;
proportionate and dissuasive. Article 83.2 specifies the factors to be taken into account when
determining the size of the penalty fee for the violation. At the assessment
of the size of the penalty fee, account must be taken of, among other things, the infringement
nature, severity and duration, whether it was a matter of intent or
negligence, what steps were taken to mitigate the damage they recorded
has suffered, the degree of responsibility taking into account the technical and organizational measures
carried out in accordance with articles 25 and 32, how the subject of supervision has
cooperated with the supervisory authority, which categories of personal data are affected,
how the violation came to IMY's attention and whether there are other aggravating circumstances or
mitigating factor such as direct or indirect financial gain from the procedure.
For authorities, according to ch. 6, § 2 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that
the penalty fees shall be set at a maximum of SEK 10,000,000 for violations which
referred to in Article 83.5 and 83.6. Violations of Articles 5 and 13 are covered by it
higher penalty fee according to Article 83.5.
Assessment of mitigating and aggravating circumstances
Everyone who is ill has the right to care around the clock. Care seekers are referred in large
extent to call 1177 as a contact route to receive care, without others
contact routes are highlighted.
As has been established, there are approximately 283,000 inhabitants in Värmland County. The lack of
information can thus affect a large number of care seekers who call 1177.
The provisions on information mean that the Regional Board must make care applicants
persons aware of the processing of personal data and the rights of care seekers i
connection with the Regional Board's processing of personal data.

It is aggravating that the lack of information was extensive, lasting and concerning
large number of care seekers who were able to contact 1177 without receiving information about
among other things, the Regional Board's and the data protection officer's contact details. The lack
of such contact information limits the care seeker's opportunities to exercise their
rights. It is also aggravating that information was not provided about the collection of
tasks took place for the purpose of ensuring that calls to 1177 are taken care of by the care provider
MedHelp AB.
For penalty fees to be effective, dissuasive and proportionate must
a balanced assessment is made in each individual case. As for the penalty fee
size, IMY finds, based on an overall assessment, that the Regional Board must pay a
administrative sanction fee of 250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand) kroner for it
noted the lack of information for care seekers.
This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation
by department director Suzanne Isberg. In the handling, the unit manager Katarina
Tullstedt and the lawyer Mattias Sandström participated. At the final processing
also has IT security specialist Magnus Bergström, legal director David Törngren and
unit manager Malin Blixt participated.
