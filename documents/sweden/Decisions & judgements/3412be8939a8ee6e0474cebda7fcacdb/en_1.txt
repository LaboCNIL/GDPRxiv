Region Örebro County regarding a report to the Ombudsman against forensic psychiatry
the clinic in Örebro had been published in its entirety on the region's open
website. The publication had taken place before a board meeting on the 25th
September 2019. The notification contained the notifier's identity information (including
social security number), contact details, information that the notifier was posted on
the forensic psychiatric clinic and information that the complainant was the subject of
urine sampling. Due to this, the Data Inspectorate decided in the end
of January 2020 to initiate a supervision against the Health and Medical Care Board in
Örebro County Region in order to investigate the board's handling of

The Örebro County Region is considered to be able to invoke a general interest in publishing
minutes and summonses, including personal data, based on Article 6 i
the Data Protection Ordinance and ch. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act. Sensitive
personal data in accordance with Article 9 of the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 3. § 3
The Data Protection Act should never be published on the region's website. In the current
In this case, publication should not have taken place.
The Health and Medical Care Board lacks written routines regarding publication
of documents and personal data on the website. There are a few people
whose task is to publish the health and medical care board's
notices and minutes on the website. Routines for publication are shared
orally. In this case, the oral procedures and the document have not been followed
was published by mistake.
Örebro County Region has begun work on creating written guidelines and
routines for service of notices and minutes to elected representatives and for
publication on the website.
Other information that has emerged in the case
The Data Inspectorate has reviewed the information provided by the board
about the incident in a personal data report (dnr PUI-2020-339). The committee
states in this document, among other things, that the incident occurred due to
"Human factor: error in the individual case" (a pre-printed alternative answer), that
the document has been removed from the external web, to be removed by
the document was accompanied by an immediate review of all published
notices and minutes to ensure that disclosure has not occurred
otherwise or in other documents, that a date has been set for information
and review to the relevant staff group regarding rules for publication on
the web, and that the data subject has been informed of the incident.
In an appendix to the report of personal data incident, the region wrote the following.
“Örebro County Region considers it very important that personal data
treated correctly and in accordance with the rules in force at any given time.
Therefore, Region Örebro County strives to in the various steps in the preparation of
cases, pay attention to the existence of personal data in different types of
documents, and that if it is not necessary that they be there, either take
remove them or present them in such a way that they can not be traced to
separate individual. This work is done systematically and through a number
preparation steps./…/In the present case, however, it has been the case that they

the current information as a result of a mistake, which does not have in the usual way
noticed in the preparation process, has followed out in the publication on
the public web. ”

Justification of decision
The Data Inspectorate finds that among the personal data that
was published on Region Örebro County's open website, there was information that
have been sensitive in accordance with Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation. This is the case for
the information that the data subject is admitted to the forensic psychiatric ward
the clinic and that he is subject to urine sampling. This then it
The former information reveals that the person may be suffering from a serious mental illness
disorder and the latter information that the person has or has had one
drug problems. Thus, they constitute information about health. Further has
social security number covered by the publication.

Legal regulation
Personal data may only be processed if there is a legal basis for it
as set out in Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation. Such legal support
may, for example, consist in the treatment being necessary to perform one
task of general interest, such as providing the public with transparency
municipal activities. Processing of sensitive personal data is like
as a general rule prohibited and such personal data may only be processed again
processing is covered by an exception in Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Social security numbers may only be processed with the support of ch. § 10
the Data Protection Act, ie if there is (a according to
the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation are valid) consent or if
the treatment is clearly justified with regard to the purpose of
the treatment, the importance of a secure identification or something else noteworthy
reason.
Those who process personal data must, in addition to having a legal basis
always comply with the basic principles set out in Article 5 i
the Data Protection Regulation. Among other things, personal data may only be used
for specific, explicit and justified purposes (the principle of
purpose limitation) and no more personal data may be processed than
necessary for the purposes (data minimization principle). Of Article 32

follows that the data controller has to take appropriate technical and
organizational measures for personal data to ensure a
a level of safety appropriate to the risk to natural persons
rights and freedoms. Furthermore, the person responsible for personal data, according to
Article 32 (4), take measures to ensure that each natural person performing
work under the supervision of the data controller, and who may
access to personal data, only processes these on instructions from it
personal data controller.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment of the publication
The Data Inspectorate assesses that the publication of a private person
correspondence to an authority has gone beyond a conceivable purpose of
publish parts of the current case on the web (to provide the public with insight into
municipal activities). Thus, there has been nothing special,
expressly stated and justified purpose of the publication of the relevant
personal data. Furthermore, there has been no legal basis for that
publish the personal data and the publication has not been covered by anything
exceptions to the ban on the processing of sensitive personal data.
Social security numbers have been published without the conditions set out in ch. § 10
the Data Protection Act have been complied with.
The Health and Medical Care Board has only worked with oral
instructions to the employees who were responsible for publishing the board's
documents on the web. The publication should have been preceded by an assessment of
if it was permitted under the Data Protection Regulation. That this has not happened indicates
that the board has failed in the instructions to those who work under the board
oversight. This means that the board has not taken appropriate action
organizational security measures to protect against unauthorized publication of
personal information on the web.
The Data Inspectorate has in a number of decisions about municipalities' web publications
according to the Personal Data Act1 stated that an appropriate organizational measure for
to protect personal data from improper publication are written procedures for
web publishing. Such routines should be used by staff and should
determine when personal data may be published, who should do it

The Personal Data Act (1998: 204), PuL, entered into force on 24 October 1998 and ceased to
apply on 24 May 2018. The Data Inspectorate was the supervisory authority according to PuL until
The Data Protection Ordinance began to apply on 25 May 2018.

the assessment, how long the data should be stored on the web, work routine for
masking of sensitive or classified information, handling of linked
documents and an indication of who is responsible for publication and
possible deletion of data.2 Other appropriate measures may be to see
to ensure that staff receive adequate training in the Data Protection Regulation and how
it must work so that personal data is not handled in violation of the regulations.
Such training can ensure that the person who publishes personal data on
the website does this in accordance with its instructions
personal data controller.
The routines that the health and medical care board had have not been enough to
protect personal data from publication in violation of the Data Protection Regulation.
Sufficient measures have not been taken to ensure that those who
publishes personal data under the supervision of the board does so in accordance
with the board's instructions for publication.
The Data Inspectorate therefore states that the Health and Medical Care Board in
Örebro County Region has violated Articles 5, 6, 9 and 32 of
the Data Protection Ordinance, and ch. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act.
Choice of intervention
The Data Inspectorate has found that the board has published sensitive
personal information and social security number on Region Örebro County's website and
that the board lacks written routines for web publishing. The publication
which has taken place has lacked a legitimate purpose and legal basis. The publication
has not been covered by any of the exceptions to the prohibition on processing
sensitive personal data. This means that the board has considered
personal data in breach of the principles of purpose limitation and
data minimization in Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation, the provision on
legal treatment in Article 6 and the ban on the treatment of sensitive
personal data in Article 9. The publication of social security numbers does not comply
the conditions in ch. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act and is therefore contrary to it
the provision.
Article 58 of the Data Protection Regulation lists all of the Data Inspectorate
powers. The Data Inspectorate has in case of violations of

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2020-1539

the Data Protection Regulation a number of corrective powers available under
Article 58 (2) (a) to (j), including reprimand, injunction and penalty fees.
It follows from Article 58 (2) of the Data Protection Ordinance that the Data Inspectorate in
in accordance with Article 83 shall impose penalty charges in addition to or in lieu of
other corrective measures referred to in Article 58 (2),
the circumstances of each individual case. If it is a question of a smaller
infringement, the supervisory authority may, in accordance with recital 148 i
the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one
penalty fee.
A penalty fee shall be paid
The Data Inspectorate has assessed that the board has violated Articles 5, 6, 9
and 32 in the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act, adopted
on the basis of Article 87 of the Data Protection Regulation. These articles are covered
of Articles 83.4 and 83.5. In the event of a violation of these shall
the supervisory authority consider imposing administrative penalty fees
in addition to, or instead of, other corrective actions.
The Data Inspectorate assesses that this is not a minor violation.
This is against the background that the personal data that was published was sensitive
and touched a patient. Furthermore, the person could not reasonably expect that
his correspondence was made available to a large circle. In addition, var
the personal data was published for a long time without it being discovered by
the board. There is no reason to reimburse the penalty fee with anyone else
Corrective Action. The Health and Medical Care Board must thus be imposed on one
administrative penalty fee.
Determination of the amount of the sanction
According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall:
ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual
cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
For authorities, according to ch. 6 § 2 second paragraph of the Data Protection Act that
the penalty fee shall be set at a maximum of SEK 5,000,000 at
infringements referred to in Article 83 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation and at most
SEK 10,000,000 for infringements referred to in Article 83 (5). Violations of
Articles 5, 6, 9 and 3 Section 10 of the Data Protection Act (adopted on the basis of
Article 87) are subject to the higher penalty fees referred to in Article 83 (5) and

7 (10)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2020-1539

infringements of Article 32 are covered by the lower maximum amount referred to in Article
83.4.
Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation sets out factors to be taken into account in
determining the amount of the penalty fee. These factors include a)
the nature, severity and duration of the infringement; (b) the infringement
committed intentionally or through negligence; (c) the measures taken by it
personal data controllers have taken to alleviate the damage they
registered suffered, d) the degree of responsibility of the personal data controller with
taking into account the technical measures implemented in accordance with Article 32,
(g) the categories of personal data covered by the infringement;
manner in which the infringement came to the attention of the supervisory authority, in particular
whether and to what extent the person responsible for personal data reported
the infringement.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment of the size of the penalty fee is taken into account
taken to the following.
The violation has concerned sensitive personal data regarding a person in
dependency for which the publication of the data may have been obtained
serious consequences. Furthermore, the information has been published openly
the region's website for a long time. That there was a lack of appropriate technical
and organizational measures to ensure such personal data do not
published poses a risk that similar events will occur again.
The lack of appropriate security measures is reflected in the fact that the board does not
himself discovered the incorrect publication. However, the publication has not
intentionally and there is no indication that more than one person in
the reality would have been affected by incorrect publications of sensitive
personal data. The board will be added to this as soon as it becomes aware
if the event has acted by deleting the published document,
inform the data subject and inform the staff concerned and that
work has begun on developing written routines. The Data Inspectorate
also notes that the region has made a personal data incident report
on behalf of the board to the Data Inspectorate and followed the regulations that
exists in that respect.
The publication of personal data on the board's open website refers to one
and the same conduct and includes infringement of Articles 5, 6 and 9 of
the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2020-1539

The penalty fee for the violation of Article 32 refers to the Board
organizational security measures when publishing on open websites and
is thus determined separately.
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that the Health and
The health care board in the Örebro County Region must pay an administrative fee
a penalty fee of SEK 120,000 for the violations of Articles 5, 6, 9 and
32 of the Data Protection Ordinance and ch. 3 Section 10 of the Data Protection Act. Of this
amount refers to SEK 80,000 violations of Articles 5, 6 and 9 of
the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 3. Section 10 of the Data Protection Act and 40,000
refers to the violation of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation.
Order for further organizational measures
Pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d), the Data Inspectorate has the power to impose a
personal data controller to ensure that a processing takes place in accordance with
the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. It is clear from Article 58 (2) that
administrative penalty fees can be combined with injunctions.
The Health and Medical Care Board has not taken sufficient organizational steps
measures under Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation to ensure that
personal data is protected from unauthorized publication on the region's website,
such as drawing up written instructions and ensuring that the person
publishes personal information on the website does so in accordance with
the instructions.
The Health and Medical Care Board in Örebro County Region must therefore be ordered to
establish written instructions and establish procedures to ensure that
who publish personal data on open websites do so accordingly
with the instructions.

This decision was made by the Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after
presentation by [lawyer] Elin Hallström. At the final processing
also has General Counsel Hans-Olof Lindblom, Unit Manager Malin Blixt and
unit manager Katarina Tullstedt participated. IT security specialist Magnus
Bergström has participated in the assessments concerning information security.
