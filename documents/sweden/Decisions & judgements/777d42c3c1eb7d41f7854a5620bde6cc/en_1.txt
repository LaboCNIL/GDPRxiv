the personal data incident refers to.
Implementation and method
During the review, the following has mainly emerged.
On 25 February 2020, the Data Inspectorate asked a number of questions
The police authority for written answers.
The Police Authority's response states that the indictment register in November
2019 was migrated to a new technical platform, which required changes in
the communication with the system extract register (RUT). The current one
the function underwent both unit tests, system tests and acceptance tests before
it was commissioned. The system is complex and a couple of shortcomings were discovered
caused errors in certain types of extracts from the debit register. In total
are 448 individuals who have requested information about themselves affected by
it occurred. The register extracts that have been sent to the persons concerned have
contained too little or too much information. Of the incorrect extracts referred to
407 paragraph such complete extracts that individuals may request to exercise
their right of access to the debit register and the remaining 41 incorrect extracts
referred to such limited extracts that individuals may request to show
or leave to employers. When the extent of the problem became known
the registry extraction service was paused pending the error.
The police authority has subsequently supplemented coding and thinning logic in
the system with what was missing after the migration to the new platform.
The police authority has stated that when a modernization or update of
the technical platform becomes relevant again, the tests will be organized
and designed so that similar errors do not recur. The police authority
further intends to investigate the possibilities of automatic tests to avoid
errors in the future caused by the human factor.
Due to the incorrect extract from the register, the Police Authority has
taken a number of measures. The authority has, among other things, published one
press release with general information about what happened and
notified all individuals who received an incorrect extract. Further has
correct extracts have been sent out to the persons concerned and the incorrect extracts
have been requested to prevent their use. The police authority has
further stated that they followed up which extracts were submitted and made one

careful investigation and risk assessment of the 41 incorrect extracts that can
be used to search for certain types of jobs.

Justification of decision
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
Section 1 of the Load Register Act (1998: 620) states that the Police Authority
with the help of automated processing shall keep a load register.
The authority is responsible for personal data for the processing of personal data
in the register. The law contains provisions regarding the registration of
persons who have been convicted or have not been charged with a crime and apply in addition
Criminal Data Act (2018: 1877).
Section 2 of the Load Register Act states that the load register must be kept
to provide information on such load data as is needed in
activities of law enforcement agencies. The register may also be used
to provide an individual with information that is of particular importance in his or her
her business. It can e.g. are alarm installation companies or
individual employers in the healthcare sector who need information about
persons to be employed in the business.
The investigation shows that the Police Authority has taken a number of measures
in direct connection with the authority becoming aware of the current situation
technical problem which meant that a number of incorrect registry extracts from
the debit register was sent during the period 19 November 2019 up to and including
on 13 January 2020. Among other things, the register extraction service was temporarily stopped in
waiting for the problem to be fixed, correct extracts and information
was sent to the persons concerned and the Police Authority reported without
delay the incident to the Data Inspectorate. It happened
the personal data incident has not affected what data is available about
persons in the debit register or how long the data is stored.
In summary, the Data Inspectorate states that the Police Authority has
rectified the technical error that involved sending out extract from the register
the load register during the period 19 November 2019 up to and including the 13th
January 2020 has become incorrect. The Data Inspectorate therefore does not take any
further action.
