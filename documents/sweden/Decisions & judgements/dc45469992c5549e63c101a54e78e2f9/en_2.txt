Information
On 25 May 2018, the EU Data Protection Regulation began to apply. Since
The Data Protection Ordinance is directly applicable in Sweden, as well as in the others
EU Member States, it is therefore the provisions of the Regulation
which is now to be applied in the processing of personal data.
The Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice on
record keeping and processing of personal data in health care
(HSLF-FS 2016: 40), constitutes supplementary legislation with regard to
personal data processing in health care.
Before the Data Protection Ordinance came into force, the government appointed one
inquiry - the Social Data Protection Inquiry - which has reviewed
the register statutes within the Ministry of Social Affairs' area of activity,
for example, the Patient Data Act and HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The Data Inspectorate
notes that with regard to the current provisions of the Patient Data Act
in this decision, these are essentially unchanged.
The Data Inspectorate's inspection of the Elderly Committee in Uppsala municipality
implemented before the Data Protection Regulation came into force, why
the inspection will not in this decision make use of the corrective
powers with regard to penalty fees.

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has examined the elderly committee and the care committee
allocation of permissions, log checks and asked questions within the framework of
the coherent record keeping regarding the Siebel record system
(hereinafter the journal system).
An inspection was carried out by the care committee and the elderly committee
on February 3, 2017. The Data Inspectorate examined the municipal health and
the healthcare's processing of personal data attributable to patients within
framework of the medical record system.

The Elderly Committee was submitted on 24 February 2017 with supplementary information
The Data Inspectorate and submitted certain comments on the inspection report.
On 25 October 2018, the Data Inspectorate requested that the senior citizens' committee should
provide additional information, due to the fact that the processing had
taken longer than expected. Above all, the inspectorate wanted to know about
the processing of personal data in the record system had changed in proportion
to when the inspection was performed on February 3, 2017.
Opinion from the senior citizens' committee was received by the Swedish Data Inspectorate on 13 November
2018, and i.a. the following appears. “The personal data processing in
the record system has not changed in relation to when the inspection was made.
On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the municipality has begun a procurement of future
documentation system which will replace Siebel. The idea is thus that
a new record system will be in place in 2019 or at least 2020. "
The Data Inspectorate has delimited its supervision in such a way that the audit concerns
authorization assignment and barriers in the journal system.
The Elderly Committee has mainly stated the following.
General information about municipal health care
Uppsala Municipality has since 1 January 2017 divided the responsibility for it
municipal health care on two different boards - the senior board and
the care board.
The Elderly Committee
The Elderly Committee is responsible for information regarding municipal commitments according to
The Health Care Act (HSL) for persons over 65 years of age, but not for
persons covered by the law on support and service to certain
disabled (LSS) or who have a mental disability.
The Elderly Committee's activities are conducted by the Elderly Administration under the leadership of
a managing director. The elderly administration is responsible for home health care in
special housing for the elderly and home care in ordinary housing for those over 65
year. MAS (medically responsible nurse) is organized in a quality and
development unit with a department head. Area manager as well
operations manager according to HSL is for ordinary housing organized under
head of the home care department. All special accommodation for the elderly has its own
operations manager HSL, which is organized under the department manager at

Department of Housing. The elderly administration has a staff that is responsible for
strategic health issues as well as procurement, agreements and
contract follow-up.
The Care Board has stated the following
The care board is responsible for information regarding the municipal commitment
according to HSL for persons under the age of 65 who are covered by LSS or who have one
physical disability. The care committee's activities are conducted by
The care administration under the leadership of an administrative director.
The administration is primarily responsible for home health care in special housing
disabled and ordinary housing for persons who have received a decision according to
LSS or the Social Services Act (SOL) and is under 65 years of age. The administration has also
employed licensed personnel who are organized in a separate department with
department manager and operations manager according to HSL and own MAS.
Emergency care
In Uppsala municipality, there are several private actors who perform municipal
home health care. Their assignments are governed by agreements between the boards and them
private providers. During the inspection, it was stated that Uppsala municipality
agreement on health care with the private care providers only
refers to the time between kl. 07-17. Other times, ie. between 17-07, it is the municipality
responsible for patients in the municipal health care and
for the patients of the private care providers.
Of the supplementary information received by the Data Inspectorate on 24
February 2017 it emerged that when it comes to health care interventions in
ordinary accommodation (ie for those who remain in their home) has
the home care providers are responsible for healthcare interventions between 7-16. When it
In the case of special housing, the private actors are responsible between 7-22. Other
time, individuals' needs for health care interventions are met by it
municipal emergency medical care, ie. part of the municipality's own account.
The elderly administration performs all health and medical care during on-call time "on-call medical care",
also for users who belong to the care committee's area of responsibility or who
the boards have a principal responsibility for but which is conducted by private individuals
actors.

The personal data responsibility for the processing of personal data in
the medical record system regarding the municipal health care in
Uppsala municipality
The Elderly Board states that the boards are responsible for personal data
each board's area of responsibility according to the Patient Data Act. It appears that one
patient can be relevant within both the care committee and the elderly committee.
With regard to the activities called "emergency care", the senior citizens' committee has, based on the definition specified in ch. Section 6 of the Patient Data Act - assessed that
personal data liability is linked to the processing that an authority purely
actually performs. Because the executing authority in this case is
the senior citizens 'committee, the municipality has made the assessment that the senior citizens' committee
is responsible for the processing of personal data in the business system as far as it is concerned
documentation relating to medical care during on-call time.
Personal data processing in the record system
The medical record system has been used in Uppsala municipality since June 2012 and that
is the municipality that handles the operation of the system. The journal system is used both
in health care and in social services. The journal information from
however, the different business areas are separated.
At the top of the patient's medical record is shown if there is specific information about
the patient under the heading "warning or observandum". To “warning or
observandum ”should be visible in the journal, an ordinary journal entry is written and
the line is marked with keyword 1 "observandum" and then with keyword 2
"Warning, infection or observation". Warnings are e.g. allergies and these
marked with a red triangle. Infection and observations are marked with one
exclamation mark. Observandum is always visible in the patient's medical record
patient safety reasons. It is p.g.a. a previous complaint that has been decided
to do this.
Eligibility
The document Siebel - Organizational Tree Patient Journal states the following.
Authorization level 1 - “Records are only available for leg. staff within
one and the same organization, in this case for leg. staff within Uppsala
municipality (own management). This means that when leg. staff within Uppsala municipality
(own direction) writes a journal entry for a customer so has all the leg. staff
within one's own organization access to it no matter what

business area / business area leg. the staff is located in / works in.
This is because journals are created / written at the highest level (Level 1),
which means that the customer always has a journal, regardless of whether he or she is up to date
several business areas / business areas within Uppsala municipality (own
regi).


Licensed staff, regardless of where they are located, writes
always in one and the same journal.



If the patient moves to another unit / ward, regardless of where in
organization, the patient record remains intact. Example:
Licensed staff in a special accommodation can continue to work in one
started care plan, created by licensed staff on one
alternating care accommodation.



The record is not affected in the event of a reorganization.



As long as there is a care relationship, no dialogue needs to take place outside
the business system (fax, mail, telephone, etc.). This leads to a pile
patient safety. "

Authorization level 2 - The private care providers establish / record at the intermediate level (Level 2), ”which means that leg. staff working with the same customer
but who is located / works in another business area / business area
do not have the opportunity to read the journal entry. It also means that it is
secrecy between the different business areas / business areas as a result
that each business area / business area prepares its own journal for
customer to whom you have a care relationship. In other words, a customer can have several
records within one and the same organization as this takes place at Level 2. "
Authorization level 3 - Means access to records for one or more devices.
During the inspection, a list was submitted to the Data Inspectorate - Order
system role - which describes the different roles that exist in the journal system. Of
this list appears i.a. that certain roles - such as nurses,
occupational therapists and physiotherapists / physiotherapists - have competence level 1.
No needs and risk analysis has been presented by the senior citizens' committee.
Emergency care
The senior citizens' committee states that the night nurses, about 15-20 nurses, work
on call at night and all of these nurses are employed by
the senior citizens' committee. These nurses have qualifications for tasks in
the medical record system attributable in part to patients in the municipal health

The Data Inspectorate

and healthcare, partly to information about patients at the private care providers.
To be able to log in to the private care providers' patient records use
the nurses of so-called positioning. Positioning means that
the nurses change the unit / organizational part that they currently have
work from outside, for example which care provider or which unit within
the caregiver they work from. Only these night nurses
has the current positioning option.
Night nurses who visit the private caregivers' patients log in and
record in the private care provider's journal. There is no consent from
current patients to staff in the municipal health and
healthcare may be given access to the private data providers' patient data in
the journal system.
The municipality's view is that it is the municipal care provider that is
responsible care provider during the times of the day when there is no agreement with
the private caregivers. The municipality considers this to be problematically clean
legally, no matter how big or small the private caregiver is.
Coherent record keeping according to ch. 6 the Patient Data Act
The Elderly Committee states that the municipal health service participates in
system for coherent record keeping through national patient overview
(NPÖ) and through the journal system. Before the unified record keeping
was introduced in the municipality, investigations were made to check that
implementation was correct. The municipality considers that it meets the requirements in
Chapter 6 the Patient Data Act.
There are guidelines for the unified record keeping within it
municipal health care. The medical record system includes the municipal one
health care together with about 10 private care providers. The document
Guideline for information management and record keeping regarding health and
healthcare has been submitted to the Data Inspectorate.
In order for health and medical staff in the municipality to be able to take part
data from and make available data for private care providers as well
uses the journal system, in addition to what was previously stated
with regard to night nurses in emergency care, the patient's consent must be obtained
first obtained. The municipality states that obtaining consent only means that
current caregivers are given the opportunity to read other caregivers' notes. To

Documenting consent is mandatory to enable reading by others
caregiver's journal.
The municipality carried out information initiatives aimed at the municipality
citizens in connection with that system for coherent record keeping
was introduced. There is also information about coherent record keeping
the municipality's website.
The staff who obtain the patient's consent to take part in information
through coherent record keeping, provides information to the patient in connection
with the consent obtained.
Bar (coherent record keeping)
The elderly committee states that the patient can block their medical record so that it is private
caregivers cannot take part in their information through the medical record system.
The patient does not block against a special care provider, but the patient blocks everything
opportunity for all other caregivers to read. The lock can only be lifted off
the care provider by whom the block is established, regardless of whether it is a private one
caregiver or caregiver in Uppsala municipality.
However, there is no possibility for the patient to block their data as
is dealt with by the elderly committee for the care committee and vice versa. One
discussion is underway within the municipality about what measures must be taken
due to the reorganization of the municipal health care.
Documentation of access (logs)
All roles that have access to patient data in the medical record system
logged, including e.g. technicians who need access to the system.
The Elderly Committee's view is that the logs contain all that information
as the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (SOSFS 2008: 14) on
record keeping and information management in health care prescribes.
The municipality also performs log checks.

Reason for the decision
Authorization assignment in the journal system
It appears from ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act, that the care provider shall
determine the conditions for granting access rights to such
data on patients who are fully or partially automated. Such
eligibility shall be limited to what is necessary for the individual to be able to
fulfill their duties in health care.
Of ch. 4 §§ 1-3 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 states that the care provider shall be responsible for that
each user is assigned an individual privilege to access
personal data and before he decides on the allocation of authority, shall
a needs and risk analysis is carried out.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The provisions of the Patient Data Act aim to take care of both
privacy protection and patient safety, see chap. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act.
The legislator has thus made a balance in terms of how the information
shall be treated to meet both patient safety and privacy requirements.
The Data Inspectorate can establish that the requirements of the care provider
authorization allocation in ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act is clear.
Eligibility must be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to
fulfill their duties in health care, based on a needs and risk analysis in accordance with ch. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The Data Inspectorate can further state that all licensed personnel within
the senior citizens' committee has been assigned competence level 1, which means that they have
access to all journals created / written at this level. Regarding
the night nurses at the senior citizens' committee, they have also been given the opportunity to
use so-called positioning in the journal system, which actually entails
access to all private caregivers' patient records in emergency care without
patients have agreed to this.
Because different users have different tasks within different
work areas, this is a wider competence than what is permitted under
the Patient Data Act. Limitation of a user's permissions must be made
based on a needs and risk analysis both within the framework of internal confidentiality,
and within the framework of the unified record keeping.

The Data Inspectorate states that the senior citizens' committee has not limited
users' permissions to only what is needed for the user to
be able to fulfill their duties in health care.
The Board of the Elderly has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 32
the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and
Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The Data Inspectorate therefore submits to the senior citizens' committee that after a needs and
risk analysis assign each user individual privileges to access
personal data in the journal system Siebel, to what is needed to it
individuals must be able to fulfill their duties in health care in
in accordance with ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 2
HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
One caregiver's treatment of another caregiver's unobstructed
personal data
The provisions on the conditions under which a care provider may treat
unlocked personal data made available by another care provider
the system of coherent record keeping, can be found in ch. § 3
the Patient Data Act. It states that three conditions must be met - it is required that
the data relate to a patient with whom there is a current care relationship, that
the data can be assumed to be important for prevention, investigation or treatment
diseases and injuries of the patient in health care and that
the patient agrees to this.
The preparatory work for the Patient Data Act states that active consent is required
from the patient's side (Bill 2007/08: 126, p. 252 f).
Furthermore, it follows from ch. § 6 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 that the care provider shall be responsible for that
an authorized user's access to unlocked data about a patient in a
other care provider, preceded by the user checking that the conditions
for the processing of personal data according to ch. 6 Section 3 or Section 3 a of the Patient Data Act
(2008: 355) are fulfilled and then make an active choice to take part in
the data.
The Elderly Committee has stated that the night nurses in emergency care can
use so-called positioning in the journal system - in order to get
access to the patients' personal data in the private care providers
medical records, partly to the patients' personal data within the municipal health

and healthcare. The night nurses also keep records in the private ones
caregivers' records. The board has also stated that some consent from
the patients in question have not been collected before this happens.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate can state that the senior citizens' committee has not obtained one
active consent of the patients of the private care providers, before
the night nurses take part of the patients' personal data with the private ones
caregivers.
Active consent is required before users of the senior citizens' committee can process
unlocked personal data made available by another healthcare provider
through the system of unified record keeping. For a caregiver to receive
process such information that a guardian does not have the right to block
according to § 2 fourth paragraph second sentence is required that the conditions according to
first paragraph 1 and 2 or second paragraph 1 and 2 are fulfilled (see Chapter 6, Section 3
third paragraph of the Patient Data Act).
If there is a danger to the patient's life or otherwise there is a serious risk
his health, and the consent can not be obtained according to ch. § 3
the Patient Data Act, the care provider can still treat under certain conditions
the unobstructed information, see chap. Section 4, second paragraph, of the Patient Data Act.
With regard to the issue of consent, the Data Inspectorate notes that it is off
The preparatory work shows that in some cases consent can be given in advance, before
the current patient relationship has arisen (Bill 2007/08: 126, p. 253).
The Data Inspectorate finds that night nurses within the elderly committee
emergency care takes care of patients' unlocked personal data with others
caregivers without the consent of the patients, and without the presence of anything
other exception according to ch. 6 § 3 and ch. 6 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.
The Board of the Elderly has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 32
the Data Protection Ordinance and Chapter 6 Section 3 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 6
HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The Data Inspectorate instructs the senior citizens' committee to stop giving users
access to patients' unlocked personal data with other care providers, without
consent and without there being grounds for exemption according to ch. § 3 and
Chapter 6 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.

The patient's right to block in the medical record system
The rules on the care provider's obligation to provide an opportunity for
the patient to block their care documentation in IT systems can be found in
Chapter 4 Section 4 and Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Patient Data Act. Further supplemented
the provisions of the Patient Data Act of HSLF-FS 2016: 40. See especially ch. 4 § 5 and
Chapter 4 7-8 §§ HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
Of ch. 4 Section 4, first paragraph of the Patient Data Act states that personal data such as
documented for purposes specified in ch. § 4 points 1 and 2 of a
care unit or within a care process, may not be made available through
electronic access for those who work at another care unit or within one
another care process at the same care provider, if the patient objects. IN
in such cases, the task shall be blocked immediately. Guardians of a child have, however
not the right to block the child's information. Information that there are blocked
information may be available to other care units or care processes.
Of ch. 6 Section 2, fourth paragraph, of the Patient Data Act states that if a patient
opposes that information other than that specified in the second paragraph is the same
legal space is made available to other care providers through cohesion
record keeping, the data must be blocked immediately. The guardian of a child
can not, however, block information about the child. The section thus states that
the patient's right to object to data being made available in it
coherent record keeping includes all information except information on
that there are blocked data and which care provider has blocked these.
It further follows from ch. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act that disclosure through
direct access to personal data is only permitted to the extent that
specified in law or regulation. It follows from the second paragraph that if a county council or a
municipality conducts health care through several authorities, receives one
authority have direct access to personal data processed by someone
another such authority in the same county council or municipality.
“The fact that direct access in a particular case is allowed within a
However, the caregiver's organization does not affect the application of those provisions
which implies other limitations of the possibilities of in a specific
care situation get access to personal data, e.g. the rules on blocking
personal data according to Chapter 4 ”, (see Bill 2007/08: 126, p. 245).

The Elderly Committee has stated that the information in "Observandum" is always visible in
the patient's medical record for patient safety reasons, due to the past
complaint.
The Elderly Committee has further stated that there is no possibility for
the patient to block their data processed by the senior citizens' committee for
the care board and vice versa.
However, the Elderly Committee has stated that it is technically possible to block the patient
data against all other care providers within the framework of the cohesive
record keeping and that the lock can only be lifted by the care provider who
established the barrier.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The patient's right to block applies both in the internal secrecy as well as in
system for coherent record keeping. When the patient requests his
care documentation must be blocked, the care documentation must not be available
electronically available for other care units or care processes
or, via direct access, for other care providers.
There is no legal possibility for the caregiver to exempt certain
care documentation from the patient's barrier option within the framework of the internal
secrecy. This means that if the patient requests it, the care provider must block
all care documentation in the medical record system - which includes
care documentation found in "Observandum".
In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate states that
the senior citizens' committee does not have technical functions for barriers in the medical record system
Siebel between the elderly committee and the care committee, as regards
the care documentation in "Observandum". The Elderly Committee has thus
processed personal data in breach of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation and
Chapter 4 Section 4 and Chapter 5 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate instructs the senior citizens' committee to introduce technical measures
functions for barriers in the medical record system between the senior citizens' committee and
the care board according to ch. 4 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.

A caregiver's duty to keep records
It appears from ch. § 1 of the Patient Data Act that this Act is applied to
caregivers' processing of personal data in health care.
I 3 kap. the same law contains explicit provisions regarding the obligation to
keep patient records. According to ch. Section 1 of the Patient Data Act shall apply to the care of
patients are kept patient records.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Elderly Committee is responsible for personal data for all processing of
personal data that takes place at the board, which includes processing of
personal data in patient records.
If a care provider records personal data with another care provider, ie. in
patient records of other data controllers, this means that the most
the basic conditions in the Patient Data Act are not met.
The Data Inspectorate can state that the night nurses keep records in
patient records of other personal data controllers. The requirement for record keeping,
its accuracy, its preservation, etc. means that the record must be kept and
preserved by the senior citizens' committee. Legally, the elderly committee's night nurses
therefore only record personal data in the seniors' committee's journal system.
The Data Inspectorate states that the senior citizens' committee processes personal data in
in violation of Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation, by night nurses
within the senior citizens 'committee keeps records in other care providers' patient records, and not in
their own patient records, for medical care during on-call time. By keeping records
in other care providers' patient records, the elderly council does not meet the requirements in
Chapter 3 § 1 of the Patient Data Act and thus not its personal data responsibility according to
Article 5 of the Data Protection Regulation. The senior citizens' committee can neither be responsible for nor
show that they process the personal data in a lawful and correct manner or
ensure that the information is accurate and, if necessary, up-to-date, either
that the data is processed in a way that ensures appropriate security for
personal data - including protection against unauthorized or unauthorized processing
and against loss, destruction or damage by accident.
The Data Inspectorate instructs the senior citizens' committee to ensure that all record keeping takes place
in the elderly committee's own patient records.
