Information
On 25 May 2018, the EU Data Protection Regulation began to apply. Since
The Data Protection Ordinance is directly applicable in Sweden, as well as in the others
EU Member States, it is therefore the provisions of the Regulation
which is now to be applied in the processing of personal data.
The Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations and general advice on
record keeping and processing of personal data in health care
(HSLF-FS 2016: 40), constitutes supplementary legislation with regard to
personal data processing in health care.
Before the Data Protection Ordinance came into force, the government appointed one
inquiry - the Social Data Protection Inquiry - which has reviewed
the register statutes within the Ministry of Social Affairs' area of activity,
for example, the Patient Data Act and HSLF-FS 2016: 40. The Data Inspectorate
notes that with regard to the current provisions of the Patient Data Act
in this decision, these are essentially unchanged.
The Data Inspectorate's inspection of the Care Board in Uppsala municipality

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has examined the care committee and the elderly committee
allocation of permissions, log checks and asked questions within the framework of
the coherent record keeping regarding the Siebel record system
(hereinafter the journal system).
An inspection was carried out by the care committee and the elderly committee
on February 3, 2017. The Data Inspectorate examined the municipal health and
the healthcare's processing of personal data attributable to patients within
framework of the medical record system.
The Care Board submitted additional information on 24 February 2017
to the Data Inspectorate and submitted certain comments on
the inspection report.
On 25 October 2018, the Data Inspectorate requested that the care board should
provide additional information, due to the fact that the processing had
taken longer than expected. Above all, the inspectorate wanted to know about
the processing of personal data in the record system had changed in proportion
to when the inspection was performed on February 3, 2017.
Opinion from the care committee was received by the Data Inspectorate on 13 November
2018, and i.a. the following appears. “The personal data processing in
the record system has not changed in relation to when the inspection was made.
On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the municipality has begun a procurement of future
documentation system which will replace Siebel. The idea is thus that
a new record system will be in place in 2019 or at least 2020. "
The Data Inspectorate has delimited its supervision in such a way that the audit concerns
authorization assignment and barriers in the journal system.
The Care Board has mainly stated the following.
General information about municipal health care
Uppsala Municipality has since 1 January 2017 divided the responsibility for it
municipal health care on two different boards - the care board
and the senior citizens' committee.

strategic health issues as well as procurement, agreements and
contract follow-up.
Emergency care
In Uppsala municipality, there are several private actors who perform municipal
home health care. Their assignments are governed by agreements between the boards and them
private providers. During the inspection, it was stated that Uppsala municipality

refers to the time between kl. 07-17. Other times, ie. between 17-07, it is the municipality
responsible for patients in the municipal health care and
for the patients of the private care providers.

actors.
The personal data responsibility for the processing of personal data in
the medical record system regarding the municipal health care in
Uppsala municipality
The care board states that the boards are responsible for personal data
each board's area of responsibility according to the Patient Data Act. It appears that one
patient can be relevant within both the care committee and the elderly committee.
Personal data processing in the record system
The medical record system has been used in Uppsala municipality since June 2012 and that
is the municipality that handles the operation of the system. The journal system is used both
in health care and in social services. The journal information from
however, the different business areas are separated.
At the top of the patient's medical record is shown if there is specific information about
the patient under the heading "warning or observandum". To “warning or
observandum ”should be visible in the journal, an ordinary journal entry is written and
the line is marked with keyword 1 "observandum" and then with keyword 2
"Warning, infection or observation". Warnings are e.g. allergies and these
marked with a red triangle. Infection and observations are marked with one
exclamation mark. Observandum is always visible in the patient's medical record
patient safety reasons. It is p.g.a. a previous complaint that has been decided
to do this.

Coherent record keeping according to ch. 6 the Patient Data Act
The care committee states that the municipal health service participates in
system for coherent record keeping through national patient overview
(NPÖ) and through the journal system. Before the unified record keeping
was introduced in the municipality, investigations were made to check that
implementation was correct. The municipality considers that it meets the requirements in
Chapter 6 the Patient Data Act.
There are guidelines for the unified record keeping within it
municipal health care. It is included in the business system
municipal health care together with about 10 private care providers.
The document Guideline for information management and record keeping applies
health care has been submitted to the Swedish Data Inspectorate.
In order for health and medical staff in the municipality to be able to take part
data from and make data available to private care providers, as well
uses the medical record system, the patient's consent must first be obtained.
The municipality states that obtaining consent only means that it is relevant
caregivers are given the opportunity to read other caregivers' notes. To
Documenting consent is mandatory to enable reading by others
caregiver's journal.
The municipality carried out information initiatives aimed at the municipality
citizens in connection with that system for coherent record keeping
was introduced. There is also information about coherent record keeping
the municipality's website.
The staff who obtain the patient's consent to take part in information
through coherent record keeping, provides information to the patient in connection
with the consent obtained.
Bar (coherent record keeping)
The care committee states that the patient can block their medical record so that it is private
caregivers cannot take part in their information through the medical record system.
The patient does not block against a special care provider, but the patient blocks everything
opportunity for all other caregivers to read. The lock can only be lifted off
the care provider by whom the block is established, regardless of whether it is a private one
caregiver or caregiver in Uppsala municipality.

However, there is no possibility for the patient to block their data as
is dealt with by the care committee for the elderly committee and vice versa. One
discussion is underway within the municipality about what measures must be taken
due to the reorganization of the municipal health care.
Documentation of access (logs)
All roles that have access to patient data in the business system
logged, including e.g. technicians who need access to the system.
The care committee's view is that the logs contain all that information
as the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations (SOSFS 2008: 14) on
record keeping and information management in health care prescribes.
The municipality also performs log checks.

Reason for the decision
Authorization assignment in the journal system
It appears from ch. § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act, that the care provider shall
determine the conditions for granting access rights to such
data on patients who are fully or partially automated. Such
eligibility shall be limited to what is necessary for the individual to be able to
fulfill their duties in health care.
Of ch. 4 §§ 1-3 HSLF-FS 2016: 40 states that the care provider shall be responsible for that
each user is assigned an individual privilege to access
personal data and before he decides on the allocation of authority, shall
a needs and risk analysis is carried out.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The provisions of the Patient Data Act aim to take care of both
privacy protection and patient safety, see chap. Section 2 of the Patient Data Act.
The legislator has thus made a balance in terms of how the information
shall be treated to meet both patient safety and privacy requirements.
The Data Inspectorate can establish that the requirements of the care provider
authorization allocation in ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act is clear.
Eligibility must be limited to what is needed for the individual to be able to

8 (12)

The Data Inspectorate

2019-06-28

Diarienr

143-2017

fulfill their duties in health care, based on a needs and risk analysis in accordance with ch. 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The Data Inspectorate can further state that all licensed personnel within
the care board has been assigned competence level 1, which means that they have
access to all journals created / written at this level.
Because different users have different tasks within different
work areas, this is a wider competence than what is permitted under
the Patient Data Act. Limitation of a user's permissions must be made
based on a needs and risk analysis both within the framework of internal confidentiality,
and within the framework of the unified record keeping.
The Data Inspectorate states that the care board has not limited
users' permissions to only what is needed for the user to
be able to fulfill their duties in health care.
The Care Board has thus processed personal data in violation of the article
32 the Data Protection Ordinance and ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and
Chapter 4 2 § HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The Data Inspectorate therefore submits to the care board that after a need and
risk analysis assign each user individual privileges to access
personal data in the journal system Siebel, to what is needed to it
individuals must be able to fulfill their duties in health care in
in accordance with ch. 4 § 2 and ch. 6 Section 7 of the Patient Data Act and Chapter 4 § 2
HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
The patient's right to block in the medical record system
The rules on the care provider's obligation to provide an opportunity for
the patient to block their care documentation in IT systems can be found in
Chapter 4 Section 4 and Chapter 6 Section 2 of the Patient Data Act. Further supplemented
the provisions of the Patient Data Act of HSLF-FS 2016: 40. See especially ch. 4 § 5 and
Chapter 4 7-8 §§ HSLF-FS 2016: 40.
Of ch. 4 Section 4, first paragraph of the Patient Data Act states that personal data such as
documented for purposes specified in ch. § 4 points 1 and 2 of a
care unit or within a care process, may not be made available through
electronic access for those who work at another care unit or within one
another care process at the same care provider, if the patient objects. IN

in such cases, the task shall be blocked immediately. Guardians of a child have, however
not the right to block the child's information. Information that there are blocked
information may be available to other care units or care processes.
Of ch. 6 Section 2, fourth paragraph, of the Patient Data Act states that if a patient
opposes that information other than that specified in the second paragraph is the same
legal space is made available to other care providers through cohesion
record keeping, the data must be blocked immediately. The guardian of a child
can not, however, block information about the child. The section thus states that
the patient's right to object to data being made available in it
coherent record keeping includes all information except information on
that there are blocked data and which care provider has blocked these.
It further follows from ch. Section 4 of the Patient Data Act that disclosure through
direct access to personal data is only permitted to the extent that
specified in law or regulation. It follows from the second paragraph that if a county council or a
municipality conducts health care through several authorities, receives one
authority have direct access to personal data processed by someone
another such authority in the same county council or municipality.
“The fact that direct access in a particular case is allowed within a
However, the caregiver's organization does not affect the application of those provisions
which implies other limitations of the possibilities of in a specific
care situation get access to personal data, e.g. the rules on blocking
personal data according to chap. 4 ” (See Bill 2007/08: 126, p. 245).
The Care Board has stated that the information in "Observandum" is always
visible in the patient's medical record for patient safety reasons, due to
previous complaints.
The Care Board has further stated that there is no possibility for
the patient to block their data processed by the care board for
the senior citizens' committee and vice versa.
However, the care committee has stated that it is technically possible to block the patient
data against all other care providers within the framework of the cohesive
record keeping and that the lock can only be lifted by the care provider who
established the barrier.

The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The patient's right to block applies both in the internal secrecy as well as in
system for coherent record keeping. When the patient requests his
care documentation must be blocked, the care documentation must not be available
electronically available for other care units or care processes
or, via direct access, for other care providers.
There is no legal possibility for the caregiver to exempt certain
care documentation from the patient's barrier option within the framework of the internal
secrecy. This means that if the patient requests it, the care provider must block
all care documentation in the medical record system - which includes
care documentation found in "Observandum".
In the light of the above, the Data Inspectorate states that
the care board does not have technical functions for barriers in the medical record system
Siebel between the care committee and the elderly committee, as far as is concerned
the care documentation in "Observandum". The care board thus has
processed personal data in breach of Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation and
Chapter 4 Section 4 and Chapter 5 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate instructs the care board to introduce technical
functions for barriers in the medical record system between the care board and
the senior citizens' committee according to ch. 4 Section 4 of the Patient Data Act.

This decision was made by the unit manager Katarina Tullstedt after the presentation
by the lawyer Maria Bergdahl.
