The Data Inspectorate

DI-2020-6231

Justification of decision
The Data Inspectorate's supervision only refers to the company's processing of
personal data collected through the form provided by the Swedish Data Inspectorate
taken part of.
Article 2 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation1 states that the Regulation shall:
applied to such processing of personal data as in whole or in part
carried out by automatic means and on treatment other than automatic by
personal data that is included in or will be included in a register.
The company's handling of the personal data requested in the form
does not imply such automated processing, or non-automated
processing in registers referred to in Article 2 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. The
the current handling of personal data is thus not covered by the scope of the Data Protection Regulation. The case must therefore be written off from further
processing.

This decision has been made by the unit manager Catharina Fernquist after
presentation by the lawyer Albin Brunskog.
