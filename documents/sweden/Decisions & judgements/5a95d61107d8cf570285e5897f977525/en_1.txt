Sergel Kredittjänster AB

Supervision according to the Debt Collection Act (1974: 182) - Sergel
Kredittjänster AB
The Data Inspectorate's decision
The Data Inspectorate finds that Sergel Kredittjänster AB has violated section 4
the Debt Collection Act through
to have as a routine to send debt collection claims via digital mailbox even if
a debtor has informed the company that he cannot or does not wish to take
part of shipments via that channel,
to urge in response to so-called simple objections
debtors to substantiate their objection to the debt collection company and send it in
evidence, as well as by
- extensive shortcomings in the availability of debtors.
The Data Inspectorate assumes that Sergel Kredittjänster AB takes measures for
to rectify the identified deficiencies. The management of digital
mailings and simple objections may be followed up. Sergel
Kredittjänster AB's measures in order to improve accessibility for
debtors will be followed up through renewed supervision.
The case is closed.

Report on the supervisory matter
On October 24, 2019, the Data Inspectorate conducted an inspection at Sergel
Kredittjänster AB (hereinafter Sergel). The inspection was undertaken
due to the fact that the Data Inspectorate routinely examines large players such as
has a debt collection permit.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

The purpose of the inspection was to investigate how the business is conducted and that
review Sergel's procedures for the debt collection procedure. Questions raised at
The inspection included, among other things, changes in operations, initial
checks, mutual information, design of debt collection claims, periodically
recurring receivables, accounting of settled amounts,
the use of digital mailbox, debtor contact, choice of process,
amortization plans and long-term monitoring.
After the inspection, the Data Inspectorate received many complaints against
Sergel from debtors who made it difficult to get in touch
with Sergel, both by phone and through My pages. Therefore expanded
The Data Inspectorate supervision on March 26, 2020 to also include
debtors' opportunities to get in touch with the company.

Reason for the decision
Applicable regulations
Debt collection operations must be conducted in accordance with good debt collection practice (Section 4 of the Debt Collection Act).
What is good debt collection procedure is stated in Sections 5–11 of the Debt Collection Act,
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's general advice "Application of the Debt Collection Act" and
The Data Inspectorate's practice in debt collection issues.
Digitized mailings of debt collection claims
Applicable provisions, etc.
Legal action in connection with the claim may not be taken until the debtor
requirements referred to in section 5 of the Debt Collection Act and the specified time has expired (Section 6
debt collection law). Section 5 of the Debt Collection Act requires that debt collection claims be made
in writing and have a certain content.
In the preparatory work for the Debt Collection Act, it is stated that the provision that the debtor must have
requirements do not imply anything other than that the creditor or his representative must have
have taken reasonable measures to ensure that the debtor receives the claim. Normally should
it should be sufficient that the demand letter is sent by post under the debtor's usual
address (prop. 1974: 42 p. 110).
According to good debt collection practice, mail to a debtor, who is not a trader,
sent to his population registration address or the special postal address which

2 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

has been registered with the Swedish Tax Agency, provided that the debtor has not provided information
that he or she can be reached at another address or this has been found on
other way (Datainspektionen's general advice, pp. 31.-32).
It can be considered contrary to section 6 of the Debt Collection Act to take legal action in this regard
has become known to the debt collection company that the claim has been sent to an incorrect one
address, unless the debt collection company knows that the claim has actually been reached
the debtor (Datainspektionen's general advice p. 17).
Background
Since 2018, Sergel has been using the digital mailbox service Kivra as
supplier for sending digital debt collection claims. Today, about 50% of all are sent
debt collection claims via Kivra.
Sergel considers that the company fulfills the requirement that the debtor must have been served
the debt collection claim by the debtor himself joining the service and
identified himself via BankID. Sergel equates the service with a regular mailbox
and uses the same deadline as for ordinary mailings in the debt collection claims
sent digitally, ie eight calendar days.
Sergel currently does not offer any opportunity for debtors who are affiliated with
Kivra to receive collection claims by post instead of via Kivra. Sergel can, however
inform the debtor of his possibility to remove Sergel as
sender in Kivra, which means that future letters from Sergel will be sent by post.
In the event that a debtor turns to Sergel and states that he does not
has received a collection request, for example due to limited access
to the Kivra service, it is possible to send the current debt collection claim via
mail.
Sergel has an ongoing discussion with its new debt collection system provider and
print supplier that Sergel will in future have the opportunity to on debtors
request themselves stop future digital shipments. However, Sergel experiences that
questions or wishes regarding this are unusual.
The Data Inspectorate has read the general terms and conditions for the Kivra service. I de
the general terms and conditions state, among other things, that a user can at any time
notify Kivra that it no longer wishes to receive e-mails from one
or multiple senders. After such notification, the user can continue to receive
e-mailings from the sender in question for a maximum of fifty-two days.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

Sergel has been given the opportunity to comment on the current writing in
the terms. Sergel has stated that Sergel makes checks against Kivra before
each separate debt collection claim, that Kivra's register with deregistrations is updated
once a week and that a debtor can therefore receive debt collection claims from Sergel via
Kivra no later than one week after the time of deregistration.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
By joining the Kivra digital mailbox, companies and
authorities, instead of sending letter in paper form by physical mail,
send letters as electronic mail to individuals and companies such as
has registered an account with Kivra.
In a decision on 28 August 2019, the Data Inspectorate has a case with
record number DI-2019-5660 assessed a debt collection company's mailing of
debt collection claims via Kivra. The decision stated that there is no requirement in
Section 5 of the Debt Collection Act stipulates that a debt collection claim must be sent to the debtor in
paper form. The Data Inspectorate further considered that the digital mailbox Kivra
is such a place that can be equated with the debtor's address about the debtor
voluntarily joined Kivra and did not notify the debt collection company or Kivra that
the digital mailbox may not be used for mailing by the debt collection company
debt collection claims. The Data Inspectorate found that mailing of a debt collection claim
via the digital mailbox, in the circumstances of the case,
could be considered to have been sent to the debtor in accordance with section 6 of the Debt Collection Act.
The Data Inspectorate thus considers that a debt collection company, under such
circumstances, can be considered to have taken reasonable measures for the debtor to
receive the claim when a debt collection claim is sent via a digital mailbox. The
assumes, however, that the conditions for the mailbox service are such that the debtor
has undertaken to monitor the digital mailbox and to take part in it
the shipments sent to it. In order for a debt collection company to be paid out
from the time the debtor monitors his digital mailbox, one must therefore, at the election
of a digital mailbox service as well as continuously during the contract period, in particular
review the terms and conditions that govern the user's obligation to take part
shipments.
If a debtor turns to the debt collection company and announces that he does not
wants future debt collection claims to be sent via a digital mailbox has one
debt collection companies, however, according to the Swedish Data Inspectorate, are no longer reasonable to expect
that the debtor will take part in shipments that are still sent on this

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

way. After the time a debt collection company has actually become aware that one
the debtor can not or does not wish to receive consignments from the company in it
digital mailbox, the Data Inspectorate considers that the debt collection company can not be considered
have taken reasonable measures to ensure that the debtor receives a collection claim
which is still sent to the digital mailbox. In that situation should
the debt collection company send items via physical mail to the debtor's
population registration address or the special postal address that has been registered with
The Swedish Tax Agency, provided that the debtor has not stated that he or she
can be reached at another address or this has been obtained in another way.
The Data Inspectorate further considers that it is contrary to section 6 of the Debt Collection Act that
take legal action if it has become known to the debt collection company that the claim
has been sent to a digital mailbox that the debtor has stated to him
does not monitor, unless the debt collection company knows that the claim has actually been met
to the debtor.
Sergel currently lacks the opportunity to stop future digital mailings
debtors' request but refers to Kivra. There is a risk that
Sergel may in certain situations take legal action in violation of 6
§ Debt Collection Act. The Data Inspectorate therefore assesses that Sergel's routines for
dispatch of debt collection claims via digital mailbox, when a debtor has provided information
that he can not or does not wish to receive consignments in this way, is in conflict
with good debt collection.
In light of what Sergel has stated that the request from debtors about
other means of dispatch are unusual, that debtors can unsubscribe from dispatch
via Kivra and then Sergel intends to offer this option in the future
The Data Inspectorate does not see a need to take any action at present.
However, the handling of digital mailings may be followed up within
framework for future supervision.
Handling simple objections
Applicable provisions, etc.
A summary process is not meaningful when the debtor has made a factual
objection which means that the claim must be examined substantively. If
it is clear that the debtor's objection is objectively substantiated should one
any action may instead be brought in court through a writ of summons.
According to good debt collection procedure, an application for an order for payment is therefore not received

5 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

submitted if the debtor has made it clear that the claim is disputed and stated one
factual basis for their objection (Datainspektionen's general advice p. 36 f.).
An incorrect choice of process form can further lead to an application or a decision
in cases of injunction, which in turn means that the debtor on
incorrect grounds are noted in the credit information register (Datainspektionens
general advice p. 37).
Background
In the case, it has emerged that when a debtor objects to a debt collection claim
Sergel handles the case in different ways, depending on the objection
classified as a simple objection or not. Examples of simpler
objections are that the debtor claims one he has paid but that Sergels
The client has stated that payment has not been received.
After Sergel has obtained the client's attitude to a dispute
of a simpler nature, and considers the matter investigated, Sergel tries as much as possible
to meet the debtor. In these cases, Sergel informs the debtor
the client's response and that the debtor can return if he wishes
maintain the opposition. If the debtor does not return after Sergel responded
in the case, the company may proceed with the application for
order for payment, which the debtor was also informed of earlier. At
more qualified objections, the case is handled directly by Sergels
legal department.
Sergel has submitted the following template for addressing an objection
payment.

The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate has stated in connection with previous supervision of Sergel
on Sergel's handling of so-called simpler objections, see
The Data Inspectorate's decision of 23 March 2012 in a case with a record number

6 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

1901-2011.
The Data Inspectorate emphasized in the decision that it is important for legal certainty that
debt collection companies do not act in court themselves, without letting the court decide
whether the debtor is liable to pay or not. To use it
summary process after the debtor has made a factual basis
objection is therefore required that the debtor withdraw his objection or that
the debt collection company in any case clearly urges the debtor to return for it
case he maintains his objection and in connection with it informs about his
intention to otherwise turn to the Swedish Enforcement Agency and then give
the debtor reasonable time to respond. The Data Inspectorate assumed that Sergel would
follow these instructions so as not to cause debtors unnecessary inconvenience.
The Data Inspectorate can initially state that it is an example of
treatment that Sergel gives in broadly follows the instructions that
The Data Inspectorate provided in the previous decision. In the treatment of Sergel
now submitted, however, the debtor is also asked to substantiate his objection by
to send proof that payment has been made.
It is the courts that will finally try to pay the obligation due to
of an objection and in connection with this test the probative value of it
documentation submitted by the parties. The debt collection company does not have the authority to
decide a dispute that has arisen nor to decide how the evidence would be
assessed in a future dispute in court. Debt collection companies should therefore avoid
make use of words and wordings that may give the impression that the debtor
need to substantiate its objection to the debt collection company. It should be clarified that in
and in itself there is no obstacle for a debt collection company to ask the debtor
if he or she can submit certain documentation. Such an issue should, however
formulated so that it is clear that it is voluntary for the debtor to
send in the documentation.
In response to so-called simple objections, urge debtors to
to the debt collection company to substantiate its objection and submit evidence in dispute
therefore against good debt collection.
The Data Inspectorate assumes that Sergel reviews and clarifies the writings
used to address objections to avoid any
misunderstandings from debtors and to ensure that the design of the letters is
compatible with good debt collection.

Debtor contact - availability
Applicable provisions, etc.
Good debt collection means that the debt collection company should respond without delay
the debtor's questions about the claim and the legal basis for it.
The debt collection company should also be available to the debtor at least during one
fixed phone time all weekends Monday-Friday. (Data Inspectorate
general advice p.31-32)
It is not a good debt collection procedure to take a debt collection action on the basis of objections
from the debtor or in another way it appears that the claim has no legal basis.
According to good debt collection practice, the debt collection company should therefore investigate one as soon as possible
objection from the debtor is justified. (Data Inspectorate's general advice
p. 19).
Background
Since mid-December 2019, the Data Inspectorate has received many
written complaints in which the complainant alleges that he or she has difficulty
get in touch with Sergel, both by phone and through Sergels
web service "My pages". The complainants claim, among other things, that it has
been impossible to fit in the telephone queue, or that they had to wait for several hours
to arrive. Several have also stated that they have had difficulty entering
on My pages when they are met by error messages about temporary interruption or
maintenance. Several of the complainants have also claimed that they sent several
messages via My Pages that are only answered after a long time, or not
at all. One complainant has further stated that she sent an email to Sergel which
was answered with that automatic default response.
In addition to the written complaints, the Data Inspectorate has received several
phone calls regarding difficulties in getting in touch with Sergel.
The Data Inspectorate has also, in June 2020, been made aware that
the telephone number for Sergel's customer service has been removed from the company's website.
Instead, visitors to the site were directed to find telephone numbers on theirs
debt collection claims.
In its opinions, Sergel has mainly stated the following.
Sergel has had some issues with accessibility both via
debtor web and customer service by phone. However, Sergel has taken one

8 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

several measures to address accessibility and
call times and availability have improved significantly since the beginning
of the month of March. It has been during December through February
unusually long response times on the telephone. This is partly due to the fact that
the debtor web has had accessibility problems, partly for longer
processing times and talk times during the transition to a new one
debt collection system. In addition, one of Sergel's larger customers has sent out one
several unplanned reminder mailings, which meant a lot
loading of Sergel's telephone resources. One of Sergel's customers also has
transferred larger volumes than Sergel had the opportunity to plan for in May,
June and July.
The telephony solution that Sergel uses has a limitation to
prevent the system from becoming overloaded and crashing. At long queue times
the lines become "busy" instead. When it happens and Sergel does not have
opportunity to receive more calls, the caller is met by one
message that reads: "We are unable to receive your call at this time,
please call again at a later time. For more information about yours
matters, you can log in to My Pages via www.sergel.se. ”
On December 1, 2019, Sergel launched a new debtor website - “Mina
Pages ”- at the same time as Sergel implemented a new debt collection system.
During December, the debtor's website was shut down for 10 days a week and
on a number of additional occasions due to maintenance and troubleshooting.
There have also been operational disruptions due to updates.
This in turn has contributed to very strong pressure on incoming
phone calls.
Sergel's new debtor website currently operates stably and is
available. Sergel and its suppliers have prioritized troubleshooting for
to stabilize the debt collection system and the debtor web. Sergel has too
carried out an update of the telephony platform on 27 February, which
meant an improvement in the capacity for incoming traffic.
Sergel's telephony solution has not been overloaded since then. The number
incoming calls and response times have decreased and returned to normal
inflow and call times. Sergel has expanded since mid-February
staffing with 23 administrators and a further 12 administrators shall
start in the month of May. Sergel has during the period of lack

9 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

availability has been very restrictive in forwarding cases to
The Swedish Enforcement Agency.
Sergel plans to introduce a chat feature under My Pages as one
alternative channel. The chat requires authentication via BankID. Sergel sees
the chat as a complement to telephony when the debtor needs
fast, easy feedback. Some of the information from the chat is recorded
in the debt collection system. Sergel will also wind up its
ledger management which may prevent certain disturbances and
variations of volumes from these calls.
Sergel has chosen to minimize its communication with debtors via email as such communication involves data protection risks. Sergel has three
public e-mail addresses which, since October 7, 2019, no longer
used for communication with debtors but who still can
found on the internet and in old letters. Sergel intends to steer in the long run
remove traffic from these email addresses. Until that can happen has
Sergel as a routine to answer incoming emails from debtors the same
day, with the following standard answers:
”NOTE! Important information for you!
The communication channel via this email address has ended. Your errand
will therefore not be answered here. That means you from now on
asks us questions, and sees our answer at Sergel.se/loggain. This because
further increase the security of the handling of data and personal data then
we follow the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and that is the change we are making
because we protect your privacy. An additional step in increasing your
security is that we delete the original message in this
conversation.
Welcome to Sergel.se ”
Receipts received are documented in the debt collection system and answered
via "My Pages" or by mail.
Sergel can state that the routine description has not been followed for two of
the general e-mail addresses. Incoming emails to these addresses
has in most cases only been answered with a standard answer with
reference to other channels, which then unfortunately had shortcomings

1 0 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

availability during December through February. Sergel sees
seriously on what has happened.
Sergel intends to clarify its routine description and ensure
the handling of disputes until they can close the current ones
the e-mail boxes. Sergel will also review the contents of
the default answer and specify all the channels the debtor can use for
to get in touch with Sergel.
In connection with Sergel's website and all its content being moved to
a new IT platform on June 10, 2020, the phone number did not follow
the new text that was introduced regarding "Contact with Customer Service" on
the debtor website. It has not been preceded by any special
discussions or considerations. Sergel has corrected this on July 8
2020.
Sergel's management has the highest priority to ensure a stable, simple
and secure delivery of debt collection services with high availability.
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
A prerequisite for a debt collection company to be able to fulfill its obligations
to promptly answer debtors' questions and deal with objections in a timely manner
that it is easy for debtors to get in touch with the company. With
taking into account the normal time limit for objection or payment in one
collection requirements are short, it is very important that the debtor is given the opportunity to
get in touch with the company within a reasonable time, partly to be able to take a position
to if the requirement is correct, partly to be able to object in due time.
Sergel offers contact opportunities via its debtor website and by telephone. Of
Sergel's statement states that the company has had problems with technical access
to its debtor web and long response times on the phone during one and the same
period.
The answer also shows that Sergel has removed the possibility for debtors
to communicate with the company via e-mail, at the same time as e-mail addresses such as
previously used for this purpose are still active.
The Data Inspectorate, which in this decision does not take a position on issues concerning
personal data processing, has an understanding that debt collection companies want to use

1 1 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

secure and appropriate communication channels. To refer to only
Login to the debtor's web, which requires BankID for private individuals, is at risk
however, to exclude many debtors who do not hold BankID from
the opportunity to contact the company. Such a communication channel must
therefore complemented by other appropriate channels.
The Data Inspectorate wants to emphasize that a debt collection company should handle these issues
and objections received by the company regardless of which contact routes
the debtor uses. This means, for example, that a question or a
objections received by the wrong department at the company should be forwarded
to the department that can answer the debtor's questions. Although a debtor
uses a contact route that is not assigned, the company should therefore handle the issue
or the objection. This does not mean that the question needs to be answered in the same
channel to which the question was asked, but the company can choose the mode of communication
which is most appropriate in the individual case.
Sergel states that they routinely respond to objections from debtors
even when they arrive via email but that this routine has broken. Sergel has
further stated that they will refer to more contact routes in
the default answer.
Sergel has also for a period removed telephone numbers for customer service
from their website. Instead, visitors to the site were directed to find
telephone number on their debt collection claim. The Data Inspectorate considers that a
debt collection companies should make it easier for debtors to get in touch with the company.
By only referring to the debt collection requirement to find telephone numbers
the availability of debtors deteriorates. In this context, it should be taken into account
that a debt collection case can last for several years and that it may have been a long time
since the debtor received a debt collection claim. It is therefore not certain that
the debtor even has access to this information. As previously stated is not
nor debtor web a contact route that suits all debtors. The debtor
can also not contact Sergel via e-mail, e.g. to ask about
the phone number.
The Data Inspectorate can state that Sergel has, or has had, a number
shortcomings regarding the availability of
- restricted access to the debtor's website,
long response times or the opportunity to access customer service via
phone,

1 2 (14)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-11314

-

failure in some cases to deal with issues and objections such as
received by e-mail, and
difficulties for debtors to find different contact routes to the company.

The Data Inspectorate states in a weighted assessment that they
the shortcomings listed are so extensive that Sergel cannot be considered to have survived
to the requirements for availability and the obligation to respond without delay
debtors' issues and to promptly investigate objections arising from good
debt collection. Sergel has taken action on some of the shortcomings. Certain
of the problems, however, still remain and the Data Inspectorate still receives
complaints against Sergel regarding accessibility for debtors.
The Data Inspectorate, which takes seriously the shortcomings regarding accessibility,
presupposes that Sergel takes measures to further improve
the availability of debtors. The Data Inspectorate therefore does not consider it
necessary to take some action against Sergel at present. The Data Inspectorate
will, however, follow the development of incoming complaints regarding
the availability of Sergel. The question of accessibility for debtors comes
also followed up within the framework of future supervision of the company.
Other
What has otherwise occurred in the case does not give rise to any further action
