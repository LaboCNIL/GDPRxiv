Point 1 - the legal basis for the treatment
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Tax Agency's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, sets out the legal basis for
the treatment in a vague way.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. § 3 1 of the Criminal Data Ordinance shall be a list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, contain information about it
legal basis for the treatment.
The Swedish Tax Agency's list of treatments states the legal basis for
the treatment, for each category of treatment, either with four SFS numbers or with reference to a provision in the Act (1997: 1024) on
the Swedish Tax Agency's law enforcement activities and certain provisions in
"SBDL". The Swedish Tax Agency has stated that the column "legal basis for processing"
will be reworked and specified.
In the preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act, it is stated that the legal basis refers to
the constitutional support for the treatment, ie. the regulation of that task
which causes the processing of personal data (see SOU 2017: 29 p. 322).
Due to what appears from the preparatory work, the Data Inspectorate considers that
it is not sufficient to state only the SFS number as the legal basis
for the treatment. It further appears that the references to
provisions of the “SBDL” in the column “legal basis for processing” do not apply
provisions of the Swedish Tax Agency's Criminal Data Act. The inspection finds against
this background to the Swedish Tax Agency's list of treatments, for each
category of treatment, indicates the legal basis for the treatment of a
unclear way. Due to this, the inspectorate has found reasons to use
the corrective powers in ch. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act, the Swedish Tax Agency
that in the list of treatments, for each category of treatment,
specify the legal basis for the processing.

Point 5 - the categories of data subjects affected by the processing
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Tax Agency's list of
treatments, for a category of treatment, they specify categories of
registered who are vaguely affected by the processing.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. 3 § 5 of the Criminal Data Ordinance shall be a list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, include information on the
categories of data subjects affected by the processing.
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that categories of data subjects can
be a group of people who have a specific role, e.g. suspects,
plaintiffs, witnesses or relatives of any of these (see SOU 2017: 29 p. 322).
Due to what appears from the preparatory work, the Data Inspectorate considers that
it is not sufficient to list "All" as categories of registrants.
The Inspectorate therefore finds that the Swedish Tax Agency's list of
treatments, for a category of treatment, they specify categories of
registered who are vaguely affected by the processing. The inspection has
due to this found reason to use the corrective
the powers in ch. 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act, the Swedish Tax Agency
that in the list of treatments, for each category of treatment,
specify the categories of data subjects affected by the processing.

This decision was made by unit manager Charlotte Waller Dahlberg after
presentation by lawyer Max Blidberg.
