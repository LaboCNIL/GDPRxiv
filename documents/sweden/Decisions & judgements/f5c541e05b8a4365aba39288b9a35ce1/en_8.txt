Item 3 - categories of officials
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Customs' list of treatments,
for certain categories of treatment, specify the categories of officials that
have access to the personal data that is processed in a vague way.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. § 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance, a list of treatments, for each category of treatment, shall contain information on the categories
by officials who have access to the personal data processed.
Information on which categories of officials have access to them
personal data that is processed facilitates both internal and external
control (cf. SOU 2017: 29 p. 323). In the Swedish Customs' list of
treatments are stated, for certain categories of treatments, “Authorized
based on tasks ”. The Data Inspectorate has no views on
the writing, in the event that categories of officials, for example, can be linked
an underlying document or that it can otherwise be linked
the writing to the categories of officials who have access to them
personal data processed. Information on categories of salaried employees
designed in varying ways for the categories of treatments that contain
the writing "Authorization-based on tasks". It does not appear as
clear to the Data Inspectorate that the writing can be linked to the categories of
officials who have access to the personal data processed.
The Inspectorate therefore finds that the Swedish Customs' list of
treatments, for certain categories of treatments, they specify categories of
officials who have access to the personal data processed on one
unclear way. Due to this, the inspectorate has found reasons to use
the corrective powers in ch. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act Customs that in
clarify the list of treatments, for each category of treatment
the categories of officials who have access to the personal data
treated.

Items 6, 7 and 9
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Customs' list of treatments,
for certain categories of treatments, lacks information on the categories of
personal data that may be processed and collections of transfers
of personal data to third countries or international organizations.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
The columns to indicate the categories of personal data that may be
processed (paragraph 6) and collections of transfers of personal data to
third countries or international organizations (paragraph 7) lack information
for certain categories of treatments. To state "?" or leave a column blank
does not meet the requirements in ch. Section 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. The Data Inspectorate
notes against this background that the Swedish Customs' list of
treatments, for certain categories of treatments, lack data under
Chapter 3 3 § 6 and 7 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. The inspection has due to
this has found reason to use the corrective powers in ch. § 7
the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act Customs that in
the list of treatments, for each category of treatment, they indicate
categories of personal data that may be processed and information about
collections of transfers of personal data to third countries or
international organizations.
The column for deadlines for how long the categories of personal data last
treated is indicated, for certain categories of treatments, as "?". According to
Chapter 3 3 § 9 of the Criminal Data Ordinance, it shall, if possible, be stated
deadlines. The Swedish Customs has stated that "?" means that follow-up of the answer that
the business left must take place.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Customs' list of treatments,
for certain categories of treatments, lacks data on deadlines
according to ch. 3 3 § 9 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. The Data Inspectorate receives
according to ch. 5 7 § 1 of the Criminal Data Act through advice, recommendations or
remarks (as stated in Chapter 5, Section 6, first paragraph of the same Act) try to persuade
The Swedish Customs to take action. The Data Inspectorate believes that at present it is
sufficient to recommend the Swedish Customs to make an assessment of whether it is

of treatments such as "?" specified for.
