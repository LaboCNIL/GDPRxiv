According to the Criminal Data Ordinance, the list of processing must itself contain the information specified above. The Swedish Data Protection Authority therefore notes that
The prison service's list of treatments is missing the name of and
contact details for the personal data controller and data protection officer.
Because of this, the inspection has found reasons to use them
correcting the powers in ch. 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority orders according to ch. 5. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act, the Correctional Service to indicate the name and contact details of the person in charge of personal data and data protection officer in the list of treatments.
Items 3 and 4 – categories of officials and categories of beneficiaries
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Prison Service's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, indicate the categories of
officials who have access to the personal data being processed and those
categories of recipients to whom the data may be disclosed in one
unclear way.
The reasons for Datainspektionen's assessment are as follows
A list of treatments must, for each category of treatment,
contain information about the categories of officials who have access to them
personal data that is processed and the categories of recipients that
the data may be disclosed to, also in third countries or international organisations. This is clear from ch. 3. 3 Section 3 and 4 of the Criminal Data Ordinance.
From the preparatory work for the crime data act, it appears that when it comes to categories of
recipient, it may be sufficient to indicate the type of authority to which the personal data may be provided, for example prosecutor or court
(see SOU 2017:29 p. 322).
The Correctional Service has a field in its Register descriptions called "To which
recipient the information is provided". Below the field is specified in the Register descriptions
the text "The roles/functions that have access to the data and those that
the information may be disclosed to". According to the Prison Service, information in
this field contain both internal and external recipients.

From the Register descriptions reviewed by the Data Inspectorate, it appears regarding the descriptions for LIFT, Pilot Utsikt, Inmates' IT, Game consoles,
Occupancy 6:3, Klintkoll and Hund only categories of civil servants. The Swedish Data Protection Authority considers that the given Register descriptions lack information
about categories of recipients to whom the data may be disclosed.
With regard to the Register description for KVR, it is stated that information is provided
according to § 37 and § 46-48 of the regulation to specified authorities. This means that
the recipients to whom the data may be disclosed are indicated. However, the Data Inspection Authority believes that there is no information on the categories of civil servants
who have access to the personal data being processed.
The Data Inspection Authority considers, based on the Register descriptions that have been reviewed, that
in the way that the Correctional Service has chosen to design the field "To which recipient
the information is provided", means that the categories of officials who have access
to the data (point 3) are mixed with the categories of recipients
to whom the data may be disclosed (point 4). The Swedish Data Protection Authority
therefore notes that the Prison Service's list of treatments, for
each category of treatment, indicates the categories of officials who have
access to the personal data processed and the categories of recipients
to whom the data may be disclosed in an unclear manner. Because of this, the inspection has found reasons to use the corrective measures
the powers in ch. 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority orders according to ch. 5. Section 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act, the Correctional Service that in the list of treatments, for each category of treatment,
clarify the categories of officials who have access to the personal data
which is processed and the categories of recipients to whom the data may come
to be released to. Examples of how recipients can be specified can be seen in the preparatory work
as reproduced above.
There are also two fields in the Register descriptions called "the data."
left abroad' and 'left abroad'. The Swedish Data Protection Authority has not
some views regarding how categories of recipients in third countries or
international organizations are indicated.

Point 8 – use of profiling
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Prison Service's list of treatments, for each category of treatment, lacks information on the use of
profiling.
The reasons for Datainspektionen's assessment are as follows
A list of treatments must, for each category of treatment,
according to ch. 3 3 § 8 of the criminal data regulation, contain information about the use of profiling. The Correctional Service has stated that it does not occur
any use of profiling in the authority's records.
According to the Criminal Data Ordinance, the list of treatments must contain
data on the use of profiling even when it does not occur. The Data Inspectorate therefore notes that the Prison Service's list of treatments, for each category of treatment, lacks information on use
of profiling. Due to this, the Swedish Data Protection Authority has found reasons to
use the corrective powers in ch. 5. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Swedish Data Protection Authority orders according to ch. 5. Section 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act, the Correctional Service that in the list of treatments, for each category of treatment,
specify whether profiling is used.
