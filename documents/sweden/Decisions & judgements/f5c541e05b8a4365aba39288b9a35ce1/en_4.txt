10. if possible, a general description of the security measures
has been taken.
According to ch. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act, the Data Inspectorate may use the corrective powers if it is established that personal data is processed in violation
by law or other statute or that the person responsible for personal data or
the personal data assistant in no other way fulfills his obligations.

according to the provision, certain listed information is stated (paragraphs 1-10).
The Coast Guard's list of treatments includes for each category
of treatment points 1-10. The Data Inspectorate has no comments
regarding points 1-3 and 5-10.
Contact information
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Coast Guard's list of treatments lacks contact information for the person responsible for personal data and data protection representatives.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
A list of treatments must, according to ch. Section 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance
contain the name and contact details of the personal data controller,
joint personal data controllers and data protection officers.
The Coast Guard's list of treatments contains only the name
on the personal data controller. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that
The Coast Guard's list of treatments lacks contact information
the data controller and data protection officer. The inspection is included
for this reason found reason to use the corrective powers
i 5 kap. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. Section 7 2 of the Criminal Data Act The Coast Guard to enter contact information in the list of treatments

Item 4 - categories of recipients
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate notes that the Coast Guard's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, they specify categories of
recipients to whom the information may be disclosed in a vague manner.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. § 4 of the Criminal Data Ordinance, a list of treatments, for each category of treatment, shall contain information on the categories
of recipients to whom the information may be disclosed, including in third countries
or international organizations.
The Data Inspectorate has observed that for all categories of treatments,
except one, states: Internally, externally and to some extent also to third countries after
examination. The list does not specify the type of external receiver
referred to.
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that in the case of categories of
recipients, it may be sufficient to indicate the type of authority to which the personal data may be provided, for example prosecutors or courts
(see SOU 2017: 29 p. 322). Due to what the Data Inspectorate considers
it appears from the preparatory work that it is not sufficient to state only "externally".
The Inspectorate therefore finds that the Coast Guard's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, they specify categories of
recipients to whom the information may be disclosed in a vague manner.
Due to this, the inspectorate has found reasons to use them
the corrective powers in ch. 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act Coast Guard that in the list of treatments, for each category of
processing, clarify the categories of recipients that the data can
be released to. Examples of how recipients can be specified can be found in
