Point 2 - the purposes of the treatment
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate notes that the Public Prosecutor's Office's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, indicate the purposes of
the treatment in an unspecified manner.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. 3 § 2 of the Criminal Data Ordinance, a list of treatments, for each category of treatment, shall contain information on the purposes

I 3 kap. Section 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance makes a division between the judicial
the basis of the treatment (paragraph 1) and the purposes of the treatment
(point 2). In the preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act, it is stated that the purposes of
the processing shall be listed in the register that the authority shall keep but that
this does not mean that the data controller must list all of them
individual cases where the authority processes personal data. What is meant is they
types of purposes for which the authority processes personal data. As
examples mention that the Police Authority processes personal data, e.g. in order to
receive reports of crime, conduct investigations, enforce
collection of fines and documenting interventions in the event of disturbances
(cf. Prop. 2017/18: 232 p. 121).
In the manner specified by the Public Prosecutor's Office "the purposes of the proceedings" in
its list of treatments, for each category of treatment except one,
means that the same information is provided for the "purposes of the processing" as
for "the legal basis of the proceedings". The Data Inspectorate considers, with
reason of how ch. Section 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance is designed, that it is not
sufficient to indicate the same information under 'the legal basis for
the treatment "as for the" purposes of the treatment "to meet the requirement
and Chapter 3 3 § 2 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. In its review of
The Public Prosecutor's Office's list of treatments can be the Data Inspectorate
nor see that the "purposes of the treatment" have been specified for the category of
treatment called "Cåsa - Statistical System". Not to state “the purposes of
treatment ”for a category of treatment also does not meet the requirement of
Chapter 3 3 § 2 of the Criminal Data Ordinance.
Against this background, the Data Inspectorate states that the Public Prosecutor's Office's
list of treatments, for each category of treatment, indicates
the purposes of the treatment in an unspecified manner. The inspection is included
for this reason found reason to use the corrective powers in
Chapter 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act
The prosecutor's office that in the list of treatments, for each category
of treatment, specify the purposes of the treatment. Management for how
The purposes of a treatment can be listed in the above
the preparatory statements.
