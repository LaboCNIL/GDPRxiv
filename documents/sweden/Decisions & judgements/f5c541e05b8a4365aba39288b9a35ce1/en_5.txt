The Data Inspectorate

The Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments
The Economic Crime Authority for a list according to ch. § 3
the Criminal Data Regulation on the categories of personal data processing
which the authority is responsible for according to the Criminal Data Act. For each category of
processing, according to the provision, certain listed information must be stated
(paragraphs 1-10). The Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments
contains for each category of treatment items 1-6 and 8-10.
The Data Inspectorate has no comments regarding items 1-4 as well
7-10. Collections of transfers of personal data to third countries or
international organizations (paragraph 7) is not indicated as a separate column
in the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments. According to the preparatory work
to the Criminal Data Act takes Chapter 3. 3 § 7 of the Criminal Data Ordinance aimed at certain
transfers made to third countries or international organizations
(see SOU 2017: 29 p. 323 and p. 621-624). The Data Inspectorate assumes that such
transfers, if they occur, will be listed in the Economic Crimes Authority
list of treatments.
Point 5 - the categories of data subjects affected by the processing
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, they specify categories of
registered who are vaguely affected by the processing.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. 3 § 5 of the Criminal Data Ordinance shall be a list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, include information on the
categories of data subjects affected by the processing.
The categories of treatments are listed in the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments
of data subjects affected by the processing, for each category of processing,
either as "External party", "Employees of EBM" and "Contractors of
EBM ”. The Economic Crimes Authority has stated that "External party" are parties outside
authority.
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that categories of data subjects can
be a group of people who have a specific role, e.g. suspects,
plaintiffs, witnesses or relatives of any of these (see SOU 2017: 29 p. 322).

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-1784

Due to what appears from the preparatory work, the Data Inspectorate considers that
it is not sufficient to indicate only "External party". The inspection finds
because the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments, for each
category of processing, indicates the categories of data subjects affected by
the treatment in a vague way. Due to this, the Inspectorate has
found reason to use the corrective powers in ch. § 7
the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act
The Economic Crime Authority that in the list of treatments, for each
category of treatment, clarify the categories of data subjects affected by
the treatment. Guidance for how categories of registrants can be listed is given in
the above-mentioned preparatory statements.
Point 6 - the categories of personal data that may be processed
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, they specify categories of
personal data that may be processed in an unclear manner.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
According to ch. 3 § 6 of the Criminal Data Ordinance shall be a list of
treatments, for each category of treatment, include information on the
categories of personal data that may be processed.
The Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's list of treatments does not state sensitive
personal data as a category of personal data that may be
treated. The Swedish Environmental Crime Agency has stated that if sensitive
personal data occurs, it is a question of data provided in a
report, interrogation or similar context.
The preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act states that in the case of categories of
personal data, it is mainly the presence of sensitive personal data that
referred to (see SOU 2017: 29 p. 322). No one is given in the preparatory work for the Criminal Data Act
guidance on how the wording may be treated in ch. 3 § 6
the Criminal Data Ordinance must be understood and the Data Inspectorate understands
The Economic Crimes Authority's reasoning that an overly broad interpretation means that
"Sensitive personal data" as a category of personal data may need to be specified

6 (8)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2019-1784

for each category of treatment. At the same time, ch. 3 § 6
the Criminal Data Ordinance in the opinion of the Data Inspectorate is not interpreted
such way that sensitive personal data provided in a report, interrogation or
similar contexts are not covered by ch. 3 § 6 of the Criminal Data Ordinance.
Due to what appears from the preparatory work, the Data Inspectorate considers that
sensitive personal data need to be provided for each category of processing, for
in the event that the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency deems that such information may be
treated. The Data Inspectorate finds that the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency's
list of treatments, for each category of treatment, they indicate
categories of personal data that may be processed in a vague manner
way. Due to this, the inspectorate has found reasons to use them
the corrective powers in ch. 5 Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act
The Economic Crime Authority to indicate in the list of treatments, sensitive
personal data as a category of personal data, for the categories of
treatments that the Swedish Environmental Crime Agency deems to be sensitive
personal data may be processed.

This decision was made by unit manager Charlotte Waller Dahlberg after
presentation by lawyer Max Blidberg.
