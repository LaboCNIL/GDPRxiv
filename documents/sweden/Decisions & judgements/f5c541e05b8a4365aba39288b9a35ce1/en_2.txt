The police authority's list of treatments
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate notes that the Police Authority's list of treatments, for certain categories of treatments, lacks information on the categories of officials who have access to the personal data that is processed
and the categories of recipients to whom the information may be disclosed.
The reasons for the Data Inspectorate's assessment are as follows
The police authority for a list according to ch. Section 3 of the Criminal Data Ordinance
over the categories of processing of personal data by the authority
responsible for according to the Criminal Data Act. For each category of treatment it should
according to the provision, certain listed information is stated (paragraphs 1-10).
The police authority's list of treatments contains in separate
columns the points listed in the provision. The Data Inspectorate has
no comments on points 1-2, 5-8 and 10.
The columns to indicate the categories of officials who have access to them
personal data processed (paragraph 3) and the categories of recipients
to which the information may be disclosed (paragraph 4) lacks information
for certain categories of treatments. The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that
The police authority's list of treatments, for certain categories of
treatments, lacks information according to ch. 3 § 3 and 4 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. Due to this, the Data Inspectorate has found reasons to
use the corrective powers in ch. Section 7 of the Criminal Data Act.
The Data Inspectorate submits in accordance with ch. 7 § 2 of the Criminal Data Act The Police Authority that in the list of treatments, for each category of treatment,
indicate the categories of officials who have access to the personal data
processed and the categories of recipients that the data may be
handed out to.
The column for deadlines for how long the categories of personal data last
treated is, for each category of treatment, empty. According to ch. 3 § 9 criminal

the Data Regulation, deadlines should be specified where possible. The police authority has stated that major work will be initiated to update everyone
older entries to the previous list and replace them with new ones.
The Data Inspectorate finds that the Police Authority's list of
treatments lack information on deadlines according to ch. 3 § 9 of the Criminal Data Ordinance. According to ch. 5, the Data Inspectorate may 7 § 1 of the Criminal Data Act through
advice, recommendations or remarks (as stated in Chapter 5, Section 6, first)
paragraph of the same law) try to persuade the Police Authority to take action. The Data Inspectorate considers that it is currently sufficient to recommend the Police Authority to make an assessment of whether it is possible to set deadlines in
the list of treatments.
