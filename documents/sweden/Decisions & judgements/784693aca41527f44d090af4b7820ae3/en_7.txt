The Data Inspectorate closes the case without further action.

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has received complaints regarding unauthorized use
camera surveillance on property. On the occasion of the complaint has
The Data Inspectorate has initiated supervision of the property owner.
During the examination of the camera surveillance, it has emerged mainly
following.
The property in question is used exclusively as a private home.
Camera surveillance takes place through a permanently mounted camera on the inside of one
balcony windows. The camera is of the make and model Denver hsc5003, a camera
which is activated during movement. The camera's motion detector (PIR) has the capacity to
activate the camera up to 20 meters from the camera position and
over 100 degree angle. The camera can record both audio and video at
activation.
The property owner has stated that the camera is pointing obliquely downwards so that only
the own, private plot is filmed. He has come in with a still image from
the camera which - in the form in which it was submitted - complies with this
statement. Furthermore, he has stated that when testing audio recording only
noise is heard. The reason he is being monitored by cameras is said to be that he
previously had problems with vandalism and domestic violence. Then the camera

installed, the problems have stopped. The camera is said to be on only
when no one is home. The camera has only been activated on a few occasions
since it was installed. On all occasions, it was due to severe storms.
The whole plot is fenced with a fence or hedge. Two signs about
camera surveillance is set up on the plot.
The notifier has stated that the current camera is filming on his private
plot, against kitchen window, front door and garden. Of pictures that the notifier has
come in with it appears that the camera is located at the bottom of a window
and is directed towards the neighboring plot. The notifier has later during the supervisory case
once stated that the camera is still facing his plot, but angled
more downwards.

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
The Data Protection Ordinance 2016/6791 and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200)
regulates how and to what extent camera surveillance is permitted. About one
surveillance camera captures an identifiable person or someone else
personal data in the picture, the rules in the Data Protection Ordinance apply. This is clear
of Article 2 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Of Article 2 (2) (c) of the Data Protection Ordinance and Section 5 of the Camera Surveillance Act
it appears, however, that the rules do not apply to such
personal data processing or camera surveillance performed by a physical
person as part of a purely private nature or related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of Case C 212/13 of the European Court of Justice, where the private exemption in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person as through camera
guarding place that is outside its private sphere is not covered by
the private exemption.

on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on that
free flow of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General
Data Protection Regulation).

When a private person camera surveillance a place outside their private sphere must
therefore all legal requirements in the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act is complied with. This means, among other things, that it
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring that
outweighs the interest in the integrity of the site. About the purpose of surveillance
can be achieved in a less intrusive way, this alternative must be chosen
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what purpose the guard has, and where the guard can
turn for further information and demand of their
data protection rights.2
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
With the support of the investigation in the case, the Data Inspectorate finds it proven that it
camera surveillance the property owner conducts, at the time of the decision, takes place
within his private plot. The provisions of the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act therefore does not apply.
At the same time, the Data Inspectorate finds that with the camera equipment
which the property owner uses is possible to also monitor the place outside
the plot boundary. In case the property owner's camera use would
result in personal data being processed - by either image or sound -
outside its plot boundary, the rules of the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act is followed. To camera monitor someone else's private plot
is a serious invasion of privacy. According to the Data Protection Regulation, it is not
allowed as a private person to camera monitor their neighbors against their will.
