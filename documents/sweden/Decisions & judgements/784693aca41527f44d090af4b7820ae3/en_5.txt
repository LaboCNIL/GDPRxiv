DI-2018-XXXX

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
The Data Protection Ordinance 2016/6791 and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200)
regulates how and to what extent camera surveillance is permitted. About one
surveillance camera captures an identifiable person or someone else
personal data in the picture, the rules in the Data Protection Ordinance apply. This is clear
of Article 2 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Of Article 2 (2) (c) of the Data Protection Ordinance and Section 5 of the Camera Surveillance Act
it appears, however, that the rules do not apply to such
personal data processing or camera surveillance performed by a physical
person as part of a purely private nature or related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of Case C 212/13 of the European Court of Justice, where the private exemption in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person who through fixed
Camera monitors location that is outside its private sphere not covered by
the private exemption.
When a private person camera surveillance a place outside their private sphere must
therefore all legal requirements in the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act is complied with. This means, among other things, that it
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring that
outweighs the interest in the integrity of the site. About the purpose of surveillance
can be achieved in a less intrusive way, this alternative must be chosen
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what purpose the guard has, and where the guard can turn
for further information and the enforcement of their data protection rights.2
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that photographs have shown that it
camera that was mounted on the facade of the property has now been dismantled.
