DI-2018-XXXX

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
The Data Protection Regulation 2016/6791 and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200)
regulates how and to what extent camera surveillance is permitted. About one
surveillance camera captures an identifiable person or someone else
personal data in the image apply to the rules in the data protection regulation. This is evident
of article 2.1 of the data protection regulation.
From article 2.2 c of the data protection regulation and section 5 of the camera surveillance act
it appears that the rules, however, do not apply to such
personal data processing or camera surveillance carried out by a physical
person as part of an activity of a purely private nature or that is related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of the ECJ case C 212/13, where the private exception in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person who through fixed
camera monitors location that is outside its private sphere is not covered
the private exemption.
When a private person is monitoring a place outside their private sphere, they must
therefore all legal requirements in the data protection regulation and
the camera surveillance law is fulfilled. This means, among other things, that the
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring which
outweighs the privacy interest at the site. About the purpose of the surveillance
can be achieved in a less privacy-infringing way, this option should be chosen
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what the purpose of the guarding is, and where the person being guarded can turn
themselves for further information and to assert their data protection rights. 2
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The Swedish Data Protection Authority states that it has been shown through photographs that the
camera that was mounted on the facade of the property has now been mounted down.

against this background, the matter shall be closed without further action.
