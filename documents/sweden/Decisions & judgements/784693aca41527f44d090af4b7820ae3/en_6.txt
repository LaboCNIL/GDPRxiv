Supervision according to the Data Protection Ordinance
2016/679 - camera surveillance
The Data Inspectorate's decision
The Data Inspectorate closes the case without further action.

Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has received complaints regarding unauthorized use
camera surveillance on property and has therefore initiated supervision of
the property owner.
The complainant has stated that the property owner has aimed three cameras at others
residential buildings and towards public roads.
During the examination of the camera surveillance in question, it has emerged in
essentially the following.
The property in question is a private residential address. Two cameras are
mounted on a facade and directed out from the property. There is a camera
indoors on the second floor and is directed out through a window, also this
towards a public road and a residential building outside the property in question. The
later the camera was mounted according to the notifier in the fall of 2018, when
supervision has already begun.
The property owner has stated that the cameras that are subject to review are
dummies, which thus do not work for camera surveillance. Four more photographs
support for the property owner's data shows that the cables to the two cameras provided
are mounted on the facade are cut off. A receipt showing a purchase of one
camera dummy in the autumn of 2018 provides support for the task that also the latest
set up camera constitutes a dummy.

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
The Data Protection Ordinance 2016/6791 and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200)
regulates how and to what extent camera surveillance is permitted. About one
surveillance camera captures an identifiable person or someone else
personal data in the picture, the rules in the Data Protection Ordinance apply. This is clear
of Article 2 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation.
Of Article 2 (2) (c) of the Data Protection Ordinance and Section 5 of the Camera Surveillance Act
it appears, however, that the rules do not apply to such
personal data processing and camera surveillance performed by a physical
person as part of a purely private nature or related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of Case C 212/13 of the European Court of Justice, where the private exemption in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person who through fixed
Camera monitors location that is outside its private sphere not covered by
the private exemption.
When a private person camera surveillance a place outside their private sphere must
therefore all legal requirements in the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act is complied with. This means, among other things, that it
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring that
outweighs the interest in the integrity of the site. About the purpose of surveillance
can be achieved in a less intrusive way, this alternative must be chosen
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what purpose the guard has, and where the guard can turn
for further information and the enforcement of their data protection rights.2
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate states that through photographs and receipts, respectively
purchase of camera dummy has shown that the current cameras are not

The provisions of the Data Protection Ordinance and the Camera Surveillance Act apply
therefore not. Against this background, the case must be closed without further action.
