The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-XXXX

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
Data Protection Ordinance 2016/6791 (Data Protection Ordinance)
and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018: 1200) regulate how and to what extent
camera surveillance is allowed. If a security camera captures one
identifiable person or any other personal data in the picture, the rules in
the Data Protection Regulation. This is stated in Article 2 (1) (i)
the Data Protection Regulation.
Of Article 2 (2) (c) of the Data Protection Ordinance and Section 5 of the Camera Surveillance Act
it appears, however, that the rules do not apply to such
personal data processing or camera surveillance performed by a physical
person as part of a purely private nature or related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of Case C 212/13 of the European Court of Justice, where the private exemption in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person as through camera
guarding place that is outside its private sphere is not covered by
the private exemption.
When a private person camera surveillance a place outside their private sphere must
therefore all legal requirements in the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act is complied with. This means, among other things, that it
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring that
outweighs the interest in the integrity of the site. About the purpose of surveillance
can be achieved in a less intrusive way, this alternative must be chosen
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what purpose the guard has, and where the guard can
turn for further information and demand of their
data protection rights.2

The Data Inspectorate's assessment
The Data Inspectorate makes the assessment that through information in the police report
as well as the property owner's pictures on the camera shown that the present cameras
is not working, whereby automatic personal data processing by
surveillance can not take place. The provisions of the Data Protection Regulation and
the Camera Surveillance Act therefore does not apply. Against this background, the case should
terminated without further action.

This decision was made by unit manager Charlotte Waller Dahlberg after
presentation by the lawyer Nils Henckel. At the final processing has
General Counsel Hans-Olof Lindblom also participated.
