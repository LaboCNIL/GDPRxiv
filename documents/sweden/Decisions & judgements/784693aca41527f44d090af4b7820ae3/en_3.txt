Supervision according to the data protection regulation
2016/679 â€“ camera surveillance
The Swedish Data Protection Authority's decision
The Swedish Data Protection Authority closes the case without further action.

Account of the supervisory matter
The Swedish Data Protection Authority has received complaints about unauthorized camera surveillance on a
real estate. As a result of the complaint, the Swedish Data Protection Authority has initiated supervision
against the property owners.
The complainant has stated that the property owners have pointed a camera at them
applicant's garden.
In the review of the camera surveillance, it has emerged in the main
following.
The property in question is used exclusively as a private residence. On
the house wall in a conservatory, there is a camera mounted on the facade. The camera is
directed towards the adjacent neighbour's residence.
The property owners have stated that the camera is no longer functional at that time
burglars destroyed it in a burglary in 2016. The property owners have
came in with a police report that corroborates their information as well as pictures that
shows that the wiring to the camera has been torn away. The property owners use, however
still the camera as a dummy.

Justification of the decision
Provisions on which the decision is based
Data Protection Regulation 2016/6791 (Data Protection Regulation)
and the Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200) regulates how and to what extent
camera surveillance is permitted. If a surveillance camera catches one
identifiable person or any other personal data in the image apply to the rules in
data protection regulation. This is apparent from Article 2.1 i
data protection regulation.
From article 2.2 c of the data protection regulation and section 5 of the camera surveillance act
it appears that the rules, however, do not apply to such
personal data processing or camera surveillance carried out by a physical
person as part of an activity of a purely private nature or that is related
with his or her household. This is called the private exemption.
Of the ECJ case C 212/13, where the private exception in relation to
camera surveillance was tried, it appears that a private person who through camera
monitors location that is outside its private sphere is not covered
the private exemption.
When a private person is monitoring a place outside their private sphere, they must
therefore all legal requirements in the data protection regulation and
the camera surveillance law is fulfilled. This means, among other things, that the
personal data controller must have a legitimate interest in monitoring which
outweighs the privacy interest at the site. About the purpose of the surveillance
can be achieved in a less privacy-infringing way, this option should be selected
instead. In addition, the person monitoring must, among other things, clearly inform about who
who guards, what the purpose of the guarding is, and where the person being guarded can go
contact for further information and claiming theirs
data protection rights.2

The Swedish Data Protection Authority's assessment
The Data Inspectorate makes the assessment that through information in the police report
as well as the property owner's images on the camera have been shown that the present cameras
is not functional, whereby automatic personal data processing through
monitoring cannot take place. The provisions of the data protection regulation and
the camera surveillance law therefore does not apply. Against this background, the case must
terminates without further action.

This decision has been made by unit manager Charlotte Waller Dahlberg after
presentation by lawyer Nils Henckel. At the final processing has
also chief legal officer Hans-Olof Lindblom participated.
