On 13 November 2019, Svenska Europainkasso AB received an email
against an objection to a debt collection claim such as Svenska
Europainkasso AB sent out to the debtor on 11 November
2019. Svenska Europainkasso AB judged that the objection was
a contest.
In subsequent telephone conversations, a male person claims to be
representative for the debtor and Svenska Europainkasso AB requests
during the telephone call in power of attorney for the agent. At
preparation of a lawsuit against the debtor goes Swedish
Europainkasso AB through all documents and contacts
the client. Then no one has arrived yet
proxy. For that reason, it can not be ruled out that it is
a person other than the debtor who brought the action. All of them
email conversation comes from email address that can not be assumed
belong to the debtor. Contact with the client is pointed out
even though there have never been any problems with the debtor,
on the other hand, it is the close relative of the debtor who has had another
perception.
Due to the uncertainty about whether it was the debtor
who presented their position was assessed by the Swedish Europainkasso
AB that an application for an order for payment from
The Swedish Enforcement Agency was the most suitable for the debtor
the form of proceedings because the Swedish Enforcement Agency must notify
the debtor payment order which then, if uninformed,
himself can take a stand. If Svenska Europainkasso AB had chosen
to file the writ of summons, the appellant could have argued
that Svenska Europainkasso AB did not follow good debt collection procedures
to accept an action that has not come from the debtor.
After the application for an order for payment has been made, Svenska has
Europainkasso AB in an email with a power of attorney and in the same email
incorrectly stated that there is no "basis for the dispute" when
it would be that there is no "power of attorney for the contestation".

Reason for the decision
Applicable provisions, etc.
Debt collection operations must be conducted in accordance with good debt collection practice (Section 4 of the Debt Collection Act).
What is good debt collection procedure is stated in Sections 5–11 of the Debt Collection Act,
The Swedish Data Inspectorate's general advice "Application of the Debt Collection Act" and
The Data Inspectorate's practice in debt collection issues.
A summary process is not meaningful when the debtor has made a factual
objection which means that the claim must be examined substantively. If
it is clear that the debtor's objection is objectively substantiated should one
any action may instead be brought in court through a writ of summons.
According to good debt collection procedure, an application for an order for payment is therefore not received
submitted if the debtor has made it clear that the claim is disputed and stated one
factual basis for their objection (Datainspektionen's general advice p. 36 f.).
An incorrect choice of process form can further lead to an application or a decision
in cases of injunction, which in turn means that the debtor on
incorrect grounds are noted in the credit information register (Datainspektionens
general advice p. 37).
The Data Inspectorate's assessment
It is undisputed that what Svenska Europainkasso AB has received is one
such a factually based objection that deprives the debt collection company of the opportunity
to use the summary process and entails that the debt collection company
instead, bring an action in court through a lawsuit. The question is
about the circumstances that Svenska Europainkasso AB has reported on
really gives a debt collection company the right to apply anyway
order for payment.
Good debt collection does not set any special requirements for the forms of one
disputing or on identification in connection with a disputing. One
debt collection companies should normally assume that it is the debtor who has presented
an objection when it is stated to come from the debtor.
As the Swedish Data Inspectorate has understood, Svenska Europainkasso AB has
stated three circumstances in support of its assumption that the debtor himself did not
stands behind the objection made. The objection has been lodged via a

email address that appears to be linked to a person other than the debtor,
someone other than the debtor has later raised the objection by telephone
without presenting a power of attorney and the client states that he has never had one
problems with the debtor but with a person close to the debtor.
The Data Inspectorate considers that none of these circumstances, or
the circumstances as a whole, give reason to assume that the debtor himself
does not stand behind the objection made. The objection would thus have
taken into account in the choice of form of process and thereby led to an application for
lawsuit instead of an application for an injunction.
The Data Inspectorate states that Svenska Europainkasso AB through its
wrong assumption also made a wrong process choice. The action is contradictory
against good debt collection and thus also against section 4 of the Debt Collection Act.
The Data Inspectorate assumes that the company takes measures to ensure that
in the future, objections received will be taken into account when choosing the form of process.
