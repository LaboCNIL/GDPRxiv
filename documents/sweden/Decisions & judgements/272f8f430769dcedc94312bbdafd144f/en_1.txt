Report on the supervisory matter
The Data Inspectorate has drawn attention to complaints from the public
that Nusvar AB (the Company) has disclosed personal data concerning, among other things
financial information about all Sweden's residents who are 16 years and older via
The company's website www.mrkoll.se (the website). The website is covered by
such a certificate of issue as is regulated in ch. Sections 5-7 of the Freedom of Expression Act (1991: 1469).
The Data Inspectorate has initiated supervision of the Company in order to investigate to what extent
The company via the website conducts business that is to be regarded as
credit reporting activities and, if so, the extent to which the Company complied
the prohibition of the Data Protection Ordinance and the Credit Information Act
processing of data on offenses involving crime and
the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation on data minimization and
the Credit Information Act's requirements for legitimate needs and a credit information copy.
The supervisory case began with a supervisory letter on 18 December 2018. Answer
on the supervisory letter was received on 30 December 2018. The Data Inspectorate

2 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

conducted an on-site inspection at the Company on April 9, 2019. Minutes
from the inspection has been drawn up and sent to the Company for comments.
Opinion on minutes received on 5 May 2019. A supplementary letter
from the Company came in on May 29, 2019.
What has emerged in the case
The website is a commercial business that mainly
conducted on the basis of advertising revenue. The purpose of the Website is to
make public information about private individuals of general interest available,
such as, for example, social security number, housing situation, vehicle ownership,
legal information and certain other non-public information,
for example telephone number. The user logs in to the website and can take
part of the published information free of charge.
It has emerged during the investigation that the Company receives additional information
The website from more than a dozen different suppliers, including
The Swedish Companies Registration Office and the credit information company Yellow-Belly Decision Systems
AB (Yellow-Belly). The business started by the Company receiving one
called the basic lift regarding basic data from the credit information company YellowBelly in November 2018. Yellow-Belly then lifted a
population register database, which included social security numbers and addresses.
The company has since collected updated information from Yellow-Belly var
14th day regarding social security numbers, addresses, company information and
cluster information, such as aggregated area information and aggregated
financial information. The economic information that is aggregated remains
of income information and payment remarks.
All information is compiled by the Company. Some information is
cluster information, which refers to information about about 22 to 2,000 people
which are lumped together. The cluster compilations are based on where it is from
the user wanted person lives. The economic cluster information
consists of around 22-28 people. Thereafter, the Company interprets the information and
creates comprehensible texts based on this data that is available on
the website. The information is presented on the website in various "blocks".
Especially about the block Summary
In the block "summary", certain information is compiled from the others
blocks. The economic cluster information shows, for example
information on payment remarks. If there are more within the cluster
payment remarks than zero, it appears that there are

3 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

payment remarks in the area in question. No one is left then
individual information about the wanted person. If there are none
payment remarks within the cluster, ie. about none of the 22-28 people
which is part of the cluster of the wanted person has someone
payment remark, it is explicitly stated that the wanted person
has no payment remarks, "X has no payment remarks".
Furthermore, the block "Summary" shows how often the person in question is
searched on the Website. This is information that the Company itself produces
based on how many times the person has been searched for and viewed on the Website during the month. Information about the number of searches on the Website
does not mean that anyone has paid to receive information about
the person in question. The information about the number of searches is reset at each
turn of the month.
Especially about the block Prosecution, judgments and lawsuits
The company compiles the information, which comes from the courts
the district courts, the courts of appeal, the Supreme Court and the administrative courts in
depending on the nature of the case). For the case
a wanted person has been prosecuted for one or more crimes, this emerges
on the Website in the current block by that about the wanted
the person states, for example, “X has been prosecuted in a court of law in a case that
intended criminal case ”(this information is also presented in the block
"Summary").
Users of the Website can view the judgment itself directly on
The website by paying SEK 99 to the Company. When the payment
completed, a summary of the current judgments is displayed, including
the decision directly on the Website in the relevant block. The company does not
own summaries of the judgments, but these are provided by the courts.
Users who have paid to see the judgments have access to these
for 24 hours on the Website.
Especially about the Economy block
The company compiles the financial information. This is based on
cluster information provided by Yellow-Belly and the aggregations provided
Yellow-Belly has done and so is the information under the headings “They
most earn ”,“ A neighbor (or the person himself) earns ”and“ Salary indicator ”
be developed.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

The cluster information consists of around 22-28 people who are selected based on it
searched for the person's address which is then lumped together. The information in
The wage indicator is based on a comparison of the entire country's median wage with
the median salary in the current cluster.
Under the heading "Income current year" are the six lines "Number
payment remarks "," Income from employment "," Taxable income ",
"Income from capital", "Active business activities" and "Passive
business activities ’. These lines are, with one exception, not filled in that long
the individual user does not buy a credit report for SEK 49.
The exception is the line "Number of payment remarks" in the case where none
person in the wanted person's cluster has a payment remark,
i.e. in the same situation as it says "X has no payment remarks" in
the "Summary" block. In these cases, it comes in the line for “Number
payment remarks "state that the wanted person has" 0 ". If anyone in
the cluster has a payment remark left the field blank. These six lines
covered by the Company's certificate of issue. The Company is thus responsible for
these six lines. The content of, and responsibility for, the information in the six lines
changes, however, if the user chooses to purchase a credit report for 49
crowns of Yellow-Belly, see below.
Especially about the block Housing and neighbors
The company compiles information about residents and neighbors, which comes
from Lantmäteriet. Information about the estimated value of any condominium
or property is based on an algorithm that the Company has developed that is based
on broker statistics.
Especially about the Block Popularity
The company compiles the information. This is the same information that has
developed under the block "Summary" above. In this block it appears
also how sought after the person is under the heading "Top ranking" and which
other persons who have also been searched for on the Website under the heading
"Also visited". The information in this block is reset at the end of each month.
Especially about the block About the neighborhood
The company compiles the information, which is primarily a repetition of
other information on the Website and is based primarily on aggregated
information. This block also shows the average age of the neighbors
the wanted person and the average income in the neighborhood.

The company's information regarding the requirement of legitimate need and
credit report copy
The Company does not consider that the Company conducts credit information activities through
to provide the Website. The company therefore does not need to take into account
the provisions on legitimate needs and credit information copy.
Credit reporting activities are conducted only when the user via
the site buys a complete credit report on the wanted for 49
kronor. This credit reporting business is operated by Yellow-Belly. The company
is only Yellow-Belly's dealer.
The company's information about the business as a reseller of YellowBelly's credit information
The Company states that the Company is a reseller of Yellow-Bellys
credit information product on the website. A credit report costs 49
kronor. The purchased credit information is displayed directly on MrKolls
website in the block "Finance" by filling in the information below
the headings "Income in the current year" and the new headings
"Liabilities and payment remarks" and "Bankruptcy". Under the title
"Income in current year" is in this mode the line "Number of payment remarks"
not included.
Under the heading "Debts and payment remarks" there are eight lines
regarding traditional credit information. Under the title
"Bankruptcy" is a line that indicates whether the requested person is in personal bankruptcy
or not.

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

The information that is published when the user buys a credit report for
SEK 49 is not in the Company's database for the Website. It's Yellow-Belly
which fills in the fields on the Website when the user orders a credit report for SEK 49. For users who are on the site without having
ordered any credit report from Yellow-Belly, these fields are masked.
Yellow-Belly sends a credit report copy to the wanted and
is responsible for ensuring that the user has a legitimate need.
The company's view on the definition of credit reporting activities and
the scope of the certificate of issue
The company considers that the information that the wanted person person does not have
some payment remarks, (X has no payment remarks), i
the "Summary" block does not constitute credit information because
it is cluster-based information based on not having any person in it
wanted cluster has no payment remark.
The company considers that the information in the block "Finance", that it sought
the person has "Number of payment remarks 0 pcs", does not constitute
credit information because it is cluster-based information
which is based on the fact that no person in the wanted person's cluster has anyone
payment remark.
The company considers that the information on the estimated value of any property in
the block "Residents and neighbors", does not constitute credit information then
it is based on broker statistics.
The company considers that the information under the heading "Salary indicator" does not constitute
credit information. This information does not say anything about it
search for the person themselves as there is no information at the individual level.
The website is covered in its entirety by the publication certificate. It's only
The company that can change the content of the Website.
As for the block "Finance", however, the situation is special. The block
"Finance" is covered in its entirety by the publication certificate as long as the lines below
the headings "Income in the current year", "Liabilities and payment remarks" and
"Bankruptcy" are not filled out. These lines are, with one exception, masked as such
as long as the individual user does not buy a credit report for SEK 49.
The exception is the information filled in by the Company itself “Number

7 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

payment remarks 0 pcs ”under the heading“ Income current year ”. This
information is thus part of the Website and is covered by the publication certificate.
If a user buys a credit report for SEK 49 changes
the situation. The purchased credit information is then filled in by Yellow–
Belly and is displayed directly in the block "Finance" under the headings "Income
current year ”,“ Liabilities and payment remarks ”and“ Bankruptcy ”. Raden
"Number of payment remarks 0 pcs" is not included in this mode. The company
considers, therefore, that the information under the headings "Income in the current year",
"Liabilities and payment remarks" and "Bankruptcy" in the block "Finance" in
this position should be considered as an elevated and thus separate part of
The website. This raised portion is not covered by the Company's certificate of issue
but then forms an unmodified part of the Website for which Yellow-Belly is responsible
for.
As for the block "Prosecution, judgments and legal proceedings", this is part of
the website covered by the Company's certificate of issue regardless of whether
the user obtains a judgment for 99 kronor or not. The company believes that
is the difference between the block relating to "Prosecution, judgments and legal proceedings" and the block
"Finance" because the information that appears in the block "Prosecutions, convictions and
litigation ”is not disguised, but instead incomplete until
a user of the Website pays SEK 99 to take part in it.
The company ended its collaboration with Yellow-Belly, on April 8, 2019 then
the contractual relationship was terminated with immediate effect. The resale of
credit information thus ceased immediately. The company sold as a property
of Yellow-Belly's resellers about 700 credit reports in March
month. At the end of May, the Company released a new version of the website.
In the new edition, the information on payment remarks has been excluded.
Instead, only very rough information is provided that describes it
economic situation of the area as a whole (extent in the form of
postcodes outside the cities, and the district area in the cities).

Justification of the decision
The Data Inspectorate's position in this decision refers to Nusvar's operations
on the MrKoll website during the period from December 2018 to
and with April 8, 2019. The company raised during the period financially
information from Yellow-Belly and published data on that individual
people do not have payment remarks. The site has below this

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

time period on several occasions changed in layout. However, the processing of personal data has been the same in relevant parts.
Nusvar's activities on the Mrkoll website are covered by a so-called voluntarily
certificate of issue according to ch. Section 5 of the Freedom of Expression Act. This means that
the provisions of the Freedom of Expression Act on broadcasts of programs are applied
when information is provided to the public via Mrkoll.
Of the delegation provision in ch. Section 18 of the Freedom of Expression Act follows that
what is stated in the delegation provision in ch. 12 § 5
the Freedom of the Press Ordinance (1949: 105) that regulations may be issued by law
if professional credit reporting activities also apply in the case of
program.
It follows that it is possible to issue regulations in law on
credit reporting activities conducted through websites covered by
certificate of release. Such legislation has been implemented through
the Credit Information Act (1973: 1173).

Credit reporting activities
The Data Inspectorate is the supervisory authority according to the Credit Information Act
(1973: 1173) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
on April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with respect to treatment
of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on
repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (Data Protection Regulation), GDPR.
According to Section 1 of the Credit Information Act, the Credit Information Activities Act applies
which means that someone, except in isolated cases, provides credit information to
compensation or as part of a business activity. The law also applies to other
credit reporting activities, if they are of a larger scale.
Section 2, first paragraph, first sentence of the Credit Information Act states that
credit information refers to information, assessments or advice provided
guidance for assessing someone else's creditworthiness or credibility
otherwise financially.
In the preparatory work for the Credit Information Act (Bill 1973: 155 p. 139), the issue is addressed
when certain information is to be considered as credit information:

9 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

“It is also characteristic of credit information that the information is provided for
certain purpose. It must be information that is intended to serve
guidance for assessing someone's creditworthiness or other credibility in
financially. Information that typically has a completely different
purposes are not covered by the concept of credit information, even if information by
economic nature is included in the information. This includes e.g. data in personnel tests
performed to test a person's suitability for a particular employment.
The information in a credit report is of course primarily focused on
economic conditions. Often, however, information about more personal is included
circumstances. Some sharp boundary between the two types of information can
not drawn and is also not required. The nature of the information is lacking in itself
significance for the definition of the concept of credit information. The crucial thing is
if it is suitable to serve as a guide in the assessment of creditworthiness, etc. "
The assessment of whether the Company's dissemination of information constitutes credit information activities
The investigation shows that the stated purpose of the website is to
make public information about private individuals of general interest available.
The information provided free of charge on the website has not been disclosed
credit reporting purposes. However, the information is disclosed immediately
connection to a pure credit information service operated by YellowBelly. Many users of the website can therefore be assumed to visit
the website for the purpose of obtaining information to management for the assessment of
the creditworthiness or other credibility of the wanted person financially
respect. In that case, the information provided by the Company on its own
personal data liability publish on the website is sufficient to exist
basis for a credit assessment of the wanted person, without the user
need to order a credit report from Yellow-Belly for SEK 49, conducts
The company's credit information activities within the meaning of the Credit Information Act.
Information on the extent to which an individual has a payment remark or
is not an example of a task that can typically be used to do
a credit assessment of the wanted person. An indication that it was looking for
lack of payment remarks may, for example, be sufficient information
about the individual's finances in order for him or her to be allowed to order a product against
invoice in an online store or approved as a member of a tenant-owner association.
A user who visits the website for the purpose of making a credit assessment
of the wanted person and who does not need more information about the wanted person
finances than that may refrain from ordering a complete credit report from
Yellow-Belly.

DI-2018-22737

The company publishes information that the wanted person has no payment remarks by stating in the block "Summary" that "X has no
payment remarks "and in the block" Finance "enter" Number of payment remarks 0 pcs ".
The fact that this information can not be provided about all individuals
people who do not have payment remarks - but only about individuals
people who do not have payment remarks, which is part of a cluster of 2228 people who also do not have payment remarks - missing in this
case significance. Anyone who takes part in the information on the website receives one
unequivocal finding that there are no payment remarks for the person who
is sought in cases where such information exists. It thus constitutes a statement
relating to the individual's financial circumstances, suitable to serve as a guide for
the assessment of his creditworthiness. The Data Inspectorate finds that
The company thereby during the period December 2018 - April 2019 has conducted
credit information activities through the publication The company itself is responsible for
for on the website.
The Data Inspectorate states that the disclosure of credit information has not taken place in individual cases, but takes place as part of business activities.
and is of greater scope. Such activities are covered by
the regulations of the Credit Information Act.
Section 4, first paragraph, of the Credit Information Act states that credit information activities may only be conducted with the permission of the Swedish Data Inspectorate. According to § 4
fourth paragraph of that law, however, a permit for credit information activities is not required, insofar as it is conducted through the publication of credit information
in a manner referred to in the Freedom of the Press Ordinance or the Freedom of Expression Act. The website is covered by such a publishing certificate as
regulated in ch. Sections 5-7 of the Freedom of Expression Act. The Data Inspectorate
states that the Company thus has the right to conduct
credit reporting activities without a permit. The Data Inspectorate states
at the same time that the Company has to comply with other applicable provisions in
the Credit Information Act and applicable provisions in
the Data Protection Regulation.
If the wanted person is part of a cluster where one or more of the other individuals
the persons have a payment remark, the user may proceed through
to order a credit report from Yellow-Belly for SEK 49.

1 1 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

The Data Inspectorate finds no reason to question the Company's claim that
The company is only a reseller of Yellow-Belly's credit information when one
users purchase a complete credit report through the 49 website
kronor.
Without taking a position on the substance of the matter in question, because the question
is irrelevant to the question of whether the Company conducts
credit information activities or not, the Data Inspectorate does not find either
reason to question the Company's assertion that the information below
the headings "Income in the current year", "Liabilities and payment remarks" and
"Bankruptcy" in the block "Finance" should be considered a lift and thus
separate part of the Website that is not covered by the Company's publication certificate, i
the situation when the user pays SEK 49 and takes part in such a full
credit information for which Yellow-Belly is responsible.
Information about violations of the law
Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation contains restrictions on processing
of information on violations of the law. Such data may only be processed by
authorities or if the processing is permitted under Union law or
national law. The Credit Information Act contains, in so far as it relates
processing of personal data, provisions that supplement
the Data Protection Regulation. The second paragraph of section 6 of the Credit Information Act follows
that information on offenses involving crime, convictions in criminal cases,
criminal coercive measures or administrative detentions do not
may be processed in credit information activities without the consent of
The Data Inspectorate.
The blocks "Summary" and "Prosecution, judgments and legal proceedings" state whether
the wanted person has been prosecuted in court in one or more cases pertaining to
criminal case. If the user wants to take part in the judgments from the cases where it
wanted has been prosecuted, the user can proceed by paying SEK 99.
The verdict and a summary of the current verdicts are then displayed directly on
The website in the block "Prosecution, judgments and legal proceedings".
The Data Inspectorate considers that the information “X has already been prosecuted in one
court in a criminal case ”is an indication of
violation of the law in section 6, second paragraph, of the Credit Information Act. To
this will allow the user to choose to collect and partake of themselves
the decision directly on the Website in the relevant block.

1 2 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

The Data Inspectorate finds that the Company is in breach of Article 10 of the
the Data Protection Ordinance and section 6, second paragraph, of the Credit Information Act
processes information on offenses for credit information purposes without
The Data Inspectorate's consent.
The requirement for data minimization
Section 5, first paragraph, of the Credit Information Act states that credit information activities shall be conducted so that they do not lead to undue intrusion into personal
integrity through the content of the information provided or otherwise
incorrect or misleading information is stored or disclosed.
For the processing of personal data covered by the Data Protection Regulation, Article 5 of that Regulation shall apply instead.
According to Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation, personal data which:
be treated as adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to
the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization).
It follows from these rules that in credit information activities it should not
data other than those which are adequate and relevant for
the assessment of someone's creditworthiness. It should also not be treated more
information than is necessary to assess the creditworthiness of the requested person. At
the assessment of which data may be processed is the starting point for sowing
get as much data as possible to be processed. In the selection, such priorities shall be given
tasks that alone or together with a few other tasks can
provide the necessary knowledge needed to assess the wanted person
creditworthiness.
As the website includes credit reporting activities, they should provide information
which are published on the website are assessed in terms of adequacy,
relevance and scope based on a credit reporting purpose.
Several of the categories of information published on the website are adequate
and relevant for credit information purposes, such as address details and
marital status.
However, the Data Inspectorate considers that personal data on vehicle holdings,
estimated value of a condominium or property, telephone number, zodiac sign,
popularity or neighbors' names and ages are not necessary, adequate and
relevant for assessing someone's creditworthiness.

1 3 (19)

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

With regard to information on vehicle ownership, such information does not exist in practice
considered to mean such an improvement in the quality of credit reporting activities
that they should be allowed (Länsrättens i Stockholms län judgment 15 June 2001, Case no
Ö 4128-99). As for the estimated value of condominium or property so
these data lack adequacy and relevance for credit reporting purposes
since the information only refers to the Company's own estimates of value as
in addition, not combined with ownership information and
underlying collateral. Information on telephone numbers, zodiac signs and
popularity are irrelevant for a credit reporting purpose.
The Data Inspectorate therefore finds that the Company has violated Article 5 (1) (c)
the Data Protection Regulation by processing non-personal data
adequate, relevant and too extensive in relation to one
credit reporting purposes.
Requirements for legitimate needs and credit information copy
Anyone requesting personal information, i.e. a credit report of a
private person, according to section 9, first paragraph of the Credit Information Act, must have a so-called
legitimate need for it. This means that he must have entered into a credit agreement
or be about to enter into a credit agreement with the respondent or that he in
otherwise has reason to make a financial risk assessment regarding it
asked.
Each time a credit reporting company discloses a credit report about
a natural person must, in accordance with section 11 of the Credit Information Act, simultaneously and
receive a free written notice of the information, reviews and advice
which the information contains, a so-called credit report copy.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Company has not fulfilled its obligations
in accordance with the provisions of sections 9 and 11 of the Credit Information Act in
credit reporting activities.

Choice of corrective action
The Swedish Data Inspectorate has established that the Company has conducted credit information operations via the website MrKoll by processing information on
payment remarks and thereby,



in the credit information business processed personal data about
violations of the law in violation of Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation and Section 6

The Data Inspectorate

DI-2018-22737

the second paragraph of the Credit Information Act by stating, without the consent of the Data Inspectorate, that the wanted person has been prosecuted in
criminal cases, and publish judgments against payment,



processed personal data in breach of the principle of data minimization in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation by processing
several categories of information that are not adequate and relevant and
too extensive for credit reporting purposes and



acted in violation of the provisions of Sections 9 and 11 of the Credit Information Act by failing to take into account the requirements of legitimate need and
credit report copy.

Possible intervention measures
If the person who has the right to conduct credit information activities violates one
provision in the Credit Information Act, the Data Inspectorate may, in accordance with section 17
the Credit Information Act order him to make a correction or notify one
new condition. If the person conducting credit information activities does not fulfill
what is incumbent on him in accordance with section 11, the Data Inspectorate may, in accordance with section 22

Section 15 of the Credit Information Act states that when supervising such processing of
personal data covered by the Data Protection Ordinance applies to the Data Inspectorate's powers under section 17 of the Credit Information Act in addition to the
powers of the Data Inspectorate under Article 58 (1) to (3).

DI-2018-22737

Instead of penalty fees, in certain cases, in accordance with recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, a reprimand may be issued instead of penalty fees if it is
the issue of a minor infringement. Circumstances such as
the nature, severity and duration of the infringement.
Penalty fees must be imposed
The Data Inspectorate has stated above that Nusvar conducts credit information activities and has assessed that the Company in the current processing of
personal data has violated Article 5 and Article 10
the Data Protection Regulation. These articles are covered by Article 83 (5), which means
that a higher sanction amount should be imposed.
The personal data processing that this supervision covers has entailed
processing of personal data about persons registered in Sweden who are 16
years or older, just over eight million. Information about payment remark appears
in all cases where individuals based on cluster information about 22–28 nearby residents
was found not to have a payment remark. Information about a violation of the law has been processed in cases where the data subject has been the subject of prosecution in
criminal case. It is thus not a question of a minor infringement. There is
thus no reason to replace the penalty fee with a reprimand.
No other corrective action is relevant for that treatment either
as happened. The company must therefore be subject to administrative penalty fees.
Circumstances relevant to determining the penalty fee
size
General provisions
According to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, each supervisory authority shall:
ensure that the imposition of administrative penalty fees in each individual
cases are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
According to Article 83 (3), the administrative penalty fee may not exceed
the amount of the most serious infringement in the case of one or the same
data processing or interconnected data processing.
Infringements of Articles 5 and 10 are covered by Article 83 (5). The amount of the penalty
may therefore not exceed EUR 20 million or 4% of the total global
annual turnover during the previous financial year, depending on the value
is highest.

The company started operations in 2018 and only had one reported
turnover for the last month of the year. The company's sales in 2018 amounted to
The company's annual report to SEK 399,092.
Article 83. 2 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out all the factors that must
taken into account when determining the size of the penalty fee. In the assessment
of the size of the penalty fee shall, among other things. a. account is taken of a) the infringement
character, severity and duration, b) intent or negligence, g)
categories of personal data, h) how the breach came about
The Data Inspectorate's knowledge and k) other aggravating or mitigating
factor, such as direct or indirect financial gain.
The circumstances of the present case
The Data Inspectorate's assessment of the penalty fee has been taken into account
that information has been collected about all Swedish citizens over the age of 16,
more than eight million citizens, who have been open online freely
available to the public and stakeholders. Publication of information on
the website constitutes the Company's core business and the treatments have taken place in
profit motive. These circumstances are aggravating.
In addition, the fact that information on payment remarks is taken into account
may be provided in credit reporting activities, but not information on
violations of the law. The fact that this information is provided
jointly risks leading to negative effects and to an extensive infringement
in the personal integrity of individuals.
Account has also been taken of the fact that the treatment has taken place
The Data Inspectorate's knowledge through a number of complaints from the public.
At the same time, the Data Inspectorate states that credit information has
published for about five months, and has since ceased.
During the period of time the data has been published, it has the potential
the dispersal effect has been extensive. The website comes high, for example
up among the search results on other major search engines and the spread, as well
the opportunity to access the data has thus been great.
With regard to the question of whether the infringements have taken place with intent or through
negligence, there is nothing in the investigation that shows otherwise is that

processing, which among other things consisted of open publication of the information about
payment remark and information about violations of the law, made intentionally.
Determination of the amount of the sanction
As already stated, the amount of the sanction can be set at a maximum of 20 million
EUR. The amount of the sanction must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
The Data Inspectorate states that the Company is newly started and that the Company's
latest annual report only covers one (December 2018) of the five months
as the credit information service at www.mrkoll.se has been available. It is
therefore not possible to use this as a basis for determining
the size of the penalty fee.
The company has not specified its sales for 2019. One
The starting point is therefore that the company's monthly turnover in any case
corresponds to that for December 2018 recalculated for the full year 2018, SEK 4.8 million.
The Data Inspectorate decides on the basis of an overall assessment that the company should
pay an administrative penalty of EUR 35 000.
The Data Inspectorate does not consider that there is reason to take anyone
further action due to the Company not complying
the provisions of section 5, first paragraph, first sentence and sections 9 and 11;
the Credit Information Act on legitimate needs and a credit information copy
as the Company's credit information operations have now ceased.

This decision was made by the Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after
presentation by the department director Hans Kärnlöf. At the final
The case is handled by Hans-Olof Lindblom, General Counsel, and the Head of Unit
Catharina Fernquist participated.
