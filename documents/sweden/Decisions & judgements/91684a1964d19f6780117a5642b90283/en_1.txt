Decision after supervision according to
the Data Protection Ordinance against Inera AB

Date:
2021-06-07

The decision of the Integrity Protection Authority
The case is closed.

Background
On February 18, 2019, Computer Sweden published an article entitled “2.7
million recorded calls to 1177 Vårdguiden completely unprotected on the internet ”. In the article
states, among other things, that “On an open web server, completely without password protection or
other security, we have found 2.7 million recorded calls to the advisory number 1177. "
It appeared from Inera's website that Inera AB manages and develops the joint ventures
the systems for the 1177 Care Guide by telephone that the regions need in their activities.
IMY initiated written supervision against Inera AB on March 5, 2019 to check how Inera
processed personal data on care seekers within the framework of the advisory number 1177.
IMY also initiated supervision of Voice Integrate Nordic AB and MedHelp AB. It emerged
that three regions hired MedHelp as a care provider when care seekers call 1177 for
healthcare advice and partly Inera AB to connect the calls to MedHelp. IMY
therefore initiated supervision against the Health and Medical Care Board Region Stockholm,
Regional Board Region Sörmland and Regional Board Region Värmland.

Inera states, among other things, the following. In the capacity of personal data assistant for the regions
Stockholm, Sörmland and Värmland process Inera telephone numbers for people who
calls 1177. All 1177 calls are initially routed to Inera's contact center where it is made
a check if the municipal ID is equal to Stockholm, Sörmland or Värmland. Is so
In this case, an outgoing call is created from Inera's contact center to MedHelp AB's
contact center whereupon MedHelp AB takes over the call. The call then leaves Inera's system
completely. Inera does not store any of MedHelp's recorded calls and has no agreements with MedHelp.
IMY states that Inera processes personal data in connection with seeking care
calls 1177. This treatment is carried out by Inera on behalf of the regions in its capacity as
personal data assistant. However, Inera has no responsibility, either
personal data controller or personal data assistant, for the personal data processing
which MedHelp AB performs during the actual healthcare consultation or for storage of audio files
with recorded calls to 1177 when MedHelp AB is the care provider that answers
the conversation.
The case is therefore closed without action.
This decision was made by Director General Lena Lindgren Schelin after the presentation
by department director Suzanne Isberg. During the processing, the unit manager has
Katarina Tullstedt participated. At the final hearing, the IT security specialist Magnus Bergström, the chief justice David Törngren and
unit manager Malin Blixt participated.
